This part didn't grab my intrest that well. As I went on through the book, it began to get more and more intresting to me. Magic Or Not is one of the great adventures written by Edward Eager."},{"Title":"Magic or Not?","review":"I think that Magic or Not was a pretty good book. After I finished the book I wanted to read all of the other books. So far I've loved all of Eager's books I've read."},{"Title":"Magic or Not?","review":"I love all of Eager's books. &quot;Magic or Not&quot; and &quot;The Well Wishers&quot; differ from his other five books in that the magic is less overt. It might be magic, it might be imagination, or ???? This book introduces readers to the joys that a love of the past can offer. The mystery centers on an abandoned house--who lived there? Why did they leave? The children are realistic, and you'll want to eat Lady Baltimore cake after reading this book. I read it at 8 and checked it out again and again just so I could keep it on my bookshelf. I'm happy today to own that original hardcover (the same one I checked out 30 years ago) as well as one of the newer paperback editions. The illustrations are great too."},{"Title":"Magic or Not?","review":"In this book Mr. Eager introduces us to James, Laura, Kip, Lydia, Deborah and Gordy....not to mention the magic of the wishing well. In this book James and Laura have just moved to the country from New York. They are both excited about this move. A move to the country, for them, signals the beginning of adventure. They find adventure, too, when Lydia suggests to Laura to make a wish upon the well in hers' and James' new backyard. Some of the good deed adventures in this book are exciting, some are not; however, interesting insight is offered into each character-which will come in handy when reading \\"The Well Wishers\\", the sequel."},{"Title":"Magic or Not?","review":"When the characters of a book spend the whole thing wondering if what's been going on is real magic or not, it' safe to assume the magic is not dramatic and thunderous.That's how it is in this book. A group of children go around the countryside together, getting to know the people in the village, and doing good deeds that don't always turn out as they'd planned. Watching the children become fast friends, though one of them is thorny and another is goofy and a bit of a reject, is the best part of the book. The plot isn't predictable, but its surprises are mild.I agree that Half Magic and Magic By the Lake, by the same author, pack more punch. But this one's nice for filling in if you've read those and want another Edward Eager fix, or if you just want to while away a summer day."},{"Title":"Magic or Not?","review":"I have read Half Magic and Knights Castle and just finished Magic Or Not?, and out of those three, my favorite is Magic Or Not? I recomend this book for all children who can read (and adults too)!"},{"Title":"Magic or Not?","review":"First, I recommend that you read the book \\"Half-Magic\\" first. That is Mr. Eager's best book, and it sets the tone for every other book he wrote. You get a feel for the type of characters he has in his stories, and the theme of magic having rules, which is absolutely critical in this book.This books' charm is that Mr. Eager is so vague about the children's; wishes being magic or not that you are left wondering. This is not as overt as his other books, and it is this subtlety that energizes me.We all know that magic has rules-read G. K. Chesterton's essay \\"The Ethics of Elf-Land\\"-but this book takes that idea to the next level. The magic is not magic at all, but just our godlike powers of doing good and helping other people.This book is a great way to get your children to do right. Start out with \\"Half Magic,' and teach you children that magic, along with everything else, has rules. Then introduce them to this series of books, which teaches that magic is just us doing the right thing. This will save you many lectures and fights sine the morality is coated in a fairy tale.A great alternative to Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Magic or Not?","review":"I remember this book from years past. It was good to re-visit it again. My only wish was that it was available through iBooks, too."},{"Title":"Magic or Not?","review":"Edward Eager's books are well written, magical and educational. I discovered these books this year, 2012, as a result of my 8 year old son's interest in magic books. Amazon pointed me to these and we now own all seven of the series - they are well worth it. Published in the 1950's they remain interesting and imaginative."},{"Title":"Magic or Not?","review":"This book and its sequel The Well Wishers has Edward Eager with another set of children: Laura, James, and Deborah who have just moved to the country, and Kip and Lydia, their lively new neighbors. Laura longs for the fantastic, and a series of adventures which may or may not be magical ensue. In this book and its sequel Eager seems reluctant to fully embrace magic, and to some the mundane alternative explanations might seem to fall a little flat. But even so, there's plenty of fun, lots of wry, unsentimental commentary by children on the foibles of adults, and many, many literary and historical references. Adults looking for thoughtful, fun books which will pique their childrens' interest need look no further than Edward Eager."},{"Title":"Magic or Not?","review":"If Only You Had A Wishing WellMagic or NotBy Edward EagerWhen James, Laura and Deborah move into their new house on Silvermine Road, there are rumors that the well on the property is a dried up wishing-well.

They soon find that if, in fact, the well is working, (and they aren't at all sure) it will only work for un-selfish wishes.Can it be a coincidence that they find the long lost heir, or that they stop the school from being torn down? At times, it seems that the very thing they wish for is exactly what they get.Will the magic work when they need it, or will they have to find their own solutions to their problems?Magic or Not is an adventure of children making friendships and helping others.

Book Award and is a beautifully written \\"study of children's literature and the Left in the mid-twentieth century. It is a work of history as well as a work of literary analysis.\\" (p. vii) I was born at mid-20th century and, as a child, read many of the books discussed. This book explained my life. As a child I learned a democratic, egalitarian spirit from the Lyrical Left. \\"While school textbooks taught children to uphold the values of the Cold War, many of the trade books they checked out of the library or bought in bookstores taught them just the opposite.\\"As McCarthyism drove leftist writers and educators underground they entered \\"the hidden world\\" of children's literature. Some titles and authors discuessed are: Millions of Cats, Dr. Seuss, the All- About Books and the Landmark Books, Jack London, Little Golden Books, Penny Parker, Nancy Drew, most Lincoln biographies for children, Langston Hughes, many science and nature books, etc.\\"Few...\\" of the authors of these books \\"wished to 'propagandize' children... they wished to make children autonomous, critical thinkers who questioned authority and believed in social justice.... to strengthen a sense of community, of the need to work with others to solve problems or accomplish tasks.\\" (page 11) \\"They wished to give children tools of critical thinking, a distrust of received authority, and insights into the dynamics of biological and technological development and operation. They wanted to share their internationalist, cooperative, and democratic outlook and what they perceived as an ability to rationally evaluate aspects of an irrational society.\\" (p. 182)Learning from the Left offers one explanation of how and why the radicalism of the 1960s grew out of the placid (and repressive) 1950s and how and why some children of the South marched for Civil Rights although Mickenberg cautions, \\"It would be impossible (and far too reductive) to draw some kind of cause-and-effect link between childhood reading and the rebellions of the 1960s. Even so, the generational lines are not merely coincidental.\\" p. 276I highly recommend this Mickenberg's Learning from the Left, which I read in the Kindle edition, to anyone with an interest in literature, history, American culture, education, or who seeks to understand the roots of the sharp political divide and partisanism which is the bane of current U.S. politics."},{"Title":"Frantic (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force #6)","review":"Im am reading this series for the second time and I love them!

The text by Carols Harrison is written in both English and Spanish on each page, and it comes with a read-along audio CD that has three tracks: one in English, one in Spanish, and one in both English and Spanish. The warm and engaging story, artfully illustrated by Grizelle Paz, is about a young boy who is missing color from his life until he goes out and brings home a rainbow in his cap. The sentences of Ruben's Rainbow are of moderate length without being too complex, making it a superb book to help young children learn how to be bilingual. Highly recommended for family, school, community center, and public library collections."},{"Title":"Ruben's Rainbow / el arco iris de Ruben","review":"I gave 'Ruben's Rainbow' to my four-year-old nephew and he loves it! He even listens to the CD that came with it by himself on the computer -- he's learned a little Spanish in his pre-school and he's developing a really good ear for it. The story itself is really sweet and the illustrations are great. I would recommend this to anybody who needs a gift for a small child, it's a high-quality book and it has added educational value too."},{"Title":"Ruben's Rainbow / el arco iris de Ruben","review":"Ruben's Rainbow is beautifully illustrated. The story is a wonderful tale about how Ruben falls one morning in a world filled with color and brings that color back with him.

It comes with a CD with the audio of the story that is very helpful and a great addition to the book."},{"Title":"Ruben's Rainbow / el arco iris de Ruben","review":"I'm not bilingual, so I wasn't sure how the accents over the letters made them sound, until I listened to the CD & followed along in the book.It's an unapologetically whimsical story of a boy discovering a world full of color, & Grizelle Paz's pictures are delightful.A fascinating way to listen & learn the sounds of another language, & I loved the sound effects, too!"},{"Title":"Ruben's Rainbow / el arco iris de Ruben","review":"What would it be like if the world had no color? Ruben knows, because he used to live without color. Who's Ruben, you ask? He's the young boy in the book, \\"Ruben's Rainbow,\\" who lived in a black-and-white world. After being \\"plopped\\" into a new and colorful world, Ruben found a way to bring all the colors of the rainbow back home with him.This book is special -- it is written in English and Spanish. The sentences are short and easily translated, so parents and children can read in both languages. Accompanying the book is an Audio CD, that recites the story out loud, first in English alone, then in Spanish alone, and then in both English and Spanish. For the dual version, I wish that one sentence at a time was translated instead of the whole page. Also, I would have preferred some silence after the translation, so the parent or child could repeat the words themselves before the next sentence began. Despite my own preferences, the Audio CD is a wonderful complement to the book, since it allows parents and children to actually hear how the words should be pronounced in both languages.MyParenTime.com recommends \\"Ruben's Rainbow,\\" by Carlos Harrison and Grizelle Paz - the story is sweet; the illustrations are colorful and simple; and it introduces another language to children.

But that doesn't mean it was bad! I just found Roger so utterly boring. And there were too many pages from his point of view. He seemed more interesting in the future time.I liked to see how Brianna and Jamie got to know each other and their relationship grow. AndI liked how well she get along with John Grey.

The first two books were the unabridged versions read by Davina Porter - they were phenominally good and I couldn't wait for the 3rd book. Unfortunately I couldn't seem to find the unabridged version - so I purchased the abridged version read by Geraldine ?. I only listened a few minutes and decided my money was wasted.The unabridged versions by Davina Porter hold your attention very easily. She reads extremely well - great modulation, completely different character voices for men and women that stay the same throughout the series, and even her accents for different parts of the world are good (except the American - she can't seem to keep her voice that blunt).The abridged versions by Geraldine ? were read too fast with almost no differentiation between character, accent or emotion. It all became a blur and will quickly lose your attention - especially in the car.The abridged versions fail to provide the rich detail that makes Diana Gabaldon's stories fascinating and engaging. Don't buy any of them.Go to the web site displaying Davina Porter's works - the Outlander series is extremely expensive - but you will be sure to get the quality you expect form Diana Gabaldon's books, consistancy, and want to listen to the series over and over again!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Amazing twists and turns in the storyline - keeps me engaged.

There's quite a few of the normal mishaps, adventures and debacles that the Frasers always seem to find themselves in the midst of and that make the book a page-turner. One complaint, though: are the Fraser women forever doomed to endure their pregnancies and birth of their children without their husbands? Roger's long absence was distressing. Also, the story of the Englishmen Murchison and Hodgepile seemed less than fully developed and didn't really contribute to the overall story. It could have been left out. Still, if you're a fan of the Outlander books, this book is a great continuation of the story."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"With Drums of Autumn, Gabaldon turns the story of Jamie and Claire more toward the future than the past. A New World, new families, new challenges face the Fraser Clan and they meet the new day well. Gabaldon skillfully answers many questions, yet lays new trails for her faithful readers to pick up on as well.The reader would do well to read the Outlander series in order, as many of the references made are about situations, people and events that all intertwine and connect and the unaware reader may find this confusing. Although not mandatory to the understanding of the current book, familarity with the characters and their previous adventures is helpful.As in her previous novels, Diana Gabaldon has struck gold again. The reader should appreciate the length to which she has gone to tell this wonderful story and will look forward to the next in the series with sincere appreciation."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Highly recommended for fans of historical fiction. Memorable well defined characters."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I received Outlander as a gift a year ago. I read it without puting it down, and was done the next day. I had never read book that looked so deeply into someone's soul. Gabaldon's characters are incredibly real. It sparked my interest like no other book. (Especially about Scotland.) I have read other romance books that were good, but this one is by far the best. I say this because this book made the relationship real. They fought, situations going on around the effected them, and they truly seemed real. I begged for the next two books for my birthday, (I'm only 15) and was elated when I got them . I read them greedily, and was pleased the way the characters did not change, and how beautifully the story of Claire and Jaime was unfolding. In the scene of Drums of Autumn where Young Ian must say good-bye to his family forever, I cried. The book has an emotional foothold with me. I both thank and commend Gabaldon, on her four literary master-pieces. (in my opinion) I await the next two books impatiently."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The general consensus seems to be that the first 2 books were the best. Diana was more than half way through writing the 2nd book before the first book was published and therefore before any before any comments/critisisms or feedback was recieved (from the greater public).I read the Drum reviews before reading the book (I was waiting for it to come out in the standard sized paperback here in NZ) therefore was 'forewarned'. I do agree that it was a little superficial compared to the previous books when it came to Claire &amp; Jamie. Perhaps too, because of the excellence of the first books our expectations were too high. Can anyone name a series that is as good at the end as it was at the beginning (except for, perhaps, M*A*S*H).Jamie and Claire are into the next phase of their relationship - they're now together 'till death do us part' so all the tension of Claire coming and going is not there. So too, has the originality of the situation (for readers) dissapated. We've accepted Claire's 'travelling' as quite normal, whereas that is what hooked us to begin with, wasn't it?Diana Gabaldon certainly has her work cut out for her!! I look forward to reading her 'non Outlander' books too!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Having devoured the first three Outlander books, I couldn't wait for Drums. I did enjoy this book, mostly because I can't get enough of Jamie and Claire, but something was missing. The characters weren't true to themselves. It is true that they, and their relationship, have matured, yet, they aren't characteristically the same. This book was very superficial, whereas the others were very in depth. The newness of Jamie and Claire's renewed relationship is hardly felt. Most disappointing of all is Jamie's introduction to his daughter. This child meant everything to him. He sacrificed himself, and the love of his life to save her, yet all he can say when he meets her is, &quot;You're huge!&quot; I had builr this scene up so much in my own mind, that all I can say is---how anticlimatic!!

We kind of see a young Katherine Hepburn as Claire. The stories just keep getting better and better. I would love to see Jamie go with Claire to the 20th Century!

But, it left me wanting something else. It was very predictable and I was able to put it down and not pick it back up for days. The other 3 books I could not put down; I read every spare moment I had because they were so good. I felt this particular novel was hurried. Everyone waited so long for the final book...maybe she got tired of writing.

I dread the periods between books because nothing seems to measure up. I do have a tip on a similar read and I'll give it a shot. Bless you Diana for your imagination, may it continue to flourish!

It was a bit sad to see Jamie grow so cynical, and Brianna's character is getting rather irritating ... but I still can't wait for number 5.I just read several reviews suggesting a miniseries or movie of &quot;OUtlander&quot; - PLEASE NO MOVIE, it couldn't possibly come close to the original.Roll on novel number 5!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I normally shy away from books written in a series - I lose interest too quickly! I read the first 2 on loan from a friend, then rushed out to buy the 3rd. I was in a panic for several days - until I found Amazon.com - searching for this book. I neglected everything and everyone for 3 days while I read Drums of Autumn. I am elated to learn this was not the end"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I don't think I've felt this personally about fictional characters since I was 12 and reading The Lord of the Rings. However, it _is_ proving to be inconvenient to be hopelessly in love with a figment of somebody else's imagination- not to mention difficult to explain to my husband! I was lucky enough to find the series just after Voyager was published, so I didn't have to suffer withdrawal that time around, but it will be a long dry spell before the next tome comes out- I'm not even going to think about how long it will be until the last one. The only other books that come close to being so engaging and absorbing are (some of) Laura Kinsale's; with the Outlandish books one has the added advantage of getting to experience the whole scope of Claire and Jamie's lives together, not just the falling-in-love and the first few obstacles. I would highly recommend these books to anyone who hasn't read them yet; unless of course you have the willpower to wait another 6 years or so to spare yourself what will surely be a frustrating wait to get all the answers! :"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"There's gonna be alot of depressed people when this tale finally winds down, me included. Diana Gabaldon has an endless supply of imagination. Of course this book is as terrific as the ones before it. Drums Of Autumn has it's own flavor as does each and every book in this series. It offers closure for some items of interest and raises new questions for others. Can't wait for the next book."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The book was really draggy at the beginning but it picked up towards the middle when Brianna went through the stones. Roger wasn't much of a great character (kinda lame) but Jamie and Claire still had &quot;it&quot; and it was such a thrill to read about their love for each other. Hopefully the next book will be a lot better :)"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"As many other readers, I was disappointed. Books one and two were so very good, the third &quot;Voyager&quot;, was wrenching, especially Jamie\`s prison experiences, but then it became a bit of a travelogue, a bit dragging in places, but still very good! Now, this one really was much flatter. I mean, there are still axceptional scenes and laugh-out-loud-moments, the language is wonderful, but it is superficial. Brianna acts so often like a spoiled child, and the whole sequence of Roger first making love to her, then disappearing after just one night and by mistake being &quot;thrown to the Indians&quot; by her family, oh, come on, this really sound like the cloak and dagger stuff from old romances! Also, you got this feeling of pages that have to be filled and time that has to be spent before we get to the next really interesting things, a bit like being with people in their everyday lives after sharing all the high drama before - a bit of a letdown. Well, I was disappointed, the tension was just not there and I really put the book down for weeks before reading on - I don't think I will buy her next book as a hardcover, seems a waste of money! - But yes, it was still so good that I will definitely read on through the series."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Much as I love this series, this is far and away the weakest book in the saga. Had this been the first book of Ms. G's that I read, it would have been the last.For whatever reasons, (rush to publication, too many cooks spoiling the broth, aliens replacing the author with a duplicate) DOA is a more apt acronym than you might think. My exact complaints are outlined by earlier customer reviews of Allchans and Reedwstle, so I won't belabor the point. I found the book tedious, dramatically different in style than the first 3 and if it weren't the 4th of 6 books, I wouldn't have bothered to finish it. If DOA is your first taste of the series, I beseech you to give the others a try before writing Jaime/Claire/etc off.----Now, on to casting the film, what about Liam Nielson for Jaime? And what about his wife, Natasha Richardson, as Claire?"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I was fortunate enough to luck into this series right from the beginning. The first time I read OUTLANDER I was hooked by page 10 and have eagerly awaited each book as it has been published. The combination of history, captivating characters and depth of emotions portrayed in these stories keeps you total involved, and makes you feel like these are people you wish you had real life contact with. Everyone who reads these books, awaits anxiously to see what the next stage in Jamie and Claire's life will bring. Drums of Autumn was just as riveting as the other books in this series and was especially fun because it was like running into an old friend and discovering what had been going on in their life while you were away! I applaud Diana Gabaldon's thorough research and dedication to spending the time it takes to let the story evolve and unfold. This type of writing is rare, and is cherished by all who read this series! I would HIGHLY recommend that you go out and get the first book, then, plan on spending many happy hours immersed in another world!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"After reading the other installments, I had hoped this one would regain the luch vision the first 2 books had. There were points in this book that I found wonderful, and even brought me to tears. Yet, I found the second half of the book hurried. As if the author was attempting to hurry up and finish the story. As if she were attempting to tie it up in a pretty bow and put it on display."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Since this is the fourth in the Outlander series, let me give you a brief recap first. The books revolve around Claire, a 1940's post war nurse who falls through a circle of stones in Scotland, similar to Stone Henge. She ends up in Scotland in the 1700's, meets up with a Scottish Highlander named Jamie Fraser, and goes on many incredible adventures. What I probably like best about these books is the fact that it is told from Claire's viewpoint, on finding herself in the past and the amazing love affair with Jamie Fraser, who any woman would swoon over. The first book is how they met, the second revolves around the Battle of Culloden, and the third picks up with Claire, after being sent back through the stones in the last book, now twenty years later with her daughter Brianna, discovers that Jamie survived after the Battle of Culloden. It involves her search into what happened to him, and her decision with whether or not to chance going back through the stones after him. This fourth installment I believe is my favorite of all,...so far. This one covers the period of Jamie and Claire and their &quot;entourage&quot;, adjusting to life in the &quot;wild lands&quot; of the New World. It also covers their daughter, Brianna, and Roger, who were left behind and their discovery of what will happen to Claire and Jamie in the future. It involves Brianna trying to save her parents, Roger trying to save Brianna, and the harrowing experiences they encounter through it all. The book nicely moved between Claire and Jamie's story and Brianna and Roger's. It once again had me glued to the pages, once again taking it everywhere with me and reading as much as I could every chance I got. One of the great things about this series is you never get bored...EVERY SINGLE page is exciting and you care about them and cannot wait to see what happens next. I just finished this today and already started on The Fiery Cross. According to the author's website, there will be at least two more books after that, but I am hoping there will be many more. Yes, I have become obsessed and have given the same fate to my friends who I have loaned my books out to. You have GOT to get these books, but make sure you read them in order! Again, these books are definitely not boy meets girl, the end. That's so boring! I hate traditional romance novels. This involves time travel, history, romance and adventure, all rolled into one. These are by FAR the best books I have ever read, and I read alot of them!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Although I don't believe that I could ever write as well as Ms. Gabaldon does, I think that the main problem with this book is the lack of direction. Outlander was motivated by Claire's determination first and indecision later to return to the 20th century. Dragonfly in Amber contained the drive of Claire and Jamie to save their loved ones from the folly of Charles Stewart. And Voyager had the search for Ian and the unraveling mystery of time travel. In DOA there is little motivation for the characters to do anything. The plot seems to be a quiet time between major events in the characters lives. Nothing that lends to the story as a whole.Brianna and Roger's jump to the past would have made more sense if there had been more development of their personalities. In this case Brianna is portrayed as a shadow of her father in almost every way. Roger isn't as shallow, but he shows no emotions other than frustration or lust. Neither of these characters can stand alone.What I missed most was the careful flashbacks and the banter between characters. There were none of the little explainations that occurred in the previous books. These explainations revealed a lot about each character through seeming insignificant moments and tied their thoughts to their actions. I hope that the next book will have more of these things.A note to Ms. G., please don't bow to the advise of your current editor/publlisher! You have many, many loyal fans; and we are buying the books- not them!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I borrowed The \\"Outlander\\" from my sister in law a few months ago, having run out of new interesting books. I was a little reluctant at first since its set in the 1700's/ early 1900's. I am HOOKED!!! After the first i borrowed the second \\"Dragonfly in Amber\\", also awesome! Then i bought the third \\"Voyager\\". I am in the middle of the forth, \\"Drums of Autumn\\", and i am a few short seconds away from buying the fifth...\\"Fiery Cross\\". Diana Gabaldon is the author , honestly i have never heard of her before but she is AMAZING at bringing these characters, and the settings to life. Its a mix of interesting mysteriousness, romanticism, shocking, action, at at times hilarious!! Everything from time travel, witchcraft, war, & family. WONDERFUL LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! CANT GET ENOUGH I almost hate to finish the series i think ill be lost without Jamie and Claire. Diana...we need another series PLEASE!:)"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I loved the first three. This is the first one I haven't been really impressed with. It was a page turner and I didn't want to put it down, so she gets three stars. But I agree that the characters of Brianna and Roger are not well developed and certainly not her best work. And what really got to me was the storyline. You expect bad things to happen in a book, but they need to be realistic. Some of them were. But most of the truly terrible things that happened were a result of the characters' own missteps, misunderstandings, and stupid decisions. I felt like I was reading an episode of Three's Company, except it wasn't funny. It was tragic. It left a bad taste in my mouth. I already ordered the next one but if it doesn't get better I am done with this series."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"To get full impact out of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander books, you MUST start with the first book: OUTLANDER.So much has already been said about this Outlander series, I don't have too much to add ... except to say I Love her books and characters (mostly Jamie) and am hooked for life.About 2 weeks ago, I finished reading her last printed paperback book.. called: A Breath of Snow and Ashes.\\"Daily\\" I still stop and think about the the story and all the characters.. as though they are real. (It is Historically accurate!)Here on Amazon, I have pre-ordered Diana Galbaldon's latest book ... soon to be released via Amazon on June 22nd.The title is called: An Echo in The Bone.I have also Pre-ordered another book coming out in September 2010.. called: The Exile. (It's about Jamie's perspective).When I finish The Exile... I'm going to go into withdrawal!It takes the very talented Diana Gabaldon about 3 years to write each Novel.Hands down, this series is the most unique and compulsive reading experience I have ever had."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I enjoyed this one the most so far. It was fast paced and with the varied parts of the world, very informative. I don't know how D. can do so much research!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The fourth in the series, after relocating to the American Colonies, frontier life in the Carolinas proves heartening, cold, and something of a pleasure at times. The accuracy is amazing, and Gabaldon is a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This is book 4 in the series and is excellent. A long read and very meaty so don't expect to finish quickly but it's worth the effort. I loved book 1 and 2. Book 3 (Voyager) wasn't my favorite but I am back in thrall with this one. Claire and Jamie are such rich characters and now we've added daughter, Brianna and the man in her life, Roger. These latest time travelers, Brianna and Roger, introduce an exciting new dimension and add new perceptions of the 1700's as seen through the eyes of a throughly modern and well-educated couple. If you like history, if you like rich characters, if you like love stories that aren't all mush but have ups and downs just like real life, then you will love this book!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I found this book the most fascinating of the series so far. As a descendant of North Carolina Highlander Scots, I felt that the book gave me real insight into what my ancestors' lives may have been like as they settled the area, interacting with the Native Americans, and establishing a new nation. I could never before understand why they stayed in rural NC for over 200 years on their land. The story is very dramatic, fantastic and magical. I'd waited six months to read this one, but I won't wait very long to read the next one. Drums definitely made it well worth working through the thousands of pages of the first three books to get to it. Wonderful things happen."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This is the fourth in a series of what has been, until now, exceptionally well written time travel, adventure/romance books by the author. There are six such books published to date. I urge the reader to start at the beginning and read each and every one in the order in which it was written. Be not afraid of the length of each book. Trust me when I say that you will end up wishing that they were each longer, so riveting is the story that the author unfolds. Ms. Gabaldon is a master storyteller without compare, employing the superlative use of actual historical events with authentic period detail to weave a three dimensional tapestry of timeless love and adventure. While the core of the story is about a love that transcends time, it is an adventure story that holds the reader in its thrall.The love that spans time is that which twentieth century Englishwoman, Claire Randall, has for eighteenth century Scottish highlands warrior, James Fraser. Those readers who have read the first book in the series, \\"Outlander\\", know that in 1945, Claire, a combat nurse during World War II, is reunited with her husband, Frank, after the war. While on a second honeymoon in Scotland, she visits a strange, flat topped hill, where a forbidding stone circle draws her. Touching one of the stones, she is hurled through a vortex in time and finds herself in eighteenth century Scotland, where she meets the brave and brawny, red headed Scot, James Fraser, with whom she falls head over heels in love. Finding herself thrust into the midst of clan warfare and intrigue, she and her beloved 'Jamie' have enough adventures to last a lifetime.The second book, \\"Dragonfly in Amber\\", is a continuation of that story, told from the perspective of the twentieth century where Claire, now a doctor, has lived for the past twenty years. Upon the death of her twentieth century husband, Frank, Claire returns to Scotland with her grown, red headed daughter, Brianna. There she discloses to Brianna the events of her secret past, as well as the truth as to who Brianna's biological father truly is and of the love that Claire bore him.While in Scotland, however, Claire discovers something that will change her future, as well as her past. You see, for the past twenty years Claire has mistakenly believed that her beloved 'Jamie' died in the historic battle of Culloden. It was there that the Scottish highlanders bravely fought the English in a misguided attempt to restore Charles Stuart, their bonnie Prince Charlie, to the English throne, only to be decimated on the battlefield. Those few who survived were branded as Jacobite traitors and imprisoned, and their families disenfranchised. It was this very event that Claire and 'Jamie' had conspired to change, only to fail.Their story transports the reader from the turmoil of the Scottish highlands to the intrigue of the French Court and regales the reader with the adventures of the two lovers, as they conspire to change the very course of history. It was this valiant attempt that ultimately brought Claire and 'Jamie' to the crossroad that would compel these star crossed lovers to part and have Brianna become a denizen of the twentieth century.In \\"Voyager\\", Claire, now realizing that the love of her life and soulmate survived the battle of Culloden, makes the decision to go back in time and find James Fraser, as she has not stopped loving or wanting him every waking moment for the past twenty years. Leaving her daughter, Brianna, she once more hurls herself into the vortex of time to eighteenth century Scotland to begin her search for James Fraser, in hopes of being reunited with her 'Jamie'.\\"Voyager\\" tells the story of what happened to Claire Randall and James Fraser in those intervening years. It tells of their ultimate reunion and rediscovery. Against a backdrop of historical events and period detail and with a cast of unforgettable characters, it regales the reader with their new adventures, as Claire returns to a still divided, turmoil ridden Scotland. Reunited with Jamie, none the worse for wear,they seek to make a life for themselves. As their love comes full circle, they take to the high seas, and their adventures continue, captivating the reader once more.In \\"Drums of Autumn\\", the story takes somewhat of a detour, as it begins to focus more on Brianna. Back in the twentieth century, Brianna and her boyfriend, Roger, a Scot and college history professor, as well as descendant of one of James Fraser's cousins from clan MacKenzie, each independently make a discovery that stuns them. Roger keeps it to himself, while Brianna acts upon it. The discovery involves an old news clipping which tells of Claire's and James' premature deaths in a house fire in pre-revolutionary, frontier America. Brianna makes the decision to go to the stone circle to try and go back in time to change the course of history and save her parents. She does not, however, tell Roger of her plans. Roger, discovering Brianna's deception, follows on her heels and, on that strange, flat topped hill in Scotland he, too, enters the stone circle and is himself hurled into the vortex of time.Brianna and Roger catch up with each other in the eighteenth century only to be parted for a time, each having their own adventures. Claire and James by now are established homesteaders in North Carolina and are enjoying, what is for them, a relatively staid life. By the time Brianna catches up with them, an event has occurred in her life which may have the impact of forcing her to stay mired in the past.This fourth book in the series is a bit of a disappointment, as it could have used some serious editing due to the author's self indulgence. Moreover, the characters are not so well drawn, as they are in the first three books in the series. Unfortunately, a pivotal character, that of Brianna, is uncharismatic and comes across as somewhat vapid and stupid. Brianna definitely needs work, if she is to capture the readers' imagination as have Claire and 'Jamie'. At the stage of development in which she is, Brianna would be unable to sustain another book. The same goes for Roger, who comes across as somewhat one dimensional, though he does have potential, as he seems to have a latent smoldering and sensual quality to his personality.Still, notwithstanding some of these issues, this remains a compelling time travel saga, and my thirst for the fifth volume, \\" The Fiery Cross\\", remains undiminished. I only hope that the lengthy time span between the fourth and the fifth volumes means that the author has worked out some of the kinks in this new and developing direction which the series seems to be taking."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This is a great book and a wonderful continuation. It is book 4 in the series. I couldn't wait to read more about Jamie, Claire, Roger and Brianna. This book answers a lot of questions from the previous ones and has a lot of nice suprises!!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This book started very slow and did a lot of rambling with Brianna and Roger's relationship. Roger was a pretty uptight and too tightly strung most of the time but likeable. I found Brianna to be very immature and self centered. Rather dumb too in some respects concerning almost inviting herself to be raped. What did she think Bonnet was talking about in the tavern when it was apparent that he thought she was a prostitute? For a supposedly knowledgeable woman of the late 1960's she still goes on board his ship knowing how women were treated in the 1700's after months of research on that era. Pretty farfetched. Then she is entirely too keen on slapping, punching and generally thinking it is okay to tear into Roger, Ian or anyone else that crosses her including threatening blackmail to get her way with John Grey. This book does not put her in a very good light. She becomes more likeable and matures into an interesting woman in later books, thankfully, as she is an important character from this book forward.I was touched by Brianna's initial meeting with Jamie but wasn't too thrilled with his really horrible handling of her in such a rough way when he was \\"convincing\\" her in the stable that she could not have prevented her rape by fighting back. Obviously, fainting was a terrible fright in all of Gabaldon's books but manhandling a woman in early pregnancy was not a concern by Brianna's father of miscarriage? One of the few times I found Gabaldon's portrayl of Jamie a bit much.I did enjoy the details of the settling of Frazer's mountain and general info of early days in N. Carolina. Ian is certainly an interesting character and was glad to see him appear in subsequent books of this series.If you enjoy history, some romance, general mayhem and often times harrowing experience, you will enjoy this book. I find Gabaldon to have a very enjoyable sense of humor in most of the books and found myself smiling at many things I read."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The whole Outlander series is outstanding. This book keepsone on the edge of their seat with suspense, adventure, and theenduring love between Clare and Jamie. Gabaldon is one of thebest writers of any genre that I have read in my lifetime ofreading."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Once again I just love these recordings. More characters come to life, Brianna and Roger. The music takes you to King Louis court, you can almost smell the roses. I just wish the story could be read word for word, how many tapes would that be? I suggest you read the book first and your appreciation of the audio version will be greatly enhanced. If you do listen to the recording first I believe it will encourage you to go back and read the book for the parts that were edited out of the recording. It does help to read the books in order, but you can get the jist of the meaning individually. I love the books and the audio tapes and cannot wait for the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Much too wordy for my wife; never finished the book, However, father-in-law likes the book and series of book by Gabaldon!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Diana Gabaldon is my favorite author. You must start with the first book - Outlander. I love everything about them. I am an avid reader of many different kinds of books, but non can compare, she is a literary genius. A friend told me about her and her books, it was the greatest gift I have been given. I started with Outlander and continued on with each book thereafter. Loved them all and this one was no exception. She is an amazing story teller. They make me laugh, cry and I cannot put them down."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I love the Outlander series and was pleased to see the inclusion of the Mohawks as part of the story. The main problem is, however, that the Jesuits were out of New York by the late 1680's when England declared the region to be under English control and they threatened to execute any Jesuits found in the area (accurately fearing them to be spies for France). Most of the Mohawks relocated to Canada where one of their own, Kateri, was to become the first Native American saint honoured just a few weeks ago in 2012. The ones who remained in New York became Anglican when the most western church at the time, Queen Anne's Chapel, was built west of Albany in 1713 after four Mohawk chiefs went to England, swore their loyalty to the queen and received promises of a church, a minister and a silver communion set that is still used to this day. The inclusion of the longhouse, the Jesuit and the Mohawk culture, however is done very nicely and accurately sensitive even though it is 100 years out of time. The relocation of the Tuscaroras to the New York vicinity also occurred in 1720, long before it is in the series. By 1770, the Mohawk Valley had 300 Mohawks surrounded by 3,000 settlers, and they lived in log houses not longhouses. These Mohawks fled NY to Canada with the British when war broke out and the warriors from Fort Hunter did participate in the action at Fort Ticonderoga and afterwards under the leadership of Joseph Brant's cousin, John Deserontyon (An Echo in the Bone). After the war, Brant established two reserves for the warriors. Deserontyon's followers, 104 of them, relocated to one of the reserves and today the band list contains over 8,000 qualified descendants. There are 5 other Mohawk reserves also in Canada. The Tuscarora live in both Canada and on a reserve near Niagara Falls, NY. I think the Drums of Autumn and the other books in the series do an honour to these groups, even though out of sequence with reality, but still done with respect to their plight."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"As much as I love Jamie Fraser this book was not as good as the others. These poor people go through so much ALL the time and it never ends. They can't catch a break. I like adventure, angst, and all that but this is ridiculous. But I'm addicted and can't stop reading them.There was one whole plot I could have done without, which was the whole Roger getting sold to the Indians and Ian getting taken away. The Roger thing was unnecessary and frustrating, but the Ian thing was heartbreaking.I have the 5th book loaded on my iPhone already but I'm not sure if I'm ready to begin it or if I need a break for a while. And I see the next one is 10 hours longer than this one.I think the only thing that keeps me going during the lull parts is Davina and her wonderful narrating skills. She keeps me in the game and hanging on when I wish I was reading an actual book and could skim. During this book I wanted to skim a lot and unfortunately because of the audiobook I couldn't.I want to continue out of pure curiosity but I'm sort of dreading the next one. Not a good sign. However, I bought all of the books already so I'll have to read them sometime!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I agree with other comments in that this is a disappointment after the first 3 books. Jaime has turned into a caveman, just fighting and not listening. Roger is not acting like the Oxford scholar that he is. He meets Jaime and he doesn't tell him his name? All he can do is admit that he \\"took Brianna's maidenhead\\"? Really? But then there wouldn't be all the misunderstanding that makes the consumes of the book. It just seems very formula to me."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"If you are looking for excuses to treat yourself...this is the series. Drums of Autumn is part of the Outlander series. This fabulous writer will hold your interest with present day and history. Her characters are delicious. And she is not afraid to throw in a little sex. Good girl Diana. So exciting that I probably live about 30 minutes from this author.

Reading this one now and going through the whole series. Happy with my purchase."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Drums of Autumn carries the story of Jamie and Claire Fraser beyond happily ever after to the reality of the rest of their lives. In doing so, Gabaldon creates a believable and poignant portrait of a marriage that works. Their relationship continues to involve the reader because both Jamie and Claire grow individually within it. This is marriage at its best; offering love, security, and the freedom to be and become. These books are not romances, nor histories, nor adventure stories. They are, instead, accounts of one couple's struggle to find themselves through each other in their struggle to establish &quot;a marriage of true minds&quot; under the most unlikely of circumstances. Never maudlin, the series celebrates the best of love, marriage, committment, and mutuality. I am only sorry I have finished Drums of Autumn and will probably have a long wait until the final(?) book in the series is available"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Outlander is a series of 6 books, quite large in volume. When I first read Outlander, I loved this story, and I loved the characters. But by the time I finished this book I wasn't sure I wanted to read the next one and find out what happened to Jamie and Claire. But as I said, I was now engrossed with the people and the story and so I continued. I am now half way through the 4th novel (Drums of Autumn) and already own the last two (pre-purchased A Breath of Snow and Ashes). And I STILL wonder WHY I am continueing to read these! And here is why, Diana Gabaldon writes in DETAIL right down to the dirt on someones shoes. And she says so and so got chills and not because the room was cold; so many times you want to wretch. She writes pages and pages and pages of things that have nothing to do with the story. You really begin to wonder where she is headed and you start to feel that she is either wasting your time or she just likes the sound of her own voice. OR she enjoys BEING this character right down to the last thought and shiver. I find myself speed reading through some passages looking for when we are going to get back on track. Don't get me wrong, she is BRILLIANT!! If you love historical fiction, you WILL love her writing and you will LEARN alot about living in the time she writes about as well as the Scots. She does her homework, her research is impeccable and she has a cult following with this series. It is a great story and I will read all of them, I just think she could have written the SAME story in half the time. So forewarned is forearmed with Diana Gabaldon. If you have tons of time to kill, this is your book!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I love these romance books more than any other because of the time travel, action, and historical information. Diana writes so vividly that I even felt as though I was in Scotland or later in early America. First of all, make sure that you read the first book, Outlander, and make sure to read the books in order. If you like even the first two books, then you will continue to enjoy the rest of the series and look forward to each one. I have heard some people complain about Drums of Autumn, but I found it as enthralling as the rest. The book may look long, but you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I decided to read the 4th book in hopes that the author's pace would heighten and her wordiness would lessen. 500 pages later, the plot and the characters finally began to pick up. I believe that the author couldn't decide whether this series should be in the romance section or a work of historical fiction. Too bad she chose the former route."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The time travel episodes in Drums of Autumn and the preceding three novels of this series were written so I felt as though I traveled along with the characters through the mysterious stone circle in Scotland. The sensory descriptions left me feeling this process was entirely possible. In spite of the speculation by the characters over what is actually the catalyst that allows them to step through into time, it is believable in the way it was written.There is another mystery that accompanies this unfolding saga in the lives of the two main characters. Jamie and Claire share a connection that transcends all obstacles. This is heartening and hopeful to a reader who would wish for such a deep and abiding love relationship. This surely must be the impetus that pulls readers to want more of this series in spite of some of the annoying behavior of Jamie and Claire's daughter, Brianna.As other readers have said, Brianna seems to be spoiled and throws tantrums that embarrass me to read. Her pencant for name calling is really disgusting. In her anger, she does not hesitate to use words that I doubt very much she would have gotten away with during her upbringing. Where did this all come from? How can she, when provoked, call the man she loves and the man she learns is her father names that you would not expect to hear from the mouth of a young girl of that time. She supposedly grew up in modern times with two very respectable parents who would have seen to the training of a young lady. Instead she comes off as a gutter mouth. I was troubled by this unbelievable handling of this character.I sincerely hope the author finds a way to straighten Brianna out if she continues to appear in the next book. I can't believe that her unforgiving and stubborn behavior comes from her heritage or from the stress of traveling into a strange new world where life is harsh. It did not seem to affect her mother that way.Claire has a presence as she matures that is worthy of the man of honor who is her husband. Jamie is one of the most incredible heros in a novel of this kind I have ever read about. It's easy to feel sympathetic to Jamie and Claire and therein lies the answer to the mystery. We love them and want to continue to know them. I will buy any book that is written in this series."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I have enjoyed all the books in the Outlander series. This was the weakest. What was her editor thinking about letting her go on for so long. It should have been trimed down into a normal sized book and it would have been wonderful. Robert Graves where are you now that we need you. (He edited David Copperfield). I will certainly buy the others. She is a wonderful writer, but this book was self indulgent."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"It all started when my wife got it as a gift, and I being stubborn, was not interested in a romance. She said it's more than that. BOY WAS SHE RIGHT!! Sometimes all I can think about are these books and how Ms. Gabaldon has linked EVERYTHING together. I've just re-read book four and have noticed something that all our friends or people in this review have not noticed. Not to give it away, but look at the very last line in 'Drums&quot; and keep that in mind when you read the series again. By the way, you all think that Claire won't go back to her time....I think there is the chance. Remember her what she found, It's her legacy, her &quot;tica ba&quot;. For you readers who think the tension is gone, think on that one. These stories have me gripped. Anything can happen and if you think everything is going to be good remember what happen to Ian.. I do. It got me pretty choked up. I for one find it hard to imagine the possibility that I may never see my family again. And so I'm on pins and needles waiting for &quot;The Fiery Cross&quot;. I have a feeling that Guellie started something that has not yet ran it's full course. (I love how the author throws her in once and a while). So Jamie and Claire are yet to survive the fire cause I really want them to. After knowing what Frank did (read the book) anything can happen. Brianna and Roger (whom I feel for Roger cause he underwent a LOT!!) are bringing in a &quot;new?&quot; McKenzie clan .... .....things will come full circle. I can't wait. Great, great, great, great, great excellent writing and SO DARN REAL!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"As other reviewers stated, the first three books were so wonderful I stayed up all night reading them. I started this one, and kept thinking, &quot;Well, maybe it will get better soon,&quot; finally (actually pretty quickly) deciding I would rather sleep. As a comment one year after receiving this for Xmas 97, while I've read and re-read the other books, this one continues to gather dust on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"While the first three books held me captive (I couldn't read them fast enough), I was disappointed with the long awaited &quot;Drums.&quot; The magic between Jamie and Claire was missing as if they were part of the story because we expected them to be there. There were many lost opportunities to develop the relationship between Jamie and Brianna and the relationship between Brianna and Roger. I think the novel would have been more interesting if Brianna and Roger had not gone into the past, but continued their search for Jamie and Claire in the history books and continued their lives together. Diana Gabaldon is an excellent author but it seems that this novel was put together without a lot of thought to the characters themselves. The characters did not act as they had in the previous novels. I hope that the next novel, if it comes to pass, continues on with the characters as they were originally written."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"i would have given it four and a half stars but you cant do that. i dont think it merits five stars but i wouldnt call it a four star book either.Diana Gabaldon begins to pull together all the floating strings in The Drums Of Autumn and she does an excelent job. She brings in a new romance, quite nicely, and has it play out much better then Jamie and Claire. it doesnt go rancid. She brings in a new charecter with Jamie's nephew Ian, who one gets to know in this book; she doesnt send Ian on the predictable route and instead creats quite a good charecter. She also brings in and developes Lord John Grey, who is a complex and interesting charecter. Again, the plot is good, being complex and not all that predictable, her writing style, though not deep, is definately hooking and beleivable. The one thing that gets very old is Jamie and Claire. They were great in the first book, they actually argued and acted like two people in a relationship but in this book it's all cotton candy between the two of them. Diana Gabaldon creates a possible fantacey or hers, in the relationship between Jamie and Claire and it stops working. Every body gets older and well it does not mean that they get any less beautiful it is doubtful that, unless she got implants, her boobies are as firm and round as they were when she was 27. I seriously doubt that her hair looks like Autumn and i find their relationship more and more sickening: no relationship is that perfect, it would get boring.on the whole though, it was a good book, possibly my favorite from the Outlander series."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"If you like historical romance that is heavy on the adventure this book was written for you. Ironically, I'm not a fan of the romance genre at all, but this series of books provided such excellent adventure and suspense as well as knowledge of herbal lore that they drew me in."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This is my third book in Ms. Gabaldon's &#34;Outlander&#34; series and I love it. I'm only about 2/3 through with it and will jump on the next one right before I finish.Since there are several more to come, I'm guessing that this saga will go on for another generation or so and ready to all the way with them.By the way, I'm glad I'm reading this on my Kindle Fire since It is more than 1200 pages long and my arms would get very tired holding it up."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"As a fan of all her Outlander series, I enjoyed this one very much. I found I learned a lot about American history, too, from the lives of ordinary people just trying to survive."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"All of the books in this series are phenomenal! If you like fantasy, romance, history, you'll love Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. 'Nuf said!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This is a fabulous series - I am not a huge fan of romance - but this series is so much more than that. Historical fiction, suspense , drama - laughter! and yes love - I cannot wait to read the next one-"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Diana Gabaldon provides the ongoing, very well told and Intriguing fantasy, historical romance story. Start with the first book in the series to fully enjoy the tale."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Please keep these OUTLANDER series novels coming. I can't get enough. Even though some of these books are over a 1000 pages, I can,t stop rereading the entire seriers."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Diana Galbaldon has you dying to find out what is going to happen next to Jamie and Clair. This couple is what we all wish we could be - attractive, sexy, clever, and very down to earth. These book are some of the best reading out there!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Diana Gabaldon delivers another favorite with Drums of Autumn. Claire is smart, funny, sexy - what more could a woman want? It truly is difficult to pigeonhole any of the Outlander books into one specific genre, and Drums of Autumn is no different. I love that there's something for everyone in her books. Diana Gabaldon does not shy away from any subject matter, that I can see, and I admire that in an author as long as it's well done (and it is). I've recommended this series to many, many friends and I always love to get their excited feedback. The books are ginormous, but then that's another thing I love about them."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Again, terrific writing with very deep meaning to some of the stories. I didn't particularily like being drug through the story about the attempted abortion of a slave woman under very dire circumstances."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The entire Outlander series has been great. The characters are so wonderful and the setting is so grand you feel that you can imagine being in Scotland in the 1700's. I travel a lot for work and I am in my car driving 2 - 3 hours at a time so I have listened to all four books on tape. It is a great way to pass the time I am currently listening to the series for the third time so I hope that the author comes out with a new book soon. Jamie and Clare feel like family and I would like them to come back for another visit real soon."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This has got to be the greatest series ever written. What I love so much about it, is how Diana explains in full detail how a charactor or scenary looks. I feel as of I can actually see the people and there surroundings perfectly.I have just given the series to my Mom to read. I explained her that these are my Bibles and to take PERFECT care of them.I read the series at work and my co-workers thought I was crazy because every day they would see me crying or hear me laughing out loud...you should have seen me when I finished Drums of Autumn. I was so sad because I did not get to spend my days with Jamie and Claire any more. I can't wait until the 5th book comes out.I thank you so much Diana Gabaldon."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I was given Outlander as a retirement gift and have read the next two books so far. Spellbinding story-lots of passion and pretty gritty descriptions of everyday life in different places and times. It makes you feel somehow connected with these passionate people."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I got Outlander on loan from a friend, and found myself needing the next before she got a chance to bring it to work. I went out and purchased the set of four and have reread them and loaned them out in between. Jamie has become a part of this twenty first century nurse's life,too. I have always loved this style of book but there are few words to really express the all encompassing thrill of running through the heather and smelling the fresh clean,preindustry air with these delightful and vibrant characters. They beckon you to delve through the stones....."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I have not read it yet but I have it in my lap.I was wondering if any one was going to mention the characters,the frenchmen,Fergus and his new wife.Those are also important people in the past books.I will get back to you about &quot;drums&quot;.I also want to say thanks to the author for having such a wonderful mind.Is this somewhat true in the books about the past in the 1700's with the Frasers if so I would love to find out about more on the Frasers because I am from scotish decent."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I don't have much to compare Outlander, Dragonfly in Amber, Voyager, and Drums in Autumn to because at the young age of 46 I have not been a reader. At the prompting of a dear friend I read Outlander. I was so intrigued with the story that I had to carry on and at the conclusion of Drums of Autumn could only wait for more. I say a change in my life because since picking up Outlander late in October I have read not only the 3 companion books, but 2 Dean Koontz, a Sidney Sheldon, started and put down 2 Stephen King (sorry Stephen, read a non-fiction by someone Anderson called The Four O'clock Murders, and am enjoying an Elizabeth George book right now. I think the key thing here is that without Gabaldon's Outlander I would not be reading today. What more can I say! Read them all!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Wow...after coming to the end of Drums of Autumn, all I could think was, &quot;There's got to be more!&quot; Glad to hear that The Fiery Cross will be coming out, even if we have to wait awhile. The fourth book in the series is more thought-provoking than the other three, but it still makes for a really good time! I loved the beginning romance between Brianna and Roger - hopefully this will be just as passionate and exciting as Jamie and Claire's. This book is really more about the Fraser family and how mothers, fathers, and their children relate to eachother. There's still enough adventure and romance to satisfy, though. These books have quickly joined the ranks of my all-time favorites, and I believe they will someday become classics of historical fiction. I'm only left to wonder...what will happen to Jamie and Claire? Will they survive, and how will the newspaper article be explained? I guess we'll have to wait for the next book. It will be interesting to see what Diana Gabaldon does with the Frasers' role in the American Revolution. Can't wait to find out!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I tended to skip a line here or there, not my favorite in the series, but if it gets me to the next book, I was glad to travel through it with Jamie and Clair. Each person I have turned onto these books has come back to me with a look on their face that I recognize immediately. It says get me the next book and make it quick. I just finished the fourth re-read of the first three books and am now half way through Drums again. I think Brianna and Roger are going to run a close second to the Clair and Jamie love affair, but there has to be some way Clair and Jamie die and then get reincarnated and start all over again. I'm young, I will never get enough. Keep up the good work Diana."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Gabaldon has done it once again! Drums of Autumn continues the adventures and love story of Claire and Jamie to new heights and adds daughter, Brianna and her romance with Roger, to the mix of a book for all time. In her Outlander series, she has demonstrated a knowledge of Scottish, West Indies, and Colonial American history that is pure entertainment. If anyone can read the Drums of Autumn, or any of the previous books of this series, without putting it down they have more will power than I. I am hopefully waiting for another in this series as I cannot wait to see what will happen next!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I have read and reread all of the Outlander series... Diana Gabaldon is one of the best authors I have ever read and her books speak to our hearts. Although I've read the series many times I still laugh and cry every time! Jamie is my altime favorite character... Don't miss the chance to get to know him - and the other &quot;people&quot;- they seem real when you read the book - in the book!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Diana Gabaldon continues to entertain in the 4th book of this series. Each one is as good as the last, which is really saying something given that they're all 900+ pages. One of the best series I've ever read, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Loved this installment as I have loved all others in the Outlander series"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This whole series is just delightful. Very well written, well developed storyline, well developed characters. Just absolutely great! Huge books, but you'll blow through them fast. Don't be discouraged by the size or the fact that there's a time travel aspect to it (I put off reading the series for 7 years because of these 2 things). The first one is more of a romance, the second is more historical fiction, the third and fourth are more adventure, the fifth and sixth go back to being more historical fiction, and they all have just about every since genre woven throughout. So it doesn't matter what genre you prefer to read, this series will fit into it!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This is the fourth in a series of what has been, until now, exceptionally well written time travel, adventure/romance books by the author. There are six such books published to date in the series. Those of us who are hopelessly addicted to this series are hoping for a seventh.I urge the reader to start at the beginning and read each and every one in the order in which it was written. Be not afraid of the length of each book. Trust me when I say that you will end up wishing that they were each longer, so riveting is the story that the author unfolds. Ms. Gabaldon is a master storyteller without compare, employing the superlative use of actual historical events with authentic period detail to weave a three dimensional tapestry of timeless love and adventure. While the core of the story is about a love that transcends time, it is an adventure story that holds the reader in its thrall.The love that spans time is that which twentieth century Englishwoman, Claire Randall, has for eighteenth century Scottish highlands warrior, James Fraser. Those readers who have read the first book in the series, \\"Outlander\\", know that in 1945, Claire, a combat nurse during World War II, is reunited with her husband, Frank, after the war. While on a second honeymoon in Scotland, she visits a strange, flat topped hill, where a forbidding stone circle draws her. Touching one of the stones, she is hurled through a vortex in time and finds herself in eighteenth century Scotland, where she meets the brave and brawny, red headed Scot, James Fraser, with whom she falls head over heels in love. Finding herself thrust into the midst of clan warfare and intrigue, she and her beloved 'Jamie' have enough adventures to last a lifetime.The second book, \\"Dragonfly in Amber\\", is a continuation of that story, told from the perspective of the twentieth century where Claire, now a doctor, has lived for the past twenty years. Upon the death of her twentieth century husband, Frank, Claire returns to Scotland with her grown, red headed daughter, Brianna. There she discloses to Brianna the events of her secret past, as well as the truth as to who Brianna's biological father truly is and of the love that Claire bore him.While in Scotland, however, Claire discovers something that will change her future, as well as her past. You see, for the past twenty years Claire has mistakenly believed that her beloved 'Jamie' died in the historic battle of Culloden. It was there that the Scottish highlanders bravely fought the English in a misguided attempt to restore Charles Stuart, their bonnie Prince Charlie, to the English throne, only to be decimated on the battlefield. Those few who survived were branded as Jacobite traitors and imprisoned, and their families disenfranchised. It was this very event that Claire and 'Jamie' had conspired to change, only to fail.Their story transports the reader from the turmoil of the Scottish highlands to the intrigue of the French Court and regales the reader with the adventures of the two lovers, as they conspire to change the very course of history. It was this valiant attempt that ultimately brought Claire and 'Jamie' to the crossroad that would compel these star crossed lovers to part and have Brianna become a denizen of the twentieth century.In \\"Voyager\\", Claire, now realizing that the love of her life and soulmate survived the battle of Culloden, makes the decision to go back in time and find James Fraser, as she has not stopped loving or wanting him every waking moment for the past twenty years. Leaving her daughter, Brianna, she once more hurls herself into the vortex of time to eighteenth century Scotland to begin her search for James Fraser, inhopes of being reunited with her 'Jamie'.\\"Voyager\\" tells the story of what happened to Claire Randall and James Fraser in those intervening years. It tells of their ultimate reunion and rediscovery. Against a backdrop of historical events and period detail and with a cast of unforgettable characters, it regales the reader with their new adventures, as Claire returns to a still divided, turmoil ridden Scotland. Reunited with Jamie, none the worse for wear, they seek to make a life for themselves. As their love comes full circle, they take to the high seas, and their adventures continue, captivating the reader once more.In \\"Drums of Autumn\\", the story takes somewhat of a detour, as it begins to focus more on Brianna. Back in the twentieth century, Brianna and her boyfriend, Roger, a Scot and college history professor, as well as descendant of one of James Fraser's cousins from clan MacKenzie, each independently make a discovery that stuns them. Roger keeps it to himself, while Brianna acts upon it. The discovery involves an old news clipping which tells of Claire's and James' premature deaths in a house fire in pre-revolutionary, frontier America. Brianna makes the decision to go to the stone circle to try and go back in time to change the course of history and save her parents. She does not, however, tell Roger of her plans. Roger, discovering Brianna's deception, follows on her heels and, on that strange, flat topped hill in Scotland he, too, enters the stone circle and is himself hurled into the vortex of time.Brianna and Roger catch up with each other in the eighteenth century only to be parted for a time, each having their own adventures. Claire and James by now are established homesteaders in North Carolina and are enjoying, what is for them, a relatively staid life. By the time Brianna catches up with them, an event has occurred in her life which may have the impact of forcing her to stay mired in the past.This fourth book in the series is a bit of a disappointment, as it could have used some serious editing due to the author's self-indulgence. Moreover, the characters are not so well drawn, as they are in the first three books in the series. Unfortunately, a pivotal character, that of Brianna, is uncharismatic and comes across as somewhat vapid and stupid. Brianna definitely needs work, if she is to capture the readers' imagination, as have Claire and 'Jamie'. At the stage of development in which she is, Brianna would be unable to sustain another book. The same goes for Roger, who comes across as somewhat one dimensional, though he does have potential, as he seems to have a latent smoldering and sensual quality to his personality.Still, notwithstanding some of these issues, this remains a compelling time travel saga, one which the many fans of this series will, undoubtedly, enjoy."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Diana's books take a long time to read. They are so rich and well developed that I like to savor each chapter. I received \\"The Outlandish Companion\\" as a gift while I was in the middle of \\"Drums of Autumn\\". It helped me immensely in understanding some of the Gaelic and other languages that are interspersed throughout the story. I only wish I had the \\"Companion\\" before I started reading the series.Like the first three books, this one covers a lot of territory and introduces some more notable characters. The personalities of Briana, Roger, Lord John, and Ian are better developed in this book and they will hopefully provide us with more entertaining reading in the next. I am constantly amazed at the struggles that each day presented to Frasers & company during the 18th century. The perilous ocean travel, the thieves, the devastation from illnesses such as measles, not to mention the hard life in the wilderness. (The part with the snake in the privy really got my attention!) As in the other books, Diana doesn't sugar-coat any situation or any bodily function!Jamie and Claire are truly partners and soul mates in every sense. I felt they became even closer in this book, if that is possible. I love Jamie's steadfastness and noble character. He becomes quickly initiated into the roll of father when he makes a truly human error in judgement pertaining to his daughter's virtue. The argument with Brianna & the estrangement that ensues seem very realistic. Claire has settled nicely into the roll of mother and country doctor. She is not as much of a firecracker as in previous books, but then again she is still remarkable for a middle-aged woman!There are a few slow parts to this 800+ page book, but I never found it boring. I can find no reason to give this less than the 5 stars that it deserves."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"My fianc&eacute; started reading Outlander at my request recently so I decided to pick up Drums of Autumn and give it a go-ahead again. I had tried reading it a couple of years ago and had gotten halfway through it when something distracted me. This happens often with Diana's books. It's not that they aren't riveting, they are. But the piece-by-piece way that she writes sometimes makes for the mind to wander in certain parts of her books. Their size is often an invitation to that also. Of course, my ADD could make this ten times worse but my mind wandered. However, this time, when I drove right in, I read it from cover to cover in a week or two. It was great! Gabaldon is amazing! I've enjoyed every book that she's written so far and Drums is no exception.Take no heed to the folks who say it's slow. The thing about Diana's books is that they have their own pace. They are not at a breakneck speed they whole way through. Sections of them might be but as a whole, the book has it's own pace. There's a lot of ground that needs to be covered in this book. When you're finished, you'll see: a lot happens in this book! I find myself excited about starting the Fiery Cross just to see what she's going to do with the upcoming Revolutionary War! It's a fascinating time and to see it from the point-of-view of the Fraziers' sounds exciting to me.If you are new to the Outlandish books, go back to the original Outlander and dive in. If you are unsure about starting this new part of the series, the Americas, instead of the three other Scottish books, give it a try. I don't think you will be let down. I wasn't."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Last november, I trusted a friend's recommendation and starting reading the 'Outlander series' from Diana Gabaldon.

There's a lot of action in the book, but I thought much of it was rather improbable (but, then again, isn't time travel improbable?).I'm still a fan, and will wait impatiently for the next book, but I did enjoy the first four books more than &quot;The Fiery Cross.&quot;I just hope we don't have to wait as long for the next installment!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I picked up DRUMS OF AUTUMN one day in a store, and promptly moved, thus baninshing the book to a box. A few weeks ago, I picked it up and started to read it. I had never read anything by Diana Gabaldon before (yes, I went about it completely backassward), but the way she weaved stories within stories to create a beautiful tapestry absolutely captured me. I loved the entire book! The fact that she writes a story including all the day-to-day events, be they hilarious or heartbreaking, is evidence of a terrific author! It really shouldn't be classified as a romance novel, because it's so much more than that; it's believeable! You can read it and say, &quot;That has happened to me!&quot; or &quot;I always say that!&quot;. None of the cheezy tripping through the daisies, and characters who are outrageously perfect crap.

I highly recommmend these books to anyone looking for a whirlwind adventure!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Contines the excellent tale of Jamie and Claire started in the superb Outlander.

Can't recommend this series highly enough."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Who would have thought that looking at a clearance rack of books would unleash such mystery and love. In 1996, I wanted to find books over Scotland... I saw Outlander. It looked like it may be okay. So I read it. I could not put it down. I was so swept up in JAmie and Claire's adventures, it was unreal. I couldnt wait for the other books in the saga. Drums of Autmn was yet another gripping adventure. I long await for the last two books in the saga."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book as I did the others before it. I was prepared to be entertained and to fall in love and I was not disappointed. I felt that I had personally met the characters in the book. Diana Gabaldon's books captured my heart from Outlander right through to Drums of Autumn. Anyone who wants to be entertained by mystery, adventure, romance, suspense and sheery joy should read all of Diana Gabaldon's works. The only disappointment I experienced was coming to the end of the book and wanting more and that is actually not disappointment but anticipation, a very good feeling. Diana keep them coming. These books are ones I will never forget and each winter I feel the desire to reacquaint myself with the characters. I will never forget the way I felt when Jamie met Brianna for the first time."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I have read the series and can not say enough about this book. The author has followed through so well. The book is wonderful. I have read other series and can honestly say that this one picks up where the other left off with out any confusion. I have enjoyed this book so much and hope to see the next very soon. My sister and sister-in-law read as much as I. We trade books and usually don't expect the books returned. We just pass them on to someone else. These books I will keep so I may reread them again. I have not enjoyed a book as much as I have this writers books. I would recomend any one who enjoys reading about the Scottish and the early America's to buy this series. They are so entertaining and enjoyable. Once you start to read the first it is hard to put them down till you have read through all 4. Then it leaves you waiting for the next to arive. I hope to see more of this series soon and other series of hers in the near future. She writes to make you fell you are a part of the book. You fell you are a part of the book and experiencing the scenes of the book yourself. If you buy this series you will not regret it. It is money well spent and will give you house of enjoyment."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This book is a good book it is not for children though.

So i would tell people to read it."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I haven't read Drums of Autumn yet, but I HAVE read the preceding three novels in this series. I don't want the author to cut any corners on the rest of the series, but I sure can't wait to read them all!

Gabaldon is so detailed in her descriptions that you feel transported to the 18th century. The story and characters keep you wanting more and more! I can't wait for &quot;The Firey Cross.&quot;Suggestion to those of you who don't have time to read...listen to the series on tape.

I have read all 4 books and can't wait for the fifth one to be published. Excellent writing. Contrary to some other reviews,I've enjoyed the inclusion of Roger and Brianna and the slower pace in some parts of the book. It helped prolonge the suspense. Keep writing Diana."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The fourth in the Outlander series, Drums of Autumn takes off a bit after the third book ends. As a recap (and a bit of a spoiler if you haven't read the first 3) we learn in the previous installments that Claire, a nurse from the 1940's has traveled back in time to 18th century Scotland. There she falls in love with dashing Jamie Fraser and is forced to leave him when a great battle dawns on the horizon. When she learns of his fate 20 years later in his own time, she has to decide between him and their daughter, and what point in time she will go to. When she leaves for the past, she quickly finds Jamie but a series of adventure has them setting out for America in search of Jamie's missing nephew. While they have many adventures in the Caribbean, they are eventually shipwrecked on the shores of Georgia.Drums of Autumn starts with their struggling to make a place for themselves in America. They reunite with Jamie's aunt and while they are happy staying with her, Jamie has no wish to inherit her property. Seized by his need to get away, he takes up the government's offer to homestead the land and claim a place of North Carolina for himself.While the going is tough and they are often faced with the hardships of working a wild land, they manage to carve out a home for themselves.Meanwhile, in the future, their daughter Brianna has discovered that they will be killed in the year 1776. Desperate to warn them, she goes back into the past, swiftly followed by her boyfriend Roger who is deeply in love with her. Surprisingly, they find their way to North Carolina, but a series of events will endeavor to keep them apart.Like always, Gabaladon writes with a great deal of detail. Her characters are rich and full of life and she makes you feel as if you really know them. I do fault her for the character of Roger however. In the previous books he was his own person, but with this book I found him sounding and acting more and more like Jamie. She is great at making distinct characters and it made me wonder why she would have her two main male characters almost identical. It was as if she was so used to writing Jamie that Roger morphed into him.Like the other novels, with the exception of a few parts, it is written in the first person from Claire's point of view. All other parts are told in the third person.Unlike some of her other books, while this one does contain a bit of violence, it is not heavy handed and adds to the book rather than just being there to be there. There were several times that I caught myself skipping the pages just to hurry up and find out what was going to happen.While it is not as good as the previous two I still found this book to be a tremendous work of writing. I look forward to the next in the series.Drums of AutumnCopyright 1997880 pages"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Just when you think Diana has given you all she's got, she gives you more! I can't put this series down! Her ability to make you believe you are there.. you can almost smell & taste it! The history, and the beauty that is Jamie & Claire - people you'd so like to know! - and now Roger and Brianna come into the mix.. She continues to amaze me, surprise me. The intricate tales she weaves connecting and throughout each book! She has the ability to mix the ordinary with the extraordinary (time travel) and make it believable! She can make you laugh, and bring you to tears (Jamie & Brianna Meeting... wow). It has been 20 years since an author has been able to touch me in this way. I thought great fiction was dead! This series (Outlander..) is number one on my Christmas list for all my friends. I just read Echo in the Bone (7th Book) and cannot wait for the next book!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I must admit that I'm hooked on this series! I can't seem to get enough of Jamie and Claire. I felt like this book was an improvement over the last one and I'm glad. I think I can say with a fair amount of confidence that this is my favorite series ever now. That says a lot because Lord of the Rings and the Dark Tower series have kind of tied for that spot for a lot of years. I have the fifth book in the series sitting on the shelf waiting for me and I'm going to try and get my hands on the sixth book soon. I hope the series continues to be this good!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Diana Gabaldon is an amazing story teller. I really enjoyed this the fourth installment in the Outlander series.I don't know what I could say about this book that someone hasn't already said. I will add my two cents and say that I like the character Brianna. I think that it's important to put into perspective that she comes from a time when people aren't considered adults at the ripe old age of seventeen. And she has been given a lot to deal with in a short period of time, she seems a bit impulsive and immature but she's twenty two years old...I enjoyed the love story between Brianna and Rodger and the adventures in Drums were just as exciting as all the others.I am hooked! I will be reading ALL of the books in the series! It's wonderful escapist adventure with a fabulous background in historical fiction.If anyone knows if there are more books coming out after Snow and Ashes will you let me know...I read in The Outlandish Companion that Gabaldon was going to publish a prequel to Outlander and I tried to find out more but couldn't."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The fourth in the Outlander series. Claire, a 20th century Englishwoman steps through a circle of stones and is transported 200 years back in time, where she falls in love with 18th century Scotsman, Jamie Fraser. Some reviewers comment that this is the weak link in the series. I agree. While Jamie and Claire fascinate me, and I cannot get enough of them, there were other characters who did not interest me at all. Overall, this is an excellent author."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This is the fourth in a series of what has been, until now, exceptionally well-written time travel, adventure/romance books by the author. I urge the reader to start at the beginning and read each and every one in the order in which it was written. Be not afraid of the length of each book. Trust me when I say that you will end up wishing that they were each longer, so riveting is the story that the author unfolds. Ms. Gabaldon is a master storyteller without compare, employing the superlative use of actual historical events with authentic period detail to weave a three dimensional tapestry of timeless love and adventure. While the core of the story is about a love that transcends time, it is an adventure story that holds the reader in its thrall.The love that spans time is that which twentieth century Englishwoman, Claire Randall, has for eighteenth century Scottish highlands warrior, James Fraser. Those readers who have read the first book in the series, \\"Outlander\\", know that in 1945, Claire, a combat nurse during World War II, is reunited with her husband, Frank, after the war. While on a second honeymoon in Scotland, she visits a strange, flat topped hill, where a forbidding stone circle draws her. Touching one of the stones, she is hurled through a vortex in time and finds herself in eighteenth century Scotland, where she meets the brave and brawny, red headed Scot, James Fraser, with whom she falls head over heels in love. Finding herself thrust into the midst of clan warfare and intrigue, she and her beloved 'Jamie' have enough adventures to last a lifetime.The second book, \\"Dragonfly in Amber\\", is a continuation of that story, told from the perspective of the twentieth century where Claire, now a doctor, has lived for the past twenty years. Upon the death of her twentieth century husband, Frank, Claire returns to Scotland with her grown, red headed daughter, Brianna. There she discloses to Brianna the events of her secret past, as well as the truth as to who Brianna's biological father truly is and of the love that Claire bore him.While in Scotland, however, Claire discovers something that will change her future, as well as her past. You see, for the past twenty years Claire has mistakenly believed that her beloved 'Jamie' died in the historic battle of Culloden. It was there that the Scottish highlanders bravely fought the English in a misguided attempt to restore Charles Stuart, their bonnie Prince Charlie, to the English throne, only to be decimated on the battlefield. Those few who survived were branded as Jacobite traitors and imprisoned, and their families disenfranchised. It was this very event that Claire and 'Jamie' had conspired to change, only to fail.Their story transports the reader from the turmoil of the Scottish highlands to the intrigue of the French Court and regales the reader with the adventures of the two lovers, as they conspire to change the very course of history. It was this valiant attempt that ultimately brought Claire and 'Jamie' to the crossroad that would compel these star crossed lovers to part and have Brianna become a denizen of the twentieth century.In \\"Voyager\\", Claire, now realizing that the love of her life and soulmate survived the battle of Culloden, makes the decision to go back in time and find James Fraser, as she has not stopped loving or wanting him every waking moment for the past twenty years. Leaving her daughter, Brianna, she once more hurls herself into the vortex of time to eighteenth century Scotland to begin her search for James Fraser, in hopes of being reunited with her 'Jamie'.\\"Voyager\\" tells the story of what happened to Claire Randall and James Fraser in those intervening years. It tells of their ultimate reunion and rediscovery. Against a backdrop of historical events and period detail and with a cast of unforgettable characters, it regales the reader with their new adventures, as Claire returns to a still divided, turmoil ridden Scotland. Reunited with Jamie, none the worse for wear,they seek to make a life for themselves. As their love comes full circle, they take to the high seas, and their adventures continue, captivating the reader once more.In \\"Drums of Autumn\\", the story takes somewhat of a detour, as it begins to focus more on Brianna. Back in the twentieth century, Brianna and her boyfriend, Roger, a Scot and college history professor, as well as descendant of one of James Fraser's cousins from clan MacKenzie, each independently make a discovery that stuns them. Roger keeps it to himself, while Brianna acts upon it. The discovery involves an old news clipping which tells of Claire's and James' premature deaths in a house fire in pre-revolutionary, frontier America. Brianna makes the decision to go to the stone circle to try and go back in time to change the course of history and save her parents. She does not, however, tell Roger of her plans. Roger, discovering Brianna's deception, follows on her heels and, on that strange, flat topped hill in Scotland he, too, enters the stone circle and is himself hurled into the vortex of time.Brianna and Roger catch up with each other in the eighteenth century only to be parted for a time, each having their own adventures. Claire and James by now are established homesteaders in North Carolina and are enjoying, what is for them, a relatively staid life. By the time Brianna catches up with them, an event has occurred in her life which may have the impact of forcing her to stay mired in the past.This fourth book in the series is a bit of a disappointment, as it could have used some serious editing due to the author's self indulgence. Moreover, the characters are not so well drawn, as they are in the first three books in the series. Unfortunately, a pivotal character, that of Brianna, is uncharismatic and comes across as somewhat vapid and stupid. Brianna definitely needs work, if she is to capture the readers' imagination as have Claire and 'Jamie'. At the stage of development in which she is, Brianna would be unable to sustain another book. The same goes for Roger, who comes across as somewhat one dimensional, though he does have potential, as he seems to have a latent smoldering and sensual quality to his personality.Still, notwithstanding some of these issues, this remains a compelling time travel saga, and my thirst for reading the fifth and sixth volumes in this series remains undiminished. I only hope that the lengthy time span between the fourth and the fifth volumes means that the author has worked out some of the kinks in this new and developing direction that this series seems to be taking."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The fourth book in the Outlander series, it's as great as the three that came before. I have just finished reading it for the second time in preparation for the fifth book THE FIREY CROSS which is scheduled to be released in November.Drums, is the continuation of the adventures of Jamie and Claire Fraser in 18th century America. The tale of Brianna and Roger is cultivated in this book and deeply enriches the storyline. Gabaldon gives the reader what he or she wants and the promise of more to come. Every page read draws the reader on for more and more.A great book to accompany the series is THE OUTLANDISH COMPANION, which pulls the story together with descriptions, pictures, maps, and timelines of all the important places and characters.Kelsana 9/24/01"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Drums of Autumn will leave you breathless. Whether from the pounding of the titular drums as war rises again on the horizon, or from the tension of suspense, you'll close the last page completely satisfied and wondering why you're exhausted.Our Heroine, Clare, finds herself looking for her past, in more ways than one. Returning to the 18th Century, she decides that trying to find the love of her life is more important than staying safe and secure in the 1960s.Unfortunately, like daughter, like mother. Her only child follows her on an expedition to find Jamie, Clare's husband and Bree's father.The action continues in Scotland and migrates to the New World.After having been separated for neigh unto 20 years, both Clare and Jamie have continued their lives, separately. It is the detailed, sympathetic portrait of them attempting to reconcile their shared past with their current present which will pull at your heartstrings. They are realistic, which certainly means it isn't the same old thing you've read before.Gabaldon never ceases to amaze with her insight into the workings between men and women, without denigrating either one in the process.This kept me on the edge of my seat, eagerly turning pages like few other books.If you've read Outlander, either stop, or simply buy the next three together. Dragonfly in Amber and Voyager are definately worthwhile, if for no other reason then to get you to Drums of Autumn.

I was hooked when I first opened &quot;Outlander.&quot; I find Claire's modern day sense of humor in rather barbaric (to her way of thinking) situations refreshing, as well as her intelligence. How many other authors would have thought to have her bring penicillin to the 18th century, or better still, try to invent it in the 18th century? Jamie is, what can I say, completely wonderful. Stubborn, yes, macho, true, yet lovable and so compatible with Claire.I couldn't put any of these books down once I had started them. I have them all in hardback and prominently displayed on my bookshelf with the &quot;Outlandish Companion.&quot; I even persuaded my grandmother to read them, and she loved them!I have to wholeheartedly recommend these books to any reader of historical fiction. You really feel like these characters could have existed, and that you are actually looking at life much the way it was in the 18th century.

I did not feel that they detracted from Jamie and Claire: they are a natural progression of the story. This book was just as rivetting as the 3 before it. Many are the times I have read deep into the early hours of the morning, absolutely absorbed. A neighbour loaned me the first book in the series, 'Outlander' (called 'Crosstitch' in Australia). On my way to France in September I bought 'Dragonfly in Amber' at Sydney airport and while in Paris I was able to get 'Voyager' to read in the plane on my way home (23hour flight). I hate to think that one day these wonderful tales will end.

Drums of Autumn is yet another fantastic addition to this series. This book is just as pleasing as the previous three, rich with imagery, historically interesting, along with the comfortable presence of Claire and Jamie that I have grown quite fond of throughout this series. Gabaldon continues to keep the story interesting by introducing new characters and saying good-bye to some, creating new drama, but also bringing back and reminding us of some characters from the previous books. This leaves you wanting more, knowing there is more to be told about all of these characters and how their lives will weave into the web of Jamie and Claire's.The pace is a bit slower in this book (but by no means boring), this helped me slow down a bit, enjoy the language(s), revel in the imagery and prepare myself for the break I am now forced to take waiting for the next installment of Jamie and Claire, Brianna and Roger.

It amazes me that Ms. Gabaldon has been able to continue to delight readers with her consistently good writing, excellent plots, superb characters and meticulous historic research for thousands of pages and four novels. &quot;Drums Of Autumn&quot; most certainly will not disappoint fans of the series. If you have not read the three preceding novels, I strongly urge you to do so before beginning this book. &quot;Drums of Autumn&quot; may be able to stand as a novel in its own right, but I think it would be too confusing to enjoy it thoroughly without having read the historic and personal drama that Ms. Gabaldon details so well in her previous books. To label the &quot;Outlander&quot; series as merely historical romance fiction would be to do it a terrible injustice. This is an epic historical romance, yes...and so much more. The relationship between Claire and Jamie is one of the most caring and intimate I have ever encountered - in fiction or real life. This is a couple who are solidly committed to a life together for better or worse. Theirs is a love that truly transcends the boundaries of time.More than twenty years before this novel begins, Claire Beauchamps Randall, vacationing in post WWII Scotland, stepped through the ancient stone circle known as Craigh na Dun - and was suddenly sucked back in time to 1743 and war-torn Scotland. It was here that she met and married her own true love, highlander James Fraser. Before the tragic battle of Culloden Moor she was forced to return to the 20th century to protect herself and her unborn daughter, abandoning Jamie in the process. Two decades later Claire made the journey back through the stones to reunite with James in the 18th century, leaving their grown daughter, Brianna, behind.James and Claire both agreed that there was no possibility to build a life for themselves in Scotland. The clans had been forced to disband, the people were starving and living in abject poverty, most of the men were dead, crippled, imprisoned and or jobless as a result of the doomed Jacobite uprising. The Frasers along with a few friends and James' nephew, Ian, cross the Atlantic and make their way to North Carolina where Jamie's aunt has a plantation. At the same parallel time, 20th century Brianna and her beloved Scottish boyfriend Roger discover some terrifying information about Claire's and Jamie's fate. Brianna is determined to reach her parents somehow and warn them of coming events, hoping to change the future. The inevitability of these events and the frustration and inability to change the future continue to be strong themes.This is a phenomenal novel! Ms. Gabaldon details frontier life in beautiful 18th century North Carolina so clearly and accurately that one literally feels swept back in time. Claire and James have grown tremendously as characters, as have the love and intimacy between them. I have never experienced a couple as unique as these two in modern fiction. New characters are introduced, as well as a marvelously vile villain, and in typical Gabaldon style, these new folks are portrayed with realism, complexity and humor as are many of the old favorites. This is also Brianna's story. She finally meets her father in &quot;Drums Of Autumn&quot; and becomes a woman with a woman's responsibilities.The books in this series are among my favorites novels, not just because the plots are so fascinating that I am unable to stop reading once I begin...although this is true. The characters are so palpably real that the reader actually bonds with them, at least with Jamie and Claire, in a way that is most unusual and very moving. We follow their lives and observe them as they grow as human beings, experience joy, suffer, and just interact with each other on a day to day basis, as well as in the midst of high adventure. We watch as they make history and as history tears away at them. I cannot recommend this book and series highly enough.JANA"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Ostensibly, \\"Drums of Autumn\\" is about reunions with fathers. Gabaldon, however, seems to meander about quite a bit before she remembers her theme. Although I didn't do an exact count, I agree with the reviewer who commented that the first 500 pages are terrible. \\"Drums\\" begins with Jamie and Claire attending the execution of one of Jamie's fellow inmates. Jamie and Claire, plus entourage, are heading to a Scottish settlement in Wilmington, North Carolina, where his aunt owns a plantation. The first half of the book mostly involves the mishaps on their journey north, life at the aunt's plantation, Jamie's debate over whether to strike out on his own or accept his aunt's generous offer, an adventure-filled trip to the wilderness, and ultimately, getting settled in a home in the new world.While I don't want to suggest that all these events are mundane--this is Jamie and Claire Fraser we're talking about, after all--the events are very episodic. Gabaldon lacks any kind of overriding theme to organize the plot. In \\"Outlander,\\" we had Claire's ultimate decision about whether to return to her 20th century life. In \\"Dragonfly in Amber,\\" we had their attempt to prevent Culloden. In \\"Voyager,\\" we first had Claire's search for records of what happened to Jamie, and later the search and rescue of Jamie's nephew Ian.Also missing in \\"Drums\\" is a good villain. With the deaths of Jack Randall and Geillis Duncan, Gabaldon has to create a new bad guy or two. She does introduce her villains fairly early on--only their true malevolence does not become apparent until much later. In other words, unlike the way the threat of Jack Randall loomed in \\"Outlander,\\" the threat of these villains seems to disappear when they initially disappear from the plot.About halfway through \\"Drums,\\" the Frasers' daughter, Brianna, who remains in the 20th century, discovers something about her parents' fate and decides to travel to the past to warn them. Her boyfriend, Roger Wakefield, follows her. Once Brianna and Roger wind up in the past, the plot tends to liven up, and the direction of the book also begins to make sense. Without revealing certain plot twists, I will note that certain events should create a sense of urgency to get certain issues resolved--and yet Gabaldon does not really leave the reader that worried about the potential outcomes. Gabaldon does manage a few nice little plot twists at the end, so keep going. Suffice to say that Roger has an interesting encounter with an ancestor, and Frank's influence comes into play.Despite my tepid praise for this book, as historical romances go, it's still quite good--just not as good as the first three. One aspect that I appreciate about Gabaldon's books is that she does not overly romanticize the hardships and harsh living conditions of the past. She also deftly avoids overly sentimentalizing certain situations or going for the cliche. For instance, when Brianna meets her real father, at long last, after traveling through time and across the ocean, she first seems him behind a pub, urinating--not in some idealized encounter.I'm crossing my fingers that \\"The Fiery Cross\\" is better, but I'm not optimistic."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"&quot;Time travel, not my cup of tea &quot; I thought when I first came across this book whilst researching novels set in 18th century North America.I like my historical novels with a dose of realism, not fantasy.

But , as I found, not having got into the whole &quot;Jamie and Claire &quot;thing was no bar to enjoyment of this novel at all.The sterling quality of the writing drew me in and never let up. How can it be that a book of 800 pages whithout much of a plot still seems too short? Gabaldon is an excellent storyteller who brings her characters - and their surroundings - vividly to life. It is a mark of her skill that she manages to make an existing relationship sound new and exciting .(If you think that's nothing special, have you ever wondered why most novelists abandon their characters after courtship? As in life, so in fiction people find it much harder to sustain than to start new).And the device of time travel succeeds extremely well in dealing with the dilemma of the historical novelist: the desire to go back in time and fix things, to apply modern thought to a historic situation. We feel with Claire's outrage at slavery, bodily punishment and everyday cruelty, thoughts that would be anachronistic in a character of the period. Because she is a modern creature, Claire can voice these thoughts, if not act on them.For me, a particular gem was the deeply moving tale of another time traveller whose remains Claire stumbles across and who appears as a ghost to save her life. The story of his failed attempt to change the past and warn his people is revealed on the occasion of a visit to an Indian village, whose residents refused to believe his prophesies of doom.Claire of course knows the future but also knows that she is powerless to change the past. If you could go back in time, who would you try to warn?"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I was originally prepared to be partially disappointed with this book as a few of the other reviews had left me with the mistaken impression that it didn't deliver. Much to my delight, I LOVED Drums of Autumn! It delivered all of the goods and more. I was also thoroughly taken with the preceeding 3 books in the series.With Drums, I found enjoyment in Jamie and Claire being comfortably together, secure in their love for one another and settled in their new home. This book, like the other three, was filled with laughter, tears, romance and adversity. It dealt with each characters emotions perhaps even better than in the preceding novels because it took it's time - I for one enjoyed the slower pace (but never, never a boring one). I liked the addition of Brianna and Roger's story as well as John Grey's continued presence in the lives of our hero and heroine. I can't wait to see what happens next - the introduction of Stephen Bonnett as well as Will's reappearance should make for some interesting story plots in the next 2 books!I have never been so taken with any characters as I have with Jamie and Claire. Diana Gabaldon is a phenomenal writer - she speaks directly to my heart and sense of adventure! I recommend this as well as every book in the Outlander series - 5 stars for all."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The fourth in the Outlander series, Drums of Autumn begins in Charleston in 1767 where Claire, Jamie, Fergus and Ian begin a journey to find Jamie's Aunt Jocasta who owns a plantation in North Carolina. As with the previous three novels in this series, Diana Gabaldon weaves stories within stories creating a rich tale of adventure, suspense and love.In Drums of Autumn Brianna, Jamie and Claire's daughter travels back in time to find her parents to warn them of disaster in their future. Brianna found a story in an old newspaper telling of the death of Jamie and Claire Fraser in a house fire. Roger Wakefield, Brianna's sometime boyfriend, also found the story. Roger decided not to tell Brianna for fear she would attempt to go back in time to warn her parents. When Roger learns that Brianna has done exactly that, he follows her through the stones back to 18th century Scotland. Brianna finds her way to Lollybrach and meets Jenny, Jamie's sister, and Ian and all the children. This is a wonderful part of the book where the reader can appreciate and feel the amazing connection between past and future, gave me the chills just reading it.Roger eventually catches up with Brianna in the colonies after Roger's most arduous ocean crossing. I do agree with several of the other reviewers who feel that Brianna's character is a bit weak. I haven't caught on to, or much liked, Brianna at all since the first introduction of her character. Brianna does not have the depth or heart that Claire has and comes off as a self-centered child in many ways.Brianna and Roger each have their own separate adventures and each is intertwined with Jamie and Claire's. Lord John Grey appears again to play an integral role in Brianna's life. The character of Lord Grey is one of my favorites as he is a man of honor.In Drums of Autumn Jamie is not the ferocious warrior, nor the persecuted prisoner; he's a farmer and a builder. Although it was a relief of sorts not to endure any floggings or near-death misadventures, it seemed as though Jamie was out of his element having been removed from Scotland. Nonetheless, this book was everything the previous books were in it's own way. Diana Gabaldon has succeeded in continuing the \`love that spans time' between Jamie and Claire and has added more depth to their relationship.This series is one of the best I have read. I was overjoyed to discover the 5th in the series, The Fiery Cross, has already been released already so I won't have to wait to continue this engrossing saga."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Although I loved this fourth book, I also was a tiny, and I mean tiny, lol, bit disapointed that we didn't get to see much of Claire and Jamie's life in the New World as this one focused mainly on their daughter Brianna.In the last book 'Voyager', Claire and Jamie are cast ashore in the Carolinas with nowhere to go and with no hope of returning to a unstable Scotland. 'Drums of Autumn' picks up right where it left off and we see them safely to the Colony of Cape Fear, North Carolina, where other exiled Jackobite Scot Highlanders settled.Here they make a new life where the rivers run clear and the rolling hills remind them of home and the fertile valleys give them hope. Jamie becomes disheartened when the British Crown threatens everyone's peace and the Americans begin to rile over taxes and control of their new home.Striving to get away from government control, Jamie takes Claire farther into the wilderness and into the mountains; at last finding a precarious foothold. He is convinced that war cannot invade into their mountain sanctuary.History spares no one and Brianna, the daughter Claire and Jamie have left in the future finds a terrifying piece of information from the past that throws a black shadow over her peace of mind.Her mother and a father are in danger.Not wanting to sit back while history completes itself, Brianna follows her mother into the past to change history and finds herself flung into a foreign world that was once her own. But now Brianna finds her own life in danger and must make a decision so heartbreaking that it will tear their fragile family apart.Love, pain, treachery and tragedy bring this story to life. I liked Brianna alot, but was a little bit disapointed that the entire book seemed focused on her travels(which by the way I thought was fascinating)and her life.We get to see Claire again and brave Jamie, but only briefly here and there.Jamie has changed a little in this book, gotten older and matured. He is very sweet, but now is wary of people and overly protective. Jamie is the 'perfect man', if a man can get that perfect, lol.Claire also has matured and shown us how she has changed in little ways. I was happy to see mother and daughter back together again, it made the story more complete.I am so looking forward to the fifth book titled 'The Fiery Cross' and how the Revolution affects their lives...This is a saga that will become a classic...1. Outlander 2. Dragonfly in Amber 3. Voyager 4. Drums of Autumn 5. The Fiery CrossTracy Talley~@"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This book is the 4th installment in Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. The stars of the series are Jamie and Claire Fraser, whose long, passionate love has transcended time and keeps readers coming back for more.Jamie and Claire are living in 18th century America during this installment. Their daughter, Brianna, is a young woman in the 20th century. But when Brianna comes across historical references to her parents' untimely death, she rushes back into the past to warn them. However, her love affair with Roger Mackenzie Wakefield complicates this endeavor.Had I not enjoyed the first three books of this series so thoroughly (especially Outlander, the first book) I would give Drums of Autumn at least 4 stars. I did really enjoy it, particularly after the first 300 pages or so - the story seemed to get much tighter and more exciting at that point. But this book simply doesn't live up to Gabaldon's previous work overall.Why? Well, for starters, Brianna and Roger occupy a non-trivial amount of the book, and they are simply not as interesting as Jamie and Claire. Gabaldon tries very hard - in some ways their relationship follows the same trajectory as Jamie and Claire's (they fight a lot despite being attracted to each other, they're both stubborn). But the \\"spark\\" just isn't there. It does not help that Brianna, despite being an MIT graduate, seems to lack maturity and common sense. And Gabaldon cannot decide if she wants to make Roger a quiet, retreating historian or a loud Scot like Jamie.The parts that feature Jamie and Claire are extensive, but they also disappoint sometimes. They are still wonderful and compelling characters, but they can be exasperating, too. Gabaldon never tires of reminding the reader of Claire's beauty and intelligence, and though I applaud her for featuring a \\"mature\\" female heroine, I am tired of hearing about how she looks half her age, and how every man all but falls madly in love with her on sight. Jamie, meanwhile, is still dashing and brave, but he veers into brutish violence a little too quickly and too often. In a way, this is understandable. Jamie has led a very harsh life. But in putting Jamie through so many years of hell, Gabaldon has sacraficed some of what made the young Jamie so appealing and different.The matter of Claire's first husband, Frank Randall, also troubles this book. Gabaldon can't seem to decide how she feels about Frank. In the previous book, Voyager, he was portrayed as an insufferable racist and philanderer. But in this installment, Gabaldon seems determined to prove that Frank was a good husband to Claire, and several plot points revolve around her continuing devotion to his memory (even though she does, and always did, love Jamie more). I had hoped all talk of Frank would cease after he passed away, but, that's clearly not the case. Gabaldon has trouble letting characters go. Even those who are long gone reappear in dialogue and memory to a frustrating degree.Having said all this, again, I enjoyed the book, and I will finish the rest of the series. Gabaldon's efforts are always engrossing, and no other love story I've ever read compares to that of Jamie and Claire."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I am starting to get a little sad at the prospect of soon finishing these books! What will I do with my life? I do know that I will really miss these characters.I agree with many of the previous reviewers about Brianna (even 30 years ago girls were being 'sent off' to have illegitimate babies)--I can't imagine what reactions would have been 200 years ago. Wouldn't Jocasta have kept her hidden? And why didn't she tell people that she was 'handfasted' when her pregnancy was discovered? It's also ironic that Claire is always saying that Brianna is stubborn just like Jamie. Claire is pretty stubborn herself! I did enjoy Roger and Brianna's story though.I disagree with previous reviewers about DRUMS OF AUTUMN needing a villain. Bonnet is extremely dastardly, isn't he? Frankly I'm glad Black Jack is gone!I loved this novel as much as the first three. The writing is exceptionally beautiful and as we have grown accustomed, the plot is compelling. As usual, something is happening on every page and I enjoyed the fact that Jamie and Claire have settled down (sort of!). The last few pages of this 'bonnie tale' are so poignant and touching that I was moved to many tears!I have learned so much about Scottish and Colonial history; this is a historical novel with large doses of romance, adventure, and fantasy to boot. And best of all is the love story of Jamie and Claire: &quot;Your face is my heart, Sassenach,&quot; he said softly, &quot;and love of you is my soul.&quot; Or, &quot;And when my body shall cease, my soul will still be yours Claire--I swear by my hope of heaven, I will not be parted from you.&quot; And, &quot;You are my courage, as I am your conscience,&quot; he whispered. &quot;You are my heart--and I your compassion. We are neither of us whole, alone. Do ye not know that, Sassenach?&quot;I recommend these books to anyone who loves to read; they will touch your heart as they have mine!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I wasn't sure I would like this one. Claire and Jamie weren't in Scotland! It did take me a while to get into this one, but once I did, I tore through it. The characters are real people. By the time I finished this book, I was so sad because there was not another one to pick up. I miss my friends! Gabaldon does her research, and it really shows. Excellent book!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The best series I've ever come across for romance novels - wonderful and intriguing characters. A series of tales that keep your eyes red at night from late-nite reading, characters that make you laugh out loud, and cry at their tragedies. You become engulfed with Clare &amp; Jamie and their adventures and their everbinding everlasting love for one another - they become a part of you. I'm not sure I can wait until #5! Besides the fact that I simply must visit Scotland now!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I must say this series has captured my attention and my heart. When you read these books by Diana, you can't help feeling as though you are there with Jamie, Claire, Brianna,and Roger. These characters and their story is one that will be burned in your mind forever."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"During my numerous visits to Scotland I usually picked up everything having to do with that countries history etc. After reading &quot;Outlander&quot;, &quot;Dragonfly....&quot;, and &quot;Voyager&quot; I was forever hooked. Naturally I loved reading &quot;Drums...&quot; although I did not enjoy it as much as especially parts I and III. Still, I have read all 4 books a total of five times so far and, after a rest period of about 6 months, will most likely start again with part I. I have infected a number of my colleagues and friends (not all of them female either!!!) with the &quot;Jamie and Claire Virus&quot; in the meantime and we all can hardly wait for part V to be published in 2000. What a way to start the new century."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This fourth book in the series just leaves you aching for more about the lives of Jamie and Claire. If you read this book and have read the other books in the series, you will know. It is an absolute page turner!!! It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you gasp in outrage, and it will leave you wanting more!!!! It is just a fabulous book that will make you believe that that kind of passionate love does exist for us out there. It will make you fall in love with love!!! Diana Gabaldon is wonderful!!!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Lo que m&aacute;s nos ha gustado de este libro es el establecimiento de un perfecto vinculo con las historias anteriores de la serie y adem&aacute;s igual que en ellas hay que destacar el estilo de su prosa y el impacto sensacional que produce la descripci&oacute;n de las escenas. Los personajes llegan a convertirse en parte de la familia."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Diana Gabaldon constantly amazes me with the depth of her talent. Drums Of Autumn was my least favorite in this series and I still thought it was 5 star material. Even though I find it a little depressing seeing Jamie and Claire age (probably because I just turned 30 :-)) I would adore these characters if all they could do was flirt with each other by flashing toothless grins from their rocking chairs. Excellent saga!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"For all of you Jamie and Claire fans: you must read Sara Donati's book &quot;Into the Wilderness&quot;. It is written in the same style at (almost) the same level. Our favourite couple even makes an appearance!! Diana Gabaldon was quoted on the cover and that's why I picked it up. What a treat. (It is about a fiesty couple in 18th cent. New England)"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Drums is a good book....but by far the best written was Outlander..that book captured your imagination and heart all in one. Drums didnt capture your imagination like the Outlander or Dragonfly in Amber. It did alot of droning on about insignifact things..and the misunderstanding with Jamie and Roger and sending Roger off like that..that part wasnt the greatest scene. But now Brianna and Roger are breaking in a new Mckenzie clan. And there is still the Revolutionary War to happen. Knowing Jamie...he will get caught up in that somehow. I am anxiously awaiting the 5th. After reading the other reviews..i too believe that a movie can be made...but why Kevin Sorbo? I think Adrian Paul should play Jamie..and he is Scots..and maybe Sean Connery can play one of the older characters..maybe Colum."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I never really liked history in school, in movies and other books it was just &quot;background&quot;. Ms. Gabaldon has brought it alive! I have been reading a lot of other historic romances, nothing compares to this series! Next I plan to pick up some history books of 18th century scotland, then a Gaelic dictionary, and, hopefully, teach myself Gaelic. All this thanks to Ms. Gabaldon's wonderful Outlander series! Having Irish ancestors and my husband having Scottish ancestors, we just loved the books, read all together. Wow, what an aphrodisiac! I loved all 4 books, beginning to end, even the boring parts (isn't life like that?). I had to go back over chapters to try and absorb the whole picture, and realized that even the slow or seeming uninteresting parts had a purpose to complete the story. I will pick up one of the books and just open to wherever and start reading, this will usually prompt me to want to read another chapter in same or other book for a complete picture! I have never had this happen with any other book(s) I've read, and I have read hundreds of books and series. I love Jamie and Claire like best friends. I eagerly await the next two books! check out Ms. Gabaldon's web site for excerpts from the two upcoming books for a little &quot;fix&quot; until they come out, it gets me through hunger pangs for them.

I have laughed and cried with them. In this novel (and I am more than happy to learn another will be coming) they find a new life in colonial America, a scant ten years before the Revolution happens. Claire and Jamie are challenged not only by the vast wilderness of what will become America, but by the twenty year seperation they have finally overcome. There are still many things in their respective pasts to be faced and triumphed over. But love for each other and for family can sustain them through anything. It was wonderful to spend time with the Frasers of Lallybroch once again and I look forward to meeting them down the road!

I was not happy with the 3rd book. But I so enjoyed DRUMS OF AUTUMN! I can't wait to read the next one. I loved this book, MUCH better than the 3rd. It didn't hold me right away - I wasn't hooked until Jamie &amp; Claire stayed with Aunt Jocasta - but the book seduced me and by the time they set off from River Run, I was reading in the car at lunch, reading through dinner, and devouring the story. The author's description of the American setting enthralled me, as did the goings on of farming, economy, indian relations, etc. Claire and Jamie's scenes together were still the best in the book, but I did enjoy Bree &amp; Roger's relationship toward the end, but still not as much. I LOVED THE ENDING!!! That last chapter really was the perfect end to this wonderful story. Hurray Gabaldon! ...and Thanks."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This comment is really based on the four books so far. In my opinion it is one of the best series to date. The content takes you back into differnt times and just by closing your eyes you are there. The writing is terrific! Jamie &amp; Claire are memorable. These books will have you laughing and crying, sitting on the edge of your seat and cozy warm.

I was a little anxious that after three books the writing might have lost some of it's power. Not so. I found that the author has continued her along the same winning way as in the three previous books and with the change of continent, infused not only Jamie with a new and intriguing life ahead, but Claire also is faced (perhaps for the first time) with the uncertainty of not really knowing what lies ahead.I found myself enjoying this fourth book as much as the others ( although I think Crosstitch is still the most riviting of them all for it's sheer suspense) and I am chomping on the bit while waiting for the next installment in the lives of Jamie and Claire"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This is the 4th episode in the Outlander Series. Glad it isnt the last! There are so many side stories to keep your interest and the characters are vivid. Of course, it continues the story of Jamie and Claire and what a story it is! This series is so refreshingly different from the standard 'historical romances' they should not even be labeled as such! I've read the 4 books over the summer and am glad to have the opportunity to catch up on my sleep waiting for the 5th book in November. Diana ends each chapter with a lure to go on to the next, thereby delaying chores, sleep etc. etc. Good author! Diana, you are amazing!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Over the past few months, I read the Outlander series and became completely engrossed in this other time and place! Of the four books, Voyager would probably get my highest rating because so much happens, but you have to read them in order anyways to truly enjoy it. I usually don't go for historical romances - the plot is often the same - but I thought I would give Outlander a chance when I saw it included time travel. Much easier to identify with a character who comes from approximately the same place as you, yet you get all the history stuff thrown in too. Anyways, I highly recommend all of these books to others - a word of warning, don't read ahead like I did (I can't help it -- it's a disease...) OR read the Outlandish Companion until you are all done!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Drums Of Autumn by Diana Gabaldon is just one of the amazing books from the Outlander series. The others being: Outlander, Dragonfly In Amber and Voyager; with more to come. In this book we're in America with plantations, slavery, Indians and disease. The book maintains the quality of the first three with the exception of (in my opinion) Roger and Brianna's story. To me it read like a Harlequin Romance; but what do you expect from this amazing author. She meets the reading needs of every individual. Just don't read all four books in a row like I did, or else you'll open your mouth to talk one day and you'll be speaking with a Scottish accent.

When's it coming?!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"It is well written and keeps the reader glued to the book.It is one of the best books I have read.

Breathtaking, very interesting look into the past. My only criticism would be that I found Clare did not gripe enough about missing modern commodities...I know I would have. Those &quot;good old days&quot; were sometimes not so good...no washing machines, dryers, dishwashers, lightweight lingerie, cosmetics, antiseptics,etc.QUESTION: Where is the fifth book that was supposed to come out in Autumn 1999? called &quot;The Fiery Cross&quot;. Where and when can I get it?"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This series is fantastic. I have recommended it to a number of people who are like me, couldn't put it down, or in my case quit couldn't stop listening. Well written, very imaginative.

The audio version is especially great as the reader uses a Scottish accent which I think lends a lot to the enjoyment of the series."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Claire and Jamie meet the New World.

I cant put them down, you become a part of the Fraser family living and feeling like they do.The entire outlander series is wonderful."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"As the fourth book in the series, it is just as captivating as the first. It was hard to put down. I have finished it and am on to the next book, which is just as good. I will feel like I have lost a good friend when I am finished with the series.

Would advise anyone to read these books. Hats off to Diana Gabaldon!!!!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Diana Gabaldon, does a great job of carring this series through.

Even made a trip to Scotland because of the books. So interesting. Definitely read them in order."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I didn't care for the first part of the book. It seemed to float from one action scene to another. I remember groaning at one point, \\"Oh no, another pirate scene.\\" It lacked coherence in my opinion. As another reviewer said, it was episodic. I'd have given this part of the book no more than 3 stars, maybe 2.I liked the rest of the book a lot. It became coherent and quite absorbing from the time it focused on Brianna and Roger, their relationship and their relationships with Claire and Jamie. There was still plenty of action, but it seemed like a part of the whole story rather than an episode that was sandwiched into it. In addition, there was quite a bit of historical fiction focusing on the various tribes of Indians in the area where Claire and Jamie settled which I found interesting. I would have given this part of the book 5 stars if it had been a book of its own. I debated whether to give the book as a whole 3 or 4 stars. I chose the latter, because I felt the latter part of the novel was excellent."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the first three books in this series. I just finished Book 4 \\"Drums of Autumn\\" and think it really didn't live up to the previous books. There were parts of this book that were wonderful, but it tended to wander off track. Several chapters could have been deleted entirely and it wouldn't have hurt the overall story. Toward the end, I started skimming a bit because things just seemed to move too slowly -- the whole episode with the Mohawks was entirely unnecessary and really off track. I think I will take a break before tackling the next three installments."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Perhaps in most books in a long series, by the fourth book they seem to get dull and unimportant. Not so in the Outlander series. After the second reading of \\"Drums of Autumn\\" I realize that this series is perhaps the greatest in the world. Though book four lacks more sex scenes which made the first three books awesome, it is just as adventurous and exciting.Clair and Jamie, though dominant characters in the books, take a little bit of a backseat, since Bree, their daughter, comes into her own in an attempt to find her parents in the past. Just behind her is Roger, the Oxford man that had helped to find Jamie for Claire and Bree, also able to travel into the past. The story takes place in pre-revolutionary America, and the knowledge that Claire has of future events is always in the back of your mind. More on that in the next book of course.I can't recommend this series enough, and I plan on reading these stories again and again and again."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"There are so many reviews that I will just say: READ ALL OF THE BOOKS IN THIS SERIES!!! They are well worth the time it takes to do so. I have read them all more than once and will continue to read them over and over."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Diana Gabaldon has created characters with such depth that you feel as if you know them personally. As she creates the environment of her stories she includes all of the sights, sounds and smells needed to make you feel you are in the middle of the action. Her ability to detail the love between Clair and Jamie makes them totally realistic. All of her main characters have fully drawn personalities and she explores their feelings with more depth than I have seen in other books I have read. Bravo to Gabaldon! I will be sad when the series ends. I can only hope that she continues writing so that we may enjoy her extraordinary talent for many years to come."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I wish Amazon had a 4.5 star because that is what this book deserves. A better-researched author is not out there! She makes history come alive. If you like historical fiction with a paranormal twist and don't mind ( or are thrilled) with saga-length...this is the series for you. Start with Outlander..."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Live the adventure, once you start with Outlander by Diana Galbaldon who can stop, live your second life through this 7 book series...just what I needed, i recommend them all."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I was enthralled with the Outlander series. So much so that I didn't want it to end. I read the first three without blinking but as I came to the fourth, I knew the end of the series was near. I put down the book half way through because if I didn't finish it, the characters would stay alive in my mind. I waited over a year - reliving the story in my head and still not wanting it to end. I finally picked up the book and late last night, and read the last pages. Now that I've finished, I'm hoping there will be a fifth book. I'd love to hear of any other recommendations for books similar to these."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I just finished the 4th and (I hope not) final book in the continuing saga. I am ready for the next! Incredible how the story just keeps coming. And I just keep going. Here's some advice though, start with Voyager and progress through each book up to this one for the full effect."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I honestly didn't enjoy this one as much as the previous three. This book takes place in the colonies, but Jamie and Clare really belong in Scotland. I am eagerly looking forward to the next book and hopeful they will get back where they belong."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I have read the entire Outlander Series. I fell in love with Jamie during the first series, the Outlander. His charming wit and sense of humor was more than a match for Claire. I am waiting on pins &amp; needles for the 5th of the series, The Fiery Cross. I'm sure it will more than match the previous books. Keep up the excellent work Diana."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This book would deserve five stars if Brianna and Roger weren't talked about so much. They're not very interesting characters. They don't get to me as much as Jamie and Claire do. Great book, though, even if it's not one of the best."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This was the first book by Gabaldon that I have read. I did not realize that it was part of a series until halfway through the book (I was expecting major flashbacks to explain references to past events), however, I was able to get a decent grasp of Claire and Jamie's stories. Drums of Autumn was good enough in parts that I want to read the first 3 books of the series, but only in parts. Maybe Gabaldon should put out an abridged version! I actually skipped a good chunk after Roger was shipped off to the Indians because I was disgusted by how the author was manipulating the story in such an artificial way. I mean, if Roger had just said &quot;but I love your daughter&quot; or something in that vein, the book would have been maybe 200 pages shorter, and better. I got the feeling that Gabaldon might have been going more for quantity than overall quality. However, when she hits her writing stride, she is very good, and that made me pick up the book again, skim it until Jamie and Ian realize that the man they pummeled was Roger, and continue reading from there. Overall, I felt that the characters of Brianna and Roger were not developed well, and as a consequence, far less engaging than Claire and Jamie. They were downright annoying at times, and I'm not sure if I would continue reading the series if they became the main characters."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Having read a number of readers' glowing reviews here at Amazon.com about Ms. Gabaldon's time-travel series, I purchased the first book and excitedly set out to read as much as I could in a weekend. I love the concept of time travel, am intrigued by Scotland and its history and was hooked. Only when I ran to a local bookstore for the second book (sorry Amazon, needed to keep reading right away!), looking in the scifi section where I'd seen the whole series initially, did I come to realize that this was a ROMANCE series. *laugh* Not exactly my standard reading material. I admit, it took quite a bit to buy the next book and keep reading but the characters were so appealing I really felt compelled to. The smarmy romance I found slightly annoying until I began to imagine Duncan McLeod of the Highlander TV series (the actor Adrian Paul) in the title role of Jamie... and ... all of a sudden romance wasn't such bad reading material. By the 4th book, I really needed something inspiring to keep reading and I must say, I was disappointed with Drums of Autumn. The work read as though it had been rushed to publication, not nearly as well thought out as the first two in the series, and so my overall rating of the series is a 5. Now, back to Adrian Paul.."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This isn't the best book of the series. The first 500 pages were terrible. After that, I liked it more and more. Brianna and Roger aren't developed, they don't get to my heart like Claire and Jamie do. I almost don't care what happens to them. They're even stupid sometimes. Also, I don't like the predictability. This book was my least favorite in the series by far. I don't how you guys can rate this, &quot;This is the best book I ever read&quot;. Read Gone with the Wind and then let us know how you feel about this one. There aren't enough historical references for me here at all. At least Outlander was well researched. This book could've taken place at anytime and we wouldn't have noticed. The story starts to get worn out and tired after awhile. In Outlander, it was gripping, something was happening every single page. This was a bore....Sorry, Diana. I hope the next one is a winner! And you know I'll be reading it anyway..."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This book has its truly good parts, but quite a bit of it is boring. A big disappointment after the previous books. It's almost as if the two main characters are now together and settled, so the author does not know what to do with them. (Why fairy tales say simply \`They lived happily ever after' - What's more boring than two beautiful people gleefully changing diapers?)"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I have fallen in love with this series. It is well worth allowing yourself to be taken away by the saga. This book moves the story of Claire and Jamie through America.

Another world awaits you here!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I found Outlander one day at the bookstore several years ago when I was looking for something different to read. I read the preview of the book and was immediately intrigued. Since then I have read the three sequels and have thoroughly enjoyed each one. I am an avid reader but I do believe the Outlander series is and probably always will remain my favorite. I have read each book of the series three times and still have not grown tired of them. I look forward to the next in the series! Diana - you do have a way with words"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"My co-workers and I have looked forward with anticipation to the arrival of this book. We have shared and reviewed each book in the saga. Our only complaint is that once it is over we know we will have to wait another year for the next edition. Finishing the book was like saying goodbye to old friends. Drums of Autumn held me spellbound as Claire and Jamie try to make their way in the American wilderness. We cheered Brianna's decision to join her mother and father, and were thrilled when Roger finally followed. We cried for Ian and the family. Brianna's arrival at Lallybroch was like coming home again. We are all dying to read the next book. Our lives will be so dull in comparison"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I just wanted to commend Diana Gabaldon on yet another triumph in her wonderful &quot;Outlander&quot; series...though &quot;Outlander&quot; still remains my favorite.

I lostfurther time to Drums of Autumn, the latest (butalas not greatest) installment.Gabaldon is a highly gifted writer, able topresent a marvellously deep and textured world. Unfortunately, this book lacks thedepth and rich layering of the previous novels.For this, I must indict Gabaldon's editors. Whatis here is vintage &quot;Jamie and Claire&quot;, but thenarrative seems rushed, breathless; hardly morethan an outline.The introduction of Brianna and Roger is perfect,but their story is given short shrift, and onelongs for more detail, more exploration.

She pays great attention to detail and has completly researched her topics and settings.I always come away with a sense of loss when her books are through as though I won't be seeing good friends for a long time to come.I look forward to her next books. I just wish they were going to be out sooner"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I anxiously awaited the debut of this book. It was amazing how the day-to-day life of the characters could be so interesting. The characters seem so real that you find yourself wondering how their lives will be in the next book. I understand it takes awhile to write a book this good, but I wish the author would give a bit more of the old history that happend in previous novels so that I don't have to remember so much detail from a book that I read 2 years ago. Thanks again for a great boo"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Which genre to pigeon-hole the Outlander series into has become a great debate. What it all boils down to is great old fashioned high Romance in the tradition of Sir Walter Scott and R.L. Stevenson, updated for a modern audience. Diana Gabaldon is the person everyone would have wanted seated by the fire in the days before TV and radio. She is a wonderful, imaginative storyteller. Drums of Autumn is a little weaker than Voyager, but seems to set the stage for more to come in the next two books. And after all, how much more physical abuse could Jamie take? Give the man a break. Please don't attempt a movie, it would spoil the fun"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I am a big fan of this series. This book however was a little rough starting. I read at least a good 25% of the book before i really got into it. We saw the whole 'society/pomp and circumstance'thing in Dragonfly in Amber, and it was good in that book, but in this one, it was just irritating. I had to get past those first chapters. It certainly has its dark moments, as do the rest of the books, but i think this one didnt quite have as many shiny moments either. There was sort of a somber tone throughout the whole book. Even when things seem good, they arent that great. Lots of lows, not many highs. I love the way DG keeps revealing layers of Claire and Jamie's relationship, but Bree and Roger arent quite so complex. I really want to get into their story, but its just not as exciting or captivating. I really enjoyed the bits of them in 1960whatever, and i wanted more!This book definitely had some of those moments i dread in books, that ever present blunder!(!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!)Seriously?!?! Bree tells Claire, not only is she Pregnant, but she was raped, at the exact same time Jamie beats the snot out of Roger because he thinks it was him that raped Bree. SO incredibly frustrating for the reader. almost a stereo-typical romance novel plot. One of the reasons i love these books so much is because they are not what you expect, and that part of the plot was rather disappointing.Overall, the book was good, and once i got into it, i read 75% in 3 days. I wouldnt necessarily 'recommend' it right now, but once i finish book 5 and see that this one was just a bridge for the awesomeness of the first 3, then i will recommend it, but ill have to wait until then!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This Book could've been easily 5 stars (IMHO) if Not for two things that more or less *forced* me to give it 4.I'm not going to rehearse the plot, a lot of people already did that wonderfully however I'm going to say what Bugged me the most about this book.First of all, I enjoyed the story well enough even though it kept switching between Jamie & Claire in 18th Century NC and 20th Century Bree & Roger. I didn't mind the Brianna and Roger parts too much it was somehow sweet though not as interesting as Claire and Jamie. I thought Brianna was a tolerable character up till the Stephen Bonnet issue was reviled. That part was *SO* frustrating for me to read about as well as somehow unrealistic.How stupid can someone be to willingly step unprotected and unaccompanied by anyone into a stranger's ship nonetheless only to get raped ? I understand her goal was to retrieve her mother's ring but seriously she could've taken *some* precaution it is the 18th Century we are talking about a simple gun could've saved her all this trouble and then not only does She gets raped but she doesn't tell her mother about it till it's too late and even begs her at one point to not to revile her Rapist's identity to Jamie ? Why ? Because she doesn't want him killed ? Her reasons are beyond stupid and in consequence led to Roger (the love of her life) being beaten brutally and sold to the Mohawks in such a cruel manner for some stupid misunderstanding caused by none other than Bree. Then she gets pregnant and is so convinced the father is Stephen Bonnet. So what does she do ? Go and meet him AGAIN ! You Got to be Kidding me.I failed to feel sorry for Her after a while. It's impossible to believe that Claire (the ever so sensible) is the mother to this whiney/immature/stupid person.Another thing that frustrated me was Stephen Bonnet. As far as Villains goes this guy hasn't much to recommend him. I had *some* respect to past villains in the series who despite their immorality and sometimes *forgive me* perverseness were complex and *had* some intellectual sustain to get them by. If Stephen Bonnet was a *real* person he wouldn't have survived five minutes in the Pirating Business. You are dealing with Gangs and extremely dangerous people who won't hesitate to kill you. It does take more than simply luck to get going in this path. To have him escape from hanging *ONLY* to own a ship and establish himself as a captain who sails from England to the Colonies regularly under the same name is either a sign of how stupid the English authorities are to not have him recognized or how completely unrealistic this is.Stephen Bonnet needed to be Hanged in this book. I know he'll make a reappearance soon however it's not something I'm looking forward to."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I am so glad I've read Drums of Autumn and proved the negative reviewers wrong. I almost decided not to push deeper into the Outlander series, but my addiction won out.Gabaldon keeps me riveted with her incredibly well researched history. Never has an author set a stage so well, thrown out old misconceptions and painted such a grimy yet beautiful picture of life in the 18th century. It is also a pleasure to read about places I've been and the area where my wife was born and raised. I began The Fiery Cross last night.This is fantasy at it's best. Sure, it is a romance novel read by men like me, but it is at it's heart a fantasy. I am a sci-fi and sometimes fantasy reader so I accept the unreality of fantasy. That does not mean the historical settings are any less real. In real life Jamie and Claire would have been dead a dozen times over but fantasy allows them to survive every scrape they find themselves in. Fantasy is Fantasy and Gabaldon is a master of fantasy.Drums is very hard to put down. Whereas I almost dropped Outlander half finished due to a sometimes dragging storyline, Drums moves at a fast pace and presents two parallel story lines that keep you riveted on not just two but now four main characters and their intertwining destinies.History is made with Drums of Autumn. Read it with the prescience that you too will be back for more the moment you finish the last page."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Wow! I've finished book four, Drums of Autumn, and I'll admit, I've got a love-hate relationship with Gabaldon's writing. Talk about an ongoing saga, and the end isn't near... First off, Gabaldon is a phenomenal writer: captivating, creative, humorous, passionate, but on the downside--extremely longwinded. I find it a laborious task to read her writing in its entirety, and I often fail to do so. It's obvious that she takes great pride in researching and accurately depicting the setting and historical information, but in my opinion, it's just too many details about insignificant things. Trust me, I'm hooked into the world of Jaime and Claire. Bree and Roger are proving just as intriguing; however, I find that I have to take breaks from her books to maintain my sanity."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I just discovered Diana Gabaldon's \\"Outlander\\" series a couple of months ago and was eager to continue following Jamie and Claire Frasier as they create a new life for themselves in America. I do agree with other reviewers who say this is the weakest of the series so far and that a little more editing could have made for a shorter read without jeopardizing the story.One of the things I do enjoy about these books is how Gabaldon destroys relationships and invites us to witness how they are repaired. Terrible things happen to these people, and while you might begin to wonder how much pain they can endure, you can't help but admire their perseverance and devotion to one another in the end.My only gripe is that Gabaldon seems to have created an unbelievably small world for her characters in which they cross paths with their own ancestors or those of people they know. In this book it served to pose the question of whether one character's visit to the past helped facilitate his own birth in the future, and while I do enjoy these \\"Quantum Leap\\" hypotheses, the circumstances under which these chance meetings occur (and recur) become too coincidental to be thoroughly believable.I am still looking forward to following the Frasiers and MacKenzies through the rest of their lives together, but for now I'll be taking a much-needed break with some lighter fare."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I do not agree with those reviewers who say this is a \\"weak link\\" in the series or not as good as the first ones. I found this 4th book (another \\"all day sucker\\" at over 1000 pages), to be a richly woven tale with great depth and lots of twists and turns as the story moves to 18th century America several years before the Revolutionary War. And this one not only continues the great love between Jamie and Claire but adds the story of their daughter Brianna and her love Roger. I did find the latter two to be a bit hard to grasp but I did not think Roger to be too much like Jamie as some did. Perhaps it is just that we haven't yet seen enough of Brianna and Roger to feel like we truly understand them. Gabaldon does an extraordinary job of depicting life among the indians and the slaves and the hardships the white settlers faced, particularly in the back country like the Ridge where the Frasers live. There are wonderful pictures of secondary characters that I came to love and expect to see in the remaining volumes. The story of Jamie's nephew Ian becomes one of heart rending interest and likely reflects what may have happened to some in that time. And Lord John Grey is still in the picture as the friendship with Jamie continues. Once again, Gabaldon uses the \\"time travel\\" aspect of Claire's and Brianna's (and Roger's) being 20th century people to show what a change in lifestyle it would be for us to go back and live in that time. Finally, to see all the Scots in America after losing their homeland to England's abuses after Culloden was encouraging even though the reminder they had lost family and clan roots tugged at my heart. Still, as this story drives home, England's loss was America's gain."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This is the fourth in Gabaldon's \\"Outlander\\" series. The Frasier family all ends up in \\"the colonies\\" in pre-revolutionary days.I have good and bad feelings about this book. I am totally caught up in the series and intend to finish it--eventually--through the 6th book (each book runs around 1,000 pages). But this wasn't one of the best. It dragged terribly in spots.One of Gabaldon's strong points is her ability to paint a picture with words...you see, smell and hear the time and place that she is describing. But by the same token, sometimes you just don't care about the bloody smell of the wood or the sound of the birds or the feel of crisp leaves under the foot, when you're desperate to find out what's going to happen next in the story.Also, Brianna Randall-Frasier takes a large part of this story. There is a long part of the book where I wanted to slap her for being such a whiny ninny. But overall, this was another page-turner in the saga of the time-traveling Frasier family."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"We rejoin Jamie and Claire, now in the British colonies in North America but still leading a life as dangerous and adventurous, and as loving, as always. We also see a lot of the next generation, Brianna and Roger, and their struggles to live up to the example of a loving relationship that Jamie and Claire have left them. I smiled almost all the way through this book, just because I love the characters and was so happy to be reading more about them, and was thrilled to see them happy with one another. I also laughed out loud many, many times, and then at other (and less frequent) times, felt genuine horror and sadness. That's how real these characters are, and how well this book is written, that it can evoke such genuine emotion.Even though this book, just like the other books in the series, is around 1000 pages, it was actually very quick for me to read, because I just did not ever want to put it down.I'm much more interested in Scottish history than in American, but then again, I'm much more interested in Jamie and Claire than I am in reading a history book, so it works out just fine. I was less interested in the parts about Bree and Roger, at least until Diana Gabaldon leaves a huge cliffhanger regarding the latter, and I was forced--FORCED, I say--to read ahead just to make sure everything would be OK. Unfortunately, having gotten glimpses of what was to come, my insatiable need to keep reading flagged for an evening, so I don't recommend reading ahead.I wish I had re-read the first three books before reading this one after a break of a couple of years, because I could not remember all the details about their meeting with Geillis Duncan in the third book, which was undoubtedly important. Maybe I'll readVoyager (Outlander)again soon, unless I go ahead and finish the series (is another one coming out soon?), in which case I'll read it after. Or maybe I'll read them all again. Or maybe I'll read the Lord John books first..."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"As far as Outlander novels go, Drums of Autumn is the most bodice-ripperish out of the 4 I've read so far. Mainly, because the entire book is plotted around a MISUNDERSTANDING that could have been resolved with one adult conversation. Oh, how I hate those in romance novels!Here is how it goes. In this installment Claire and Jamie are in America establishing a Scottish colony in North Carolina, of course not without a fair share of difficulties and misfortunes. Two hundred years into future Brianna discovers information that forces her to risk her life and travel back in time in secret to visit her parents and possibly change their destiny. Roger, Brianna's fiancee, follows her and the couple immediately consummate their relationship. A mix-up concerning Roger's identity (specifically, his last name) is what drives the main conflict of this novel. This tiny misunderstanding leads to a series of pretty dramatic events.It's not a secret that while Diana Gabaldon is a great storyteller, she is a weak plotter. She admits so herself, saying that she assembles her book as a puzzle, first writing separate scenes and then piecing them together with a plot. Thus very often her plots are overridden with very unlikely coincidences and sometimes deus ex machina. Drums of Autumn is no exception, but here the entire misunderstanding twist is just way overdone and makes some characters (particularly, to my chagrin, Jamie) act like complete idiots.Another hot button issue for me is this: does every character in the Outlander series have to get raped at some point? There is a new addition to the list of Lord John, Jamie, Claire, and Fergus. I mean, enough already with the sexual abuse! I am sure even 200 years ago not everyone was assaulted, right?Brianna and Roger's relationship is given a lot of screen time in this book. Not sure if I care for these two much and believe in their love. Brianna is a pretty unlikable, spoiled, rash person and a source of almost all misfortunes in the story. And poor Roger. He has to go through a lot of pain and suffering for his love.And the last complaint. For a book of this length (1070 pages!) and with such an extensive use of words like \\"virgin\\" and \\"maidenhead,\\" Drums of Autumn is definitely very light on sex.You might ask why with all these problems I am giving this novel 4 stars? Well, like I said, Gabaldon is a great storyteller. She is so wordy, so descriptive, so in love with the scenes she writes, so self-indulgent to the point, I think, that she doesn't edit out any of her own writing, and yet I am ready to read anything she writes. There is just an addictive, cracktastick quality to her stories. I love being taken on adventure and Gabaldon does just that. I will undoubtedly read the next book, regardless of rapes, deus ex machinas and contrived plots. But can Jamie be not such a possessive dumb-ass in The Fiery Cross though? Pretty please?"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I really love this series of books. This one was a bit harder for me to get into for some reason. Yet, once certain plot twists started happening I couldnt put it down. The only thing is there were certain plot lines that seemed to just drop. So much so I had to go back and re read certain chapters to make sure I wasnt missing anything. If you have not read the book yet, please stop here.. I dont want to ruin anything for you.. so this is kind of a spoiler...........What REALLY happened to Lord John Grey and Willie? You will notice that Gabaldon leaves us with Jaime leaving Willie in the cave waiting for him to come back from being with the Indians, and leaves Lord John Grey with Claire recovering from the Pox. She aggravates me, because she jumped from these stories right into Roger and Brianna and left us wondering what the heck happened to them??? Yes, they come back later in the book, but we know nothing of how they got back home or what prompted them to go back or anything like that. I seriously thought I missed something and had to go back and re read some of the chapters because it bugged me so much that I didnt know what happened to these characters. And what about ( I cant remember his name now) the guy that had gotten angry and scalped the Indians. He went to Claire's and talked with her, but that was it.... where did he go? What happened to him? Maybe I am just missing something? Was it not that big of a deal to everyone else? Just curious. So if I have missed something can someone who has read these books help me out?Thanks!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This is the fourth book in a story that begins when our protagonist enters a circle of stones and falls two hundred years into the past. All four books are incredible, but this fourth one is a mesmerizing, can't-put-down book. It's amazing how Diana Gabaldon sews all of the books together. Having fallen two hundred years into the past, Claire Randall falls in love, deeply, with a Scottish Highlander by the name of Jamie Fraser. Forced to make an agonizing choice to stay in the past or return to her husband, the decision is finally made for her when Scotland goes to war with England, and she escapes back through the stones, narrowly escaping death, leaving her lover/husband behind to face a certain death. Three years have passed since Claire first fell into the past,but she knows she must go, for she is pregnant. Drums of Autumn begins in her present time, where she meets historian Roger Wakefield. Knowing Jamie Fraser to have died on the battlefield in Scotland, she now comes with her grown daughter Brianna to Mr. Wakefield for some research on what happened to some of the rest of the folks she knew and loved back \\"then\\". She had returned to her husband Frank in present day time, but he has since died. They had raised Brianna together, with Frank thinking Claire delusional every time she tried to tell him her story. Now with Brianna grown and Frank dead, Claire, a physician, asks Roger Wakefield to research a list of people she had known in the past, claiming just curiosity of Scottish history. Anxious to know what happened to her many friends and in-laws, she is shocked to know how many, almost all, died on the battlefield, but an even more shocking discovery leads her to tell Briana and Roger Wakefield the whole story. Now Claire must make a wrenching decision, and what she does now will alter Brianna's future forever, and change Claire's life in a way she never thought possible. I could not put this book down. I finished it in the care, and it was so good that I didn't notice until after we'd driven off we had not been stopped at a stoplight, but by the police! (Routine check). This author is gifted, this book and the entire series of books is a must-have."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"With her latest book, Drums of Autumn, Diana Gabaldon continues to enchant us enough to look forward to more in the series which began with Outlander. The story of Claire and Jamie is compelling, but to be truthful, not as compelling as her first three installments. Something is lacking, and I believe it to be the fact that there is no truly dastardly villain such as Black Jack Randall. Also, one can only suspend belief so far when it comes to imagining life in the North Carolina wilderness in the late eighteenth century. Can we accept that Claire, even for the love of this man who is larger than life, can undertake all the chores, e.g. planting, harvesting, cooking, preserving, doctoring the neighborhood, etc., etc., and still have time and energy for a late night romp under the bushes? Besides, when did she learn to do all this?Her daughter Brianna's tragedy is almost glossed over, unlike the rape of Jamie, which was dwelled on with loving detail in previous books. The trials and tribulations of Roger MacKenzie are almost by the way. My favorite, most fully drawn character in this book is John Grey. He is charming, sympathetic and tragic. I keep seeing David Hyde Pierce of Frasier in the role.While I loved Diana Gabaldon's first three novels, I merely liked this one. Enough to read more, but also hoping for more."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"It is dated February 2002. With no doubt the best of intentions, Beverley has managed to give away the entire plot!! Why has this review been given 14 helpful votes?!! I do not understand."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Last night, the inner romantic in me was frog-marched outside with a burlap sack over his head, kicked into a kneeling position above a ditch full of running sewage, then shot in the back of the head before being pushed into the flotsam. The trigger was pulled by none other than Diana Gabaldon.This is a novel for die-hard fans of this series, or for those who have very strong masochistic streaks (and stronger stomachs), as there is nothing remotely interesting or exciting that occurs. We're introduced to two new characters to either love or wish a hellish demise on (depending on your point of view). This is just another fat, flabby, nearly thousand-page exercise on Gabaldon's part in her neverending series about the least likable couple since Adolf and Eva. This is bad enough on its own, but we're now subjected to Claire's daugher as a major character (who I maintain is an adult version of Rosemary's Baby), paired with yet another blithering idiot of a male for a husband to make this novel Hell's delight.The bulk of this exercise takes place in the Carolinas in the 18th Century, occasionally shifting to late 1960s Scotland and Massachusetts, so if you find clearing land and building shacks to be the most fascinating activity at the highest pitch of excitement yet devised by mankind, then you'll absolutely love this novel. There are other tangents that are offered as a way of fleshing out the story, (A bear attack that didn't provoke excitement, but elicited a huge eye-roll on my part as it fell flatter than my grandfather's cardiogram. Jamie and Claire spending a night outside in the middle of winter under a lean-to made of Hemlock branches that annoyed me so much that I wish they'd been stupid enough to make tea out of the Hemlock. Also there's Gabaldon's never-ending humbug about the time-travel circles being drawn out with yet more jargon to pad out a story that should have been told in 50 pages. I swear she gets paid by the word), but they're as interesting as trying to see if there really are 2000 flushes in a 2000 Flush toilet tablet.With the adventure having flat-lined in this story, Gabaldon's writing about the undying devotion and slop between Jamie and Claire elicited yawns on my part as well. Apart from one egregiously bad bout of Jamie and Claire coupling like stoats in the wilds (I defy anybody to defend a line like this: \\"Christ, your mouth is as slick and salty as your qu*m\\" and say that the passage that it's from is worthy of anything other than having dog's abuse hurled at it), Gabaldon manages to keep her passages regarding Jamie and Claire's dancing the mattress two-step to within the acceptable limits of bad taste (apart from Gabaldon's never-ending nipple fixation) that made them merely boring instead of maddening. But........Gabaldon came out of nowhere and landed a right hook on me with Roger and Brianna's first time they thundered the night away like King Hal on honeymoon for its hopelessly risible qualities. Whether it's Brianna's mumphing \\"Mi oing i' i'?\\" (translation: \\"Am I doing it right?\\") as she takes aboard a consignment of British sausage for the first time, or a description which goes \\"Another minute, and he was going off like a waterspout\\", I couldn't help but be amused. Laugh? Why, I laughed so hard that I cried.Even though Gabaldon wrote that above passage which I think is the biggest farce since Chuckles the clown retired, it's still not enough to redeem an abysmally bland and hopelessly adrift book. Calling this the worst book of the series is a rather perplexing problem for me, as trying to pick which of Gabaldon's books is the worst is like trying to decide which manure pile smells the worst. Approach this book only if you're armed with a crucifix, garlic, holy water, and a wooden stake. Even then, you'll still suffer."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I fell in love with Jamie and Clare in the Outlander, and can't wait to read what happens next! I look forward to reading all the books in the series."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Overall great!!!....book was described in it's exact condition...seller shipped immediately and I received the book in only a few days....would definitely buy from this seller again!!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"It took me two years before I was to pick up and read Ms Gabaldon's books, as the notion of reading a time travel romance was off-putting to say the least. However, after much encouragement from a friend, I finally took the plunge. To date, I have not come up for air. I haven't read anything this good since James Herriot (All Creatures Great and Small). Speaking of James, Diana creates wonderful character's, and James and Claire are no exception. My life has not been the same since reading the Outlander series, and I often find myself reflecting on the lives and times of her character's. Her books are so good, that it is heartbreaking to finish them. And so, upon finishing her fourth book, Drums of Autumn, I turned right around and started the series all over again. I eagerly await her fifth book, The Fiery Cross, which continues the story of Jamie and Claire. Thankyou Ms Gabaldon, for providing me with a safe sanctuary to go to on rainy days."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Although I loved this book every bit as much as the three previous, I was dissappointed with it,...but only because I knew it was the last in the series, and that I would miss the characters. They became so REAL to me,........."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I enjoyed the Outlander series, and read the first three books in about two weeks. This fourth book is an unnecessary continuation of the series. For lovers of Claire and Jamie's story, it would have been best to end the series after Book 3.The newly evolving characters don't make a lot of sense, and seemed to move between centuries so easily, adapting without any trouble at all. The storyline didn't seem historical, and seemed like a modern story happening in the 18th century.I kept hoping it would improve towards the end, but I was disappointed. I'll keep my memories of the move to America as the start of a new life for Jamie and Claire, and read no more of this series."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Truly beyond expectation and Diana has raised the bar of what you can expect from her! She is a true artist. Love, adventure, history, family, loyalty, betrayal......and the greatest of these is love. Men really love this series. It speaks to men and women alike. You feel like you are actually a part of the lives of Jamie and Claire!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I guess it had to happen, but hope against hope, I thought here was one writer who could sustain her readers' interest throughout the entire series. Well, dear reader, it turns out she is just another &quot;romance writer&quot;--a term she hates. I, too, was enchanted by the first three novels in this series, but this one is so very disappointing--Brianna's a jerk, Roger is a wimp and Jamie-alas!-just another boorish character who resorts to violence. The use of the standard &quot;bodice-ripper&quot; devise of creating a situation where the young lovers have a mis-understanding, are separated for most of the book, and then re-unite at the end was too trite for words. And Claire! Where is her fire, her passion, her independence! All now reduced to a haus frau! I think Ms. Gabaldon has too many irons in the fire-a book edited by her on writings by mothers and daughters is due out soon. She threatens to leave her loyal readers of the Outlander series hanging while she starts another series. (See her web page.) For God sakes-quit milking the cash cow and give your readers what they deserve-a great ending to a (sometimes) superior series."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"As promised in previous reviews, I will also keep this one short, sweet and to the point.Firstly, I must state that this volume HAS to exist.Bree and Roger have appeared in the previous books, but their links to this tale have not been forged as strongly, simply because the story had not yet required it to do so.Well .... in this one they bring it home and finally become important players in the Outlander series.I adore Roger - and personally, without him, Bree would be too big'a chunk to swallow sometimes. (Another itty-bitty reason this volume needed)Again, as I have said in previous reviews - this one cannot be missed if you are intending to follow the tale to the end.Get into it people - there is plenty more to follow.Cheers - Jo"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Gabaldon, again, weaves a wonderful story of adventure for Jamie and Claire. Those two names evoke a feeling of such excitement. I was happy to see them settle into domestic bliss, after seveal novels of constant turmoil, peppered with calm interludes. Gabaldon is so true to Jamie and Claire, I am rarely surprised by what they do. It's a cozy familiarity. Her ability to drag up past characters creates an intimate world of criss crossed lives and intermingled plot lines. I love that Claire always finds her medical niche, with her infamous box of herbs. And Jamie has his kilt back! I'm not sure why, but the descriptions of the kilts in the earlier books was just fscinating. I loved hearing all of the uses for the wool. Symbolicly, to me it also means that everything is right in the world - Jamie in a kilt. SPOILER - I was thrilled that Jamie finally got to meet Bree. I know this is fiction, but I was stupidly happy over it. I thoroughly enjoyed the story line with Bree and Roger."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The Outlander series has been one of the most interesting and riveting reading investments I have made this year. I have loved all of the novels I've read thus far, especially Voyager. Now that I have read Drums of Autumn, the fourth book of what will apparently be a six-book series, it appears that the wonderful reading investments will continue, although I wasn't as riveted with this one as I was with its three predecessors. Drums of Autumn takes a bit of a break from Claire and Jamie Fraser and focuses more on their offspring Brianna and her significant other Roger. Brianna and Roger discover an old newspaper clipping in which states that Jamie and Claire die in a fire, so Brianna decides to visit the old stone circle that transports her to pre-Revolutionary America without telling Roger. Her intention is to attempt to change the course of history and save her parents' lives. Jamie and Claire are living normal lives in North Carolina after deciding to abandon the chaotic Scotland and all of the casualties that occurred during the Jacobite Rising. Brianna is happy to be with her parents and spending time with them, but will she be able to return to 20th Century? And will she ever see Roger again? There are various twists throughout the novel.Once again, Gabaldon regales the reader with a historically rich tale that makes you feel as though you had been around during that time frame. The backdrop of North Carolina in the 18th Century sounds beautiful. The Colonial times have always fascinated me and reading about that period, especially before the Revolution, was very insightful and enjoyable. And I loved reading about how Jamie and Claire got there and built their lives away from Scotland. In fact, all of the chapters centered on Jamie and Claire were wonderful and riveting as usual. But I agree with the reviewer who stated that their relationship is a little too perfect now. I like them when they are facing adversities and conquering dilemmas with a love that transcends time, war and all sorts of obstacles. I enjoyed their love story of old, especially in Voyager. And I have to add that Brianna and Roger aren't quite as memorable or as interesting as Jamie and Claire. Brianna is somewhat one-dimensional and doesn't bring anything new to the story. As for Roger, I like that he's a descendant from one of the members of the MacKenzie clan who happens to be one of Jamie's cousins, and he does have a spark to him that I like. However, he is not Jamie, and reading about him and Brianna has left me cold. Perhaps I am being biased because I love Jamie and Claire so much, but Brianna and Roger don't transmit the same sort of passion and fire that their older counterparts do. As for the other characters, there are some new ones that are colorful and wonderful to read, which keeps the story from lagging too much. But, as I already said, the new couple doesn't quite do it for me. And that is why Drums of Autumn isn't quite as unputdownable (not a real word, I know) as the previous three and that is why I take away a star. I felt the impatience of reading the 800-plus pages of the trade paperback book this time, unlike with the other books. I nevertheless loved it and cannot wait to pick up The Fiery Cross."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I NEVER read romance books, and after Gabaldon's books were recommended to me, I was more than a little leary when the clerk led me down the romance aisle. I'm a writer myself--mostly southern literary fiction--and the way Gabaldon molds her characters and designs the plots prove that these books are not bodice-ripping romances, although Claire's bodice does get ripped several times. All the books are a melding of historical fiction, literary fiction and mainstream. Having Scottish ancestry, I have had my interest piqued regarding Scotland just from reading these books, especially Outlander. The concept of time travel sort of makes one consider the possibility of that occurrence. My great-grandmother was a french immigrant, and although I've never been in a formal french class, I can read french enough to get the main idea and can speak it somewhat. So Gabaldon makes the reader consider the possibilities of supernatural things. The only complaint I have is that there seems to be so many things which happen to Jamie and Claire--one right after the other--which are bad, that I'd like to go along for awhile and see them living a happy family life with somewhat of a twist in plot. Otherwise,these books are destined to become classics!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Once again, Diana Gabaldon has transported readers back into the rich historical background of the 18th century. The setting has switched abruptly from Scotland in the midst of a rising to the American colonies on the brink of revolution. With the change of setting, though, the style of this fourth book in the series has also changed. Outlander, Dragonfly, and Voyager all had huge complex plots filled with feeling, excitement, and grandeur, and they were written with intelligence; altogether, they left me awed. Drums, though, seems more like a novel composed of random ideas thrown together and hastily shaped into some semblance of a complete story, without the necessary links between each new idea. Also, the characters aren't as well developed and aren't as easily likable--Brianna seems spoilt and unforgiving, Jamie overprotective and stern, without much in common with the boyish, perceptive openly-honest man he was before. It's still written with the same humor and distinct &quot;Gabaldon voice,&quot; though, so it's anything but a flop. Just one piece of advice for prospective Outlandish readers--don't let Drums be the first book in this series that you read"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"About a hundred pages into Outlander, the first book of author Diana Gabaldon's unique historical romance series with a time travel twist, I was hooked. In Claire and Jamie Fraser, Gabaldon has created compelling, unique characters, and the sparks from their relationship virtually fly off the pages.When we last left Claire and Jamie at the end of book three, Voyager, they had survived a shipwreck which had left them in the American colonies. Drums of Autumn opens with the couple preparing to make a home for themselves in the New World. Just as the Frasers are beginning to find their place in 1767, the book flashes forward to present-day--1969, that is--and their daughter, Brianna, left alone in Boston when her mother returned to the past to reunited with her true love. Although Brianna has the support of Roger Wakefield, who is clearly besotted with her, she is still struggling to come to terms with the loss of the only father she ever knew, who she loved deeply, and another father who she has never met, a conflict that has major implications for the plot of this sequel.The story continues to flash between these two settings, and this is where I thought the book started to feel weighed down. I've always thought that the Outlander series was at its best when it featured Claire and Jamie; although the scenes between Brianna and Roger were interesting, they felt like a distraction after awhile. In addition, Gabaldon uses a writing technique here not employed in her other books: there are times when Claire is featured in the scene, yet the scene is NOT told from the first person perspective. Given that the reader was always given Claire's first-person point of view in the prior Outlander novels, this felt like an unnecessary gimmick to me.Finally, at 1070 pages, this book felt overlong to me. I don't mind long novels when they are engaging, but I definitely felt bored throughout much of the middle of this book; I think I would've enjoyed it much more if sharper editing had been employed. Still, I like these characters enough to care what happens to them next, so I am sure that I will still go on to read the next book the series. My final rating is 3 1/2 stars--just be sure to read the three preceding books in the series before attempting to tackle this one."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I've recently finished reading the entire series.

Though I am a great fan of romances, most can be summarized quite easily (guy meets girl, there's an attraction, followed by a misunderstanding, then finally things are sorted out and the man confesses his love). Diana Gabaldon's series is so much more! This story is so engrossing that I'd be surprised to find anyone who hasn't enjoyed it.

I consciously decided to take my time on Drums of Autumn to ensure that I didn't confuse characters and muddle up story lines. In fact, it took me 6 months to read this book, and I really, really enjoyed it. The smaller stories within the book were so riveting this time. For the first time since starting this series, I am chomping at the bit to start the next book.The only reason I gave this one four stars instead of five was the length of this book. I would have felt satisfied finishing about 3/4 of the way through. But otherwise, it was a great read."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Diana Gabaldon takes us back in time into the lives of Jamie and Claire. The author as usual does her research on the topics and settings and when the story unfolds you can feel the detail descriptions she portrays to the scenes, the attire, and characters. I thought Drums of Autumn was a wonderful book and I look forward (I'm a little late to this author) to her next book in the series. I highly recommend this romantic and adventurous story."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Loved it!!! These characters reach out and invite you into their lives, loves, hurts. I can get enough of this series!!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Let me first say the Outlander Series is the best collection of books I've ever read. However Drums of Autumn was not my favorite of the series. After reading Voyager that was non-stop action and romance, DOA slowed down quite a bit and focused more on the relationship between Claire and Jamie's daughter Brianna and her relationship with Roger McKenzie. Unfortunately I couldn't seem to ever care for these two as much as I had Jamie and Claire. Of course the book still had breathtaking and suspenseful moments and Diana Gabaldon is a master storyteller. The place and time of this book had special interest to me because my ancestors immigrated from Scotland and Ireland along this time period and came to GA through the NC mountains. It was interesting to learn how many southern customs and traditions came to be. Even though not as good as the first three, still a wonderful book and a must read to continue the series."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":". In this fourth volume of her time travel/romance series, Gabaldon continues the adventures of Claire and Jamie Fraser. Shipwrecked on the coast of the American colonies, Claire and Jamie are making their way to North Carolina where many Scottish exiles have settled after serving time as indentured servants. They are faced with the task of making a life in the wild, untamed American wilderness menaced by hostile Indians, bear, venomous snakes and disease. But Claire and Jamie rise to the challenge. Jamie accepts the offer of the Carolina governor to start a settlement on a beautiful mountain that will soon be known as \\"Fraser's Ridge\\" which he hopes to fill with former fellow Scottish prisoners from Ardsmuir. But their lives are disrupted by the sudden appearance of their beloved daughter Brianna whom they believed to be safely settled in the future. Brianna has risked her life to find Jamie and Claire to warn them that they are destined to die in a terrible fire in less than eight years. Although filled with joy to have Brianna join them, the Frasers are terrified by the dangers that colonial America provides to a young woman. Following from the future is her lover and Claire's friend, Roger Wakefield, a Scottish historian who has fallen in love with Brianna. Roger is the only man able to use the mysterious stones to travel to the past because he is the descendant of the witch Geilie, Claire's nemesis. As usual, Gabaldon has crafted a lusty, exciting tale that propels the reader at a lightning pace through bear attacks, hangings, mystical encounters with ghosts and lots and lots of juicy sex. At its heart, this is after all, a romance series, so the fiery passionate scenes between Claire and Jamie are still just as urgent and descriptive as Gabaldon's other volumes in the series. It's refreshing to have a pair of middle-aged protagonists who still find delight in each other. However, I do concede that by this volume, Gabaldon's plot formulas sometimes wear thin. Her reluctance to end the series that is already many thousands of pages, means that Gabaldon often repeats plot devices like the resurrection of a supposedly dead character or the amazing coincidences that sometimes drive the story. Still, the book is entertaining."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I have never read anything better than the Daina Gaboldon series! I look at my life differently, in fact I look at everything differently. Of course I'm in love with Jamie as so many others. I don't know if I would want a movie to be made...No, No I don't. I will from here on in spend the rest of my life looking for my Jamie. Thanks and hats off to you Diana!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Diana, you did it again! I can't get enough of Jamie, Claire and the whole damn clan!! I've recommended your books to EVERYONE I know and you're characters are regular topics of happy-hour conversations now. Keep 'em coming, Diana!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The entire 'Outlander' series is wonderfully romantic. Diana Gabaldon writes with such passion and heart that the reader actually feels a part of the story. I am now in the process of re-reading the 4 existing books for the 3rd time. I am eagerly awaiting with bated breath the continuation of this series...waiting to re-enter the lives of the beloved Jamie and Claire. Once again, absolutely stellar!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"With each succeeding book in the series, I think the author cannot possibly do a better job, but she always pleasantly surprises me with her ability to write an interesting story about very human characters. Each time I finish a book, I experience a few days of depression since I have, in effect, just lost two very dear friends ... at least until the next book in the series is published. I think that's why the books are so very good, because the characters aren't just words on paper ... in your imagination, they actually become living, breathing people and you feel that you know them inside and out. Better yet, you CARE for them! Anyone who doesn't enjoy these books has something very wrong with them!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I too must say that I was a bit dissapointed with this book, especially with the character development of Roger and Brianna (annoying!) and the contrived ending. However, this book still has some very good parts and is worth a read. I hope that the next book in the series will be more representitive of what we know Ms. Gabaldon can do. Some more focus on characters such as John Grey and Willie or a change of scenery would be nice in future books. Colonial America didn't seem too interesting, although the colonial North American setting had potential( but I DON'T want to read about the american revolution!). I'd like to see them go back to Europe (please!) or go to another colony."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"To anyone who didn't like this book-you must be crazy. I count this series as the best 4 books I have ever read and recommend them to friends all the time. Yes, there are still some questions left unanswered (like why was Jamie haunting Claire in the beginning of Outlander). But, that's why we can't wait for the next installment."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I liked this book but didn't like it as well as the first 3 books in this series. I didn't like Brianna and Roger. I guess I am having a hard time accepting Jamie and Claire getting older too. I felt there wasn't as much time spent on Jamie and Claire as Brianna and Roger which I didn't like. I'm hoping there will be a book 5 out because there are still some unanswered questions. Like how did Jamie kill Randall? Or did he? What happened to Jamie's son? I'll be looking forward to my questions answered."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Enjoyed the continuing romance of Jamie and Claire.....would have liked more relationship development with &quot;kids&quot; prior to their increased responsibilities....some plot aspects seemed harsh.....can't always get a happy ending......how much longer until book 5 comes out.....I'd be happy to help out with the plot!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I really like Ms. Gabaldon's books. Reading her books are like meeting a friend you haven't seen in two years.You don't need an introduction, just pick up the book and find out what your old friends &quot;JAmie and Claire&quot; have been up to.&quot;Outlander&quot; was my favorite and &quot;Voyager my least favorite.I really enjoyed &quot;Drums&quot; because of the feeling of warmth of the main characters.Again I have to wait to find out about Briana and the baby.Keep writing -Diana-QUICKLY."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"...with the potential of a new direction for the next generation. A young couple, starting out with their history of the future(?) the Revolution ahead of them (or is it behind them?!?) -- looks like a gathering of strength to start the next saga. Maybe this single book one wasn't a 10, but if you take all 4 as a whole (just divided so the huge story is in manageable-sized volumes), it's an inescapable fact that Ms. Gabaldon has given many of us an immense amount of reading pleasure. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Jamie gets to meet his daughter! Good story and I still love the relationship between Jamie and Clair."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"&quot;Drums of Autumn,&quot; the fourth novel in Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series, continues the adventures of eighteenth-century Highlander Jamie Fraser and his time-travelling twentieth-century wife Claire. Recently arrived in the American colonies after the shipwreck that ended &quot;Voyager,&quot; Jamie and Claire, along with Jamie's nephew Ian, make their way to the mountains of western North Carolina to establish their new home (after the requisite meetings with relatives, bandits, and other assorted colorful characters). Meanwhile back in 1969 Boston, their daughter Brianna makes a horrible discovery about her parents' demise and decides to journey back in time herself to prevent that. She is followed by Roger Wakefield, the dashing Scottish historian, who always shows up a little too late to prevent the headstrong Brianna from getting into major trouble.Brianna and Roger are the two major reasons I did not enjoy &quot;Drums of Autumn&quot; nearly as much as the other books. They are in many ways the typical couple to be found in historical romances--Brianna is at once whiny and stubborn, while Roger is overbearing. Gabaldon uses the classic (and annoying) romance devices of miscommunication and &quot;whose child is this?&quot; to further their story along. Jamie and Claire are, as always, great characters, but Gabaldon's tendency of making sure every bad event has closure (and good ones as well, since she drags in John Gray and Jamie's son Willie) stretches thin the already thin suspension of disbelief necessary to make the time-travel idea work. Overall, Gabaldon's work is miles above other romance writers (and, at heart, these books are romances), but &quot;Drums of Autumn&quot; is definitely the weakest in the series."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The only really great book of Gabaldon's was Outlander or \\"Cross Stitch\\" and it certainly got my emotions up. I flung the damned book accross the room at the ridiculousness of the wolf scene. It was just too much but that was close to the end of the book and I was already hooked. It became one of my favorite books. I loved the characters and read the next 2 books and they were very enjoyable but not new or great, just good. This fourth book I read and barely got through. Claire and Jamie by this point are no longer interesting and the erotica are the only interesting points and I don't pick up a 900 page book for erotica (bad at that). What stupid scenarios are in this book. I couldn't like Briana and what's his name, idiot or the situations they got into. 'In the fronteer you leave a woman unprotected?' He is a historian for **##* sake. It dragged a lot and didn't really have a good plot or direction and the adventure had died.I did finally get through this book hoping that it would improve to at least half of the 2nd or 3rd books enjoyability. The only thing that it did was continue the story. The next book was even worse if you can believe it and after a 1/3, I ended up skimming through to get the story. I haven't even opened the 6th because of the 4th and 5th. It was given to me Christmas a year ago. It did get better reviews but I just couldn't handle another waste of time like the 4th or 5th book just to see where these characters were going."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Sometimes I wonder what book the \\"reviewers\\" here actually read. Complaints of changing diapers (one line at the end of the book) or that the series takes a turn and deals mostly with Brianna and Roger (First 500 pages is 90% in the past). What you\`ve read 400 pages of this novel and feel you need to share? Save it. If you pick up the book open to the last page and see the number up top is 1070 and complain that it\`s \\"wordy\\", you\`re an idiot. While the first three books had a new peril every 25 pages, this tome includes the same great writing and is at a slower pace, but the banter between Jamie and Clarie is still satisfying. Claire and Jamie have this wonderful insite and a sense of mirth about their daily lives now in the New World. Brianna finally meeting James? I read that page three times. Lord John Grey is a fantastic character and comes alive on two special occasions (...to all that put major spoilers in your reviews without warning may you die twice). If your a fan of the series the Fiery Cross awaits and I for one can\`t wait to start it. There is no silly Mr.Willouby or Rev. Jack the Ripper revelations only and great style of writing with deep characters and engrossing dialoge that will have you fall in love with the entire family."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This book is just not as good. I loved Claire's story with Jamie. And for that reason, Outlander is still my absolute favorite in this series, and one of my all-time favorite books. Unfortunately, as the series has progressed, Claire's story has become lost.This book was primarily about Brianna and Roger, who are flat characters and not that interesting. The manner in which the perspectives switched from Claire's first person narration to third person with everyone else interrupted the flow of the book and was annoying.Furthermore, the plot was not as exciting as the other three books I have read thus far. I think I would recommend stopping at Voyager (with the caveat that I haven't read Fiery Cross or Breath of Snow and Ashes)."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Diana Gabaldon's Scots romances are unparalleled. In this 4th book, she shows her ability to keep aging characters strong and interesting and introduces new blood to the plot lines. The character studies remain the strength of her book, although Clare's daughter comes off a little stupid in this one. Diana trades the Highlands for Colonial America giving a fresh glimpse into pre-revolutionary war pioneer life."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I love the Outlander series and I devoured this book as quickly as the others. But, for the first time, I felt that the story was running out of steam. The novel introduces the time travel thing again, this time it is Roger and Brianna who make the leap into the Eighteenth Century to hunt for Jamie and Claire. This is where the book was a real cliffhanger as the reader cannot wait to read the reunion between Jamie and Brianna.It then stumbles for the last third waiting for its resolution. I will not say why since anyone who has not read the book would kill me! I think it is right that the focus has now moved on to Brianna and Roger but their love story has not been as well fleshed out as that of Jamie and Claire. However, if you love the Outlander books, you are not gonna care a hoot - you will love this and will not be able to put it down until it is over."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"If the size of the books makes you apprenhensive or you would like to revist them, you might try the unabridged Books on Tape read by Davina Porter. I looked at the size of the books and thought I don't have time to read that long a book, let alone all 6 of them, yet people were raving about how good they were. I found the unabridged versions at the library and Davina Porter made them come to life with the English and Scottish accent. I don't know of any books on tape that I have enjoyed more. So far I have listened to the first four and am axniously awaiting &quot;The Fiery Cross&quot;. If you have time to read them, they are great but the unabridged version on tape is outstanding. You get so wrapped up in the story, you can't believe when you reach the end as you still want more. Hopefully Amazon.com will be able to offer the unabridged versions sometime in the future as I notice all they offer now is the abridged."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I can't wait...I just can't. It sort of makes me wish that I hadn't started the first one until the last one was written. Drums was excellent, as I knew it had to be. Diana Gabaldon should have started her writing career earlier! I don't think any saga has ever caught my attention and kept it like Jamie and Claire's. I have laughed, cried, gotten mad and stamped my feet. It's as if these characters are my family. I still love Lynn Kurland's books, because they are funny and more lighthearted and are excellent reads when Ms. Gabaldon doesn't have a new one out! I am a forever fan and will surely read anything that Gabaldon writes from now on."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"My favorite historical fiction novel of the last year or two is Outlander, followed by The Triumph and the Glory, and then Drums of Autumn. The appeal of this genre is the transportation of the reader to other times and places with style and compelling realism, and the Gabaldon accomplishes this task in fine fashion. Next on my list is Voyager!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"You laugh, you cry, you celebrate. This next book in the series will keep you guessing as to what will happen,"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Loved this book, yet again.

While this is the first in the series that did not get a 5 rating from me, I still wasn't disappointed. I've got a couple things I think make the story a little different that the first 3. My first thing is that Jaime and Claire have almost settled down it seems. Besides the Indians and living in the complete wild, there doesn't seem to be as much danger or intrigue as before. It's not really a bad thing, it's just a change of pace that you aren't really ready for. And funny, I never thought myself as the harlequin romance type, I kind of missed that all out passion that Jaime and Claire have. It's kind of absent in this book (not so much the feeling but that act). And last, I didn't like Brianna in the past. She's a modern young women who refuses to acknowledge that her ideals do not really have place in the 1700's. Claire seemed to step right into that past and find her place. I think Brianna will be ok, but only because she will be surrounded by those who know or come from the future as well.Now, all that being said, I still really liked the book. I love the history that is woven in. I think it's admirable how Jamie and Claire carve a niche out for themselves in the colonies. All this while trying to keep themselves in the background to avoid any political ties because they know they aren't far from the Revolution. I liked the dealings with the Indians. I learned a few things I didn't know and shed some light on things I really wouldn't have understood. It still beautifully written even if it can seem a bit long. I will be looking forward to the next in the series!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Great used book in a wonderful series. Good service, excellent price, quick delivery. If you haven't discovered books by Diana Gabaldon, you are missing a rich reading experience.

An author of extraordinary vision and THE storyteller of our time.Thank you, Diana!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I wasn't sure if I was going to like Drums of Autumn after reading the reviews here, but I loved it. I thought it was just as good as the 1st and 3rd book and way better than Dragonfly in Amber. I found myself reading about Claire and Jamie and enjoying it, but wanting to skim through to get to Brianna. I really enjoyed reading about Brianna and fell in love with her character! I also enjoyed Brianna and Roger when together, but I did not enjoy just reading about Roger. I love to read about Jamie and can't seem to get enough of him, but Roger bores me and those 10 or so chapters telling his story were so boring to me! I actually skipped the part where he was on the ship and read a few chapters ahead and then went back and read it....although I should have just skipped it because I missed nothing at all. I was also a little bored with all the indian stuff. I wished Ian would not have stayed with them and became one of them. I really wanted to see Ian and Lizzy fall in love...oh well. Besides those few boring parts though I loved everything else. I loved Brianna getting to meet Jamie! I can't wait for book five!Spoiler: I also really loved that she surprised us with the baby...and the rape. I had forgotten all about Brianna even running into Bonnett and seeing the ring until she said the baby isn't Roger's...and then preceeded to tell Claire what happened to her. What a surprise! Even though I was not happy about it...it was definately a shocker!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I have found that all of Gabaldon's Outlander series to be just a good read! She writes with such descriptive quality as to make one \\"see\\" where she is and what is unfolding before your eyes. The love story between Jamie and Claire makes one become breathless at their love scenes, and yet, become somewhat melancholy at the depth of love these two people have for each other. A love and understanding only to be dreamt of! She tells a story both of love and history, that at the end of each chapter, one feels compelled to continue...just one more chapter! I am a woman possessed with her story."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I am rereading all of the Outlander series and enjoying every minute.

There were some great moments, and it sometimes made me laugh. But, unlike the other three, this was extremely slow. It almost felt like a filler, with its only purpose to set you up for the next one. I am happy I read it, because I love Jamie and Claire and their story.

They strike a cord that makes look forward to Drums in Autumnand most like the MANY more after that!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Fortunately, like Claire, I can travel through time which allows me to meet the November 15th deadline which you have in your review guidelines on this book. Ms. Gabaldon's triple whammy--excellent historical research, contineously fast-pased plot, and endearingly realistic characterization make this book definitely worth our wait. You can really lose yourself in her books, and the length of them makes for a wonderful reading experience. Worth the times"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Anything with romance, mystery and suspense is worth my while, and let me tell you, Diana Gabaldon provides us with that and much, much more. She brilliantly paints us a picture, so real her characters are people we know intimately and would recognize on the street. The facinating history of that time period in Scotland was a big PLUS as well. I've just got to ask . . . . has anyone thought of making a mini-series or movie from the Outlander books??? I can just see it. Who would play Claire? Who would play Jamie? Watch the tv series &quot;Highlander&quot; sometime and tell me what you think of it's main character &quot;Duncan McCloud&quot;. He'd make a great Jamie if we could dye his hair red. I'd love to hear from other lovers of Diana's books and also receive recommendations for books that are similar"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Haven't read it yet but the rest of her books have been outstanding. The sort of books that make you want to take a vacation and just settle down and read all day. May she have a long and productive life"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I obviously have not had the opportunity to read Diana Gabaldon's newest book, but am eagerly awaiting its release. I have read the 3 others in the series and loved everyone of them. As to any complaints about the great gap between release dates, I can only say that I understand the amount of time and effort it takes to create great fiction. I'm sure it will be worth the wait. As a recent graduate of history, with a great love for Scottish history, Galbaldon's books invite readers, who otherwise would never pick up a history book, to visit a time that is filled with so much color, tragedy, and romance. I commend Gabaldon on her attention to great detail...it is the HISTORIC DETAIL along with beautiful writing that has made me a true addict of this series"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The parts of the book that I have read from the internet are brilliant, just as the rest of the series has been.The major complaint of myself, and the network of people to whom I have recommended the series, is the long time between books in the series in Australia.How is it that the peices on the net are date 1994 &amp; 1995?The story is interested and well written, and although those lacking imagination, may question the travelling through stones, the story itself is riveting."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. I didn't read the previous books in this series, but had no trouble following the story. I found the historical descriptions and the Scottish connection fascinating. I've always thought of time-travel stories as a little hokey, but Ms. Gabaldon is such a good story teller she makes it work. This was a good and comfortable read. A very long book, but it still seemed over too soon."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"If only History had been taught in schools the way Ms Gabaldon manages to tell it! I guarantee there would be boys more interested in learning - Jamie as a role model going from young Scot to treasonous activist to prisoner to pioneer - and Claire moving from a simple wife and mother (if ever there was such a thing!!) to a time traveller and pioneer would be a role-model for any young woman searching to find her way!I LOVED all of the books in this series and was lucky enough to find three of them in one go - the pain of waiting for Drums was immense, and now I find myself in the same position as many - waiting with baited breath for the next epic. I find myself feeling for the characters, laughing, crying, hoping and dreaming. The sensitive way in which Ms Gabaldon deals with Bree's rape by Stephens, the love between Bree and Roger which mirrors Claire and Jamie - it fills the heart. I will never part with my copies of these books - when loaned out, they are jealously guarded, but I feel it is almost a duty to introduce other people to these amazing books.Diana - you have my heartfelt thanks for providing books that defy description."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The story of Claire and Jamie will go down as being a classic - the story continues with its usual breathtaking pace and realism, and a great twist at the end. Oh to know such people and such feeling that they have - a romance without being slushy, adventure, historic yet a very modern feel to it - who could ask for more - except more of the same please. A definite winner."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Yes I'm obsessed with these books! The only thing that makes Drums of Autumn a 9 and not a 10 is I had to read Voyager to get this far. What great fun. On a bad writing day , her work is miles beyond most novelists best attempts. It's a crime to classify these as romance novels. Not many authors can write to make you want to reread a paragraph just to revel in it's construction; or make you say aloud &quot;Ohh that was wonderful.&quot; I am even more impressed with her skill as a writer when I consider that it's tough enough to create good characters for a developing story line, but it's even harder to take existing personalities and weave a story around them that fits. Her pros are matched only by her inventive characters. It's wonderful to read books where the hero is not perfect. Both Claire and her man fall short of perfect and Diane G. is great at giving them flaws. All I can say to those who did not like this book is it just too bad people aren't always what you want them to be, but that's what makes them human. I find myself often thinking of these people and I wont tell you how often I've reread these books. Until she publishes again, all I can do is imagine how their lives must progress in the 18th century. This is dangerous only because I can not possibly imagine it right, just as one can not possibly imagine loosing her virginity correctly. But I listen to Oldies stations (the 60's) thinking what songs Roger might sing to Brianna when they are alone and he wants to make her happy. Or what Brianna might construct on their farm that shouldn't be there. I am interested not only in the plot to these books but also in the people she creates therein. I hope her next book brings all her characters back strong. I did miss having Fergus cut out so abruptly. After all, he was the only child Jamie actually had a hand in raising. As to anyone who thinks this would be good movie material.... Forget it. No movie could ever get it half right! I can't wait to read more of this series, but I can wait long enough for Ms. G. to get it all down right."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I, not being one who reads lengthly books nor romances for that matter, fell in the depths of this series rather quickly. &quot;Outlander&quot; was introduced to me by a friend of mine whom use to roll her eyes and laugh whenever I mentioned lavendar oil, and I simply had to find out what this small thing about lavendar oil she had. Not knowing what to expect, I was skeptical, but that was soon put to ease. This series is does a wonderful job of exploring the trendils of Scotthish History, along with a bit of French, West Indies, and pre-revolutionary American History, with the tied in web of two lovers - James Fraser and Claire. Thrown together by time and war, they fall into the depths of love. Torn apart by blood and hate, and a unborn child, they battle their lives seperated by 200 years, once again back together in passion that could dispell even Muspell's fires, they struggle for their lives, living with the love and seperation of their daughter, and their guilt of things done during the 20 years apart. Finally to settle in America before the Revolotionary War, making new friendships with Natives, and bears and skulls (grin). And to be reunited with their lost daughter Brianna. (whom also has a heated romance with a Roger MacKenzie, that is quite interesting in itself). Through a few family feuds (mostly between Brianna and stubborn Jamie) the series ends leaving you longing for more, and with a dreamy smile upon your face. I will not say the series is flawless, because it's not, but I truely do recomend this series to anyone who wants to escape reality and forget everyones' existance, even for only a few hours at a time."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Outlander, given to me by a friend......she hasn't gotten the first three books back yet....I LOVED them....I read each of the first three books w/in a three week time period......and Drums in less than a week......I would stay up 'late' at night to read. Her choice of words make you feel like each character is speaking to you......between the magic, romance, history and humor..I think anyone would love these books. I had never read a 'romance' novel before.........and although these are not truly classified as romance, I do not think I would read any other author BUT Diana........It's really a 'must try' book for people that are hestiatant to read 'romance'..."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"After reading some of the other reviews (which I did not do until after I finished the book), I realize that my feelings are shared by many. While I devoured this book like I did the previous three, I felt at times that I was just &quot;reading to be reading&quot;. I wasn't really the whole book which made me feel that way, just parts. I know that with any series, a reader starts to predict and forcast events and actions. I think I got caught doing this a lot. For example, I pictured Brianna to be EXACTLY like her father. Well, she wasn't, and it was probably a bit unrealistic to think she would be. She is female, and Claire was very different from Jamie. Anyway, I still love the series and look forward to the next book..."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"It is not easy to have Jamie and Claire growing older. I was hoping that the book would draw us to Brianna and Roger the same way we were drawnto Jamie and Claire. I was expecting the same level of passion that Jamie and Claire had always had. I found John Grey to be a very interesting and diverse. Diana Gabaldon is a great romance novelist. I hope the demand for the book did not pressure her to finish &quot;Drums&quot;sooner than she would have liked. We are anxiously awaiting the next book, however, we will wait longer if it is necessary!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"When I read the first 3 books in the series I became so entrenched in the story that it stayed with me for days. &quot;Drums&quot; doesn't have the same pull, there is no passion between Claire and Jamie. They say the right words but we don't feel the internal flip flops, the gut wrenching emotion that kept us desperately seeking more, more!A lot of missed opportunity too: it's a major scene when Brianna finally finds Jamie but did she have to find him relieving himself under a tree?! Could have been a great moment in the book but it fell flat.Unfortunately too, Brianna comes across as spoiled and churlish, having rages against Jamie and Roger while she, herself, made the bad decisions that had nasty consequences.John Gray steals the story...hope to see a lot more of him.I say to Ms. Gabaldon. &quot;You are a phenomenally talented writer who has delivered us from the mundane and we are eternally grateful...bring back the magic!! Can't wait for Book # 5 but I DREAD reaching the end of the series.&quot;"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"To me this was a book about fatherhood. I was absolutely touched to the heart by the story and depth of character development. I am stunned that some people have not found this to be Ms. Gabaldon's greatest achievement thus far. I attribute some of this reaction to the fact that reader's who have fallen in love with a character may not like to see them change. But Jamie and Claire have developed as souls before our eyes in this amazing series. We've seen Jamie grow from a young and innocent young man into a mature and concerned father. (Well, sometimes he's mature and sometimes he's a typical, stuborn Scottish dad!) And I love the story of Bree and Roger. These two converging plot lines demonstrate Ms. Gabaldon's tremendous talent. I really enjoyed her exploration of the theme of fatherhood."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"While I didn't find this book quite as spellbinding as the first three I thought it was wonderful, and will look at it as a bridge to(hopefully,) several more volumes in the saga of Claire and Jamie. Every time I start a new sequel I reread the previous volumes and they never, never fail to push me to the limits in all areas of the emotional spectrum. Each time I can't put them down, and I've not met anyone, male or female who has read them that doesn't feel the same.I have only one fear for the future of Jamie, Claire, and the rest of the characters, and that would be to lose them to a poor screen adaptation. These characters are much to beautifully written to be slaughtered by desperate producers who want a cheap and fast product. If the author reads these reviews I hope she hears our plea for her to retain control of her amazing characters and their stories. In my opinion, (whether or not you want it,) I think Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio would be an excellent Claire, and have since I first picked up Outlander. She has way more humour and sass than most of the names I've seen mentioned so far, and her looks are right on. As for Jamie, we need a big, red, bearded,gruff, sensitive, funny, wonderful,guy. We're all already in love with him so good luck getting it right. A poor choice would ruin it all. It would be really icky to see some wimp's face in our minds,( for either part,) every time we picked up one of the books. I think we need to look to the ranks of talented supporting actors and extras and not over-rated big names, Jane Seymour and Liam Neeson? YUK!!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"It was a great feeling of familiarity to open Drums Of Autumn and step once again into the lives of Claire and Jamie. That they have grown older and matured is quite evident (don't we all though!), but it is nice to see that their love and commitment to each other continues to grow. The historical aspects of the book were (once again) remarkable and make more of an impression in my mind than any history class ever did.There were parts in the book I had to re-read a few times to actually &quot;get&quot; what had happened - like the people with smallpox being thrown overboard. And like someone else who reviews the book further down, I wasn't sure what the tomb stone reference was implying. I am assuming that Frank had the stone placed there, so Jamie does not die in Scotland - as we all thought he must from the previous novels. But that just makes my anticipation for the next book that much stronger. Great work, Diana."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"What is Honor, except a virtue that the modern world condemns ? As in all her books, but especially in the Drums of Autumn, Diana Gabaldon has explored all aspects of a virtue---this time that of Honor. Gabaldon's style strikes a deep chord within the reader as she creates each passage and builds it to a poignant crescendo. In her past three books of this series, Gabaldon has told stories in the life of Claire Randall Fraser, a woman who travels across two hundred years to the past and finds a soul mate, and then travels two hundred years back into the future in order to live in the present so as to preserve the life of their child. Gabaldon has again effortlessly interwoven times periods and lifetimes in an easy- to- read style as we again read about Claire and Jamie and now about their growing children. Because of her whirlwind style, we the readers are immediately a captive to the events of the story as we are taken on a journey of exploration of our inner souls.The people of this story are of our time period and they have real world concerns. Honor, is an unrecognized part of daily lives and oftimes has no place of prominence or appeal in present day lives. Or does it? How Claire and the others maintain their quiet glimmer of Honor in the present is a wonder any of us can relate to as we struggle to live according to our ideals. In the past timeline of this story, Honor was a more obvious part of daily lives. People died for it in duels and they died for lack of it on the gallows. I was mesmerized by this story because we saw that conflict occurred between men and women due to how each lived within their perception of Honor. Sometimes those conflicts resulted in emotional or physical injury to the ones they loved. Not a Romance or Historical novel in the strictest sense of the word, Claire's story in Drums of Autumn could be ours. For she and the people around her are only human in their mistakes and misconceptions as they love, hate, fight and forgive one another. Like us they are only trying to live their lives in such as way as they can live with themselves."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This book is amazing . . Once you pick it up - you won't beable to put it down - it draws you in and makes you forget about everything else but what's happening inside the story. You feel as if you are there - with the charatures! It's a wonderful series!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I really love Drums of Autumn. Of the first four books in the Gabaldon series, this is my second favorite, easily (nothing can touch Outlander, of course).

Now for No.5"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Having loved OUTLANDER and DRAGONFLY IN AMBER, I was disappointed enough by VOYAGER that I didn't get around to reading DRUMS OF AUTUMN until it had been in print for years. And after page 200... I just skimmed the rest. For anyone (such as me) who doesn't have 100% perfect recall of everything that happened in VOYAGER and the previous novels, this is an utterly baffling book. It opens in the middle of a hanging, and I never did figure out who was being hanged, why we were supposed to care, or what Jamie and Claire were doing there. (I also think this novel would be completely incomprehensible to anyone not already familiar with the series, since it's equally uncommunicative about all the other complicated backstory on which this book relies.) Moreover, the text is overloaded with one lengthy, dense, unnecessary research-dump after another (ex. an excruciatingly detailed multi-page description of an abandoned pioneer campsite... that the characters are merely walking past). So that we can see, yes, the author did tons of research about daily life in Colonial America--see? see? SEE?? Additionally, the way the narrative keeps emphasizing how great Claire looks for her age is so dissonant and clumsy, it comes across, frankly, as the author being rather masturbatory. Finally, the main problem I had with the book is that, in a paperback of 1,100 pages... there's almost NO =STORY=. No real plot, no goal, no tension, no conflict. Just a series of perils-of-pauline events, following one after another after another, for more than a thousand pages."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I feel awful for Jamie! In book three, I was upset that Jamie married someone else and had a son with another woman but now that I read book 4, I'm not sure how I feel anymore. Claire and her daughter, Bree, don't deserve Jamie. I don't think they do anymore. How could Bree do that to herself over a stupid ring that belonged to her mother and just because it belong to Frank, her step Father. It's just gross! And Claire, she keeps thinking about Frank, still. She even loves him! How could she even question whether Jamie loved Geneva (his son's mother)or not when she herself loves another man, too. It's just all wrong and twisted! My heart can't stand it anymore! I feel bad for Jamie. He can never truly be a father to his kids. How could you, Diana, do this to Jamie?!!! Jamie, whom we all love so much!! I can't do this no more... I can't continue reading anymore."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I first read Outlander 5 or 6 years ago and loving it, dove head-first into Voyager. I tried to do the same with Drums of Autumn, but for reasons I couldn't remember until I re-read those books recently, I never finished Drums of Autumn. Of course, Claire and Jamie are wonderful, multi-dimensional characters that I care about. That's the task of an author, I think...to get the reader to care what happens to his or her characters. Claire's struggles and mishaps in adapting to 18th century life are charming and funny, but Brianna's just make her seem silly and do not endear her to the reader, not this reader anyway.As far as the progression of the book goes, it's somewhat halting and discontinuous. The author takes time to develop a couple of interesting story lines and then drops them entirely with no more than a bit of commentary well beyond the undefined turning point. More than once, I found myself lost enough that I flipped back through the pages assuming that I'd glossed over some important chapter that would tie together loose ends.I stopped reading Drums of Autumn the first time because the new characters weren't especially lovable and there were times when I had no idea what was happening. I gave up.Having said all of that, I really did like the book. Gabaldon's way with words is really special and even if I'm not clear on what is going on, I like reading about it. Claire is as funny as ever (though I could do without the bit where the Indians see her almost as some kind of deity...she doesn't need to be supernaturally amazing in EVERY way) and Jamie is drawn perfectly. If I weren't so interested in Claire and Jamie though, I might have quit reading a second time. But I guess that that is one of Gabaldon's successes. She did such a brilliant job with Outlander that I'll gladly buy any story with Jamie and Claire and forgive her entirely if there are certain aspects that work less well than others. Upon finishing Drums of Autumn, I immediately went out and bought the next two books of the series."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"In this continuation of the story of Jamie Fraser and his wife, part of the story shifts to the romance of their daughter Brianna. Brianna not only looks like her father, but is also strong willed and determined, but so is Roger who loves her and follows her back in time to the 18th century colony of North Carolina. Jamie shows his flaws by his constant jumping to the wrong conclusions, violence, and mistreatment of Roger. Roger suffers not only at the hands of Jamie, but also at the hands of the Indians that Jamie sells him to. Roger stays with Brianna despite the violent arrogance of her father, Jamie, which would have discouraged most people! I also found Claire to be disappointing in this book, as she doesn't try to curb Jamie's violence and his mistreatment of Roger. I found myself angry at Jamie and unable to undertand how Claire could not stand up to him.This book keeps your attention to the end, and I enjoyed every minute despite the disppointments I had with the characters of Jamie and Claire. It points to the fact that all people have weaknesses, and sooner or later Jamie & Claire's were bound to erupt."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This series about the adventures of a woman living in 18th century Scotland, and beyond, is truly fascinating! Ms. Gabaldon has obviously done painstaking research about the era, and her story rings true. This is so well written that it has actually stirred up an interest in Scottish history, which I've never been much interested in!At first, I was a bit put off by the graphic nature of the sex scenes, however, I came to realize that what I was reading about was \\"making love\\", not just sex. This is so rare in entertainment today, that I didn't recognize it for what it was! Very refreshing to read about the sexual love between married partners. (And, the scenes are very hot, as well!).Changing the venue of Claire and Jamie's love story to the colonies makes for a really interesting read on the beginnings of our country. I look forward to the next book! I recommend this series highly to anyone who loves a good romance, and great history."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I was drawn in with the first book \\"Outlander\\" and I can't get enough.

That being said, I still loved every minute of it and as soon as I read the last page, I immediately purchased The Fiery Cross on my Kindle and kept reading. This is by far the best series I have ever read!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This review is for the entire series. To those who rate it low b/c it is \\"too long\\"...did you not notice that before beginning it? To those who say there is too much sex...it IS technically classified as \\"romance\\"...skip the sex scenes, it won't take away from the story. To those who say there are inaccuracies (historical,factual)...it is a novel written for entertainment purposes with characters who are not all-knowing, not a history book for educational purposes.Ok. When my husband first brought this book back with him from Iraq (donated to the USO)and he told me he was reading a historical-fiction/romance/fantasy/time travel book, I teased him. I thought no way could such a book be an actual worthy read.I am a constant reader. I have to always have a book. So, when I was in-between books, I picked up this book just to pass the time. Don't make the same mistake I did..DO NOT be fooled by the genre. Don't make the mistake of thinking that these are typical bodice-ripping Highlander trash-romance...they are not. They are real literature.I do not enjoy romance novels, though I will read one if it is the only reading material available. I have to say that this series of books, though they do contain sex scenes, is NOT romance. They are a complex tale full of an entire cast of well-developed characters. I have been on the discussion boards that center around this series. Most of the women seem to be in love with (at least the idea of) the main male character, Jamie. As proof of how good the story told and the writing in this book is, I need to say that the physical description of him (and some parts of his personality) are a complete turn-off to me. He is pretty much the opposite of what I like. However, you don't need to be attracted to a character to enjoy reading about them and to grow to admire and care about them. The love story between Jamie and Claire is quite inspiring, so much so that my husband and I actually got matching tattoos inspired by the books.These stories are so well-written and in-depth, that I read them aloud to my children (simply not reading the child-inappropriate parts aloud) and all of them, from my 7-year-old daughter to my 18-year-old son, are as captivated as I am.These books weave the tale of well-developed, multifaceted characters, exploring their personal growth, interactions and relationships with one another, their people in their communities, and some well-known historical figures, all within the context of various historical time periods. From Jacobite-era Scotland to pre-revolutionary North Carolina (and many places in between), you will follow a brilliantly-written, gripping saga and you will be a part of a world you won't want to leave."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Still enjoying the yarns, but not as gripping as the earlier novels in the series. Jamie has become a predicatable cutout; the female characters less so, the history still interesting. Hey - but I read it all and bought the next one!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Another action packed (and massive volume) in the Outlander saga. Anyone who loves historical romance fiction would love this very long story. The characters are very appealing. Some of the things I hoped would happen in the narrative do happen in this particular novel. The series is packed with action and truly seems to be a window into the past. I am already reading the next one.Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel \\"To Be Chosen\\""},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Each of the first four Outlander books are very different stories.Outlander (20th Anniversary Edition): A Novelis mostly a romance.Dragonfly in Amber (Outlander, Book 2)is very historical fiction, placing Claire and Jamie in a very real situation and watching them party with real French people.Voyager (Outlander)is a rollicking adventure across half the globe with barely any time to catch your breath. This one, Drums of Autumn, is a story of survival.It has everything that made the other books compelling: the romance, the history, the adventure, and strange touches of magic that hold it all together. In this case, the magic of the Native American tribes that Claire and Jamie encounter as they carve out a spot for themselves in the New World.The way race relations are handled in the book are interesting. Claire feels very guilty about being assisted by the slaves Jamie's aunt owns, yet she has no problem calling Indians \\"savages.\\" And one or two major conflicts are caused because they can't hold their liquor.The most interesting parts of the book involve seeing Claire and Jamie's daughter, Bree, with her 1960s sensibilities meet up with Jamie and his 1760s old-fashioned ways. The clash isn't pretty with the two stubborn bulls violently butting heads, but it's never dull. Bree's trip into the past is almost, if not more, horrific than Claire's initial trip was.My favorite parts were the brief moments Lord John and Bree spent together. They are hilarious together. I almost wish he had taken her marriage proposal seriously. The two of them would have made an excellent 18th-century odd couple.By the end of Drums, I felt as though Claire and Jamie's story had reached a nice stopping point. Unlike the first three books, there aren't any stunning cliff-hangers that leave me salivating for the next installment. In fact, many of the dangling plot threads seem to have been sewn up nicely. It might be a while before I tackle the Fiery Cross, not because I was left unsatisfied, but because I have been nicely filled with a wonderful epic story, and I'm not craving dessert. Yet.--chancelee.com"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Book four is equally as captivating as the first three. Gabaldon is definitely the best author I've ever read. This adventure focuses around Jamie and Clair's new life they begin to build since landing in North America. I rarely read a book twice. I am now half way through this series for the second time. Can't wait for the eighth!!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"See review of Dragonfly in Amber - these continuing stories of love in the 18th century between a young Scot of the time and a more mature woman of the 20th century who finds herself transported through time are wonderful. Every woman should read at least one and find herself immersed in Diana Gabaldon's incredible ability to literally picture life as it quite possibly was but also to enable the reader to picture it with her. As a 73-year old reader having seen something of life I read Diana's books and think we all ought to have known our own Jamie."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The Outlander series by Dianna Gabledon is incredible. It is based on an accidental time traveler with a medical background who travels back in time 200 years to Scotland. The adventures and LOVE STORY that unfold are wonderful. I am not one to read the same thing a second time but these books are so GREAT I have read the entire series (5 or 6 books) 3 times and have learned something new and exciting every time. If you like time travel you will love these books!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Reviewed at Another Look Book ReviewsSpoilerish - Intent to be read if you have already read.[...]I ventured forth with a re-read of Drums of Autumn because I had just finished doing a re-read Voyager. I honestly didn't plan for a re-read of the Outlander series right now but I sorta just fell into it after reading and reviewing The Scottish Prisoner. I am so glad I did.I remember that when I read Drums of Autumn the first and second time, I did enjoy it but because I was so anxious to read anything and everything about Jamie and Claire, I'd skip through a lot of Roger and Bree story lines. This time around I didn't. I just sat back and really took my time and thoroughly enjoyed every chapter and every character. It was fabulous. I feel like I have now just experienced Roger and Bree on a different level.I do remember being so pleased that when Diana Gabaldon wrote Bree, that she didn't just do a carbon copy of Jamie and Claire. Yes she had Jamie's looks and some of his mannerisms but Bree is definitely her own person. I also have to remember that she is young and she will make mistakes that young people will make. I found I appreciated that trait of hers more this time and I was way more forgiving in some of the things she did and how she did them.Drums of Autumn is quite fabulous. So much happens in this book but not in an angsty, heart palpating way. A lot of character growth and the story moved forward by leaps and bounds. I think back to all the scenes that happened in Drums of Autumn and I am blown away by how much time had passed.Claire delivered some of my favourite lines in Drums of Autumn.\\"You're a walking inducement to harlots,\\" I said. \\"Stick by me; I'll protect you.\\"\\"He's much sneakier than I thought,\\" I said. \\"Practically Scottish.\\"\\"Actually, it's your kilt that make me want to fling you to the floor and commit ravishment,\\" I told him.\\"May the Lord deliver me from stubborn Scotsmen!\\" I said.And a Jamie quote worth noting....\\"Your face is my heart, Sassenach,\\" he said softly, \\"and love of you is my soul.\\"The building of Fraser Ridge really provided an excellent foundation for the North Carolina setting and a true appreciation of what the first settlers encountered.If reading Voyager was about Jamie and Claire's reunion, then Drums of Autumn was about Jamie meeting his daughter, Bree. The anticipated scene was fabulous and I wouldn't change a thing. Without a doubt, that encounter was my favourite scene in the entire book. Followed closely by birth of Jemmy. I adore that the birth was a wee bit of a family event.I also found that I enjoyed more of the Indian interactions this time around. I was still very impacted and my heart was heavy for Ian. I found Ian was on my mind a lot and I was ever so thankful that Diana Gabaldon included that letter from Ian to Jamie and Claire while they were attending the Gathering.Of course I need to move on to The Fiery Cross now. I am quite excited about it since that book was my least favourite of the series and now I am thinking after this experience, I will enjoy it that much more.Teasers: Stephen Bonnet the pirate, bear attach and fought off with a fish, Bree's engagement to Lord John, birth of Jemmy and the biological puzzle that goes along with him"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Diana Gabaldon's books are getting so much longer and I really wouldn't have an issue with it if she had anything worth saying! Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this book, but she really is in need of a good editor. There is too much detail to small things that slows the pace down. The first half of the book was very slow and uninteresting.I have to say that I really disliked the character, Brianna. She is spoiled, foolish, and petulant. Several of her mishaps could have been avoided had she just used some common sense. She does so many stupid things that I really lacked any sort of sympathy for her. I felt much more sorry for Roger because the Frasers put him through hell.The book is slow, builds steam, putters out, than builds again. It is possible to tell a good story without the extra information. I got the sense that this particular book didn't have much direction. It seemed put together just for the sake of writing another Jamie/Claire adventure, but this one lacked in adventure.Favorite characters were Roger, Ian and Rollo (Ian's dog)."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Drums of Autmun continues the story of Claire and Jamie and all of the other characters that we have come to know and love in the first three books.As with the first three books, Diana's attention to historical details is amazing and so well done if the characters were real people you would think you were reading a history book!A series that just keeps getting better and better as the books go one, the fourth one is just as hard to put down as the first three"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This is the fourth installment in the Outlander series and once again, I felt like I was transported to a wonderful time with such a rich wealth of depth to her characters and plots.In this one, we have the two separate timelines again except one is Jamie and Claire and the other is their daughter, Brianna, and Roger her love interest and a man with close connections to Jamie through his lineage. Soon all of them are in the past, but the lines are still not converged as Jamie and Claire, Bree, and Roger all have their separate storylines. When they do converge, we are left breathless with the plot twists that do not make that the point of a satisfying ending. There is so much going on and your heart is just wrenched so many times even as it beats hard in the dramatic moments. I do not wish to give any details about the plot because I do not like to give spoilers plus there is already a synopsis provided.I have been so completely engaged in this series, but there was something about this part of the story that just took it to a whole new level. I laughed and cried, but all the way through I was rapt to discover what was in the next sentence and on the next page. I am so glad that I had the next installment ready to go.Great read!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This series is absolutely phenomenal. I feel like the characters are people that I actually know in real life, and I find that while I am waiting for the 8th book to be written and published, I am actually missing these people!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I enjoyed this fourth book in the Outlander series. An event I anticipated comes to pass and family members are reunited."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I has started to read the Outlander series in my 20's, but didn't have the time and experience to truly appreciate the writing and story.I recently picked it up again and began from the beginning. The story is entwining as long as you have an imagination and super-natural suspicions, otherwise you will not make it through the 1st book.I have convinced my husband to read it - Jordan being his favorite writer - thinking that he would enjoy, but since the story is almost entirely written in 1st person, he is not inclined to see the odd sense of humor from a woman's perspective.To truly enjoy this series, you will need to have to have known complete immersion in love to the extent of all else, but still have the morality of necessary commitment."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This is the fourth book in the Outlander series and Claire and Jamie's new adventures are in the Americas. They travel with Ian Murray (Jamie's nephew) to North Carolina where they meet Jamie's Aunt Jocasta at River Run. Even though Aunt Jocasta wants to leave Jamie her estate, he prefers to settle at Fraser's Ridge which it is more secluded and something he can call his own . Of course, Claire and Jamie run into Indians and bears on the way and meet interesting characters as well.In addition to Claire and Jamie's story, Brianna (Claire and Jamie's daughter) and Roger Wakefield MacKenzie(distant ancestor of Dougal MacKenzie and Gille Duncan) join the adventures by doing some time travel themselves. Brianna goes back on her own from the 1970's to the 1770's to warn Claire and Jamie about a historical fact she finds out and Roger finds out and follows her.I didn't give this book 5 stars because I thought the whole Jamie/Roger misunderstanding and the search for him took too long. However, that won't stop me from continuing on to the next in the series, The Fiery Cross."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This was the very first book I read on my brand new reader. I had the hardcover version checked out from the library but it was just so darn BIG that I kept putting off reading it. Now I am not at all opposed to thick books - longer is usually better IMHO - but thick books are heavy. They don't travel so well. They make my wrists ache. They are hard to read in bed. So, it was easy to decide to return my free library copy and pay for the ebook. What a delight it was to read Diana Gabaldon - but THIN! I also loved trying out the dictionary function. Naturally, not every Scottish word is represented - but that just made it all that much more special when I got one. I just wish the dictionary had pictures. That would be so cool."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Wow! I thought that Voyager was amazing but this book almost tops it! I was worried that after Voyager the story wouldn't be as exciting. Wow was I wrong! Drums starts with Jamie and Claire start their lives in the new world. This book switches from Jamie and Claire's life in America 1769 and Brianna and Roger in the present 1969. I was unsure that I would like reading from Brianna's and Roger's point of view since I love Jamie and Claire so much. However, I really liked reading from their perspective. It was interesting to see how Brianna is coping after her father's death and mother's departure through time. You see a lot more of Frank in this book too: the good and the bad. The end will leave you shocked! You think you know the story and then something surprises you! I would suggest that you read the outlandish companion to help with the ending because it can be a little confusing. Diana Gabaldon is an amazing author! Can't wait to read more!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"If you are a Fan of Diana Gabaldon, you can't miss reading any of her books. This is just one in a Series. Great Read. If you haven't read her books then you are missing a good read."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This is the fourth book in the series by Diane Gabaldon. They are very well written books and hard to put down. I would not recommend for the young readers as they can be a little sexually explicit at times. A history lesson and romance novel rolled into one. I loved the book, and I would recommend reading them in order. The fourth book is just as riveting as the first three."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This was turning out to be the best of Diana Gabaldon's storytelling so far until well into the book she pulled the old rape card and turned it into a very bad soap opera. What a shame."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"All of Diana Gabaldon's books are true works of art. Of the thousands of books I've read her storytelling distinguishes her as an artistic craftsman capable of bringing to life complex and compelling stories that blur the mind's ability to reconcile that the story is fiction and not a personal account. Read them all, read the companion and then read them all again. Every word is worth it!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"All of Diana Gabaldon's books are true works of art.

Each one is as good as the last. Amazing in-depth characters, I cherish each book in this series. Drums of Autumn was as fantastic as all the previous ones! Each one leaves me wanting MORE MORE MORE!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"While this book is still better than 99 percent of the rest of the books available, when compared to the others in the series it is a step down. It doesn't seem to have its own identify as much as it serves as a link for the preceding book an the next in the series. While it is a link, it is a very long link. However, like all the books in the series, it reads quickly for its length because it is a stirring series with well-told tales. The narrative, however, does not have the same directed flow of the previous Outlander novels, and seems more of a placeholder. That said, I can't wait to read the next in the series."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I honestly did not want to read any of these, coming off of my Sharon Kay Penman books. I Could not find anything else to read at the time. Diane Galbaldon has led me on a path to find out more about Scotland and it's people. I now want to move to Scotland because of her. Galbaldon's style of writing is comparable to Jane Austin, (but modern). You will laugh, think, and cry. I consumed her books, and am waiting for Echo in the Bone to come out. Jamie and Claire have touched my heart and soul, as does Brianna and Roger. A sweeping saga of life in Scotland during and after the Culledon Battle, and up to pre revolutionary war in the states. Some of you may say, oh, come on, time travel? Once you get past that you'll love this series."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"-The Drums is not Diana's best work so far. It was a little slow paced and rather predictable. The character development of Brianna and Roger was weak and not as good as Dragonfly in Amber. They even acted stupid sometimes like when Brianna tried to force John Grey to marry her and acting as if she knew Jamie very well. Nope and I almost don't even care about what would happen to them. I also thought Jamie's treatment of Roger after his rescue was extreme. After all, it was Jamie that got Roger into the mess. I'm looking to the 5th installment in 2000 and hope that it will be better constructed and as great and steamy as the other books."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This is just not right. Books available on the US sight we cannot buy. Price differentials; I will buy this one at Barnes and Noble. Thanks Amazon."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I started reading the \\"Outlander\\" Series from the beginning and have been unable to put them down. Drums of Autumn was no acception. I was enralled in not only Claire and Jamie's romance, but now I have Brianna and Roger to follow and enjoy. The way the connections and love between the characters are written, makes Diana Gabladon's books intriguing and allows me to feel what they are feeling. I truly love these books and the characters. I would reccomend them to anyone. Start at the beginning and when you get to the end, start over again!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This book came a lot faster than I expected it to, was in excellent condition."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The whole thing went very smooth. And I received the book within a couple of days. Great job!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"After reading Drums of Autumn and reading several reviews I do not understand why some reviews have been so critical. I don't think that there were as many issues with the book as some have pointed out. In my opinion the story and characters have just evolved, which makes thebook(s) so enjoyable. In fact I nearly got to the end of Drums of Autumn before I even saw an issue, hence why I gave this book 4 and not 5 stars.Basically the only problem I had about the book was the chapters dealing with Roger and that towards the end the book drifted away from \\"Jamie and Claries\\" story. I could have lived without learning of Roger, especially his trip to America. I just don't find Roger an interesting character and he seems like a wimp. I thought we could have stayed away from him except when Brianan mentioned him and still knew enough information.I wish too we could have focused on Jamie and Claire more towards the end but once Roger and Brianna came through we saw less of them together.As for Brianna I would have liked to have kept her too to a minimum but, I think she is significant to the story and its evolvement and I did get excited as she was about to meet her father Jamie. I agree she was whiny, but then again she came from a time were women were gaining their independence and rights that were not available to them before. Her era compared to her moms was significantly different.Despite the small issues I saw I figured that Gabaldon has her reason for everything she writes and I have ordered the next two books and can't wait till book 7. So far nothing has compared to Outlander or Dragon Fly in Amber but I understand that the story, as life, evolves and I can't wait to see where Gabadon takes us next. Love, Love, Love this series!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Gabaldon's series just keeps getting better and better. I was ENTRALLED with this book. This one had more twists and turns than the previous novels. There was a skull found by Claire that had me wondering \\"Who was it?\\" This was found out later in the book, the seperation of Brianna and Roger, and the things that happened to him in the hands of the Mohawk.I do admit that there were slow parts of the book, as in the previous ones but, for me, that is part of the reason that makes these books so appealing...she sets the scenes up, takes the reader to the mid-eighteenth century and makes one envision how North Carolina might have looked during that time. I've been to South Carolina and Charleston and can easitly see without much effort how the town and surrounding countryside might have looked back then.Gibaldon is quite discriptive so it is just as easy to imagine the scenery with my mind as it was in real life.Just like Jamie, although not as badly, she puts Roger through the mill as well. He is tested in his love for Brianna. I won't say whether he comes through or not, I'll let any future readers find out for themselves, but I do feel for the poor man.I am looking forward to starting THE FIERY CROSS now. Drums only left me wanting more. As one reviewer stated, start from the beginning. Even though each book does give you snippets of what occurs in previous books and it's possible to read them alone, it is better if you begin with Outlander and continue from there."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Diana Gabaldon's fourth novel in her Outlander series is a rarity in that time travel here is no gimick, but rather an intergrating aspect of plot. Moving from the 20th century to 18th century Scotland and on to the New World, heroine Clare Randall is somebody I could travel with. The great love between Clare and the 18th century Scot Jamie Fraser makes both of these characters believable and enjoyable. This is good reading for those of us who are bored with most contemporary fiction. Author Gabaldon stirs up an enthralling blend of imagination and historical research compelling the reader to keep turning those pages. Combined with strong plot lines, believable heroes and heroines,and a vivid cast of secondary characters, these books offer up adventure, history, mystery and an intense love story. Note: read these books in order and I'm hoping for a movie!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"My mother and I exchange books, and she had given me &quot;DRUMS&quot; to read. Not knowing, or looking, that this was a series of books, I read the book in a weekend, I could not put it down! The characters are so spell-binding! Then to find out that there are books that precede, I was at the library before I finished &quot;DRUMS&quot;! But I couldn't stop reading the fourth book, and have now read &amp; re-read all of the books. I only wish my husband was more like Jamie Fraser! Ah, to have lived in that time, when men were men and women were women! And life was what you made of it, it's makes me think that we all need to be a little like Jamie &amp; Claire. Diana, if you read this, please we are all waiting patiently for FIERY CROSS, but I for one need another book to read! Please hurry!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I couldn'tpu it down!! I have learned so much about Scotland and its people, from one book to the next that I can't wait until I visit it. I love the heated romance and passiononate fights between Jamie &amp; Claire!! Diana has a way of making all of her characters come to life. I have re-read all of the series while waiting (on BATED breath)for the 5th one to be completed. Jamie is so charming &amp; protective, that it's easy to fall in love with him. And Claire is so smart and funny, that its no wonder why Jamie loves her (along with her fine fat a---). This book has made me analyze my own relationship, and while real love is not picture (or book) perfect, I sure would love to meet James Alexander Malcom Mackenzie Fraser. So for the sake of my love life...PLEASE...don't ever stop writing about Jamie!!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I've waited a long time for this book, after reading the previous three a few years ago. Once again, this book was delightful, as were the others. The book seems to be historically accurate (for a non-historian like me) and the details with regard to what a 20th century physician would know and be able to apply in the 18th century are very realistic. It took too long to find out about Roger (I peeked ahead), but all in all, a very satisfying read. It has room for another sequel, so I hope Diana Gabaldon is working on one, and I hope it won't take as long as this one did"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Drums of Autumn continues the saga of Jamie and Clair while providing fuel to the simmering flame of Roger and Brianna. Having survived a treacherous voyage that leaves them in a land both new and old, Jamie and Clair are faced with making a life changing decision. However, once this decision is made, they are faced with new danger and adventure with the appearance of their daughter Brianna. Having come through the same breach in time that Clair once entered, Brianna is on a life saving mission. It is Roger, following Brianna, who inadvertently provides the catalyst that sends each character on a new path.Diana Gabaldon has the ability to entertain while providing an inside view of life 200 years ago. Reading her books is like walking alongside her characters. You feel what they feel, see what they see. When they are sad you cry, when they are funny you laugh, when they are in danger you want to join the fight. When slops are thrown from a window you find yourself lifting your feet and when a man's dirty collar is described you hold your nose. A tradition of great writing that began with a breach in time continues in her latest offering."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I think that this is the best of the Claire/Jamie series since the first book, Outlander! Plot is tighter, the story doesn't drag anywhere, and great character development. It's nice to see that Jamie is multifaceted enough to make some mistakes, and Roger has become MUCH more interesting! I'm not sure how Brianna is going to develop as she matures, should be interesting. Definitely worth the wait. A map would have been useful. I get &quot;lost&quot; sometimes; but this is a minor criticism"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I had long ago given up on reading romance novels and had switched to mysteries. But one day I was wandering through the romance section in a local bookstore and picked up Outlander. I became engrossed from the first page and ended up buying it and all of the ones following. With Voyager (though it was very hard) I read a little bit at a time, stretching it out for as long as I could until I heard there would be a fourth. I just did not want to let go of the characters! Drums of Autumn is even better than the three before it! Thank you, Diana, for giving us a smart heroine, a fantastically sexy, gentle, strong, funny, wonderful hero, and for giving me back romance"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I salute you Diane Gabaldon! You have done it again. Your story of Jamie Fraser and Claire Randall as they forge out a life in the American Frontier is superb! Fantastic! As always I can't wait for the next volume, and yet I fear that the next book will be the last. Please say it's not true. DRUMS OF AUTUMN captures the essence of life in early America without sounding like a textbook. Diane is a weaver of words that interact with the characters and events of the time leaving the reader warm and content under her cover.As much as it is hard for us to wait for your next installment, take your time.

I've just got to ask, though, what's the deal with the gravestones at the end? Did Frank have one made for Jamie and had it planted where Claire would see it? Was he trying to be nice or mean?

This is what we all want in our married lives.Here, there is a large group of people, men and women, who are all addicted to the series. We have been waiting, somewhat patiently, for this next addition. (I must admitt I was the first of the group to actually buy it and gloat.) I would strongly suggest you read all the books in the series and enjoy life, love*, and the pursuit of Jamie and Claire's happiness. We can't wait for the 5th in the series. Hope it is as good or better than the rest. (Meanwhile, just go back and reread the others. You'll have probably missed something in reading it so quickly.

I admit to feeling and intense dislike for Brianna in this last book, however. Seems like she could do with a good spanking, and Jamie is the man to do it. As for talk of a movie, how about Kristin Scott Thomas as Claire and Liam Neeson as Jamie?

Bravo Ms Gabaldon. I look forward to the next edition with much anticipation."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This story was much more consuming than Voyager, which tended to lag in spots. Outlander was by far the best, not surprising. (I even got my Husband to read it). The stone hopping seems to be getting a bit out of hand. If it were really that easy, there would have been many more &quot;fairy&quot; tales. The weak ending explaining the gravestone is a bit far fetched and I look to the Frasers/MacKenzies to return to Scotland in the future. As to a mini-series (Outlander would be way out of movie league), if I hear of Jane Seymour as Claire one more time I think I'll puke. She's not nearly earthy enough. Adrian Paul is waaaay too short. You may have to do a real search of nobodies to do these characters justice. Please don't sell out for the latest popularity. I can picture Jonathan Frakes as Frank/Black Jack and, if you ever get past the first book, David Hyde Pierce would be a good John Grey. For future books, please leave them in the century they are currently in. Any more time travel may kill us all. (PS, you still haven't explained why Jamie was haunting Claire in Outlander if they found one another later in life)"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"While I thoroughly enjoyed Gabaldon's first 3 in this series I found Drums of Autumn a struggle. I appreciate the fact that she continues to reduce the amount of excessive sex and violence in each volume but I think she fell below her former excellent standards of historical story telling. I suspect she didn't find American history as interesting as Scottish and therefore focused too much on an overabundance of adjectives and personality. Lots of skimming required to just &quot;get on with the story.&quot; Ending also a bit flat compared to last issues but no doubt sets her up well for number 5."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"A friend turned me on to &quot;Outlander&quot; three years ago, and by the time I finished reading &quot;Voyager&quot;, I still had a 2 1/2 year wait for &quot;Drums of Autumn&quot;. In some ways, it was worth the wait--I like the fact that a couple in my age group (i.e. &quot;aging baby-boomers&quot;!!) could be so passionately in love with each other, yet have arguments which are semi-realistic. (Let's remember that we're dealing with time travel here!) And, having Brianna and Jamie meet each other was something I was hoping for after reading &quot;Voyager&quot;. Yet, the story line in &quot;Drums of Autumn&quot; was not one which I thought worked as well as it could have. It seems as though this book is one very long lead-up towards Jamie and Claire returning to Scotland--hope that happens in the next book! I notice that another reviewer thinks that Liam Neeson and his wife would be good as Jamie and Claire should these stories ever be brought to the screen (large or small). All I can say to that is--Liam Neeson for an older Jamie: yes, yes, yes--Natasha Richardson as Claire: are you serious? Totally wrong physical type and you might want to check out the movie Nell. They may be married in real life but no chemistry on screen!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"AHHHHH, I read this one just in time for valentine's day. None of that male menopausal BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY nonsense, or the silliness of MEN ARE FROM MARS, WOMEN ARE FROM VENUS, just real romance for real people. Well,real people who go time travelling, but enough of these minor details. Diana Gabaldon has a new story in her series about Claire Randall and Jamie fraser, 20th century American woman and 18th century Highlander. He's sweet, red headed, built, glorious in a kilt, not quite as bright as Claire (but let's not quibble!) and they have been cast ashore in North Carolina at the beginning of the American Revolution. Gabaldon makes the convoluted plot believable, the characters are all delights (Jamie and Claire's daugher Bree figures more prominently in this episode), and if you haven't read this series yet, you have a major treat in store."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"...defies the 1-10 scale!!!

Once you pick it up, you cannot put it down. I read it and I read it again. Gabaldon had a way with words that really touchs the heart. This book and the others in the series have a way of drawing you in and itching to know what is going to happen next. You feel as if you are a part of the story line. WELL DONE DIANA GABALDON.TWO THUMBS UPEXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Drums of Autumn by Diana Gabaldon is the fourth in a series; the story around the mysterious disappearance and intriguing reappearance of Claire Randall. In this, the fourth book, Claire and her Highland Scot husband have landed on the coast of the Carolinas after a shipwreck. They are now almost destitute and without a definite destination for their future. This wonderful story continues the fine tradition of the first three books; it contains heartbreak, love, tragedy, mystery, betrayal and more. Gabaldon twists the plot with the entrance of Claire and Jamie's daughter Brianna - from the 20th century. The author keeps us looking on as she switches back and forth between the events of Brianna's trek to pre-Revolution America to find and warn her parents of their impending death, and Claire and Jamie's trip up the east coast of the colonies and their subsequent settlement in the mountains. With disease, wild Indians, treacherous pirates, lust, greed and just plain survival, the story never slows. From one minute to the next you are compelled to read on. The events are told with a realism that makes you hear and see the sights and sounds of an America we won't see again. The colorful descriptions of everyday life and people make us feel as if we could reach out and touch them. We understand the pain, love and desires that drive the characters that are now almost a part of our own family"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I have read the other reviews and I agree with all of them.Many aspects of the series have been touched upon by all thereviews. This series is the ONLY set of books that I couldnot put down. Like others I interested friends andco-workers to read the books, even men! through muchassuring that it was NOT a trashy romance despite thelocation in the book stores. (Real men can buy a book fromthe romance section.) People I encouraged to read the bookstold me: they refused to answer the phone, the door,cut short evenings out (much to their spouses dismay) andgenerally ignored the outside world till there were no morebooks to read. Best books for anyone sick in bed, thatcan't stand convalescing. These books sparked heated debateson where the characters were going, why they did what theydid, what they TRUELY felt instead of what they said. I hada friend tell me &quot;Its just a book, calm down&quot; till they readthe series, now they want to know why its taking so long forthe next one. It was agony having to wait for each publication and I envy those people that can go on to the next bookas soon as they shut the cover of the last. Mesmerizing,enrapting, mind expanding, stimulating to want to know more;&quot;Ah, there's where Lallybrook would be&quot; while looking at amap of Scottish Clan territories. As you can tell I cannotlaud these books enough, I would love to see them in movieformat but only if it could be done as well as Interviewwith a Vampire, where the movie WAS the book with no poeticlicense shortcuts the movie industry loves to make (i.e. seeSteven King). I do have one suggestion for casting, Tim Rothas Randall, it was deja vu when I saw Rob Roy. But finding a6'5&quot;, charismatic, red haired, muscular, beautifully proportioned, handsome actor with enough talent to be able to playJamie will be hard to find."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"&quot;Drums of Autum&quot; is the first &quot;time travel-romance&quot; I have ever read. I do not usually read romance novels. However, I got lucky and stumbled onto a recorded version at the local library. Boy, if you want to really get the feel of Scotland listen to this book. The narrator is excellent and she brings all of the characters to life. Aye, I'm thinkin' it might just rub off a bit. Anyway, this is a great book and I plan to start at the beginning and read the entire series. What a find!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Now, I was really in love with Jamie through the first three books, I even had to visit the Fraser gravestone in Culloden. &quot;Drums&quot; doesn't have the gripping speed of the other books, there where no major historical events, the plot in the backwater of the Carolinas had a narrow focus. I'd have loved it if Diana would have taken the chance to elaborate on Native American history. There was a start, sure, but a little bit meager. But I did read the whole book and I couldn't stop, so that should say something. At first I was incredibly angry at Jamie for treating Roger like he did, but then one tends to forget that Jamie is a man of the 18th century. That is one reason why he is so fascinating. And if you still like a book, even when the hero behaves badly, then the author got it right. The amazing thing is that I really don't believe in that kind of love, I'd have dumped that red-headed sweet bastard long since, would never have forgiven some things he did.And still I found myself yearning for a man like that. Claire surely is an amazing character. I particularly liked the way she didn't fret and didn't bother to find herself to the ellbows in blood from the very beginnig. The medical details are fascinating, so is the historical background. But like other readers, I'm waiting for the two to return to Scotland.And take Brianna with them. I want to hear more of Roger too. He was one of the characters, who really experienced a major development. First he seemed a little bit boring, but now he's really cute and didn't deserve to be so badly treated by Jamie.God I was furious. I rarely find myself so agitated by a book, I even found myself telling the last news of Jamie and Claire to a friend as if it was real. Despite the critics, a great compliment to Diana Gabaldon"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I found \\"Drums\\" quite disappointing in the context of the first books. The plotline has meandered to a slow trickle in places. I have mentioned in my reviews for \\"Voyager\\" and \\"The Fiery Cross\\" that I have found Diana Galbadon's writing style in her later novels very self-indulgent, and \\"Drums\\" had a number of sub-plots that didn't seem to bear relevance to the main story. The character of Brianna doesn't quite gel with me, Diana Galbadon mentioned in her \\"companion\\" to the novels (Through the Stones) that she found Brianna a \\"hard nut to crack\\" character-wise and I think this shows in the novel - the psyche of this character doesn't come across, and it is difficult to feel sympathy or affection for her. Roger's character is also a little difficult to warm to, compared to those of say Young Ian and Fergus. All in all - stick with the first three books!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Originally, Diana Gabaldon was writing a trilogy. However, after she finished Voyager, she knew she still had stories about Claire, Jamie, Brianna and Roger to tell. This is the book I had been waiting for. Through Dragonfly in Amber and Voyager I had wanted more information about Bree and Roger. Finally, in this book, they get to play a bigger role. In the beginning of the book Claire and Jamie have landed in America. They go to visit Jamie's Aunt Jocasta and eventually start their own settlement called Fraser's Ridge. In the 1970s, Bree has finally decided that she wants to find out what happens to her mother and her biological father. She enlists the help of Roger and finds out that they die in a fire in 1776. She decides to go back through the stones to warn them.I don't know what it is about these books. Every single one of them is absolutely enthralling for the first several hundred pages. Then I hit a bump, something happens that severely bothers me, and I get a negative impression of the book. And then I keep going and end up interested again and pick up the next book in the series. This has happened with three separate books now (not Dragonfly in Amber, I liked that one all the way through) and I end up feeling unsatisfied but eternally hopeful that I will like the next one more.In Drums of Autumn's case there is one major cause of my disappointment. Jamie just stops listening. I actually think he has never listened (for example, when he starts yelling at his sister in Outlander for being a whore when really she keeps trying to tell him she is happily married) but he drives me crazy in this book. He accuses Roger of things, he accuses Bree of things, he yells and throws fits and then, finally, the truth comes out and he looks like the bad guy for being so rash. I do understand, to a certain extent. Sometimes things appear one way and he makes a decision based on limited information. But sometimes he just doesn't give people the chance to explain. There is a chapter with Bree where he insults her terribly without letting her tell him the whole story and I just got so frustrated with him for not letting her get a word in edgewise.I think I continue reading these books because I really like Claire and Bree. I thought this one was mostly interesting. I liked the picture of early America with the hardy settlers that are about to form a great nation. I also really liked seeing Lord John again. You can tell Diana Gabaldon likes him because, not only does he have his own series, but he keeping reappearing in Jamie and Claire's novels too. But I just wish Jamie had been less frustrating. If he would have behaved better, this would have been my favorite book in the series. As it was, I am once again hoping the next book (A Fiery Cross) will be better."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This book goes on and on and on, and never is there ever any serious conflict. Too much GD pillow talk, and too much needless description of leaves and plants and sunsets and god knows what else. Sooooo boring!!! Badly written romance at its least romantic."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Reviewed at Another Look Book ReviewsI ventured forth with a re-read of Drums of Autumn because I had just finished doing a re-read Voyager. I honestly didn't plan for a re-read of the Outlander series right now but I sorta just fell into it after reading and reviewing The Scottish Prisoner. I am so glad I did.I remember that when I read Drums of Autumn the first and second time, I did enjoy it but because I was so anxious to read anything and everything about Jamie and Claire, I'd skip through a lot of Roger and Bree story lines. This time around I didn't. I just sat back and really took my time and thoroughly enjoyed every chapter and every character. It was fabulous. I feel like I have now just experienced Roger and Bree on a different level.I do remember being so pleased that when Diana Gabaldon wrote Bree, that she didn't just do a carbon copy of Jamie and Claire. Yes she had Jamie's looks and some of his mannerisms but Bree is definitely her own person. I also have to remember that she is young and she will make mistakes that young people will make. I found I appreciated that trait of hers more this time and I was way more forgiving in some of the things she did and how she did them.Drums of Autumn is quite fabulous. So much happens in this book but not in an angsty, heart palpating way. A lot of character growth and the story moved forward by leaps and bounds. I think back to all the scenes that happened in Drums of Autumn and I am blown away by how much time had passed.Claire delivered some of my favourite lines in Drums of Autumn.\\"You're a walking inducement to harlots,\\" I said. \\"Stick by me; I'll protect you.\\"\\"He's much sneakier than I thought,\\" I said. \\"Practically Scottish.\\"\\"Actually, it's your kilt that make me want to fling you to the floor and commit ravishment,\\" I told him.\\"May the Lord deliver me from stubborn Scotsmen!\\" I said.And a Jamie quote worth noting....\\"Your face is my heart, Sassenach,\\" he said softly, \\"and love of you is my soul.\\"The building of Fraser Ridge really provided an excellent foundation for the North Carolina setting and a true appreciation of what the first settlers encountered.If reading Voyager was about Jamie and Claire's reunion, then Drums of Autumn was about Jamie meeting his daughter, Bree. The anticipated scene was fabulous and I wouldn't change a thing. Without a doubt, that encounter was my favourite scene in the entire book. Followed closely by birth of Jemmy. I adore that the birth was a wee bit of a family event.I also found that I enjoyed more of the Indian interactions this time around. I was still very impacted and my heart was heavy for Ian. I found Ian was on my mind a lot and I was ever so thankful that Diana Gabaldon included that letter from Ian to Jamie and Claire while they were attending the Gathering.Of course I need to move on to The Fiery Cross now. I am quite excited about it since that book was my least favourite of the series and now I am thinking after this experience, I will enjoy it that much more.Do you ever go back and re-read a book and just love it even more than you did before?Teasers: Stephen Bonnet the pirate, bear attach and fought off with a fish, Bree's engagement to Lord John, birth of Jemmy and the biological puzzle that goes along with him"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I have previously read the Diana Gabaldon Outlander series.

This book definitely had a different pace and style than the previous three in the series but I loved it just as much. The book switches POV a lot and sometimes it takes a couple of paragraphs to catch on. I really liked getting to know Brianna and Roger more and LOVED life on Fraser's Ridge. The pace of the book was a bit odd as some sections were very long and only covered a few days and others were shorter and covered months. All in all, though, I have been absolutely delighted with the whole series and I'll be sad to say goodbye to Claire and Jamie in a few years when the last book comes out!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I have been on bedrest since 9 December and will remain sountil mid-March when my second child will be born.

Better throw in a rape, a bear, an indian attack, a storm. The melodrama was over the top. These piled on events were interspersed with long boring stretches like where Claire grows penicillin or describes the mountain. At one point I stopped reading to count the adjectives.

When I read the first book in this series, A Dragonfly in Amber, I was happily suprised that it wasn't a run-of-the-mill, formulaic romance. The characters were shockingly three-dimensional and the antagonist was, well, a bad guy with a face behind the black moustache, so to speak.Well, sequels have been disappointing, not least Drums of Autumn. Brianna has the personality of a paperdoll compared to her mother, and unfortunately a great deal of the book revolves around her. Likewise, her love interest is only slightly more charismatic.In summary, don't miss the first book of this series but don't bother with the rest."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"It is very difficult to read one book without reading them all, and that is torture.

Having traveled across the Atlantic, with a brief stop in the Caribbean, the two are ready to settle down and make a home of their own. Meanwhile two hundred years back in the future, their daughter, Brianna, continues to frustrate her historian boyfriend, Roger, by refusing his marriage proposal. Both Roger and Brianna are troubled by a newspaper clipping that spells disaster for her parents, and each secretly chooses to handle the news in their own way.This installment of the Outlander saga takes some of the focus off of Jamie and Claire, and focuses more on Brianna and Roger, who aren't all that interesting at first glance. We also meet some old friends and new enemies. Unfortunately, it took almost 400 pages before I really got into this book, unlike the earlier three. Of course, the good news is that I still had over 600 pages of excellent reading that I couldn't put down! The last few pages were the best. Now I am ready to dive into the fifth Outlander book, The Fiery Cross."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Who wrote this book???? It is interesting to see that I am not alone in my disappointment. As others have said, the first three books in this series are fantastic. In fact, they are probably among the most entertaining books I have ever read. Gabaldon has an airtight writing style that is easy to follow, and yet doesn't insult the reader's intelligence. Her plots are fantastic as she twists a virtually seamless storyline between past and 'present'. The first three books of this series are overflowing with mind-blowing adventure and plenty of detail.My question is... WHAT HAPPENED?Picking up Drums of Autumn after having read its predecessors is a gargantuan let-down. You expect a riveting frolic of a read and get 'Walden' instead. How could an author who fueled the break-neck, gut-wrenching speed of her plots with things like murder, vicious animal attacks, necromancy, male rape, ancient Celtic religion, piracy, voodoo, abduction, war, torture....how could this same author give us the 'horror' of pulled back muscles and expect us to be content? After the Parisian underworld and the Scottish Highlands, the backwoods of the colonial US ain't cuttin' it, so to speak. Gabaldon gave time travel a realistic feel in her first three books, yet in Drums of Autumn you feel there should be a baggage check behind one of the megaliths, since the whole process is demystified, first by Brianna's sojourn to the 18th century, and then by Roger,who, hot on Brianna's heels, decides to jump in too. Almost everything about this book falls short of the mark, ESPECIALLY when you know what a fantastic tale Gabaldon can write.To be fair, I have to say certain parts were interesting. The depiction of the hardships of plantation life in the rural South were captivating. The bear attack was graphic, vivid, and a glimmer of the old Gabaldon adventure I love. Claire's method of debriding Roger's gangrenous wound also hearkened back to the style of the other books. Brianna and Roger's courtship at the Scots festival was very convincingly and tenderly written,without being sappy. Unfortunately, after the aforementioned courtship scenes, all we here about Brianna is how tall she is, and how red her hair is, and we are reminded of this ad nauseam. Very little character development...just tall/statuesque/towering/intimidating/impressive with red/flaming/auburn/copper/sun-lit/firey hair/tresses/locks/mane. Pick a permutation.It is an interesting concept, having Jamie and Claire age with the series, but does that mean we have to forget about nail-biting entertainment? I hope Gabaldon returns to her old style. I will buy her next book, but since I was burnt on this one, I will wait for the paperback. Drums of Autumn, hardcover, was an enormous and expensive disappointment."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I won't spoil the story for you, however I will mention that I was in tears at the ending, and at various points through the book. I am rather surprised to see the amount of people complaining about how long it takes her to write these books--I am quite pleased to see she hasn't given in to the lure of fame and money, cutting down on the time between books and thereby producing stories that aren't as enthralling. I am waiting with baited breath for the sequel to Drums of Autumn (I am given to understand it is the beginning of a new trilogy), since I am sure it, too, will be worth the time spent waiting for it."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The story: Jamie and Claire are together and must carve out a life for themselves in America.

I was telling all my friends about these books, staying up too late and going to work with circles under my eyes, but loving the characters, the period detail and the twists and turns of the plot.Then I came to Drums of Autumn. This is the first book of Gabaldon's series that I thought was unconvincing and could have used more attention from her editor. And that's saying something, considering each previous book is 800-1000 pages at least.Generally I've enjoyed the anticipation leading up to a major plot point (i.e. the first 350 pages of Voyager) because what's been in those pages has been well-paced, exciting and led to a deeper appreciation of the characters. But in this book, when I got to the part where Brianna has left to find her parents, I said aloud \\"It's about d**n time!\\" and by the end of the book I was skipping pages and pages just to find out what happened. And the characters started doing things that made no sense. Eventually between the absurd plot twists and the descriptive passages that just went on and on and on, I got to the point where found myself talking back to the book (\\"Arggh\\" and \\"You've gotta be kidding!\\" are prime, printable examples) and, alas, losing interest.Don't get me wrong - there are very riveting and entertaining parts to the book but overall I thought that Gabaldon wasted too much prose on things that didn't further the plot or enhance the characters, only to gloss over areas rife with potential. What about Brianna's memories of Frank (we only learned that he taught her to shoot - what else did they share?), her time living alone since her mother's departure, her arrival/stay at Lallybroch, her observations of her mother's relationship with Jaime and how she finally resolves her issues regarding her mother's betrayal of Frank? We hear at the end of the book that she's seen one marriage with love and one marriage without, and would choose love instead of settling. Really!?! And what were her observations and thoughts that brought her to this conclusion, anyway??My other gripe with this book is that that Gabaldon obviously thought up the scenario concerning Roger/Jamie/Steven Bonnet simply find a mechanism by which Brianna and Roger get stranded in the 18th century. Come on!! These ploys (mistaken identity, misinterpretation of overheard conversations) are shockingly unoriginal, used in TV sitcoms and by lazy writers who can't think of any other way to get the characters do what they want them to. I know by her previous examples that she's not lazy and has created characters and stories that while they require a little suspension of disbelief, still worked because they at least seemed plausible and in alignment with what we understood about the characters. It would have been much more interesting if Gabaldon had developed Brianna into a person whose decisions and actions actually made sense. Instead of taking stock of her situation and making a well thought out decision, Brianna instead had the decision forced upon her, so to speak, and was turned into a victim. I suppose my disappointment in this book is so much greater because the author had set the bar so high with her previous entries in the series.I'll keep plowing ahead and read the remaining two books in the series, but seeing that The Fiery Cross has only a 3-star average rating, I'll continue with much less excitement, afraid that I'll be disappointed again."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"We love Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. We have the 1st four on CD now.It is good to actually begin to see the transition from Scotland to America and the upheaval that happened in that time prior to the American Revolution. So often we get an English Centric view of that time. So often we look at only the French and Indian War - which was actually called the 7 years war in Europe - and go no further. Diana begins to tie in events in Scotland, England, France, and the colonies, and how they flowed from events in Scotland.Since I have always loved time travel and science fiction, I enjoy the interplay between the present and the past, and the historical research showing what goes on in the past. I thought her loops of information were interesting too.Since I have done some geneological research, I am well aware of the tediousness at times, but the joy in the discovery as well. I thought she did a great job in adding this to the story.I love the way she brings customs of the time to the forefront, like witch trials, french court manners, travel documents, \\"Hand Fasting\\", and the gathering of the clans to name a few.The one thing about her books that I don't like is the one sexually explicit scene in each of the books so far that I could have done without. The Black Jack Randall interegation in the \\"Outlander\\", the visit with the French King in the \\"Dragon Fly in Amber\\", the Plantation Scene in \\"Voyager\\", and the Rape Scene in the \\"Drums of Autumn\\". These scenes actually were not just gratuitous, and they actually were critical to the story. But it certainly made it hard to listen with kids in the car.Dan McMillen"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"After my first reading of this book, I really disliked Jamie for his ultra-violent streak. On my second reading, I'm still bothered some by it. This time around I found myself, instead, actively hating Brianna. She behaves like a spoilt biotch and treats Roger like absolute crap. Roger has risked his life for her repeatedly and we come to find out she \\"isn't sure\\" she wants to be with him? I for one wouldn't have sat in the circle for three days. I'd be OUTTA THERE.Diana Gabaldon obviously paints her characters vividly enough that you can develop real feelings toward them, negative or not-and you might surprise yourself on your second (or third or fourth!) reading of the series. These characters (these people?)feel like family and friends.Due to its graphic violence and often disturbing subject matter, I am still very hesitant to recommend the series to certain people. After all, they might cause a heart attack in anyone who's been on a steady diet of Harlequin-type romance books.On to the Fiery Cross!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"In this fourth installment of the Outlander time-travel historical-romance series, our hero Claire Fraser is now a settler in pre-revolutionary Colonial America. Her story alternates with that of her daugher, Brianna in the 1960's. Brianna is seeking to re-unite with her mother as well as pursue a romance with Roger MacKenzie.Claire is caught up in the day-to-day struggles of pioneer living, and has the dual perspective of 18th century and 20th century technology in her healing practice, though of course not the tools of 20th century technology. Exposure to the medicinal practices of Native Americans helps supplement her knowledge and pharmacopeia. Claire settles in to a new stage in her marriage and develops a deeper more stable relationship. Her daughter's decision to travel in time to see her mother causes Claire and Jamie to relate to one another as parents for the first time.Book four has a more settled feel to it as Claire and Jamie put down roots. Gabaldon does an excellent job of evoking the beauty, sorrow and fragility of life in the 18th century. The colorful adventures of the Caribbean are behind us though the exigencies of Brianna's relationship with Roger and her father seem a little contrived and overdramatic at times--they seem calculated to cause a more passionate re-union. While this overwrought element of drama was unnecessary, the book on whole works and is a worthy continuation of the Outlander series. At this point, I still want more!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"\\"Drums of Autumn\\" was a fantastic book...though at times sad... I can tell you that in order to apprecaite this story, you MUST read it as part of a series. While I enjoyed getting to know Roger and Brianna better, I have to admit that a part of me mourns the youth of Jamie and Claire..all of those years that they lost!!! Well, at least theyre together now...another thing that got to me was the decision that young Ian comes to in this book..however I cant deny that it was completely in his character to do as he did....anyways, if you love the \\"Outlander\\" series as much as I do..then you really MUST read this book...I think youll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I loved the first three book in this series, with the first two being particularly special to me. But I have to say, this installment just isn't as good, and it's all the fault of Brianna. What was Gabaldon thinking?Brianna is supposed to be an historian, but she runs around Colonial America saying things like, &quot;I don't need a father for my baby!&quot; and insisting on wearing pants, as if she has no idea what kinds of real-life consequences awaited illegitimate children and unfeminine women at that time. Anyone who knows anything about that time, as an historian would be expected to do, would know that it wasn't the 1960's, but Brianna just blithely goes along, not caring what the consequences may be. I was so irritated with her I almost gave up on the book several times.Luckily I didn't, because it is a very good story otherwise, and I particularly like Roger Wakefield, although I couldn't understand why he would be in love with someone as irresponsible as Brianna. John Gray is indeed a great character, and Claire and Jaime, while maybe not as exciting as they once were, are still a great couple.A solid read, but needs less of the daughter and more of her parents. I also want them to go back to Scotland."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"starting with Outlander and reading all books until you reach Drums of Autum.

It turned out to be one of those books you just can't put down. Then it was searching the used book stores for the next three novels. The same theme and characters are in all four novels. I thoroughly enjoyed the historical as well as fanciful aspects of all. Try to read the books in the order in which they were written for the most enjoyment."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"My husband says I read these books like they're bibles. I started reading Outlander 3 months ago, and haven't stopped reading. Since then, I've read the unabridged version on audio cassette (HIGHLY recommended)at least three times, and each book at least that many times. I pick up one of the books at least every day, flip it open to a random page and read for an hour. I've never read a book, let alone a series of books, that left me craving for more like this.I said it already, but for those of you who haven't listened to the unabridged version of Outlander....DO IT! Davina Porter (reader) is absolutely fantasitc. She gives a voice to the characters of my obsession."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I bought all four books and read them one right after the other. I couldn't put any of them down, as a found myself so caught up in the story. And Jamie....I could just picture this handsome, wild looking Scotsman. I also enjoyed reading about the history and people of that time, which Ms. Gabaldon brought to life.After finishing the fourth book, the only thing I found disappointing was that it had to end, and I felt like I was left hanging and there should have been more. Now I hear there is likely a fifth and sixth book...great. This story is not over yet! I will anxiously await these books, and I will definitely re-read the set again."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Diana Gabaldon is a wonderful story teller! I can hardly wait for the next book to be finished so I can continue on with the story."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Thank you Diana for this marvelous series.After Outlander, Dragonfly, and Voyager, I wasn't sure how you were going to go.

Give me more!!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The only bad thing about these books is that they ended. I wanted them to go on &amp; on! Full of history &amp; romance, I have since looked up 18th century Scotland to find out more of that time period. I fell in love with Jamie &amp; truly admired Claire, hope I could be as clever &amp; resourseful in that situation. Makes you wonder what it would be like to suddenly whisked back 200 years. I've read them all twice!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I have read all four of her books and I couldn't read fast enough to get through them all. Breathtaking, very interesting look into the past. My only criticism would be that I found Clare did not gripe enough about missing modern commodities...I know I would have. Those &quot;good old days&quot; were sometimes not so good...no washing machines, dryers, dishwashers, lightweight lingerie, cosmetics, antiseptics,etc.QUESTION: Where is the fifth book that was supposed to come out in Autumn 1999? called &quot;The Fiery Cross&quot;. Where and when can I get it?"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This book entralled me from the first word at the beginning to the last word on the last page. This author has a rare gift for giving us what our hearts desire: Hope for love everlasting, Oneness with our mates and the sense that love can survive anything if the two people are well matched. The story heightened all my senses as I read. She took me there, I could see and feel what was going on, my emotions were on red alert. Seldom has an author taken me to such heights. This wasn't just a pretty love story, the historical aspects cried out to my scots blood and entwined with my intimate imagination. I thank the author for her research and power to take me on a trip that I'll want to experience over and over. I look forward to the rest of the series and rereading the whole series in years to come!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"A friend gave me Outlander for my birthday two years ago, and I showed it to my grandmother, who, by chance, had the three other books. The history that is incorporated in these books shows a little of the history of our family, being of Scottish descent. I am moved by these fabulous stories. I just finished Drums of Autumn, and am anxiously awaiting the next installment in the on-going saga of Jamie and Claire's love story. I'm going to have to go back and re-read the previous three again, just so I can get my fix."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I have never read a series of books as compelling as this one. I don't usually keep books after reading them, but I've made an exception in this case. These four books are very treasured possessions. Can't wait for the next in the series! Keep up the great work Mrs. Gabaldon! Your novels are superb!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"This is, by far, the best series of books I have ever read! It is extremely difficult to put them down. A person can't help but fall in love with all of the characters, especially Jamie Fraser. It makes one wonder if there are any men out there that can compare.....I know I will be impatiently awaiting book number five!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I loved the way Jamie and Claire were written. They are my favorite charaters. I feel like I;m right there with them. Brianna and Roger were alright. Some of the book was really slow. I loved Outlander and Vogager though. I still plan to buy any more books in this series. I also plan to read this again."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I've read Ms Gabaldon's first four books and found them to be some of the best time I ever spent. I can't wait for the fifth one. She is one of the most detailed and entertaining writers of historical romance I've ever had the pleasure of spending time with both in the books and on the audio tapes!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Only a very few books of the same length (and weight) of Drums of Autumn are able to maintain an even level of interest (or rather fascination) throughout the entire story. While reading the novel I was struck by the candid, deft &quot;voice&quot; of the author as she continued the story of the very passionate, very human Frasers... Though some of the newer characters were less well developed (lacking the same degree of introspection from the previous novels) they were perfectly believable in their actions and misadventures... Add a plot line ingeniously entangled, accentuated with exquisite detail (highly commendable), and viola! you have a novel of the highest caliber..."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The only problem i have had with this series is when i finished all 4 books.I can't wait for #5. Diana we love you."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"These are the best book I have ever read, thanks to my husband introducing them to me. Not only is my family my life but so are the main characters of Claire and Jamie. Diana Gabaldon's sense of description to details is extremely lifelike and makes the reader feel that they are actually there in the scene. When you finish reading the Outlander book, the life of the characters remain with you--ALWAYS."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"What a story-teller Ms Gabaldon is. The entire Outlander series is full of love, life, history, day to day life, wonderfully rich characters and each book is a must read. I have read each book (approx 1000 pages each) twice and am in the middle of my third read in preparation for the sequeals release. And my fingers are crossed that this book won't be the last. Claire and Jamie feel like they are part of me and it is with regret that I close each book.

It is worth reading and it is as amazing as her first three books."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I gobble down books. Drums of Autumn, while a laudable addition to the Outlander series, was not a book I couldn't put down. In fact, I did. It took me over a week to finish, with one large sitting at the beginning and a larger one at the end. For fans of the series only.***Spoilers*** In short, Jamie and Claire, newly reunited, are now settled in North Carolina's extensively described wilderness (and, though a NC horticulturalist myself in the heart of scrub-forest country, I have never waxed so fully on the beauty of pine savannas nor do I ever plan to) - an action in and of itself taking a 1/3rd the novel. Much of the rest is devoted to their daughter, Brianna, and her would-be lover Roger trying to find the pair in the past, and the Comedy of Errors that results once everyone finds everyone else, however unknowing all parties to having found each other. *** End Spoilers***All in all, as before stated Drums of Autumn proves to be Outlander's weakest link. And, as fond as I am of this series, it still only gets 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"Great Book once you get through the first 100 pages or so, then I couldn't put it down.

What an amazing love story!!!"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The book came quicky and was in excellent shape. The book itself is really, really wonderdul!This is some of the best historical fiction I have ever read. I'm re-reading the entire series."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"A little scattered, with multiple shifting narratives, this fourth installment is still enjoyable for those who have been smitten with the Scottish Highlander Jamie and his time shifting wife Claire. I actually didn't find the book boring like some reviewers have, I just found it repetitious. Where the arrival of some characters from the earlier books are welcome and fun (Lord John for example) there is a recycled element to the book that left me wanting less of Brianna and her betrothed Roger, and more of Jamie and Claire. Once again she employs a pretty generic and stock villain who left me wondering is somebody always going to be raped in these stories?And while the first three books had some pretty terrific climaxes, this kind of peters out with a whimper. Still, the fact that this woman can clock a book in a over a thousand pages and still make it hard to put down, any quibbles feel pretty minor."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I continued on with the series because of my curiosity of what would happen to Jamie and Claire. This is a testament to the wonderful way Gabladon can weave a story with the magic of words. She has an excellent grasp of the English language. She is not a trite nor is she a cliched author. This takes talent. However, in this book more than the others, the character development is at its weakest - often making the characters seem one dimensional. I am not any more fond of Claire here than in any of the other books - possibly because I still have a huge issue with her waiting 20 years to inquire about the fates of all the people she knew in the 1700's (it still took Roger telling her about Jamie - she never asked). Yes, as I stated in another review, this was a plot device to bring us to the American Revolution. I could have lived without this if there was more in-depth, emotional study of Jamie and Claire. Why, oh why, can this woman never be without Frank's wedding ring? If she stayed with Frank out of convenience and Jamie is her &quot;heart&quot; as she once tells Brianna (Voyager), what gives with the band? When Jamie offers it back to her at the end of Drums and she accepts it back by having Jamie put it on her, I asked my husband for a male point of view. He told me he would have not stayed with a woman like Claire in Outlander let alone through the rest of the books. The wedding band would have been the last straw for him. Personally, I would have taken off Frank's band in Outlander when I did not go back through the stones and chose to stay with Jamie. Then to have a petulant child such as Brianna for a daughter, I really found myself questioning Jamie's choice in women. It is a testament to Gabaldon as a writer that her work can draw so much discussion. And, I will say it again - she took some risks as an unknown author that I applaud - they, for the most part, worked wonderfully well. I was more than glad to see an author show a couple past their 30's enjoying a healthy, active love life - too many shy away from this. It is a good author that can take stories that have been done before and do them differently enough to make them seem fresh and new. After all, there are only 7 stories to be told. Yes, I will continue to read the series - they are entertaining, though when they come out, I will not be rushing out to buy them. It will be interesting to see how Gabaldon does with her works that will not have Jamie and Claire (her contemporary mysteries). I only hope she works on her character development as much as she works on her plot lines and research. Finally, I will say I respect Gabaldon for having a dream and following it with both guns blazing and not being sucked into any kind of vortex of putting something out quickly that may not have had any kind of quality whatsoever just to make money (as so many authors do these days)."},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"The first book of Diana Galbaldon I read was Dragonfly in Amber. What a great story. I then went back and read Outlander. I could hardly wait for Voyager and eagerly anticipated Drums of Autumn. The first two books held me spellbound for hours. I would read before going to sleep, dream of Jamie and Claire, and arise early to begin the drama again. Diana Gabaldon has the ability to draw her readers into the story and bring characters to live. Voyager was not as great as the first two books and Drums of Autumn was a disappointment. The story of Briana and Roger was great to explore - could have been been more in depth. I believe it would have been in better sequence to develop their lives in the past without the complication of Jamie and Claire. Afterall, they are very dynamic characters and overshadow all present. At the end, the two groups could meet which would lead into the 5th book of the series. Fergus which was so prevelent in the last two books was only mildly mentioned in this book. It was a bit disjointed. Hopefully, the 5th book of the series will be a while in coming and allow Ms Gabaldon the opportunity to layout the book in her normal fashion. Don't be in a hurry to &quot;Get another book on the market.&quot; Good things come to those that wait"},{"Title":"Drums of Autumn Hardcover First Edition","review":"I had long sworn off romance novels. One day out of boredom, I was browsing the romance section at the bookstore and picked up Outlander. I ended up sitting on the floor to read more and then ended up buying the book. Books Two and Three affected me the same way. I couldn't wait to get home from work, get dinner for the family, and then sit and read more about Claire and Jamie (especially Jamie!) My husband kept asking me what I was reading and why I was smiling so much! The fourth book I have not even finished. I have no interest in picking it up. Though I wanted to see Jamie and Claire's story continue and didn't want to give the characters up, I think I'd rather go back and reread the first three books than buy books 5 and 6. Diana Gabaldon is an extremely gifted writer, but I think she should have stopped after three. I personally do not want to see Jamie die or read about them at 70 or 80 years of age! As to a movie?

Its audience is also limited due to it focusing in the American industry and its organizations.It provides some insights on how this industry operates, and its political and economic aspects. It helps to understand why flying is expensive, and why we should distrust cheap airspace companies.I have found the text too sensationalist, full of crashes and deaths figures, but lacking a proper context. For example, the appendix contains a list of air accidents reported by the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board) where fatalities numbers are provided; but these number of fatalities, without the context of how many passengers have flown, is useless.It is also political bias, where for example, the impact of Reagan's Deregulation is very hardly criticized.In summary, I enjoyed the reading because I have some experience in this sector, but it should be considered that it presents a too pessimistic view on air traffic for those users who aren't aware of some of its internal details."},{"Title":"Cooking for Heart and Soul: 100 Delicious Low-Fat Recipes from San Francisco's Top ChefsA Cookbook to Benefit the San Francisco Food Bank","review":"Although some of the recipes contain exotic ingredients that may be hard to get in some areas, many are relatively simple and incredibly delicious!

Send me a $50 no strings gift card and I'll forgive you."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"In a nutshell, Black Beauty's overarching story is about a single horse's experiences though it's life and the accounts that it hears from other horses. But, the underlying (and very repetative) message is this. Alcohol is the ruin of all creatures (aka the \\"Devil's drink\\"), Bearing reins (or \\"the fashion\\") is terrible for horses, overworking yourself (and the horse) will do you more harm than good, and people should be more thoughtful of others (humans and horses).Going into this book, I thought this was going to be an adventure; something akin to Homeward Bound or Benji. But instead, I was subjected to each chapter being a moral lesson in itself. Here is a rundown of how almost every chapter (of which there are nearly 40 -broken into 4 parts-) plays out.1.) An injustice is done to a horse and is either witnessed or detected by another person.2.) Said witness/detector confronts the person committing the injustice and speaks to them about it.3.) Either the person hearing this advice takes heed and makes a commitment to change for the better, suffers some kind of misfortune for continuing their wretched ways, or is reported by the authorities and is fined or jailed.I'm only guessing here, but I think the author possibly designed this book to be read in chapter bites. I only suggest this because reading this book straight through is a grind (to say the least). I seemed to continuously run across the exact same moral lessons being played out in different settings (or by other horses).So would I recommend this book to someone else. No.There is almost nothing redeeming about it.It makes you feel like people -for the most part- are either ignorate, irresponsible, awful, and/or inconsiderate, the repetition of the messages that it's trying to get across is a chore (and in the case of the bearing rein, almost irrelevant), and there isn't really much of a story to even get out of it in the end.Sadly, this is just another \\"Classic\\" that has confused me as to why it's as highly regarded as it is."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Being a classic there is no need to review the story, I think.Like so many of the Amazon free classics, this book is not really optimised for an ereader. The table of contents does not link to the chapters, each new chapter begins in mid page and the chapter heading is in plain text so the whole thing feels like one massive block of text. Granted, it is free, so one should not complain, but it seems like Amazon is missing out on an opportunity here.However, in the end I opted for the Project Gutenberg version [gutenberg.org] which is also free and much more attractive in layout and formatting."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Ordered for my kindle and it is an awesome book to have.

First published in 1877, \\"Black Beauty\\" is a storyabout a horse who faced different kind of trials, and sold to different owners withdifferent attitudes. Back in the 1800's Horses are the only way of transportation in London,England. The owners treat their horses not very far from how they treat their automobilesnowadays. For example, they made horses work nonstop, riding them and not making the horse rest, treating it not like a living thing but a machine. Sewell, cleverly wrote this book\\"Black Beauty\\" before she passed away, hoping that the story will touch the reader and to anyone who owns a pet. The story has a lot of moral values that readers will surely learn.I love this book very much, as it came to be my sons favorite bedtime story."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book was very good and at times sad.It was quite moving as well.If you are looking for a classic for kids,you have hit the jackpot!!!!!:)"},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I first read this book when I was ten or eleven, and, although I cried at the sad, sad parts, I still loved the book. One reason I loved it was because it was told from the point of view of the horse, Black Beauty. The things that the horse observed and narrated seemed very real to me: the kind of things a horse would observe and be concerned about. By the time I read this book I was already reading a junior edition of the Sherlock Holmes stories, set in the same Victorian time period (although Holmes was a bit later), so I enjoyed being in that world and learning more about the horses who pulled cabs, the drivers, people who owned horses, the abuse of horses, and their rescue. Many other reviewers of this book have observed that Sewell taught people to be kind to others, gentle, and patient, through this story. I agree.I read this book again as an adult and was struck not only by the beauty of Black Beauty's story, but also by the writing, which flows effortlessly. A good way to introduce tweens and teens to horses, to empathy, and to doing the right thing in life."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Black Beauty by Anna Sewell is a nonfiction and adventurous story told by a horse named Black Beauty.

I thought that Black Beauty was very inspiring, especially in animal cruelty. All the things that said how some people could really treat animals is unbelieveable. The part I like best of this is when he was born and how he always stayed by his mother when he was a colt until he was old enough to hang out with the other colts.Another part that I liked about this book is at the end where he finally found peace in the pasture from his bitter hard life that he had that wore him down. The worst part I disliked about this book was how Ginger(black beauty's obsession)died from being over worked and beaten so many times, that it killed her. Also when a drucken man rode him, and knew that his shoe was falling off, still did and made him go faster so the nail dug into his hoof and knew that it hurted him so badly, and it got so harsh that he fell to the ground on his knees, and cut them up badly.

This book allows you to see an animals perspective of life."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Animal books that are told from the creature's point of view (whether cat, dog, horse, or some other species entirely) are a dime a dozen these days, but \\"Black Beauty,\\" was the first book of its kind to use this technique and thus the forerunner to all animal stories that came after it. Most people are unaware that Anna Sewell broke new literary ground when she wrote \\"Black Beauty\\" in the style of an autobiography, though ironically she never meant it to be a children's story at all. Instead she intended that it would be read by those that work with horses: \\"to induce kindness, sympathy, and an understanding treatment of horses.\\"Beauty is one of several names given to the horse that grows throughout the story from a young colt in a farmyard to an elderly stallion enjoying his retirement, chronicling all his experiences, both good and bad, in between. These include being the horse of a squire, a cabby, a gentleman and a cart driver among others, as well as events that are probably known even to those who haven't read the book, such as the fire in the barn and the washed-out bridge.Throughout his life he meets several other horses such as cheerful Merrylegs and feisty Ginger who recount their stories to him; and it's difficult not to get a little choked up when it comes to Ginger and her tragic tale, especially when she tells Beauty at their final meeting: \\"you are the only friend I ever had.\\" For many children, Ginger's story may well have been their first experience with the portrayal of death in a story - I know it was mine, and I never forgot it.Since being published in 1877, the story has lost none of its power, and the image of a black horse with a white star on his forehead is universally recognized as the iconic Black Beauty. Not only this, but the novel is credited with driving the bearing rein out of fashion, a device that was popular in the Victorian age but which damaged horses' necks by forcing them upright at an unnatural angle, and is also believed to have made a difference in reducing the taxicab licence fee of the time, (something that was often exploited by those that hired out cabbies to drivers), not to mention heightening the awareness of animal cruelty at a time when animal welfare simply didn't exist.As such \\"Black Beauty\\" can be described as the first animal rights book, told in first-person narrative from the (literal) horse's mouth, criticizing things such as docking (that is, cutting off horse's tails), the aforementioned bearing reins, and the long, hard hours of work that horses had to endure. The trick of it though, is that the issues never seem particularly moralizing or heavy-handed because it's all told by the horses themselves. It doesn't take much of a stretch of the imagination to assume that if horses were capable of talking to each other, they would discuss the cruelties and kindnesses that human beings mete out upon them.This is effectively portrayed by the sheer confusion of the animals as to why humans act in certain ways; such as Beauty pondering why human beings endanger both themselves and their horses in fox hunting, or why so much pain is inflicted on animals for the sake of fashion, asking: \\"What right have they to torment and disfigure God's creatures?\\"Likewise, the first-person narrative gives a perspective on the life of a horse that had probably never occurred to Sewell's original audience (or indeed, her contemporary readers), has when Beauty discusses how it feels to wear a bit:\\"Those who have never had a bit in their mouths cannot think how bad it feels. A great piece of cold hard steel as thick as a man's finger is pushed into one's mouth, between one's teeth and over one's tongue. It ends come out at the corner of your mouth and are held fast there by straps over your head, under your throat, round your nose, and under your chin, so that in no way in the world can you get rid of the nasty hard thing.\\"Towards the end of the book, it does start to get slightly more preachy, mainly due to the fact that Sewell begins to dwell on issues such as alcohol, elections and religion that have no bearing on the horses at all, but are merely being discussed by the humans around them. However, this aspect is thankfully minor and doesn't detract too much from Beauty's own story.I have a particular soft-spot for \\"Black Beauty\\" considering Anna Sewell is lurking up in my family tree somewhere (on my grandmother's side), and the fact that the memories of reading this book as a child have always stayed with me. This is an essential book for any children's library in order to cultivate empathy for the animal kingdom, but is also valuable reading for an adult as well, not just for the ur-example of an animal tale, but as a thoughtful, bittersweet and well-researched look into the life of man's second-best friend."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Though you can't seem to skip back and forth from chapter to chapter the whole of the book is great"},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book is a timeless classic that everyone enjoys.

She does what few authors of her time did, and many do now, but with much greater charm and imagination. She makes 'Black Beauty', a young stallion growing up to be a 'working horse' in 19th century England both her hero and her narrator. We see the story of horses, places and people Beauty knows through his own eyes, and we feel the grounding truth of the story even more that way, And that's why this book is still a classic read, for ages 8 to 98+. I can't recommend it too highly. You will be transported to a very different, and yet a very familiar time and place, in which wise horses and foolish ones, foolish people and compassionate ones live and work and learn how much they depend on one another.Rielle"},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"When Black Beauty is just a young colt, his mother warns him that a horse's life is often difficult.

Throughout this truly touching book we see things from the point of view of the horse. We meet men, both good and bad. We see selfishness, abuse and neglect. We see that the horse wants little more than to be treated decently. Luckily for Beauty he is reunited with a kind man from his early days.This story is recommended for all ages.

However, the second time I picked it up I studied it more carefully and was so moved that I couldn't read through to the end.This book made me so sad and so angry and yet I am glad that I read it because I now have more respect for animals - horses in particular...."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book should be a prerequisite for anyone owning a horse as it acts in some ways as kind of owners manual. Since horses are no longer used for everyday transportation and labor however, the book loses some impact, but it is still a very well written and insightful book which captures a period in history where steam engines are just starting to replace horses. The country is on the verge of an industrial revolution and you can feel man's pressure from society to go faster, longer, and harder. Anna Sewell seems troubled that this increased pace may ruin and wear out men as easily as it starts to wear out the horses. The effects on the horses are only a warning to what is to come for man unless something is done. She shows the effects of working 7 day weeks without a rest, as well as 14 hour days. Sewell also mentions many other topics which animal rights supporters have picked up in later years. An example of this would be a few shots she takes at people who do harm to animals out of the sake of fashion without any regard for the animals. She also mentions several scenarios of animal abuse and makes comparisons to child abuse. She believes people who do not stand up when they see injustices are just as guilty as the perpetrators. The horse 'Black Beauty' is given many human qualities which is very effective. I do not know if a modern day book about love of cars would be as effective as the love that is shown in this book for a living animal. On a side note, I'd be curious what Anna Sewell's opinion would have been on euthanasia. Whenever she mentions horses getting old and unable to do their work, several times she says it would be better for them to be put out of their misery with a bullet to the head. This is a little disturbing to me since these horses all have such human characteristics. Overall though the thing that comes through the most is Anna Sewell's sincere love of these animals."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Black Beauty is a black horse that is sold to many horse owners. He lives a horrible and also an exciting life. He was born in a wealthy enviroment. However, his mistress becomes seriously ill, and Black Beauty is sold. He goes along well until he is resold again. Unfortunately, this owner is cruel. Eventhough Black Beauty was born from a kind master, he soon realizes that not all people are like that. He finds out that some are careless and cruel masters. He finally lands into cart-pulling in the streets of London. FOr the final time, he is sold to a young man named Joe Green. This was his recent master that Black Beauty met when Joe was just 13 years old. Black Beauty stays there for the rest of his life.I actually really liked and enjoyed this book. I liked it because I think that it teaches us about life somtimes. Like Black Beauty, sometimes when we have a roof over our heads with plenty of food, we do not realize how hard and difficult it is when we are poor. Black Beauty learned this when he was sold to a cruel master other then a kind master. Some of the masters are so cruel, but no matter what, Black Beauty always tries his hardest to accomplish it. This is somewhat related to our life. Eventhough it writes about a life of a horse, I really think that this book teaches many morals that can really relate to our everyday life.My favorite part is when he is at the auction. It gave me a cliff hanger that wanted me to read on. At the auction, he is at the broken down and trodden part of the fair. Black Beauty looks around and sees all these old horses, he pities him and he thinks that he does not belong here. This part made me realize that sometimes people do that at school. At the auction Black Beauty is bought by a farmer that sees that Black Beauty was born from a good breeding ground. I think that Black Beauty well deserved this special and kind family."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Black Beauty was the tale of a horse named Beauty's life.

At the time that \\"Black Beauty\\" was written the owners were abusing the animals in any way you can think of. Anna Sewell sure did not think that way, she felt that animals should be taken care of like a family members. Anna Sewell heard the cries of the animals and decided to get the word out to the people. Anna Sewell decided to write a book about an animal, she decided to write a book about a strong young horse named Black Beauty. Anna Sewell titled the book \\"Black Beauty\\". Black Beauty is a novel about a gorgeous black horse. Black Beauty is described as being a young, solid, black houses that is kind and loving on the inside. From the beginning Black Beauty is abused by it's owners. Every time Black Beauty tries to show its owner respect and that the fact that it loves its owner Black Beauty gets punished for something that no one understands. Black beauty is treated like nothing more than a peace of dirt. Its owner does not care what so ever happens to the horse, they hardly give the horse food and somewhat a little bit of water. Every now and than Black Beauty gets sold to a different owner no better then the last one before. Second owner seemed to be a little more open minded and actually bothered to give the horse food and water every day, but as old times the horse began to be abused by the new owner and the family member s as well. Only people who could afford a horse at the time were the very rich people who are known to care less then others most of the time. So after a while the owners seemed to get tired of the and just care less for it. As time passed Black Beauty became tired and began the habit of throwing off amateur riders. Because of that habit Black Beauty was sold again. This time to a lovely lady who really wonted to help the horse. She took care of Black Beauty like it was one of her own family members. She brushed Black Beauty every day and never kept it cold, she also never kept Black Beauty in hunger and loneliness. Black Beauty was promised never to be sold again, and has nothing to fear of. All the troubles were over for him now. Now he could stand under the apple trees with his old friends and not have to think about what is going to happen next tomorrow in its life. Recommendation: I recommend this book to teenagers because it is a very interesting book to read, it can also teach a few lessons about life."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Black Beauty was an exelent book by Anna Sewell! Black Beauty was one of the best books that I have ever read. Black Beauty was very loved at Squire Gordon's but one day he is forced to sell him. Black Beauty is poorly taken care of in his new home. Black Beauty's knees are broken in a careless accedent. Black Beauty is sold and re-sold until one lucky day........To find out get your own copy or rent in a local library."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 12. I still love it, and I still cry when I read it. No, it is not the best crafted book I have ever read. But it still teaches us great things about love, and caring, and fate and suffering. I can't wait my daughter to grow up for us to read &quot;Black Beauty&quot; together."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"We often talk about teaching children values, but in most cases children's literature is insipid and of no lasting value. BLACK BEAUTY, however, is both valuable as art and valuable for the virtues it teaches: kindness, common sense, and helping those who cannot help themselves. The book is well written in clean prose. It does not over reach the &quot;reading child,&quot; nor does it talk down to him. And although it is touching and occasionally sad, it is not in the least sentimental.The story, of course, is about Black Beauty, a handsome horse who is born and raised in happy circumstances. But in Victorian England horses were used much as we use cars today: they were things to be bought and sold and then gotten rid of when they were no longer useful. Black Beauty is first sold to a good home, but as time passes he is sold again and again--and not always to people who treat him kindly or even to those who give him common care.There are adventures aplenty, like a stable fire and a dangerous bridge; there are many memorable characters, like the horse Ginger and the kind cabbie Jerry. All of them are seen from Black Beauty's point of view, and beautifully, perfectly described. My mother read this book to me, and as soon as I could I was anxious to read it myself; now, some thirty years later I have stumbled once more upon it. And I can honestly say that it lives up to my memory: it is a fine book, and one that every parent should place in the hands of their children. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This is a beautiful chapter book for a child who is reading at around a 5th grade level to read alone. Black Beauty is a classic. We all know that it tells the life story of an English riding horse from his own point of view. What can be harder to remember is how deftly it teaches children about the importance of kindness to their fellow creatures.During the course of his lifetime, Beauty experiences the best and the worst humanity has to offer its companion animals. Children old enough to read this book will just be developing the kind of empathy skills necessary to understand how important kindness is, even, and perhaps especially, to those who cannot verbalize their gratitude.The book teaches kids to notice how they and their peers treat others, and I have been buying it for all of the kids in my life for as long as I can remember.I particularly like this edition because it is unabridged (the story is perfect), and because the illustrations are enchanting. I'd give it a hundred stars if I could."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Since pictures &amp; illustrations are as much a part of a child's imagination as the written word, then this book beautifully combines both, with the abundant B&amp;W line illustrations by illustrator Lucy Kemp-Welch, in addition to the 12 colour plates included - all in keeping with the time period this novel is set in. A wonderful edition to any child's library.I've been reading horse-topic related books for as long as I can remember; but the very 1st horse story that left an indelible impression on me was ANNA SEWELL's &quot; BLACK BEAUTY &quot;.It really openend my eyes as to the abuse and cruelty - and majestic fraility - that these wonderful creatures suffer at the hands of their human counterparts.Ms Sewell opted to write this book from &quot; the horse's point of view &quot; and she was one of the very few authors that was able to pull this off with such great success.This book also, laid the cornerstone for the ASPCA aims and goals, and brought to light the conditions and treatment of working horses in 20th century London, England ( and elsewhere ).The story is such a wonderful tale of a horse's life from start to finish; told with a quiet dignity and warmth - and serves as a successful analogy also, as to how humans should interact with one another.This book also laid the cornerstone for my interest and love of horses, and further spurred my interest in reading about all things Equine.From there, and I went on to read all of Walter Farley's &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; series ( I used to collect the hardcover editions), and Marguerite Henry's books, and National Velvet(which really wasn't about a horse per se, but more about a little girl who's dreams come true), and anything else I could get my horsey-hungry hands on!I now keep a copy of Anna Sewell's &quot;Black Beauty&quot; in my library at home, and have given a copy to my daughter to read.This is a tale that sensitizes the reader to the plight of horses at the hands of their human caregivers, trainers, etc - all told from the horse's mouth ( so to speak )..!And lest we think that the inhumane treatment of horses has abided since this book was written - one only has to follow the controversy surrounding the use of &quot;Premarin&quot;, or abusive training methods of gaited horses, or the Thoroughbred racing industry, or rodeo...etc.There is still much to be gleaned about the exploitation and abuse of animals from this book - which will always remain a timeless classic.Kim C. Montreal, 05/2000"},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Because it is a well-known classic and a children's perennial favorite, many people do not realize that \\"Black Beauty\\" is an impassioned plea for animal rights, written at a time when such a notion was dismissed as ridiculous. And because it is what it is, sensitive children may need a parent to explain that, thankfully, most of the abuses described in the book are long gone, thanks in part to crusaders like Anna Sewell.In a story that takes place in 19th century England, a gorgeous glossy black colt, who comes to be known as Black Beauty, is born into a life of comfort and kindness. His life is a kind of horsey paradise, until the fortunes of his owners turn...and Black Beauty is sold.Sold to a cruel owner as a cab horse, Beauty is now treated as so many hapless animals were in his day...he is virtually tortured. He is in constant pain. His knees are sore. He is made to wear a \\"check rein,\\" a device that no longer exists, but which scares me to this day because of the impression its description made upon me as a child. It was a type of rein that forced the horse to keep his head up extremely high at an unnatural angle, the more to look \\"elegant.\\" The pain that this rein inflicts upon Beauty is heartbreaking, and it did indeed break my heart to read it.Along the way, Beauty meets other horses, and keeps a lifelong friend, Ginger, who also suffers. Everything comes out alright in the end, in a story that is so tender and yet meaningful at the same time, that it is a shame it is relegated by reputation to the backwaters of so-called \\"children's literature.\\" It was pure muckracking, in the style of the great American muckrakers who came shortly thereafter. Will a child realize this? It's hard to know, but I know that as a child I was simply haunted by the described cruelty to this horse. And of course heartened by the ending. But I have to say that, many decades later, some of the cruelty in this book still upsets me.Therefore, I recommend the book with a caveat: If you have a particularly sensitive or thoughtful child, please warn him or her that Black Beauty is mistreated in the story, but that because of the book, and others like it, such mistreatment of animals no longer exists. And then let your child enjoy the sheer wealth of detail in what really is, in the end, a beautiful story."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Black Beauty is a classic read for any animal lover, however, this is a fact based novel, with vivid descriptions of the various abuses of man upon horse which are still carried on in some forms to this day. At the time this was written, horses were often overloaded and used up before going to the knackers.Really helps get you inside a horse's life and will change how you look at horses and how they are treated, but not for very young children as this is unabridged.I would highly recommend this on so many levels, from the lovely vintage language to the insight into a horse's life and training."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Animal books that are told from the creature's point of view (whether cat, dog, horse, or some other species entirely) are a dime a dozen these days, but \\"Black Beauty,\\" was the first book of its kind to use this technique and is thus the forerunner to all animal stories that came after it. Most people are unaware that Anna Sewell broke new literary ground when she wrote \\"Black Beauty\\" in the style of an autobiography, though ironically she never meant it to be a children's story at all. Instead she intended that it would be read by those that work with horses: \\"to induce kindness, sympathy, and an understanding treatment of horses.\\"Beauty is one of several names given to the horse that grows throughout the story from a young colt in a farmyard to an elderly stallion enjoying his retirement, chronicling all his experiences in between, both good and bad. These include being the horse of a squire, a cabby, a gentleman and a cart driver among others, as well as events that are probably known even to those who haven't read the book, such as the fire in the barn and the washed-out bridge.Throughout his life he meets several other horses such as cheerful Merrylegs and feisty Ginger who recount their stories to him; and it's difficult not to get a little choked up when it comes to Ginger and her tragic tale, especially when she tells Beauty at their final meeting: \\"you are the only friend I ever had.\\" For many children, Ginger's story may well have been their first experience with the portrayal of death in a story - I know it was mine, and I never forgot it.Since being published in 1877, the story has lost none of its power, and the image of a black horse with a white star on his forehead is universally recognized as the iconic Black Beauty. Not only this, but the novel is credited with driving the bearing rein out of fashion, a device that was popular in the Victorian age but which damaged horses' necks by forcing them upright at an unnatural angle, and is also believed to have made a difference in reducing the taxicab licence fee of the time, (something that was often exploited by those that hired out cabbies to drivers), not to mention heightening the awareness of animal cruelty at a time when animal welfare simply didn't exist.As such \\"Black Beauty\\" can be described as the first animal rights book, told in first-person narrative from the (literal) horse's mouth, criticizing things such as docking (that is, cutting off horse's tails), the aforementioned bearing reins, and the long, hard hours of work that horses had to endure. The trick of it though, is that the issues never seem particularly moralizing or heavy-handed because it's all told by the horses themselves. It doesn't take much of a stretch of the imagination to assume that if horses were capable of talking to each other, they would discuss the cruelties and kindnesses that human beings mete out upon them.This is effectively portrayed by the sheer confusion of the animals as to why humans act in certain ways; such as Beauty pondering why human beings endanger both themselves and their horses in fox hunting, or why so much pain is inflicted on animals for the sake of fashion, asking: \\"What right have they to torment and disfigure God's creatures?\\" Likewise, the first-person narrative gives a perspective on the life of a horse that had probably never occurred to Sewell's original audience (or indeed, her first-time contemporary readers), has when Beauty discusses how it feels to wear a bit:\\"Those who have never had a bit in their mouths cannot think how bad it feels. A great piece of cold hard steel as thick as a man's finger is pushed into one's mouth, between one's teeth and over one's tongue. It ends come out at the corner of your mouth and are held fast there by straps over your head, under your throat, round your nose, and under your chin, so that in no way in the world can you get rid of the nasty hard thing.\\"Towards the end of the book, it does start to get slightly more preachy, mainly due to the fact that Sewell begins to dwell on issues such as alcohol, elections and religion that have no bearing on the horses at all, but are merely being discussed by the humans around them. However, this aspect is thankfully minor and doesn't detract too much from Beauty's own story.I have a particular soft-spot for \\"Black Beauty\\" considering Anna Sewell is lurking up in my family tree somewhere (on my grandmother's side), and the fact that the memories of reading this book as a child have always stayed with me. This is an essential book for any children's library in order to cultivate empathy for the animal kingdom, but is also valuable reading for an adult as well, not just for the ur-example of an animal tale, but as a thoughtful, bittersweet and well-researched look into the life of man's second-best friend."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"What girlhood would be complete without reading this tearjerker classic? As a child, there wasn't much I loved more than books, horses and a good cry -- and this provided all three.For those of you who don't know the story, Black Beauty is horse in England during the 19th century. He begins life with a loving master, but due to circumstances is sold several times -- to owners both kind and cruel.Sewell, a Quaker woman, wrote this book (first published in 1877) to enlighten the public. Horses at the time were often beaten, starved and overloaded. Sewell's book, however, became a catalyst for change and ushered in a new way of thinking about the treatment of animals."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"\\"Black Beauty,\\" written by author Anna Sewell, is one of the most famous horse books during the nineteenth century. Part of its achievement consists that the novel is a classic for people with many different characteristics. First published in 1877, \\"Black Beauty\\" continues to enjoy people for new generations of American citizens around the world. Anna Sewell's brilliant account of animal treatment became a historic breakthrough because it was the first book that described a horse's experience in England. \\"An autobiography of a young stallion,\\" this book follows the life of Black Beauty. Throughout the novel, it is told in a creative first person form, as if Beauty was describing and narrating his life. Ms. Sewell chose to write this book from the \\"horses point of view,\\" and she remarkably was able to succeed with her novel. Since Sewell intended on writing this novel in Beauty's point of view, the reader begins to understand the impact of good and treatment towards the horse and his loyal friends. Starter of the Humane Society, the author truly captivates readers with this autobiography of a beautiful, friendly, loving black stallion. In a letter to her friend, Sewell expresses that she hopes \\"Black Beauty will induce kindness, sympathy, and understanding treatment towards horses.\\" From Beauty's happy, enjoyable youth to his pleasant retirement, Anna Sewell ingeniously wrote the book to remind the cruel treatment in the 1800's. Most importantly, Sewell wrote the book in a time where horses were not given the same respect today, and \\"Black Beauty\\" helped to open the eyes of many to the cruelty horses had to suffer. Although Anna Sewell's classic paints a clear picture of the society in London, England, its message is universal and timeless: animals will serve humans well if they are treated with consideration and kindness."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This is a classic and I wouldn't dissuade anyone from reading it if they want. This review is just a warning that this is not a happy book! As a kid I saw the movie, and all I remembered was a scene where Black Beauty was happy and running free. Apparently that was just at the beginning of the book! It's beautifully written and really grabs you as a reader, but if you're a compassionate animal lover and expecting a happy book a beautiful animal and his happy life, you'll want to put this book down."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was a child & my 8-year-old cousin was delighted when I gave it to her. However, though a wonderful story, I was a little disappointed that there were no illustrations. For young children, I think they're almost necessary."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book is very informative and accurate on the time in which it is set. The detail of human relationships and modes of travel, etc. in the time period are an enjoyable bit of history.The hero is most admirable, undergoing difficulty and responding correctly. Whereas White Fang would tear to pieces anyone who mistreated him, Black Beauty suffers in silence as a true hero should--because it takes more courage to accept wrongful blows than it does to stand up for yourself whether you deserve the treatment or not. Black Beauty teaches other excellent principles about the treatment of animals in general and was probably very influential on people who stand up for the \\"rights\\" of animals these days; they have missed the point of Black Beauty. Beauty himself was taught by his mother that a horse should submit to even a bad master, and others in the book make the point that animals should be treated kindly not because they have rights, but because they belong to God.Black Beauty shows the importance of having sympathy for suffering friends, joy for fortunate ones, and of holding onto one's hopes. Though the gentle protagonist loses many friends, he is reunited with others, reinforcing the traditional ideas of good triumphs over evil.This book is appropriate for all those who are old enough to read literature more advanced than See Spot Run. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I give Black Beauty a really good review because this book is a really good book of courage, will to live, and horses.

He meets many horses along the way, all in which he finds a friend, and hears their story. This horse goes from a clueless pony, to a strong, brave stallion.

This classic could be placed in the category of one of the most thrilling and adventurous books of all time. The author Anne Sewell, who has so much compassion towards horses, shows in this novel how cruel men can be towards them or on the other hand how people can understand horses and treat them well.After his birth, Black Beauty learned how to be a fine horse and to do his work properly. At a certain age, like all horses, he was sold. With sadness he left his mother and his first master, but he knew it was time for him to go to work. With his mother's advice \\"Do your work with a good will and lift your feet up well when you trot\\" he walked off with his new master. This was his second of many.Over the years Black Beauty endured mean masters as well as good ones, but he never failed. He kept beautiful souvenirs in his mind while he grew up and grew stronger. Black Beauty became a handsome black horse.One day, during his stay with his second master, the grange where Black Beauty and the other horses lived caught fire. Huge flames roared through the grange threatening all of the horses. Will Back Beauty survive the flames, all of those harsh, cruel, severe owners and all the hard work? Will he, one day, go back to his first home and be reunited with all his friends?This book is suitable for children of ages 9 to 12 and even adults could read and enjoy it.

The main characters are black beauty, some dogs, and some other horses. The things that the animals did in the story were to hang out with their friends. The animals did run into problems like humans cutting the animal's ears and tails off. The animals didn't run into any adventers. My favorite character is the little horse because no one would lease to him. I have done some of the things and felt the same things that the characters do like when on one would listen to me.I like this book because there are wild horses in the story. My favorite part of the story is when the little horse finally got to speak to everyone.

He has been sold three times! It is pretty hard to be broken in in what the people want you to do three different times. He has been whipped many times.

Set in England from a horses point of view of old life back there. If you want a book about a horse, well this book is for you! I adore it, and I hope you do to!"},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I really loved this book because it teaches many good lessons, like patience and willingness to work hard. This horse's life is filled with good times and bad, kind masters and cruel masters. The way Black Beauty loves and tries to do his best for all his masters shows his humble spirit and his need to be loved. He goes through whatever hardship comes his way and his trust in his grooms and his masters is lovely. To hear him speak of how he must do his best in everything and always be good and patient is really heart-warming, and though he is a horse, a very timid and human spirit lives within him. He often speaks of how silly and stupid things like check-reigns and blinkers are and how ignorant certain foolish people can be. He knows that not all people are like that and tries to not show his despair when an amateur is in control. He is truly pious soul and in him I saw the qualities that make a creature beautiful, not only on the outside but on the inside too."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This truly is a timeless classic, a bestseller and groundbreaking book in it's time.It was written by Anna Sewell who was an invalid at the time. It was her first and only book. She had been particularly close to horses due to a childhood injury to both her ankles that limited her walking mobility but not riding.It was one of the first animal biographies written in the first person and highlighted abuses and difficulties that horses faced in their everyday lives in the Victorian era. This book was instrumental in changing the way society looked at animals and horses in particular and changed the way that horses were treated. It is also a treatise of sorts on compassion and how to treat your fellow man and animals. It's quite possibly the first guidebook on the humane treatment of horses.As for the book itself, even more than a hundred years later the writing is still easy to read and follow. It is like an old friend that I can pick up any day and still read with pleasure. The story is poignant and sad but also happy. I highly recommend this book to children and adults who have not read this already, anyone who is interested in animals and especially horses and life in the Victorian era. 5 stars definitely."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This was a gift for my daughter. She asked that family members give her books that had significance in their lives and to inscribe them with a message about the significance of the book. Black Beauty was the first book my mother read as a girl. She is 89 years old, and during the Great Depression the government created a book binding program in her home town. If people brought a book in and donated it to be rebound, they would receive a free library card. My mother's copy of Black Beauty was sorely worn, and she carried to book to the bindery and received her free library card. When I asked her what book she took out first from the library, she responded, \\"Black Beauty!\\""},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Anna Sewell (English Quaker 1820-1878) was one of the first equine advocates, if not the first to write a children's novel about a wonderful horse and the cruelty of man. Black Beauty is the autobiography of a horse.Told from the horse's point-of-view, Black Beauty describes his birth, early training and his fondness for his first master, Squire Gordon, stablemates Ginger and Merrylegs and grooms John and James.For fashion's sake, some owners insisted the grooms harness the carriage horses with their head's held high with the check rein. This made it difficult for the team to pull as well as caused other long term problems. Squire Gordon was against such devices.When James plans on moving on, little Joe Green is trained for his position. The young boy makes a grave error in Beauty's care after the horse is ridden hard to fetch the doctor for the mistress, and the doc rides him hard back. Beauty survives the incident, but when the mistress needs to move due to her illness, all the horses must be sold.After that, Beauty describes his life with various owners. Some are ignorant, some cruel but a handful give him the best care they can including a cab driver. Life is hard, and the author gives details of the cruelty of some grooms, drivers and owners.At least Sewell gives the story a happy ending.I first read this as a teen, before I took riding lessons. Looking back, I think Sewell's insight helped me decide my path on my journey to becoming a professional horsewoman.I would recommend this book for all horse lovers except the very young."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Black Beauty: The Autobiography of a Horse, by Anna Sewell is a spellbinding story of a horse's life in nineteenth century England. This novel is especially interesting because Sewell anthropromorphizes Black Beauty and makes him the first person narrator. The plot of Black Beauty revolves around Beauty's life and interaction with other human and nonhuman animals as well as his sale from one owner to the next. Most importantly, Sewell wrote this novel to call attention to the treatment of animals in nineteenth century England.Sewell organizes this book into four sections. In the first section, Beauty tells the story of his youth with his first two masters: Farmer Grey and Squire Gordon. The author describes Farmer Grey as a man who gave his horses \\"good food, good lodging, and kind words.\\" After Beauty turned four, Farmer Grey sold him to Squire Gordon. Beauty led a relatively comfortable life with Squire Gordon. The only exception was when a new stable boy forgot to cover Beauty with a blanket on a cold night and he became very ill. The first section of the book ends when Gordon is forced to sell Beauty because of his sick wife.In the second section of this book, Beauty's health begins to rapidly deteriorate due to inept owners as well as indolent, corrupt, and abusive grooms. Beauty's first owner after Squire Gordon is a nobleman referred to as the Earl of W-----, who is indifferent to his horses. Beauty's bad situation is made worse after his regular groom leaves and a man by the name of Rueben Smith is left in charge. The climax of this section occurs when Smith drunkenly rides Beauty over a freshly paved road of \\"large sharp stones, over which no horse could be driven quickly without risk of danger.\\" As a result, Beauty's front knees and one hoof were injured and Smith was thrown from the saddle and killed. Due to Beauty's injuries, the Earl of W----- sold him and for the rest of this section, he is passed from one incompetent owner to another.Beauty's luck improves in the third section, after he is purchased by a London cab driver by the name of Jeremiah Barker. Barker is portrayed as a religious, kind, and attentive owner who cares greatly for his horses as well as other people. At one point, Barker even refuses two paying customers to give a free ride to a woman with a sick child. By portraying Barker as both a religious man and a kind owner, Sewell makes the implicit argument that the cruel treatment of animals conflicts with Christianity. However, when Barker becomes ill after waiting on a fare in extremely cold weather, he is forced to sell his cab and all of his horses.In the final section, Beauty's fortunes are mixed. Beauty's first owner in this section was a baker who knew very little about horses or how to care for them. Worse still, this owner's foreman had no empathy for Beauty and persistently overloaded his cart. This was especially difficult because the foreman also put the check-rein up, which prevented Beauty from putting his full power into pulling the cart. Sadly, when Beauty was unable to pull these heavy loads, he was insulted and abused. It is also during this section that Beauty experienced the worst treatment yet at the hands of man named Nicholas Skinner. This Simon Legree-esque character used horses like machines, and when they could no longer work, he sold or killed them. Luckily, Beauty was eventually sold to three older women. In the last paragraph of this book, Beauty stated, \\"My troubles are all over, and I am at home.\\"Sewell's choice to anthropomorphize Black Beauty allows her to present his story in a very personal manner. As Beauty is sold from one owner to the next, the reader feels Beauty's fear and apprehension. When Beauty is mistreated, neglected, and abused, the reader is forced to feel his pain. Had Sewell chosen to write this from a human's perspective, this would not have been possible. Therefore, Black Beauty: The Autobiography of a Horse presents a persuasive argument that humans should reconsider the way they interact with animals."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This is a great book and I like the book Black Beauty the book, because my favorite color is black and I like horses.The illustrations by William M. Hutchinson are very beautiful and my favorite ones in there are A Stormy Day, The Fire, Farmer Thoroughgood and His Grandson Willie and My Last Home and they are just my favorite four drawings in the book and one part of a guy driving a horse.For The Fire, here's something to say about it for an adapted example and it goes:Danger at the InnMy master and his wife planned to visit friends some two days' drive away. We were to drive partway and stay overnight at an inn. Ginger and I pulled the carriage and James Howard, the stableboy, drove us. James needed practice at driving in order to take up the offer of a job as a groom at another stable.At the inn, an old hostler took charge of Ginger and me. James couldn't believe how quickly and thoroughly he cleaned me - my coast was as smiit as silk.\\"I've had forty years practice looking after horses,\\" the old hostler told James. After he had gone, a second hostler came in with his friend. The friend puffed on his pipe as he climbed up to the loft for some hay.That night, I had slept for some hours but woke up suddenly feeling very uncomfortable. The air had seemed all thick and chocking. I heard Ginger coughing and one of the other horses moving about restlessly. They were neiging and stamping very loudly in fear. When I listened more closely, I could hear a low crackling noise. I didn't know what the noise was but it made me tremble all over.Then one of the hostlers burst into the stable with a lantern, began to untie the horses, and tried to lead them out. He was so frigtened himself that he scared the horses even more. The first horse wouldn't go with him, nor the second and third. He tried to drag me out by force, but that was just no use! As I waited my turn, I saw flames spreading from the loft. Then I looked upward and saw a red light flickering on the wall. Someone outside cried, \\"Fire! Fire!\\"Then the next thing I knew James was at my side when I heard his voice saying, \\"Wake up and come on Black Beauty, we'll soon be out of this mess.\\"He slipped my bridle on, took his scard off his neck and tied it lightly over my eyes, and talked to me carefully leading me into safety in the yard, when he slipped the scarf off my eyes and left me with another man, then raced back into the burning stable with his scarf.There was a whole lot of confusion in the yeard with horses being yanked and led out of other stable and people were yelling and shouting all sorts of things. Presently I heard above all the noise a loud clear voice, which I knew was Squire Gordon's. \\"James, James Howard! Where are you?\\"Then I heard a crash of something falling in the stable and the next moment I gave a loud joyfull neigh for at last, I saw James leading Ginger away from the burning building. I neiged woith joy and relief.\\"You're a brave lad, James, are you hurt?\\" the master told him.\\"I am well, Squire,\\" James said happily. \\"Aye,\\" said the big man who held me, \\"He is a brave lad, and no mistake!\\"Just then two strong horses dashed into the yard pulling a fire engine begind them.We heard that the fire had been started by someone laying down a lighted pipe and exiting without it; I remember our John Manly's rule, never to allow a pipe in the stable.For My Last Home, if you were Joe Green and you found Black Beauty again, the outfit you would wear is a green cap, blue shirt, red scarf, brown vest, black blazer, beige riding pants and high black leather riding boots and that is probably nearly an OK outfit to wear and another one is a white shirt, blue riding jacket, white gloves, white riding breeches, and high black leather riding boots with brown tops and here's something to say about My Last Home as an example as it for an adapted example and it goes:My golden yearsAt the next horse sale, a boy took a liking to me. \\"Was that one a carriage horse, Grandpa?\\" he asked.\\"He might have been, Willie,\\"he replied, to his grandson's delight.\\"Couldn't we buy this horse and make him young again!\\" Willieasked.\\"I suppose we can try, Willie,\\" he replied happily.They brought me to their farm, where I could rest or run in themeadow as I pleased.\\"He's growing young, Willie,\\" the boy's grandfather remarked.He found me a home with three kind young ladies who doted on me.My new groom looked at me over. \\"You have a scar on your backlike Black Beauy.\\"He looked me in the eye.Then he smiled. \\"Beauty, is that really you?Don't you know me? I'm little Joe Green from Squire Gordon's stables.I did not recognize Joe at first. He had grown from a boy into a fine young man with dark whiskers.\\"I can see you've had some hard times, Beauty,\\" said Joe. \\"ButI'll make sure that you only have good times now. I'm here, Black Beauty, I'm here. I swear I won't ever let you out of my sight again. Oh, Beauty ... You're safe now. Your troubles are over.\\"Joe was right -- finally my troubles are over. He is the bestand kindest of grooms and my mistresses have said that they willnever sell me. Willie's grandfather said to Joe the other day: \\"In your place he will last till he is twenty years old -- perhaps more.\\"At last, I am truly at home.This book illustrated by William M. Hutchinson is simular to the Black Beauty starring Sean Bean and directed by Caroline Thompson, the Warner Brothers home video one and the other Black Beauty books illustrated by Victor Ambrus and adapted by Caryn Jenner, Great Illustrated Classics adapted by Deidre S. Laiken and Illustrated by Walter Seaton are definitely simular to the Warner Brothers Home Video of Black Beauty starring Sean Bean and Directed by Caroline Thompson. They just are for sure.I really liked and loved this book and this Whitman classics book of Black Beauty Illustrated by William M. Hutchinson is reminding me of the 1958 rodeo of Dean Oliver, the 1958 world champion calf roper when I think just a book published in 1955 should just be perfect for the year of 1958 for sure.Well, that is a great book and a great movie the only movies of Black Beauty I like are Sean Bean, the goodtimes cartoon animated version and the Hanna Barbera animated version and just three would do of my favorites.I loved, liked, and enjoyed this book and what a great book to read over and over again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I am a fan of that book and I liked and enjoyed that book like a happy one at the end of Black Beauty finding a happy home! Another book to collect only with Black Beauty is \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" by Mark Twain and like two Black Beauty books and one Tom Sawyer book.This is a great book and I really liked and enjoyed it and just for the heck of it, you would like to hear some Historical Results from 1958 in the past and it goes:1958All-Around Cowboy1.

Sewell no doubt understood a lot about life that she, thankfully, left behind for others to discover in her one and only book. My wife and I are finding there is a lot to learn from all of the books that were not part of either of our childhoods. I am grateful to be able to able to be learning about them now, and to be able to share them with our children.This book is easy to read, not too long, and easy for little ones to follow along with.

Bringing up a horse with love, care and kindness were all virtues suggested, and examples were given on how to do this (don't tie the head up, rub down your horse after a hard days work). It also gives examples of what happens to a horse when it is mistreated. And all this was written in a time where horses were mere methods for transportation, rarely more. If you havn't read this book as an adult horse owner, perhaps you should, the lessons are just as valid today."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Black Beauty is a beautiful classic by Anna Sewell.

Black Beauty faces a lot of struggles throughout this book. The setting takes place in a rural area. Early on his horseshoe falls off on the road,and he keeps falling down and people want him to pull a taxi. He is so beat up,and his knees are all riped up, it is just awful. He has been sold three times! It is pretty hard to be broken in in what the people want you to do three different times. He has been whipped many times. I would think that would hurt getting whipped like that all the time. He has been in a dirty sable for a long time now. But finally at the end someone bought him and he had a great life after all. I learned that the nicer you are to an animal or person, the nicer they are to you. I thought it was a well written book. I'm in fourth grade and the author used wonderful voice and desriptions so I could \\"see and feel\\" the action in the story. You should read this book or other books by this author if you love animals."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This is a great printing of black beauty.

Some friends of mine also don't!Thanks to Amazon, now I can read it all, and also watch it all, since I ordered the DVDs from Amazon also. If you have the time, pay attention to what Caroline Thompson had done, writting this play for the screen.Anna Sewell's text is very strong, though enchanting. Her only play is, nonetheless, a Master Work [I keep on thinking how many times had she write and rewrite the play on pieces of paper, back in 1871, without a Text Editor on a LapTop! In a world full of Technology, it is very pleasant to pause and read a text like this one].The precise details of the story, the subtleties gathered from the environment, the way of living of people at that time, the role played by all the main characters of the play, children, men and women, and most of all, all the emotions related to humans and animals sharing the same place at the same time back then, tells us how attentive a person Anna Sewell was."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Black Beauty by Anna Sewell is a heartwarming tale about a gallant horse that goes through many changes in his life. His name, home, and treatment changes each time he is sold. Black Beauty has many owners, good and bad, some avaricious and rueful, some kind and compassionate. He meets many horses along the way, all in which he finds a friend, and hears their story. This horse goes from a clueless pony, to a strong, brave stallion. I recommend this book for people who have been wistful for a story from a quite different perspective. This novel by Anna Sewell is truly a classic."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Black Beauty is an excellent book. It stays true to what horses at that time would go through and is very realistic. I as a horse person find everything true.

Anna Sewell really sculpts her character so that you forget he is a horse and think of him more as a living breathing intelligent being."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Based on our reading of the first two chapters, this is a book that is both good and sad. Black Beauty's mother gave very good advice. The death of one of his mother's friends was tragic, as was the death of the rider. We look forward to reading the rest of the book, and we hope Black Beauty has a happy life! I am writing on behalf of a group of special young men and women who are students at the French Creek Elementary School in French Creek, WV."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I like horses and the color black and Black Beauty is my favorite book and one of the best novels by Anna Sewell. He is a beautiful black animal with a white star on his forehead and one white foot and in the novel of Black Beauty, Black Beauty's white foot was usually always on the back in the left and another second best of Black Beauty's white foot was on the front in the right and that's where I like to see Black Beauty's white foot and it's perfect for the best on the front in the right, and the two hind legs on the left and the right and that's how you like Black Beauty and the best choices.My favorite character in this book is Joe Green, because at the end of Black Beauty, Joe becomes a man and one lucky day, he finds that horse he used to care for and gets excited when he said he had almost killed him so many nearly ten years ago at Squire Gordon's farm after coming back from the Doctor's. This is the best one illustrated by Scott McKowen because there is five black and white illustrations in this book of Black Beauty as a colt with his mother Duchess, Rob Roy or a differnt horse either on a hunt or Lady Anne on Black Beauty, Black Beauty getting shoes for the first time, A kind man leads Black Beauty to his new home and Black Beauty as a cab horse and if there were some other 2 illustrations for this book that would be part of in with illustrated in black and white by Edwin John Prittie and 4 color illustrations by Edward F. Cortese and Going for the Doctor by Percy F. Spence of 7 black and white illustrations and 5 color illustrations in this book, that would make it the best but...there would be like some of the best seven Full Page Illustrations that would be best for the Scott McKowen part of in with some of Edward F. Cortese and some of Edwin John Prittie and Percy F. Spence are:One of the riders was getting out of the water, covered with mud the other lay quite still color illustration by Edward F. Cortese\\"The children did not know when they had enough, so I just pitched them off backwards\\" black and white illustration by Edwin John PrittieSafe in the yard, he slipped the scarf off my eyes and shouted, \\"Here, somebody! take this horse while I go back for the other\\" color illustration by Edward F. CorteseGoing for the doctor color illustration by Percy F. SpenceWith scarcely a pause Lizzie took the leap, stumbled among the rough clouds, and fell color illustration by Edward F. Cortese\\"My dear master was cheering on his comrades when one of the balls, whizzing close to my head, struck him\\" color illustration by Edward F. CorteseMy groom began patting me as if he were quite overjoyed at seeing me again black and white illustration by Edwin John PrittieThat was talking about two of the black and white illustrations by Edwin John Prittie, the four color illustrations by Edward F. Cortese and Going for the doctor by Percy F. Spence and that would make it just for the perfect book illustrated by Scott McKowen if you imagined it in your head to make it go with the book, plus this Black Beauty book is very much easier to be in of Scott McKowen of the five black and white illustrations of Duchess the white horse with Black Beauty the colt in a red background, hunter or Lady Anne in a black top hat, white shirt, brown riding jacket, black leather gloves, brown dress and tall black leather riding boots on a different horse or Black Beauty in a blue background, blacksmith in a light blue shirt, light brown apron, brown pants and short black leather boots shoeing Black Beauty in a pink background, A kind man in a brown cap, white shirt of his sleeves pushed up, plaid vest of green and black, black leather gloves, brown riding pants and tall black leather riding boots leads Black Beauty to his new home in a yellow background and a driver in a black derby hat, white shirt, black vest, black jacket and black pants and probably has a blanket over him driving Black Beauty with two passengers of one of a man in a white shirt, black bowtie, black suit jacket and black pants and a girl in a black hat, green shirt, and grey pants are in a purple background, as for out of this book just to tell you of what clothes they would wear and they are John Manly the coachman in a brown cap or a black top hat, white shirt, black vest, brown riding jacket, beige riding pants and tall black leather riding boots, then James Howard the stableboy in a green shirt, brown vest, brown jacket, light green scarf, grey pants, spats and short black leather boots, then Lady Anne in a black top hat, white shirt, brown riding jacket, black leather gloves, brown dress and tall black leather riding boots, and then for the final in My Last Home when Joe Green becomes a man, Joe would be in a brown cap, white shirt, black vest, beige riding pants and tall black leather riding boots with brown tops when he recognizes its Black Beauty and that that's very perfect for some of the best seven black and white and color illustrations that would've been great if it was in the Scott McKowen book and thank goodness it is part of it and I am using my imagination as I read the book for the few favorite characters of John Manly the coachman, James Howard the stableboy, Lady Anne and when Joe Green becomes a man at the end and that's what it always means a lot to me for this best book of Black Beauty illustrated by Scott McKowen.This book of Black Beauty - Illustrated by Scott McKowen reminds me of DVD movies on Bonanza, Vol. 7: Silent Thunder/The Last Trophy/The Hopefuls/The Spanish Grant, Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again, Disney's The Pacifier, Virginia's Run, City Slickers, Jeopardy!: An Inside Look At America's Favorite Quiz Show starring Alex Trebek because of episode 3. Ultimate I: Anyone's Game in Ultimate Finals, and the 2006 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo (Wrangler NFR), for this year in Las Vegas, Nevada and that's what this means to me, a lot. I loved and enjoyed this book of Black Beauty and it's the best book ever to look at over and over again and live with that easy one by Scott McKowen so you'll have great effort into this book and this Black Beauty book illustrated by Scott McKowen also goes with the DVD of an animated version of Black Beauty with actors David Gregory and Barbara Stevens.For this book of Black Beauty illustrated by Scott McKowen (where Beauty's white foot is on the front in the right) to make this go good and great with the animated DVD version of \\"Black Beauty\\" (Hanna-Barbera Productions) with David Gregory, in this Black Beauty book illustrated by Scott McKowen, Black Beauty is Anna Sewell's beloved story of a sweet tempered horse born and raised in the English countryside. Taught by his mother to always be a friend to man, Beauty lives happily with his master Squire Gordon and the stableman John Manly. Beauty soon learns that the world can be a harsh place when he becomes the property of several owners who use him as a job horse, pulling cabs and heavy loads through city streets. Beauty endures this through his unyielding courage and lives out the rest of his life in meadow where he was born. At the end of the book, Black Beauty comes into the care of Joe Green with three kind ladies and Joe Green is proud to be home with him again.My other favorite Black Beauty books with the one Illustrated by Scott McKowen is the other best eight are Illustrated by Neil Reed: Published by Prospero books in 2001, Illustrated by Ian Andrew, Adapted by June Brigman and Roy Richardson, Retold by Lisa Church and Illustrated by Lucy Corvino, Illustrated by William Geldart and Illustrated by G. P. Micklewright and that's my best new favorite eight books of Black Beauty to live and read with but, the real ones I would be in for the ones I like are Illustrated by Neil Reid published in 2001 by Prospero books, Illustrated by Scott McKowen (which is the easiest one to live with, because of the five black and white illustrations which are great and good and much easier), Illustrated by Ian Andrew, Adapted by June Brigman and Roy Richardson, Retold by Lisa Church and Illustrated by Lucy Corvino, Illustrated by William Geldart and G. P. Micklewright and that's the best seven books to be in of Black Beauty.Another two favorites of Black Beauty I like are his white foot on the back in the left and three white feet of one on the front in the right and the two in the hind right and left and that's three different favorites I like of Black Beauty and where his white foot will be.Examples of my favorite horse of Black Beauty in different ten books of his white foot are:Black Beauty's white foot on the back in the left in the five different books of Adapted by Laura F. Marsh, Illustrated by Neil Reed: Published by Prospero books in 2001, Illustrated by Ian Andrew, Adapted by June Brigman and Roy Richardson, Retold by Lisa Church and Illustrated by Lucy Corvino. So that's where I would like to see Black Beauty's white foot on the back in the left.Black Beauty's white foot on the front in the right in the different books of Illustrated by Scott McKowen and Illustrated by G. P. Micklewright. So that's where I would like to see Black Beauty's white foot on the front in the right.Black Beauty with three white feet of one on the front in the right and the two in the hind right and left in the specail book Illustrated by William Geldart. So that's where I would see Black Beauty with three white feet so his you would want it on the front in the right, back in the right and the back in the left and if you see one white foot because of the three, you would say the one on the back in the right.Black Beauty is my favorite horse and he would be a great horse for roping and bulldogging as if he could be a perfect rodeo horse.Here's how the Black Beauty books will work out for the two favorite DVD's I like of Black Beauty are the ones by Sean Bean (1994) and directed by Caroline Thompson and the animated one with David Gregory and that's the best two to watch over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.Black Beauty (1994) starring Sean Bean DVD is like the novel with the three of the books on three different Black Beauty books of Adapted by Laura F. Marsh, DK Readers: Black Beauty (Level 4: Proficient Readers) (Paperback) adapted by Caryn Jenner and illustrated by Victor Ambrus, and Illustrated by James Needham and because those three different books of Black Beauty would go great with the movie as the three matched up and go. The one illustrated by James Needham for sure goes great with the movie because of his white foot on the back in the left.Black Beauty with actor David Gregory in the animated DVD is like the novel with the two of the books on two different Black Beauty books of Illustrated by Scott McKowen and Illustrated in colour by G. P. Micklewright would go great with the animated DVD version as the two matched up and go. The one illustrated by Scott McKowen for sure goes great with the animated movie because of his white foot on the front in the right and that's how it would be for the animated version.Well, I gotta say, now that I love the best eight Black Beauty books, instead of ten which was way too much, I wanted to find a way just to live with eight and that was a better well mount and that's how I could make my living by some of the Cortese and Prittie and Spence for the Scott McKowen book by imagination and that was the best book I ever read which showed me how to treat horses with respect and kindness.This book should be perfect and great for the 2006 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo (NFR) in Las Vegas, Nevada to show how cowboys in the NFR should treat their horses with respect to train roping horses how to rope and wrestle calves or steers.I loved, liked and enjoyed this book.It is a GEM, I loved it and it's the greatest novel of all times of the greatest horse story ever told.What a great book I ever read if some of the cowboy art of paintings of \\"HH \\"Slim\\" Hill circa 1920 Calgary Stampede\\" by artist Gail Guenther as if on the front cover of a book, \\"Caught in the Open\\" by J. Swanson, \\"Bronc Rider\\" by Colette Pitcher, \\"Jerkin' The Slack\\" by Rick Timmons and \\"Steer Wrestler\\" by Colette Ptcher and one pencil drawing of \\"Calf Roping (6)\\" by Virgil C. Stephens and that's how those cowboy art go good with this Black Beauty book by Scott McKowen of rodeo events of saddle bronc riding, team roping, steer wrestling and calf roping. For the roping, the two cowboys of one is on a ranch as they are team roping to catch a steer for branding as the header ropes the horns by three swings and the heeler ropes the hind legs by four swings, then the two different calf ropers at rodeos, one cowboy ropes it by one swing and ties up the calf with two wraps and a half hitch and another second cowboy ropes it by two swings and ties up the calf with two wraps and a half hitch and that's how cowboys must learn to rope by treating horses right by reading the book of Black Beauty.Again cowboys and cowgirls, I loved, liked and enjoyed this book.It is a GEM, I loved it and it's the greatest novel of all times of the greatest horse story ever told. Best book ever:)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"was not aware of who the author was. but i remeber this book from my childhood, and many others recommended reading it. but it was too childish for my tastes in literature. i didnt even finish reading it."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Black Beauty, by Anna Sewell, is one of the best-loved animal novels of all time. Black Beauty is a moving story of a horse's life, told in the horse's own words. As the reader accompanies Black Beauty through life's adventures, a powerful message is presented: Treat both humans and animals alike with kindness and respect. Black Beauty's mother taught him early in life that there are many different kinds of men.\\"There are a great many kinds of men; there are good, thoughtful men like our master, that any horse may be proud to serve; but there are bad, cruel men, who never ought to have a horse or dog to call their own. Beside, there are a great many foolish men, vain, ignorant, and careless, who never trouble themselves to think; these spoil more horses than all, just for the want of sense; they don't mean it, but they do it for all that. I hope you fall into good hands; but a horse never knows who may buy him, or who may drive him; it is all a chance for us, but still I say, do your best wherever it is, and keep up your good name.\\"This classic tale inspired me, and I think it will inspire you aswell, to always be kind and compassionate to my animals, and care for them the best I can."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book is brill it made me cry laugh and somtimes even jump up and down!

I really loved reading Black Beauty, by Anna Sewell. I loved reading it because I learned that a horse's life can be filled with love, and it can also be filled with meanness. It's a great book to read if you love horses like I do. Black Beauty is told from the horse's point of view. The story is so interesting when it begins as you visualize Black Beauty running with his mother Duchess in a field in the happiest times of his life.My favorite parts of the book were the beginning when Black Beauty was with his mother and six other colts in the meadow running together and having great fun! In the middle of the book, Black Beauty comes to meet Ginger and Merrylegs, who end up becoming very good friends and somehow always seem to meet up throughout the story. At the end, my favorite part was when you come to realize that all of Black Beauty's troubles are over and he finally will live in a happy place.Some of the characters I liked were Black Beauty, Ginger, Merrylegs, Duchess, Squire Gordon, Black Beauty's first Master, John and James, and finally Joe Green. I admire all of there characters for their spirit and their courage. I would recommend this book to anyone that loves horses or to read a story that is truly heartwarming."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Black Beauty is about a great stallion that gets separated from his mom and he is sold to other people and meets great friends. He meets a little pony named Marrylegs. Marrylegs was a horse who has short legs and he loved his owners. When kids came over to get a ride on Marrylegs then they started whipping him with a stick like a real horse. A couple of days later Marrylegs gets sold.Then Black Beauty meets a lady horse named Ginger. He talks to her about how his life has been after he got separated from his mom. They fall in love as they stay together for a long time. A few months went by and Ginger got sent away followed by Black Beauty. They no longer live happily ever after because before they left Ginger told about the troubles that have been going on between the man that had bought her and the way he is going to treat Ginger. Ginger and Black Beauty meet up after carrying a bunch of people he sees ginger and she looks terrible. After finding out what happened to ginger she dies a couple days later. Black Beauty becomes really sad and then he figures out that it could be a good thing that she has gone to a better place because she has no more troubles for her to fight over. Black beauty was sad because he lost the only one he could be in love with but not long after he was being worked really hard and he was not feeling good and he died after Ginger from being worked too hard. He had no more troubles for him to take care of either. When he died he was able to be with the one he loved. Then they really did live happily ever after.I recommend this book to anyone who likes horses because this book is about a horse who is brought to many places and trying to survive being with different owners and they are not being very nice to a horse who has been to a lot of places. This is a great book by Anna Sewell. She tells great stories about a young horse who becomes a great stallion. Anna Sewell has made great books and I would recommend any book written by her.

Sewell has written a timeless book. It is an unusual book in that the main character is a talking horse, yet it's not positioned in the somewhat cartoon-ish manner that so many children's books with talking animals are. Sewell attempts to place a subtle moral tale within each chapter. She uses man's cruelty or kindness to animals as a lesson for how we humans should treat each other. The overall message, essentially, is that if we are kind to animals, presumably, we will be kind to each other. While the plotline moves at a gentle pace, there is enough action embodied within the overall story that it kept the attention of my two sons throughout. A wonderful escapist read at any age."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"You can't go wrong with a classic.

I have been reading the story from my 1897 copy, described as a \\"new illustrated edition ... sure to command attention.\\" The life of a horse told in the first person is not on every child's reading list these days. It wasn't on mine years ago. This was my first reading. Perhaps I missed this classic because I didn't have the typical young girl's 'love affair with horses'.*BLACK BEAUTY* was written by Anna Sewell, an English invalid whose Quaker beliefs permeate every page. IF kids will read it, I guarantee the preachiness won't injure them! I was surprised to be so moved by the wrongs done to animals -- all the suggestions for treating horses more humanely translate into decent human relations now, as it did then.Amazon.com states the reading level for *Black Beauty* is ages 4-8; maybe only prodigies are to atempt it? Listening to an adult read this story may help children bridge the years since \\"progress\\" brought us the motor car. Black Beauty talks with other horses about good and bad handlers and owners, and discusses all aspects of life (except mating) with friends Ginger and Merrylegs. He mulls over their temperments and his own, and the good influences of reasoning and praise. Unfortunate events caused by cruel check reins, and bits, whips, or being knocked about are part of this story. There are also exciting times of racing for the doctor, being saved from a stable in flames, or a broken bridge, becoming lame from the loss of a horseshoe.I hope you won't avoid this 'classis' but will allow yourself to do some time-traveling by adventuring into the late 1800s. Listen to a horse's wise thoughts over the clatter of hooves in the streets.

It has been several years since then, but it touched me all the same. Currently, I am in the process of re-reading it. That's how good it is! You will want to read it over and over.It begins with Black Beauty as a young colt, born into a good bloodline with racing blood running through his veins. His master was a good one and made sure that the horse became an obedient, noble steed. Unlike many other horses, he was broken in gently to insure years of the loyal service of a beautiful animal.Unfortunately, Black Beauty's life is not all good; like any other horse, he came into the hands of both kind, cold, and simply ignorant masters. Though fiction, it really could've been any horse that went through the life of Black Beauty, and some probably did. At least, horses lived the lives of some in the book, such as those abused or beaten for doing things natural to a horse.This novel was most definately touching and inspiring. It presented several important moral issues. A few include always doing your best, how to NOT \\"look out for number one,\\". and thoughts on how kindness can change a horse... and a person too.Of course, I am somewhat biased, being a Horse in the Chinese Zodiac and a special fan of stories about horses, but all the same - I have taken many of the themes in this book to heart, and truly believe that the world might be a bit nicer if a few others picked up this classic tale of a horse's journey though the harsh reality of life.Read it once! If you don't like it, then that's understandable, I guess.But chances are, you'll love it.And then you'll want to read it again."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"One of the best known books, almost everyone has heard of Black Beauty. The story is told from Black Beauty's point of view giving a totally different view of the world. He has to endure some cruel owners but remains hopeful that someday things will turn out better. One of the sad parts is the death of his over-worked friend 'Ginger'.The hero horse is eventually saved by a kind boy and his grandfather who care for him and restore him to health. It is quite sad in part but does have a happy ending and in its day would have had an effect on the treatment suffered by working horses.Another brilliant book:GODSTONE - THE KAIROS BOXES"},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"\\"Black Beauty,\\" written by author Anna Sewell, is one of the most famous horse books during the nineteenth century. Part of its achievement consists that the novel is a classic for people with many different characteristics. First published in 1877, \\"Black Beauty\\" continues to enjoy people for new generations of American citizens around the world. Anna Sewell's brilliant account of animal treatment became a historic breakthrough because it was the first book that described a horse's experience in England. \\"An autobiography of a young stallion,\\" this book follows the life of Black Beauty. Throughout the novel, it is told in a creative first person form, as if Beauty was describing and narrating his life. Ms. Sewell chose to write this book from the \\"horses point of view,\\" and she remarkably was able to succeed with her novel. Since Sewell intended on writing this novel in Beauty's point of view, the reader begins to understand the impact of good and treatment towards the horse and his loyal friends. Starter of the Humane Society, the author truly captivates readers with this autobiography of a beautiful, friendly, loving black stallion. In a letter to her friend, Sewell expresses that she hopes \\"Black Beauty will induce kindness, sympathy, and understanding treatment towards horses.\\" From Beauty's happy, enjoyable youth to his pleasant retirement, Anna Sewell ingeniously wrote the book to remind the cruel treatment in the 1800's. Most importantly, Sewell wrote the book in a time where horses were not given the same respect today, and \\"Black Beauty\\" helped to open the eyes of many to the cruelty horses had to suffer. Although Anna Sewell's classic paints a clear picture of the society in London, England, its message is universal and timeless: animals were serve humans well if they are treated with consideration and kindness."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Black Beauty by Anna Sewell is a story written from a horse's point of view and it is an excellent story. The main character of the book is a beautiful black horse named Black Beauty who tells his life story. At different points in the book it was quite sad...but it was mostly happy.

The horse, Black Beauty, lives in England. The story is told through the eyes of the horse. Black Beauty shares his life experiences and friendships. During his life, he is sold many times, and he encounters some cruel and good owners.I think this book accomplished the task the author set out to complete. She wanted to alert people to the cruel treatment of horses. The description of the bit in a horse's mouth was eye opening to me. It had to be strange to have an object inserted into one's mouth for the first time. I am not fond of horses. I was thrown off of one as a child.

It is about a horse who has a hard life. His friends die, and he goes from owner to owner. This story would have gotten the Newbury Award if they had one in 1877. This book was good because it was never boring in the middle. Anna Sewell knew a lot about horses, since they were her only way of getting around.

Observe all of life's amazing experiences from the perspective of a young loving horse, \\"Black Beauty.\\" Anna Sewell describes this story perfectly as you see all the different lifestyles and troubles that this horse experiences. Black Beauty started life as a young beautiful horse that was born into a family that did not treat him well. His mother was a large, wise horse who taught Black Beauty to always treat his master with loyalty and respect. This horse shows us that this task was not as easy as it sounded.About the time Black Beauty was 2 years old, he is well broken in and well mannered. He is then separated from his mother and sold to another family who lives in Birtwick Park. Here he meets two new friends Merrylegs (stocky gray pony) and Ginger (sassy chestnut mare). Black Beauty grew very fond of these two horses and takes there advice many times. From then on, he takes everything he had learned at his old homes with him throughout his twisted life journey in search of a happy secure home. Along the paths of his life Black Beauty is used as a riding horse, carriage horse, fair horse, and a town horse that ends up being mistreated. Black Beauty expresses his emotions and thoughts as he tries to deal with unexpected turns that life throws his way.Through all the misery and joyfulness that Black Beauty goes through, he still respects and honors all of his masters just as his mother had done, even when they ill-used himself and his friends. After being sent away to a home where the masters are hateful and living conditions are dreadful, Black Beauty isn't sure how much more he can handle. He has a lack of food, no rest, swollen joints, and torn flesh from whip slashes. He has basically given up on life. This once healthy, good tempered horse just might have now been pushed to the limit. Will Black Beauty's life adventure end here or will he go on living life in misery? Can the knowledge and character that his mother has instilled in him overcome the crisis that he is facing now?This thrilling story will touch the reader's heart as well as take them on many exciting and sorrowful adventures. You will come to learn the true passion this book shows of this amazing creature's life and determination. This story will help the reader realize that you must build life on experiences and live life to its fullest while you have the chance because you never know what lies ahead.\\"THIS WILL CERTIFY THAT THE ABOVER WORK IS COMLETELY ORIGINAL\\""},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Black Beauty was written by Anna Sewell. The book is a cross between fantasy and realistic. This is because even thought the story is being told by a horse (Black Beauty), it contains real and true information also.Black Beauty is the story of a horse's life. The horse in the story, Black Beauty, had a very interesting life. He starts out with his mother, on a nice farm. After he is one or two years old he is broken in by his master. After that, he is passed on form master to master, farm to farm, some are good, and some bad. In his life he experiences friendship, love, pain, terro, and death. His best master he ever had was at Birtwick Park, with Squire Gordon and John Manly. They were good riders and love horses deeply. However, he was also ridden by a drunk man once in his life and ended up breaking his knees!In my opinion, this book was very good. I also think that it teach an important lesson to humans, to love and care for all of the Earth's creatures. A person who is interested in horses, or animals in general, might really enjoy Black Beauty."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"remember the days when you were a little kid? Those hot summers when the ice cream truck drove by and you sat there licking you frozen ice pop? And then, your mind began to imgaine things. You saw a dreamy black horse, cantering across the meadow with a small white welsh pony and a mare a tad smaller than the black horse. And they galloped as one, through lush green meadows, occasionally lapping at a nearby crystal clear spring fed pond. You will once again be invited back to these scenes as you read Ann Sewell's Classic, Black Beauty.This masterpiece paints a picture of a horse's seemingly nine lives. Always changing from one place to another. Some are gentle and know just how to treat the horse; others just try to get the money's worth out of him. Black Beauty's best friends, a mean-tempered chestnut mare named Ginger and a spunky littl;e welsh named Merrylegs team up to take on their dreams together. Through becoming a carriage horse to take a lady to tea, to being rented out, to recovering in a young farmer's son's hands, Black Beauty is something that we won't see in a long, long time. Forget Heartland and Chestnut Hill-one book can say a lot of powerful things.I have rated this story 5 stars because it is one of the best things I have ever read.

At that point in time, it was much easier for horses to find work. Nowadays it is virtually impossible for a horse to find work. This is because automobiles have made horses obsolete.Nevertheless, Black Beauty is a charming novel about a hard working and well mannered horse (Black Beauty) who understands and speaks English. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to get inside the mind of a well mannered horse who lived in a time before automobiles were invented by Henry Ford.Merrylegs is one of Black Beauty's friends. He is a pony who, like Black Beauty, speaks English. Upon meeting Black Beauty, Merrylegs says, \\"My name is Merrylegs. I am very handsome.\\"If you enjoy reading books about animals who speak English, I also recommend George Orwell's Animal Farm."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"black beauty is a thrilling adventure for children. it is a great story of love"},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Animal books that are told from the creature's point of view (whether cat, dog, horse, or some other species entirely) are a dime a dozen these days, but \\"Black Beauty,\\" was the first book of its kind to use this technique and is thus the forerunner to all animal stories that came after it. Most people are unaware that Anna Sewell broke new literary ground when she wrote \\"Black Beauty\\" in the style of an autobiography, though ironically she never meant it to be a children's story at all. Instead she intended that it would be read by those that work with horses: \\"to induce kindness, sympathy, and an understanding treatment of horses.\\"Beauty is one of several names given to the horse that grows throughout the story from a young colt in a farmyard to an elderly stallion enjoying his retirement, chronicling all his experiences in between, both good and bad. These include being the horse of a squire, a cabby, a gentleman and a cart driver among others, as well as events that are probably known even to those who haven't read the book, such as the fire in the barn and the washed-out bridge.Throughout his life he meets several other horses such as cheerful Merrylegs and feisty Ginger who recount their stories to him; and it's difficult not to get a little choked up when it comes to Ginger and her tragic tale, especially when she tells Beauty at their final meeting: \\"you are the only friend I ever had.\\" For many children, Ginger's story may well have been their first experience with the portrayal of death in a story - I know it was mine, and I never forgot it.Since being published in 1877, the story has lost none of its power, and the image of a black horse with a white star on his forehead is universally recognized as the iconic Black Beauty. Not only this, but the novel is credited with driving the bearing rein out of fashion, a device that was popular in the Victorian age but which damaged horses' necks by forcing them upright at an unnatural angle, and is also believed to have made a difference in reducing the taxicab licence fee of the time, (something that was often exploited by those that hired out cabbies to drivers), not to mention heightening the awareness of animal cruelty at a time when animal welfare simply didn't exist.As such \\"Black Beauty\\" can be described as the first animal rights book, told in first-person narrative from the (literal) horse's mouth, criticizing things such as docking (that is, cutting off horse's tails), the aforementioned bearing reins, and the long, hard hours of work that horses had to endure. The trick of it though, is that the issues never seem particularly moralizing or heavy-handed because it's all told by the horses themselves. It doesn't take much of a stretch of the imagination to assume that if horses were capable of talking to each other, they would discuss the cruelties and kindnesses that human beings mete out upon them.This is effectively portrayed by the sheer confusion of the animals as to why humans act in certain ways; such as Beauty pondering why human beings endanger both themselves and their horses in fox hunting, or why so much pain is inflicted on animals for the sake of fashion, asking: \\"What right have they to torment and disfigure God's creatures?\\" Likewise, the first-person narrative gives a perspective on the life of a horse that had probably never occurred to Sewell's original audience (or indeed, her first-time contemporary readers), has when Beauty discusses how it feels to wear a bit:\\"Those who have never had a bit in their mouths cannot think how bad it feels. A great piece of cold hard steel as thick as a man's finger is pushed into one's mouth, between one's teeth and over one's tongue. It ends come out at the corner of your mouth and are held fast there by straps over your head, under your throat, round your nose, and under your chin, so that in no way in the world can you get rid of the nasty hard thing.\\"Towards the end of the book, it does start to get slightly more preachy, mainly due to the fact that Sewell begins to dwell on issues such as alcohol, elections and religion that have no bearing on the horses at all, but are merely being discussed by the humans around them. However, this aspect is thankfully minor and doesn't detract too much from Beauty's own story.I have a particular soft-spot for \\"Black Beauty\\" considering Anna Sewell is lurking up in my family tree somewhere (on my grandmother's side), and the fact that the memories of reading this book as a child have always stayed with me. This is an essential book for any children's library in order to cultivate empathy for the animal kingdom, but is also valuable reading for an adult as well, not just for the ur-example of an animal tale, but as a thoughtful, bittersweet and well-researched look into the life of man's second-best friend."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"A worthwhile read for kids, tho my grandchildren didn't seem interested in this and other books I got them."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Black Beauty is a novel about the tough lives of horses. The main character, who is also a horse, is Black Beauty. He grew up on a large meadow with his mother always by his side to teach him wrong from right. His mother was the one who brought him up well, and taught him to treat his masters with manners. The first place he was raised, his master knew each horse's feelings, and was affectionate towards them so that they would treat him well also. This great man, though, had to leave due to family matters. Black Beauty was sold to a new man. This master kept his horses in stalls, but yet also knew exactly what his horses wanted, but Black Beauty soon came to realize that not every master is perfect.Black Beauty was lent by to a drunkard. This man did not realize that the horse's shoe was coming off, causing him to go slower, and more cautiously. The drunkard whipped Black Beauty continuously, until they came to a stone side road. The horse's shoe became wedged between two stones, and was pulled off. Next, a sharp stone became shoved into Black Beauty's hoof. His reaction was an intense buck to leave the rider in front of him on the stone road. The man was dead! People came near, but did not blame Black Beauty, because they already knew of the poor judgment of the rider. Black Beauty was pleased with the others' reactions, but felt a tiny bit of remorse. He was able to tell his neighboring horses of his great stories, but was surprised when the others had even more dramatic events occur in their lifetimes. This book is about the events that happen in horses lives, and actually bored me quite a bit. I would not recommend this book as a gift for kids, because they would have a lack of interest for the not-needed details."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I didn't read the audio book but I read the novel. This book was excellent, it definatly belongs up there with all the classic novels. It makes you think about all the horrible things some horses go through in their lifetimes(like my own horse). No animal deserves abuse or mistreatment no matter how intelligent(horses) or not.FYI, Orrin C. Judd, horses are NOT STUPID!!!! Scientific research has recently discovered that horses' intelligence is the same as dolphins' and chimps' and we all know that dolphins' and chimps' intelligence is extremely close to our own. Research also suggests that horses may actually be smarter and more intelligent and have a more complex reasoning system than could have ever been thought. Of course, horses don't think exactly like humans: they don't judge, they don't hate, they don't lie, they don't cheat; they are honest, loyal, loving and brave-provided they have a person who cares about them, they are all these things and more. It doesn't take a genius to see that horses have very complex personalities and emotions. Sometimes I think my own horse's personality and emotions mirror my own.And all you kids out there who have read or want to read this book, don't listen to this guy. Take it seriously, because mistreatment of any animal is no joke, its a very sesious problem, because people who hurt other people usually start by hurting an animal.P.S. Obviously, Orrin C. Judd never even read the summary for The Black Stallion, because it's about a BOY and a horse, written by Walter Farley, a man who LOVED horses.I recommend ANY horse or animal lover who cares at all about the abuse animals suffer to READ THIS BOOK!!! The abuse animals and people suffer everyday is a very, VERY serious problem, and one we need to think more about. Animals are such innocent creatures, why should they have to suffer for our own ignorance and superior feelings of ourselves?"},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book was great!

My only criticism is that, from time to time, other horses get to tell their stories too, and it is difficult to tell which one is speaking. This makes the book hard to follow, particularly if the reader is a child. The book also makes overmuch use of the flashback.

He is a beautiful black animal with a white star on his forehead and one white foot and in the novel of Black Beauty, Black Beauty's white foot was usually always on the back in the left and another second best of Black Beauty's white foot was on the front in the right and that's where I like to see Black Beauty's white foot and it's perfect for the best on the front in the right and the left, and the one hind leg on the left and that's how you like Black Beauty and the best choices.The characters in this book of Black Beauty where Black Beauty's white foot is perfect in the back left for the best novel is just perfect for the one of this one of the my favourite four characters out of this book just to tell you of what clothes they would wear and they are John Manly the coachman in a black derby hat, red scarf, white shirt, plaid vest of green and black, green riding jacket with a yellow lining, black leather gloves, brown riding pants and tall black leather riding boots, except in A Stormy Day when John would be in a black derby hat, red scarf, white shirt, brown vest, long plaid jacket of grey and black, black leather gloves, beige riding pants and tall black leather riding boots, then James Howard the stableboy in a light blue shirt, brown vest, green riding pants and tall black leather riding boots, then James is in a black derby hat, blue shirt, red tie, brown vest, black jacket, brown leather gloves, green riding pants and tall black leather riding boots and for The Fire when James leads Beauty and Ginger from the burning stable, James would be in a light blue shirt, black jacket, beige riding pants and tall black leather riding boots using his red scarf for Black Beauty and Ginger and when James would get out of bed, he would have time to grab his vest but, would only just grab his jacket and his boots and scarf, then Joe Green the stable boy in a brown cap, white shirt, light green scarf, plaid vest of green and black, red riding jacket, black leather gloves, black riding pants and tall black leather riding boots, and then when Joe Green becomes a man and finds Beauty again, he would be in a black derby hat, white shirt, red scarf, brown vest, blue riding jacket, brown riding pants and tall black leather riding boots, then the master Mr. Barry in a black top hat, white ascot and shirt, black vest, blue riding jacket, black leather gloves, grey pants and tall black leather riding boots, then Jerry Barker in a red scarf, white collar on a blue and white striped shirt, brown vest, long brown jacket, brown leather gloves, grey pants and tall brown leather riding boots all for that whole year and the winter and then Farmer Thoroughgood's grandson Willie in a blue cap, pink shirt, plaid vest of green and black, brown pants and short black leather boots and that's very perfect for some of the few favourite characters out of this book of Black Beauty so you'd know what their clothing would have been like.At the end of this best book to live and enjoy with, Joe Green is home with Black Beauty at a pretty house in a small village and it had a nice pasture and a comfortable stable, and that is a good book I love a lot and it is a GEM, I loved it and it's the greatest novel of all times of the greatest horse story ever told.Black Beauty (1994) starring Sean Bean DVD is like the novel with the four of the real books on two different Black Beauty books of Illustrated by Robert Doremus and Adapted by June Brigman and Roy Richardson and because those two different books of Black Beauty just for sure go great with the movie as the only two matched up and goes well. The one illustrated by Robert Doremus and adapted by June Brigman and Roy Richardson for sure goes great with the movie because of his white foot on the back in the left.Black Beauty with actor David Gregory in this animated DVD is like the novel with the book of Black Beauty Illustrated by Scott McKowen would go great with the animated DVD version as it matched up with some of the Black Beauty books of illustrated in black and white by Edwin John Prittie and colour illustrations by Edward F. Cortese and the only one out of another one is Going for the Doctor colour illustration by Percy F. Spence and that for sure goes great with the animated movie because of his white foot on the front in the right and that's how it would be for the animated version.From now on, my new favorite seven Black Beauty books to live easier with the one of Illustrated by Neil Reid: published and copyright in 2001 by Prospero books is the other best only just the seven from now on will only be and are Illustrated in colour by G. P. Micklewright, Illustrated by Scott McKowen, Adapted by June Brigman and Roy Richardson, Illustrated by John Beer and colour illustrations by Cecil Aldin, Lucy Kemp-Welch and G. P. Micklewright, Illustrated by Robert Doremus: copyright and published by Whitman in 1951 and Illustrated by Ian Andrew and only from now on, that's my best new only seven favourite from now collection on only just the seven books of Black Beauty to live and read with but, they are now the best real ones I would be in for the ones I like are the best and that's how I'll make my living that way forever and now only just to live with and no more, just my only best now-on favourites to live in somehow and carefully to live in and the only ones I'd take part in are Illustrated in colour by G. P. Micklewright, Illustrated by John Beer with colour illustrations by Cecil Aldin (part of in with John Beer), Lucy Kemp-Welch and G. P. Micklewright and Illustrated by Ian Andrew and those are the only best three books of Black Beauty I want to follow in, live with and be part of and the only ones that follow the movies are Illustrated by Robert Doremus: copyright and published by Whitman in 1951 and Adapted by June Brigman and Roy Richardson (the only best two that follow the 1994 movie of Black Beauty starring Sean Bean) and Illustrated by Scott McKowen (the onbly best one that follows the 1978 cartoon animated version of Black Beauty with David Gregory), and those are the only seven except I only live in four of the books and the other three books just only follow the movies, and the one by Neil Reid can be by itself for sure sometimes.Another real four favourites of Black Beauty I like are his white foot on the back in the left, another of his white foot on the front in the right and another one with three white feet of two on the front in the right and the left and the one in the hind left and also his white foot on the front in the left and that's my real four different favourites I like of Black Beauty and where his white foot will be.Examples of my favourite horse of Black Beauty in different books of his white foot are:Black Beauty's white foot on the back in the left in the different books of Adapted by June Brigman and Roy Richardson, Illustrated by Neil Reed - Published by Prospero books in 2001 and Illustrated by Robert Doremus - copyright and published by Whitman in 1951. So that's where I would like to see Black Beauty's white foot on the back in the left for sure and for real.Black Beauty's white foot on the front in the right in the different book of Illustrated by Scott McKowen. So that's where I would like to see Black Beauty's white foot on the front in the right.Black Beauty with three white feet of two on the front in the right and left and the one in the hind left in the ones Illustrated by Ian Andrew and Illustrated in colour by G. P. Micklewright. So that's where I would see Black Beauty with three white feet so his you would want it on the front in the right and the left, back in the left and if you see one white foot because of the three, you would say the one on the front in the left and that's the all time best horse ever to have.Black Beauty's white foot on the back in the right perfect for the two of the best ones of Illustrated by John Beer and colour illustrations by Cecil Aldin which is perfect on the back in the right and part of in with John Beer. That's the best one to keep sometimes, but, never can tell, sometimes.This book of Black Beauty: Illustrated by Neil Reid - published and copyright in 2001 by Prospero books reminds me of some of the DVD videos on the The Cowboy Way starring Woody Harrelson and Kiefer Sutherland, Bonanza, Vol. 1: Feet of Clay/The Last Viking/Bitter Water/The Savage, Bonanza, Vol. 3: The Courtship/The Savage/Breed of Violence/The Last Viking, Disney's The Princess Diaries starring Anne Hathaway, 2003 & 2005 Wrangler NFR and that's what this means to me, a lot in this world. Also this Black Beauty book is reminding me of some Charles Schridde paintings of a few.I loved, liked and enjoyed this book and that is a gem and it is the great and best book of love, I loved it and it's the greatest novel of all times of the greatest horse story ever told. I loved it:) BEST ONE EVER!My only favorite book of Huckleberry Finn is the Illustrated Junior Library illustrated by Donald MacKay, the only best one book that follows the Walt Disney movie \\"The Adventures of Huck Finn\\" starring Elijah Wood and Courtney B. Vance and that is the only best Huckleberry Finn book I could ever enjoy the best Illustrated by Donald MacKay to show how it follows the Elijah Wood movie and that's the best!:)Well, that's all I gotta say about Black Beauty for now!

Its hard to believe its nearly a hundred years old! Anna Sewell was an excellent writer, who is my inspiration. She uses imagery and personification so well to get her (very valid) point across, in a wonderfully encapsualting way.Black Beauty is a kind, gentle and well-mannered horse who struggles in the harsh victorian world. This book has made me cry many a time, out of despair and sorrow for the charecters, and at the loveleyness of all the horses and some of the human charecters. It shows the way Victorians lived, and treated their animals and teaches us a lot of very important lessons. A must read for anyone, of any age."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Black Beauty was great, the characters were neat, the descriptions were awsome.

I recomend it for those who are beginners in english. This book is understandable and interesting. When I started to read I wanted to know how it will end."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"There are several problems with this book in regards to young people, but the most obvious is the antiquated vocabulary, which is almost impossible to understand through context.My daughter is 9, and though she has an average plus reading level, this book gave her no end of problems. As a consequence, I was forced to listen to her read and then translate the vocabulary, diction, tone, etc. She was, in most cases, completely in the dark. And no wonder! \\"Roan cob, bearing rein, phaeton,carter, drayer,\\" etc.--all words used with no reference points for my bewildered little lady, and several of them gave me pause as well. I am a high school English teacher, and I guarantee that my students would not understand half the book as well.The book was completely impossible for her to fathom by herself. When I asked her to read by herself and then tell me what she read, she couldn't explain what she had read because she didn't understand half of the terminology used.Although I am sure the book was a fine example of a classic children's book when it was published, it is a drudgery to read now. I liked the idea of the horse speaking directly to its audience, but the constant prosying on about the condition of horses and their owners became so tedious. I do understand that the book teaches about kindness to all people, human or otherwise, but any message repeated continually throughout 197 pages becomes a cliche and loses its impact after the tenth repetition.I am so happy to have this book read and the book report done. I believe that children under 12 will not understand it, and I think that only good readers who are in love with horses should attempt this book by themselves!"},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Much as I appreciate the idea of a facsimile--there's the charm of the handwritten inscription, the feeling of an old book--trying to read this edition of Black Beauty is like reading a damaged copy reassembled by an illiterate. Did they check the page numbers? Did they notice that chapters don't end? Did they notice the last pages were missing?"},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Every third page is a sermon on how to treat animals with respect. I got the point by the fifth time time around. The 10th through the 20th sermons were tad bit tiresome. Not sure how this book ever became known as a classic. I've never seen the movie, but it must be better than this book. Time to read more E.B. White, C.S. Lewis, Astrid Lindgren, Roald Dahl, etc. for bedtime stories. I quit reading this less than a third of the way through."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Black Beauty is a book of many feelings and sometimes saddnes.

Starting from a colt, he is off to a good start. He meets many horses, and learns their stories. Then when he is sold, his life plummets. Black Beauty is misused as a cab horse, and rarely stays with a kind owner, until being sold again. I like the characters, both human and horse. This story is in a horse's point of view, but it seems so human-like. It shows how life has ups and downs, for every living thing.This story teaches us kindness, and to help others in need. This book also tells us to treat animals fairly. We treat them as dumb animals, but we do not know how much they understand. It also tells us to give everyone a chance."},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This is a terrible version with too many liberties taken by the writer.

John Manly is saying goodbye to Black Beauty & Ginger. John Manly goes around to Black Beauty & Ginger in a soft loving voice. Then John sounded very sad because he would miss Black Beauty & Ginger & it reminds me of Darryl Worley's song called \\"I miss my friend\\" & it makes me sad because it is probably about missing a friend. It could be on vacation & it could be other places.Black Beauty holds his face close to John, & was the only way he could say good-bye.

For all those teachers out there, DONT BUY BLACK BEAUTY!!!"},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"One of the great unanswered questions of life is the mysterious attraction that horses hold for young girls. Sure, we all know that there's some kind of psychosexual component, but why horses in particular? At any rate, Black Beauty &amp; the rest of those equine tales (Black Stallion, National Velvet, etc.) were never central to my childhood reading, but my wife fondly recalls her father reading it to her--a topic I feel it is best to avoid commenting on.Anna Sewell was left crippled by a childhood accident and depended on horses to get around. A Quaker, she was apparently extremely sensitive about any violence towards animals. As the quote above indicates, she even used prompting rather than prodding to guide her own rides . In the closing years of her life, suffering intense pain herself, she wrote this book to call attention to the mistreatment of horses and it became a genuine publishing phenomenon. She uses a first person (first horse?) narrative to completely anthropomorphize Black Beauty, a well bred and even tempered stallion who passes from owner to owner. Over the course of the book, Beauty's owners display varying standards of treatment from kindness to neglect to open brutality. But Beauty perseveres and happily ends up back with his original owners. Along the way, Sewell also gets the opportunity to take some potshots at hunting, drinking, poverty and the like.It's easy to see how the story became a classic, thanks to its sympathetic portrayal of Beauty and his fellow horses. But it is fundamentally based on a lie. Animals aren't human and horses aren't even particularly intelligent by animal standards. We shouldn't mistreat them because to do so is unnecessary and counterproductive. But to pretend that they have complex personalities and emotions does them no service and sort of cheapens the dialogue about what &quot;rights&quot; animals should have. The book makes for a pleasant read, provided you don't let kids take it to seriously.GRADE: B-"},{"Title":"Black Beauty: His Groom and Companions (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book is just plain boring.

I have consulted several others and we all agree on one point: its a total waste of money, time, and effort.

It is about a horse who has a hard life. His friends die, and he goes from owner to owner. This story would have gotten the Newbury Award if they had one in 1877. This book was good because it was never boring in the middle. Anna Sewell knew a lot about horses, since they were her only way of getting around.

This horse had a truly pious soul and through the kind and cruel masters, whether he was loved or unloved, he always did his best and struggled to do his duty faithfully and completely. He was humble and timid and it was heart warming to hear him speak of always having to try his best and serve his master well.

The setting takes place in a rural area. Early on his horse falls off on the road and he stumbles, and he keeps falling down and people want him to pull a taxi. He is so beat up, and his knees are all riped up, it is just awful. He has been sold three times! It is pretty hard to be broken in in what the people want you to do three different times. He has been whipped many different times. I would think it would hurt getting whipped all the time. He has been in a dirty stable for a long time now.

Nicola and &quot;The Gentleman&quot; ignite sparks from their first encounter and fan the flame throughout the rest of the book.Nicola, who is a down-down-to-earth member of high society, is still in love with her former lover who has been dead for ten years. One can almost feel her pain and longing for him.Jack, &quot;The Gentleman&quot; highwayman, is a character I think every woman would love to meet. He is vowing revenge against Exmoor for a past wrong. Jack is definitely a hero to fall in love with. A sort of Robin Hood to the villagers.Even though the direction this book is going in seems pretty obvious, the fun part is getting to the destination (the last page!) This book had me smiling and practically on the edge of my seat. Of course characters from the other two books in the series are in this one and that adds to the fun. This was definitely my favorite of the three books. It was completely enjoyable. (It is comparable to the Mallory Novels by Johanna Lindsey.) You will love the characters just as much. I can't say enough about this book except that it is a MUST READ!!!(I would also like to see more books written that involve these characters)"},{"Title":"No Other Love","review":"Ten years ago Nicola Falcourt watched in disbelief as her beloved Gil Martin, a groom, and the Earl of Exmoor, Richard Montford, fought. Her incredulity changes to anguish when Gil fell off the cliff and died. A grieving Nicola kept the engagement ring that Gil gave her close to her heart while never forgiving Exmoor for causing the death of her sweetheart.Nicola has stayed away from Exmoor even though he married her sister Deborah. In 1815 Nicola finally agrees to visit in response to Deborah's urgent plea to help her through her pregnancy in light of three previous miscarriages. On the way to Exmoor, The Gentleman stops her coach, robs Nicola, and steals a kiss. To her guilt as she has stayed loyal to the memory of Gil, she liked the kiss and soon learns he is a popular Robin Hood-type figure. The Gentleman keeps showing up in a weird courting of Nicola and soon they fall in love, but her safety becomes questionable since Exmoor wants the Gentleman dead.NO OTHER LOVE is an exciting Regency romance filled with non-stop action and an entertaining rogue of a hero and an intrepid heroine. The story line never slows down, as Nicola seems to land in one predicament after another mostly caused by The Gentleman. Though extreme, Exmoor comes across as 100% pure evil, making him the oppositey of the lead couple and the catalyst moving the plot forward. Fans of the sub-genre will find Candace Camp's latest tale quite enjoyable.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"No Other Love","review":"Each book in this trilogy improved upon the last. Readers of the first 2 books will welcome Nicola's turn at love -- and will enjoy meeting &quot;The Gentleman&quot; highwayman again. Although Jack's distrust of Nicola is sometimes annoying, his sensitivity and goodness overcome it. Their passion ignites the pages, and the suspense is dealt with a sure hand.The saga of evil Richard is concluded satisfactorily, and it is indeed pleasant to have all the main players from the first two books here to take a hand in the outcome. Justice prevails, true love reigns supreme, and the good are rewarded with happiness.After reading this one, I would consider rereading book 1 to see if I'd rate it higher now. I am left, thanks to book three, with a very pleasant, satisfied feeling."},{"Title":"No Other Love","review":"This book is fantastic reading. This is the last book of a 3-book series written by Candace Camp. The first one is &quot;A stolen heart&quot; and the second book is &quot;Promise me tomorrow&quot;. The characters of her books are vividly written and seemingly alive. The story of the series is about three brother and sisters who were separated since they were young. Will they find each other? Read the whole series and find out for yourself."},{"Title":"No Other Love","review":"Jack and Nicola are very vibrant characters. Although you could tell which way the story was going, it was one of the best stories I have read in ages. Bringing back all the characters from the first two books and having them play a significant part in the unraveling of the final mystery is a rare occurrence one that I enjoyed beyond words. By the time I got to the last page, I was laughing and crying at the same time. You have to read this trilogy. It will keep you interested from beginning to end. I'm sure you noticed that I didn't say anything about the story in detail. You're going to have to read the books to find out."},{"Title":"No Other Love","review":"The first two books, &quot;A Stolen Heart&quot; and &quot;Promise Me Tomorrow,&quot; introduced us to both Niccola and Jack. While both of those were good, this is my favorite of the three. Camp still writes a fast paced story, and here we get a chance to find out about the mysterious highwayman who has played a part in the lives of the other characters in &quot;Heart&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow.&quot;Overall, I highly recommend this book. It's a delightful romp with a nicely tied up ending. (We finally get to see Exmoor get what he deserves!)"},{"Title":"No Other Love","review":"Somewhat obvious plot but sooo great. The best one of the series by far. I can't put it down and have hardly gotten any sleep because of it! Wish it wouldn't end."},{"Title":"No Other Love","review":"At first, I was not sure if I was going to enjoy No Other Love. The heroine seemed a bit shrewish and a tad too willful but by the middle of the book she really grew on me.Nicola is a determined spinster on her way to her sister's home when her coach is stopped by a highway robber and his gang. The man steals a kiss which leaves Nicola weak at the knees but not so weak that she cannot slap the highwayman.Nicola's sister is married to the Earl of Exmoor, a man who once desired to marry Nicola. She despises him as she holds him responsible for killing her first love, Gil. The flashbacks with Gil and Nicola are quite good and this in many ways is the best part of the story. Their romance is sweet and innocent but what chance did they have? He was a commoner and she a noblewoman, however Gil planned on them running away to America where class distinctions would not matter. This did not come to pass as Gil and the Earl were in a scuffle with Gil going over the edge of a cliff.Nicola is alone and involved in charitable causes. She is intrigued with the highwayman, Jack and when he needs her help she provides her limited medical services. Nicola has feelings for Jack and she feels very guilty as she has determined to stay true to her first love but Jack is also just as determined to break down Nicola's defenses. When these two are honest with each other this book works very well, when they keep secrets it tends to drag. Still this couple is very likable."},{"Title":"No Other Love","review":"Like most of Candace Camp's novels, this one is full of promise with engaging heroines and thrilling adventures, but in the end the romance lacks that true love spark that would make her stories classics.We have a wonderful premise for a romance: a decade old long lost love. The plucky heroine (Nicola Falcourt) is independently wealthy (due to her grandmother's inheritance) and bucks the strictures of her social class to be a heroine we could idolize today. Instead of looking for title and estates in marriage or frittering away her days on fashion and parties, she spends her money on charities. As a 17 yr old girl, she shunned the attentions of the local earl for his humble stableboy. She had pledged herself to this boy and planned to run away with him to America when she was 18. Instead the earl found out and in a struggle the boy plunged to his death over a waterfall. So for 10 years, Nicola kept his \\"engagement ring\\" in a string around her neck, hidden under her clothes and close to her heart vowing fealty to the boy she loved even in death. 27 years old now, she is an eccentric spinster, still a virgin, forced to return to the place she lost her love because her sister married the earl and is with child. On the way, she is waylaid by a highwayman with uncommon manners (they call him The Gentleman) and a searing kiss. This is the only man she has ever felt an attraction to since her beloved stableboy died. It fills with her confusing feelings of lust, grief, desire and betrayal as she's drawn further and further into his web.The first half of the book is excellent with Nicola and Gentleman Jack dancing around one another in desire and retreat. Jack keeps his face hidden beneath a mask, but you suspect there is a connection to Nicola. He also doesn't trust her entirely seeing her as just another member of the aristocracy he abhors.Where it goes astray for me is in the latter half of the book. We never get inside Jack's head beyond a scene or two and that is just to tell us again the reasons for his mistrust of Nicola. Things we were already told in dialogue. Jack is the long lost stableboy who survived the fall, was captured by the old earl and impressed into the Navy while being told it was Nicola who had betrayed him. So we never really get a happy reunion for these starcrossed lovers. As soon as Nicola realizes her stableboy is alive, her love and decade of fidelity are cast aside by his suspicions. Suspicions that only a stupid man would hold once he returned to the village and learned she had not meekly succumbed to the earl's demands. Camp makes an attempt to explain this by having extraneous characters speculate about his reasons, but we could really benefit by being inside his head and therefore his heart more.Frankly I expected the affair part of the story to be better, more emotional and happy. The consummation scene is certainly carnal but lacks that happy content feeling of longlost requited love and being cherished. There is no talk of mis-spent years or finally requited longings. No love words. Just sex and then they go back to tilling a garden. The reason, we're told because we are stuck in Nicola's head only, is because Jack still doubts Nicola's fidelity. She'd saved her virginity for him for a decade, even when she thought he was long dead! A woman cannot do that and not earn the respect and loyalty of her man. At least not a man who deserves her. Jack's self doubt and Nicola's fears of his love take away from even the happy times.The other issue I had with this story has to do with the ultimate resolution of the villain. Lord Exmoor, who was the villain of the entire novel series of 3, meets his end too quickly and without emotion. He not only set out to murder his heirs as children, hunted them as adults, destroyed the love Jack had and tried to kill him numerous times, but he also supposedly craved Nicola so much he married her sister when she rejected him. I wanted to see him on the run for a change, reduced to a desperate attempt to flee having lost everything. Maybe even take Nicola with him as hostage. I wanted to see Jack risk everything to save Nicola for a change (she was doing all the saving in this story). Instead the story was about a strong woman and the weaker man she loved magically winning his Cinderella-like inheritance. One minute Jack is the poor stableboy turned highwayman, the next he is recognized the true heir to the earldom.I think this is problem I have with all Candace Camp stories. She writes very compelling heroines, but her heroes always lack that selfless spark to make them timeless. They are more brooding like Healthcliff. You never feel like they would die for their heroines, only gladly accept them into their lives (and beds).Nicola suffered too much over those 10 years. She was betrayed by too many people, including the hero. She deserved to be wooed and cherished, not treated to endless suspicion and rejection from a man with stupid prejudices.So while this is definitely one of the better premises for a romance novel, it will leave you frustrated in the end."},{"Title":"No Other Love","review":"I have recently discovered Candace Camp's books so it is catch up time for me.

There were some things in this book that could be construed as pro-democrat, but there were certainly pro-republican parts as well.While some people don't like to think about the demographics of certain parties, it is an important part of politics, and the truth of the matter is that you can largely break down this country demographically and come up with largely consistant voting patterns. This book simply points that out - sorry if some people don't like that - and then yell about bias, since they don't like who they are grouped with.While I would agree that political philosophies are the most important things to be concerned about, demographic breakdowns are helpful to let the reader now how those &quot;values&quot; are played out in the political arena, and who they tend to benefit.However, this book is a book for dummies, and therefore only goes into politics very superficially. But, that is most likely what you want - a very basic overview, not an indepth anaylsis of each party's details.So, I say, buy this relatively analytically shallow, but very fair book. Its nice for those of you who want to start getting more informed about the politics of the nation."},{"Title":"Politics For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"This book is a great introduction into political participation. It is written in simple language (as should be inferred from the title) and provides a fairly clear map for anyone who is interested in ACTIVE participation in politics. If you are interested in overcoming the American political apathy, buy this book."},{"Title":"Politics For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"Having only read the first few chapters, I was somewhat hesitant to submit a review for this book. Ultimately I decided that, notwithstanding, I had some worthwhile comments to put forward which may be of use to other potential readers.Politics is a topic to which I have devoted little energy throughout my life. If the key issues in an election are gay marriage and abortion, then the significant societal issues affecting the majority of people would appear to be under control. Accordingly I have found myself ambivalent as to the outcome of most elections in mature democracies, such as in the USA. I consider this to be the ultimate victory of democracy. However my apathy for the subject lead me to the realisation that I was grossly ignorant of the structures and systems of centralised authority, to which we are all subject, and that I should read a book on the subject to set that straight.Politics for Dummies was my obvious first choice. I have used the Dummies series for various topics in the past, and have always appreciated their clear, well-illustrated and user friendly lay-out. Their comprehensive approach to a subject, starting with fundamentals for the novice and building therefrom, while simultaneously providing a ready reference book through their thorough indexes and tables of content, put them in a class of their own. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with this offering for the following reasons:1. The book is incorrectly titled. Politics is a global phenomenon , and any \`dummies' primer on the topic should necessarily present its material from a global perspective. I am not a US resident, so my views and expectations may differ from those of the majority of readers and reviewers, yet I stand by my point. A comprehensive understanding of politics should encompass a historical overview from ancient times, Greek & Roman senators, the European powers of yesteryear and its evolution to the current US political system, as well as the fledgling democracies of South Africa, Afghanistan & Iraq etc. The book should be titled \`US Politics for Dummies'.2. The book launches into the subject taking numerous fundamentals for granted. Very early on it describes how many citizens are represented by each senator versus each representative, and how these numbers have evolved over time. I don't know the difference between a senator, representative or congressman. That's why I bought the book! My ignorance in these matters may construe me as a \`wildcard' reader, whom the author should not realistically be expected to accommodate. Yet I would wager that a large number of Americans are similarly clueless, including plentiful naturalized citizens who lack a US education. From its flying start, the book doesn't look back, and continues to describe how you can immerse yourself in the political environment, raise funds, manage campaigns ... all the while leaving us political ignoramuses unenlightened and unable to follow the topics on account of a dire lack of grounding in the fundamentals. Perhaps the book should be titled \`US Politics for Those Who Already Understand the Basics', alternatively they should initiate a \`Complete Morons' series.The other reviews were something of a revelation to me, with contributors variously claiming that the book was too simplistic, alternatively a covert piece of Democratic propaganda, and those who repudiated this stating that it was entirely non-partisan. Indeed, if taken chronologically, the reviews read like a partisan debate with critics responding vociferously to assertions made in previous reviews. Few, if any, appear to be evaluating the merits of the book as an introduction to politics, and most writers appear to be politically savvy and strongly opinionated ... not the target audience that I would assume for a \`Dummies' title.To be fair, I haven't truly considered the merits of the book in its own right. Well I couldn't! After a few pages I was completely lost. I awarded one star on account of its complete failure to meet my expectations of a \`Dummies' title. If I were politically aware, and looking to embark on a political career, perhaps this book would fit the bill. I did however feel that the tone displayed an unmotivated exuberance - \`You too can make a difference', \`It behoves you to get involved', \`Run your own campaign' (not actual quotes). This style of writing belongs more to the \`Overnight Millionaire' type of literature. Furthermore if, as alleged, the book is a thinly veiled Democratic propaganda tool, then it may well be worthy of only one star, even on its own merits.It is an irony therefore that my experience with this book (which include its reviews and my efforts to compose this assessment) have merely reinforced my complacency towards politics. I am more than happy to let egos and tempers flare in heated debate over whether to teach creationism or evolution, or how to handle Iraq or the deficit. Meanwhile I will focus my energies on the seemingly pragmatic matters of providing for my family, and hopefully making a positive difference to those whom I encounter in life. And I strive to do this in whatever environment the politicians create for us.In conclusion, I acknowledge that I may be a lone voice in the wilderness here. While the book completely failed to meet my expectations, it seems to have generated interest and debate among the other reviewers, who presumably are the author's intended readership. Furthermore, the fact that I only read the first few chapters must surely temper the integrity of my review. However, it is a large world, and there are surely some of you out there who are looking for the same answers as I am. I recommend you keep looking."},{"Title":"Politics For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"First of all, I didn't get this book from Amazon, so I was forced to write this review without an account. I borrowed this book from my local library. I am not actually under thirteen, if that matters at all.On to the book. The book begins with a very basic overview of how the government works. You should probably have some basic knowledge of the legislative branch and executive branch in the United States (for which the book is written, if you live outside the US, sorry, but this probably isn't for you). Once you know this, this book explains in very plain language the politics surrounding elections. The book explains why candidates make actions, who has the largest impact on official descisions, what you can do to help candidates and much more. It doesn't go that in-depth on the topic, but if you want to learn about politics just to get a better of elections and such, this is definitely for you."},{"Title":"Politics For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"You have to remember that this is &quot;for dummies&quot;.

Really just basic information that anyone could learn simply by watching cspan a few times and watching the news regularly.

Wisely, the authors perpetually drive home the point that every citizen has the potential to change the system and their voice really does matter.Also of interest is a voter registration card (check with the index to see what regulations govern it in your state) so readers who have not already done so can register to vote and immediately begin participation in the political process."},{"Title":"Politics For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"This book is great for novices, but is lacking in the reality of party strategies that seem to run government.

In this case describing Republican voters as white, upper-class etc, happens to fit the facts presented by countless polls. It's just a fact. Read it as such. This book is extremely helpful for the novice seeking more information on politics. Don't let Rush Limbaugh style rants against &quot;liberal bias&quot; turn you off."},{"Title":"Politics For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"I would simply like to state that the premise of lower-class whites primarily voting as democrats is way off base. The fact is, white males with a high school diploma or less vote republican, college grads generally vote democrat, and anything above that is generally split. Typically those in the lower class have either a high school diploma or less and thus vote republican. Trust me, I do this for a living. While this book is lightly flawed in some areas and does leave some critical areas untouched, I feel that it is a great primer."},{"Title":"Politics For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"The reviews claiming it's a biased book are way off-track.1. First of all, Republicans generally are upper-class and white. That's a proven, well-known fact. That doesn't mean there aren't Republicans that don't fit that profile, and that doesn't mean the book is biased for correctly reporting information. In addition, minorities, women, and lower-class whites tend to vote Democrat. Married housewives, as the exception, tend to vote Republican because their husbands are most likely Republican, etc. That doesn't mean the book is biased or anything; that's like saying a book that reports that the sky is blue is siding with all those &quot;blue-sky folk, grr.&quot; O_o2. The examples are clearly jokes and not to be taken seriously. Seeing as how the examples slant either way, I think it's really irrational to claim a Democratic bias.What seems to be the case is some rather impressionable people who really *don't* know anything about politics (like basics of party demographics which is even on the news every other night) are reading it and trying to find bias. If you're a political dummy, but not irrational, then this book is fine."},{"Title":"Politics For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"This book is terribly Democratically biased. I find it horrible and irresponsible for the author to list &quot;characteristics&quot; shared by party members whereby she paints a picture of the parties as she sees them (rich, men, white... versus highly educated, working-class, women...) which should have absolutely no relevance. She says &quot;some voters will feel more comfortable in a party where they don't fit the profile&quot;. I assume she meant some will feel more comfortable where they do fit the profile. Shouldn't the &quot;profile&quot; be based on the beliefs that the party stands for? Sad."},{"Title":"Politics For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"A &quot;Dummies&quot; book--especially on a topic as subjective as politics--should present a clear, unbiased foundation of the subject matter, taking pains to flag opinion from fact. This book is dangerous because it is targeted at the uninitiated, and because the biased opinion of the author is presented casually as matter-of-fact information. Hence, the reader walks away with a headfull of propaganda mistaken for fact.It's always a good idea to read about the author (you can do so in the editorial reviews page for this book) before delving into an unfamiliar topic. For a book like this, I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Politics For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"Politics for Dummies is a very good book that will help the people who read it understand and become involved in political issues if they desire."},{"Title":"Politics For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"This book does have some very good information in it for someone looking to understand more about politics. The reason I rated this only two stars is because you should know that it is certainly written with a party bias. I've started learning more about politics over the last year and now know enough to recognize that there are Democratic ideals being pushed throughout the book. My concern is that this book is intended for &quot;dummies&quot; and so many readers may not pick up on the continuous subtle (and some not so subtle) pro-Democrat, anti-Republican examples and comments. I won't list examples here because I disagree completely with what she says. If you buy this book, you will learn more about politics but keep this bias in mind."},{"Title":"Politics For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"There is some good information in this book but it is obviously biased. Party demographics, for just one example, should be irrelevant. Belief in a party should stem from belief in their political philosophy and not because you fit some demographic profile. I mean, people really shouldn't categorize people based on skin color or sex, right?This book actually provides several humorous insights into the mind of a Democrat (the author). \\"Failing to act or to take a position has the potential of alienating everyone, so officials and candidates must go one way or the other - perhaps resorting to the coin-flip or the 'voters-love-me, they-love-me-not' method.\\" I mean, God forbid the politician take a stand on what they personally believe.I also enjoyed the \\"spin doctor\\" section. \\"President Clinton and the Pope went out on a lake in a rowboat to do some fishing. The Pope's hat fell into the water. President Clinton got out of the boat, walked across the water, retrieved the hat, and returned it to the Pope. The headline in the next day's newspaper was \\"President Clinton Can't Swim!\\" The only example of spin doctoring that she could come up with was President Clinton walks on water?!?! This type of thing is done throughout the book. To be fair, there are a couple of ones that slant the Republican way but to say this book is not biased is just ignorance.Try \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide To American Government.\\" I also HIGHLY recommend the magazine called Reason (reason.com). They truly rip Democrats and Republicans when it is called for...all based on logic and fact...not emotion."},{"Title":"Pharmacology Secrets, 1e","review":"This book is quite a disappointment for \\"the secrets\\" series.

This book is rubbish, so I recommend you stay away."},{"Title":"Pharmacology Secrets, 1e","review":"This book is a terrific mix of basic pharmacology and lesser known information important for competent prescribing and care.

This text is suitable for classroom and research purposes or for those who would like to find about their African roots."},{"Title":"African Spirituality: On Becoming Ancestors","review":"I wanted to learn something about the traditional beliefs of the Akan people so I ordered this book. It was very readable and very informative. What interested me the most was that the author used structures developed by Fowler and Erikson.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a &quot;first book&quot; about this subject."},{"Title":"African Spirituality: On Becoming Ancestors","review":"I found this book a very quick read, but incredibly insightful especially with regards to the reasons behind the traditions described.

I am teaching my son about ancient civilizations and came across this book. I picked it up and couldn't put it down until I finished it. The book contains serially related myths from ancient Egypt and is written in a very engaging style. The author is clearly an expert on ancient Egyptian civilization and writes very well. The chapters are of a length appropriate for bedtime story reading as well as for school-related activity. Furthermore, there is a nice taxonomy of the ancient Egyptian &quot;pantheon&quot; and an interesting, if too short, discussion of glyph writing. The text is beautifully illustrated and has interesting footnotes about many of the illustrations."},{"Title":"Gods and Pharaohs from Egyptian Mythology","review":"How did Osiris die?Who took the throne then?Who is the eye of the sun?How was Egypt made?You can find all the answers in this book. Through this amazing novel, many Egyptian myths are told with dramatic pictures and excitment. The myths in this book are the most exciting myths out of all of them. Even if you read the book once, you'll want to read it agian! Each story will capture your imagination each time.At the end of the book there is also a short lesson on writing hieroglyphics. All in all, this book adds up to be the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Gods and Pharaohs from Egyptian Mythology","review":"This was one of the first books on mythology that I checked out of my local library when I was a child.

In fact, Knut stands so far back, we're all like little bugs to him.Knut takes the Richard Dawkins canon (men have feelings; women have strategies) and expresses it in language so painfully acute that the reader (if you're like me), is left screaming aloud with delight.The novel is short, but the fun is long because there's zero extra words. I read it s-l-o-w-l-y in order that the phenomenal phraseology could sink in. Made it last all week. And dressed like Parelius the narrator to try to get more into the story."},{"Title":"Rosa,","review":"Rosa is the other side of the coin of Benoni's tale. Whereas Benoni was the hero of &quot;his&quot; book, he's the goat of &quot;hers.&quot; I think part of what I didn't like about this book was that a character I really loved was taken and made a mockery of. Hamsun seems more driven to show Rosa's spitefulness &amp; hatred, which gets in the way of his usually beautifully simplistic style. Instead of having the easy-going flow of most of his &quot;small Norweigen fishing village&quot; novels, it's more of a vitriolic diatrabe. Hamsun is one of the most brilliant novelists of all-time, but this is definately my least-favorite work of all his works translated into English. If you're a Hamsun lover, go ahead &amp; get it. If you've never read Hamsun before, this definately isn't a good place to start."},{"Title":"The History of Economic Thought: A Reader","review":"I have been waiting for years for this kind of book. I teach a small history of economic thought part-time to two colleges in Florida and my students have been very reluctant to dig into their pockets to buy the original texts - there are so many important books. This handy compendium brings together the key contributions between the covers of one, utterly essential volume.I like the relative conservatism of the selections - the editors do not impose their view of the canon on others and instead treat us to all the classics. I particularly enjoyed the linking material: everything is placed into its proper context.Lastly - any book that includes &quot;The Fable of the Bees&quot; gets my vote - Godlike Genius!!"},{"Title":"The History of Economic Thought: A Reader","review":"This is indeed a very well made compilation on a difficult subject. It covers many authors with great efficiency. I'm a history buff and an economist so this was heaven for me.My only problem with the Reader itself is the font; I felt it was a bit on the small side making the reading process less pleasurable than it otherwise would have been.It should also be made clear that some great economists are mediocre writers, making their points in a very obtuse manner. Also that many early economists didn't know some principles which we today find obvious, this makes some of the writing very quaint in their logic and propositions. This will be fascinating for those who wish to study the history of the economic thought process by looking at the authors themselves. It is not, however, a good book from which to learn economic theory. You are better off knowing the subject already before studying its intellectual history.Just don't jump into this book without some background on economics. The early authors aren't very eloquent in making their points and the later authors become a bit math intensive if you haven't seen the subject before.If on the other hand you want a well-compiled overview of great economic classics this book is simply unbeatable. I loved it, but then again I'm a geek."},{"Title":"Overcoming Unintentional Racism in Counseling and Therapy: A Practitioner's Guide to Intentional Intervention (Multicultural Aspects of Counseling And Psychotherapy)","review":"Ridley does an excellent job of opening up issues regarding cultural competency in the mental health services professions. However, while the examples given do illustrate the problems as they currently exist, I found several of the \\"how to\\" examples of interaction rather condescending. Still, overall, the book is a great entry into just how and why the mental health field has not served our culturally-diverse populations in the past and how to better serve them in the future."},{"Title":"To London, to London (Starlight Romances)","review":"I read Regency romances at a rate of about one every two days. I have a counselor for many years and find that they take me away from our often stressful world to a less complicated time. They are my Valium. They help me sleep.This book is out of the predictable style of many regencies. However,I agree with the other reviewer for different reasons. This book is full of meaningless conflict. Dillon, the spurned female lead character acts like someone much, much older than any 28 year old I've ever met. She acts like a 60 year old who hasn't worked at keeping herself open. She's had 10 years to get over being dumped by the hero and hasn't done the work. If you like conflict, nonsensical arguments, illogical interpersonal interactions, get this book. Otherwise, don't bother. The writing is good which is why I gave it two stars instead of one star. What a waste of time."},{"Title":"To London, to London (Starlight Romances)","review":"Charles, Lord Roxbury, is on the lookout for a bride, and Caroline, a rich American with noble English connections might just fit the bill. Except that her chaperone, Dillon Hearn, is the woman Charles once loved ten years ago when he was the last-born son of a nobleman and a poor sailor in the British Navy. Her family prevented her from marrying him by nefarious means, and broke her heart in the process, making her determined never to marry.Unfortunately for such a romantic set-up (the return of the old lover), the interaction between Charles and Dillon is antiseptic. The story is spoiled by Charles's seeming attachment to the heroine's niece until the last six pages of the book, and, by the heroine's stubborn determination not to fall in love with him again. (One doesn't come across a heroine that stubborn too often, so I applaud her in one way, yet in this instance her stubborness was spoiling the \\"reunited and it feels good\\" potential of their romance!)These two characters only connect emotionally at the very end of the book, which I admit is something I hate. That being said, someone who loves Regency romance may love this book. I can't say it's not well written, and Dillon is a strong heroine in some ways. (It's nice that she didn't fall into a decline when her first love was thwarted -- yet, she carries it on a bit too far once he comes back. That's the major flaw in her character.) All the characters here are enjoyably well-rounded ones, except Charles who remains a mystery until the very end. But it was too frustrating that the author made me wait & wait & wait for Charles and Dillon to get together, only six pages before the end? I felt cheated."},{"Title":"Why Sovereignty Matters (Aei Studies on Global Environmental Policy)","review":"I found Professor Rabkin's book to be quite informative and a fascinating read. The book has a very scholarly tone but it is written so that even a layman can understand the complexities of international law. Rabkin does an excellent job of laying out the differing views of national sovereignty. He makes a compelling case for the value of retaining our independence through increasing globalization. The book is written pre-9/11 and does not reflect on the increasing debate over unilateral action in the war on terror. I would love to see Rabkin update the book to cover that."},{"Title":"The Mid-Packer's Lament: A collection of running stories with a view from the middle of the pack","review":"Chris Russell's writing is colorful, insightful, and just plain fun. This collection of his articles mixes all three strengths, and the result is an enjoyable ramble for runners and non-runners alike. There are great stories from running events - experiences which ring true with every typical runner who hopes to be more than a typical runner but knows it probably won't happen. There are reflections and views on the world around us that ring true on multiple levels. And there are sections that simply leave you laughing out loud.If you're a runner, read The Mid-Packer's Lament for the running stories, to reinforce your somewhat crazed self-image, and for some inspiration and advice along the way. If you're not a runner - and especially if you're a runner's spouse or partner - read it as a sort of enjoyable therapy to help you understand why runners are like they are."},{"Title":"The Mid-Packer's Lament: A collection of running stories with a view from the middle of the pack","review":"One of my favorite pleasures in life is listening the run run live podcast with Chris Russell.

If you enjoy running this book is a must!"},{"Title":"The Mid-Packer's Lament: A collection of running stories with a view from the middle of the pack","review":"The Mid-Packer's Lament is a collection of the author's personal running stories told in his words with his special wit and humor. The book is easily readable and can be picked up anytime, as each of the stories are only 2-3 pages. Much of the time I couldn't contain myself and began laughing out load. As runner's we all have our running stories and I found myself often putting myself in his shoes and enjoying the stories."},{"Title":"The Mid-Packer's Lament: A collection of running stories with a view from the middle of the pack","review":"Let me just say, there were a few times I had to put the book down laughing. As a self-proclaimed mid-packer who took up running for weight-loss, now training for a first marathon, I was taken by how much of Chris' content I found myself relating to, outside of just the running! His spot-on representation of that moment a runner realizes a difference in how they feel vs. how they look - Hilarious. I laughed myself red-faced (which is not as easy to do as it was 40lbs ago, heavier). Great read. Great Job, Chris. A perfect bedtime page-turner."},{"Title":"The Mid-Packer's Lament: A collection of running stories with a view from the middle of the pack","review":"This is a collection of short stories from Chris Russell....a sort of best-of previsouly (mostly?) published columns from a true mid-pack runner with a cool house and a cool dog. At worst the stories are a little bit dull but they're short so skip to the next one at best Russell's humor reminds one of Mark Twain. One of the books on sports that actually smack of intelligence and thoughtfulness. A great vacation read or do one a night before bed.....Thanks Chris!"},{"Title":"The Mid-Packer's Lament: A collection of running stories with a view from the middle of the pack","review":"Chris Russell has captured the rambling thoughts and observations of runners and put to words.

He is also the race director of the popular Groton road race. All this and is a husband and works a regular job that requires a lot of travel. He is a running modern day Korouac on the road.

Chris is a \\"real\\" person who documents some of his challenges and frustrations in running along with working through injuries from a car accident. He provides practical advice on things like qualifying for Boston and responding to disappointing performances.

It gives a good overview of the entire process, from both the buyer's and the seller's point of view.

While no guide to this group of organisms can really hope to be exhaustive in its coverage, this book presents a good overview of the kinds of organisms that are floating around out there.This book is a great primer to the group. It is not, however, all that useful in doing taxonomic work, but it is a great tool for use in supporting laboratory work involving general identification of plankton. In order to do more specific taxonomic work, however, one needs access to more comprehensive taxonomic keys from the professional literature.Still, this book would be a great addition to the library of any serious student of invertebrate zoology, marine biology, or oceanography.Alan Holyoak, Dept of Biology, Manchester College, IN"},{"Title":"A Guide to Marine Coastal Plankton and Marine Invertebrate Larvae","review":"I never even received the book I bought, and no one notified my why, I am completely disappointed and frustrated."},{"Title":"A Guide to Marine Coastal Plankton and Marine Invertebrate Larvae","review":"collection procedures and identification of zooplankto"},{"Title":"The Traffic in Women: Human Realities of the International Sex Trade (Global Issues)","review":"The book is edifying but flawed. The overall theme, that voluntary migration - including for purposes of prostitution - is inextricably linked to, and sometimes indistinguishable from, traffic in persons, is powerfully presented with case studies gleaned from field research conducted in Thailand. Rural Thai women are engaged in sex work in Bangkok, Singapore, Japan, and Germany. The difficulty in addressing this phenomenon is that some are trafficked against their will and suffer from the most appalling conditions of fear, abuse, and inhumanity, while others voluntarily enlist as prostitutes, driven by a combination of poverty and lack of opportunity at home and greed fueled by misinformation for what lies before them. The book is wholly successful with this thesis.But the problems are two-fold. First, there simply is not enough depth to warrant even 116 pages. While the material is divided thematically, many stories are repetitive and do not add to the reader's understanding. The second, and more serious, problem is the authors' political agenda. While not oppressive, the anti-western theology is certainly intrusive. There is the use of 1970s-era jargon, referring to developed nations as \\"North\\" and the rest as \\"South\\", and predicating these labels with the assumption that South is good and North bad. There is the subtext that traffic in persons is essentially an economic problem - a migration issue - caused by unfair \\"Northern\\" economic exploitation and by discriminatory immigration laws that prevent citizens of the \\"South\\" from travelling at will to developed countries to seek their fortune. There is the imperfect understanding of economics compounded by a sort of pseudo-socialist template that yields incorrect statements like: \\"The need to import foreign labour into industrialized economies has now vanished\\" (p21); or callow outrage: \\"In an era of allegedly free markets, to permit goods, capital and rich people to move freely around the world, while preventing labour from doing so, appears both hypocritical and unjust\\" (p22). Japan is criticized because its standard of living serves as a \\"magnet\\" to those who live in poor countries. As though Japan is at fault, and the girls, even the willing prostitutes, are sad victims of Japanese success. This book is not the best forum to discuss uneven economic development, and the authors should have left it alone. Instead, there are odd statements like, \\"migrants represent the commitment of the nation to participate in the international economy\\" (p23), which suggests illegal migration and prostitution are positive economic policies of source countries, rather than the recognition that illegal migration represents a failure by these countries to provide for the needs of all their citizens.Some phrases are ill-chosen, \\"Trafficking in women not only breaches the criminal and many other laws,...\\" (p66). Others are simply bizarre, such as the discussion of wives living abroad as prostitutes. The authors aver that when husbands of the prostitutes date other women and waste the proceeds of their wives' labors, that \\"such behavior contributes to the high divorce rate\\" (p75). It is just odd to blame the husband of a prostitute for the marriage's failure.Overall, the book is a success. Its thesis is powerful, but the language is sometimes disingenuous. It is a useful starting point to understanding the trafficking phenomenon"},{"Title":"The Traffic in Women: Human Realities of the International Sex Trade (Global Issues)","review":"The book was fine, I cannot seem to resell it though, the content was great for class, I learned something."},{"Title":"Standard of Excellence, Book 1: E Flat Alto Saxophone","review":"I got this book when I first joined band.

This afternoon I read the text (it took just over 2 hours), and found it very entertaining. I hadn't realized what loving, playful, sociable creatures lions are.The author is obviously a better photographer than writer: Her style is rather formal and a little stiff. But she's also very matter-of-fact and straightforward, and her subject matter is engaging, if you are interested in animal behavior. She simply describes what she observed, and compares and contrasts it with what others have written about lion behavior and speculates a little, but never editorializes.I think children would enjoy the pictures but find the text rather boring. You could scan it and summarize what is happening for them.The three litters of cubs are absolutely adorable, but not overly \\"cutesy\\" at all. It was also charming to see how affectionate and devoted the parents are with each other. I was surprised how well the pictures depict behaviors, considering how accustomed to movies I've become.

Even so, a handsome stranger catches up to her, and before she knows what's happening, Miss Allard is in his arms--being kissed!The young lady slaps the assailant, of course, but not before her reputation has been fairly tarnished--and the memory of his passionate kiss forever sealed on her lips. The stranger in question, the Duke of Kelbourne, has made a name for himself with such roguish acts. Now, to allay rumors, the mortified Miss Allard must cut short her Season and return home, where she'll concoct an elaborate plan to exact her revenge. Little does she know, however, that the duke aslo has some plans up his rakish sleeve . . .Camy here:This kept my interest from page one until the end. I really felt for Julia when the Duke's selfish act threatened her reputation not just in London but also back home in the country.There are maybe a few too many characters to keep straight and a little bit of narrative head-hopping. Also, the heroine's revenge plan had several holes in it, but the plot made it seem like the only option available to a bitter and angry young woman with no other resources. I just thought it was a bit silly for her not to realize the Duke is much more experienced and might see through her inconsistent behavior. However, this sort of revenge plan has been dealt with much less adroitly in other books I've read, and it was nice to see it done in this novel with both elegance and good emotional impact.The Inciting Incident in the prologue--the life-changing kiss--is terrific and shocking, and the motivations for the hero and heroine coming together again in Bath to kick off the story is both cute and plausible. The confrontation between hero and heroine near the end has excellent, dramatic dialogue, and the HEA scene is satisfying without being too cheesy. I did think the short epilogue was cheesy, but the last sentence was romantic.I would definitely read another of Ms. Woodward's novels. Very entertaining."},{"Title":"The Wagered Heart","review":"This story was an utter delight and I highly recommend it to any lover of recency romance. It was fun and funny and the characters were very well done. Even though it was a decent length I wish it could have been longer."},{"Title":"The Wagered Heart","review":"I have a weak spot for romance novels where the hero,through pure blindness for the pain his actions cause,leaves the heroine's life in shambles, and then graduallya long time later realizes the pain he has caused. Thenevents conspire to make the situation worse, where even hisrelatives who like the heroine warn him because they have hearda garbled story about her lack of propriety (which he knowsisn't so, since he forced the actions on her publicly, which causedher downfall). The hero and the heroine are perfect for eachother and all works out.If you like this sort of novel, \`The Wagered Heart' is a top member of the genreand very enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"The Wagered Heart","review":"Julia Allard looks forward to a Season in London with her cousin Caroline until a rakish gentleman accosts her in the street and kisses her in broad daylight! The Duke of Kelbourne claims he made a vow with Dame Fortune to kiss the most beautiful woman he saw that day. Julia doesn't care about vows or wager; all she knows is that she's just been insulted and humiliated in public. Julia is forced to return home to the country in disgrace, where she becomes the subject of cruel gossip. A year later, cousin Caro, newly married, invites Julia to join her in Bath. Julia happily accepts the invitation. The last person she expects or wants to see in Bath is the Duke of Kelbourne. Kel shows up to do his familial duty at the summons of his adored older sister, expecting to be bored, but once he sees Julia, his boredom vanishes. Kel tries to apologize for his insufferable behavior, but Julia feels his apology is shallow and insincere. She wants to humiliate him the way he humiliated her and concocts a scheme of revenge. Her cousin warns her that she might lose her head, but she doesn't imagine she might lose her heart. The plot of this novel is a little bit unconventional since the \\"meet cute\\" occurs so early and Julia hates Kel for what he did.The story is paced too slowly and there isn't much plot. I feel like the reader doesn't get to know either of the main characters very well. I think the book could have benefited from being longer so there could be more character development.I read Moonlight and Mischief first, and I may have liked this one better if I had not. Kel and his friend Lord Haverstone appear so different in that book than this one. Moonlight and Mischief is a spin-off of this book but is superior in plot and character development."},{"Title":"The Wagered Heart","review":"This is one of most boring Regency Romance I had read so far because it is humorless and lack witty dialogues."},{"Title":"The Silver Brumby","review":"The novel is set in Australia and is written in the style of seeing life through the eyes of the wild brumbies that populate the Cascades/ Snowy Mountains. The story revolves around Thowra a palomino colt who is born from Bel Bel (cream mare). Due to his colouring he is hunted and alienated by man and beast, and the story tells how the tiny silver colt grows from a unimportant foal to the king of the Cascades. It doesn't happen easily as Thowra and his half-brother Storm evade being captured, fight for the right to have a herd, and the right for supremacy in this hostile world.I have enjoyed this series of books, and as I come from Australia I like how it contains much Aboriginal culture and words (eg Thowra means 'the wind'). These books are unlike most horsey books as the story is about the horses lives, successes and struggles instead of the humans. A good thing about the Silver Brumby books are that the are all interlinked as most are about Thowra's offspring, friends or just about him as a legend.I would recommend this book to anyone who is curious about Australian life in the bush, or who is just an avid horse lover like me."},{"Title":"The Silver Brumby","review":"I first read this book when I was nine years old and I remember loving it. I read all the other books addictively for a few months then totally forgot about them. A week ago I was at the public library and, for some reason, I suddenly remembered those books I remembered loving so much. I decided to read the first one again.Once more I was swept up in brumby country where stallions fight to the death over mares and where man is an enamy. I found myself immersed in the world of Thowra, the magnificent silver horse who ran with the wind. The scenery is so well described you can picture it and you can really see through Thowra's eyes as he gallops away with the men on horseback at his heals.You don't need to be a horse-lover to enjoy these books. I'm not. All you need is an appreciation of seeing through the eyes of a character who isn't human and a love of animals in general. I recommend this book to those who liked Watership Down and to those who wish to be transported to a world that is totally different than any you have ever read about before."},{"Title":"The Silver Brumby","review":"This book is about a silver stallion that everyone wants to capture and tame, but Thowra escapes all the time and steals Golden and The Brolga fights with Yarraman, would Yarraman be killed or still be the King of Cascade brumbies?

Strongly recommend this for kids and adults alike!"},{"Title":"The Silver Brumby","review":"This book was written by Elyne Mitchell and i can tell you she's the greatest. Anyways, this book is filled with talking horses but that's OK for this once.Thowra is born out of the rare creamies mare and a proud strongest strongest chestnut stallion. Bel Bel knew he would be hunted so she woved a spell naming him Thowra of the wild wind of the night in the storm when he was born. He and his friend Storm stayed through all of their years together. Even through adulthood. When The Brogla was in prime of his life, he has defeated and killed Yarraman, Thowra's father. But he stole another creamy off The Man and soon he was famous. He was tried to be caught and tamed, but because he had a smart, wise and cunning mother and a strong and handsome father, he was unbeatable. Other stallions wanted to kill him.He also grew faster, cunning and stronger so strong was able to defeat The Brogla! So then he was the King of the Cascade Brumbies. He kept Golden and couple of his prized mare in the Secret Valley. Then in a legendary chase, Thowra the wild wind disappeared over the cliff and people thought that he ran to his death.

The book is very short (128 pages) and can be read in a couple of hours, nonetheless it describes combat operations in the F-105 from a personal viewpoint that will captivate most readers, particularly those familiar with the Thud or the air war in Southeast Asia.The book gives background about the author and USAF fighter pilots in general, and moves on to his tour of duty in Vietnam and the struggle to complete his 100 missions North and all the triumphs, tragedies, terror, and turmoil involved in attaining that lofty goal.The reason that I deducted one star from my rating is that despite the interesting and captivating prose in this book, it is horrendously scarred with typographical errors, bad grammar, and questionable punctuation. The problem is so pronounced that in some cases the errors seemingly change the intent of the author. This book could have seriously used a proofreader or at least a trip through spell check.Although there are other books on the F-105 in Vietnam that I would recommend before reading this one (in particular &quot;Thud Ridge&quot; and &quot;Going Downtown&quot; by Jack Broughton, &quot;When Thunder Rolled&quot; by Ed Rasimus, and &quot;100 Missions North&quot; by Ken Bell) this is a good book for F-105 enthusiasts, and is an interesting, if grammatically-challenged, personal account of the air war in Vietnam."},{"Title":"Altruistically Inclined?: The Behavioral Sciences, Evolutionary Theory, and the Origins of Reciprocity","review":"In Altruistically Inclined, Alex Field presents a superbly dense and provocative exploration of individual behavior and reasoning. From a background of economics, his deconstruction and reassembling of our understanding of what is rational is an ambitious challenge that Prof. Field manages to tackle and push forward without descending into the excess of intellectual obfuscation. Not that Prof. Field entirely avoids drilling so deep into subject matter that we find ourselves immersed in annotation and data such that we must occasionally come up for air before choking on the dust left by a speeding intellect. It's a delicate dance and Prof. Field is to be commended for offering his thesis not as a debunking but as a methodical enhancement to current and classical science. His map of what might be referred to as a behavioral genome is hugely detailed and while he doesn't seek to redraw the boundaries, he offers topography within those lines that suggest vastly different interpretations than prior snapshots of the surface revealed. The author succeeds in arguing his thesis from multiple perspectives and applying a command of interdisciplinary reasoning. The effect is an elegant and compelling essay that sketches a portrait of our brain that is both an x-ray into evolutionary development and a broader credible reflection that speaks to the puzzles of social and political intercourse . As Behavior sciences lean toward inexactness, Mr. Field has been able to apply formula and rigor in measuring and testing traits characterized by nuance. That Mr. Field is an economist is evidenced throughout this book - His presentation of the data leaves the reader with an audit trail and confidence that support his theory and anticipate challenges occurring to the engaged reader. Beware though, this book is not a summer breeze. Though not without humor this book is a serious tome, and not written for \\"the layman\\" . As prefaced remarks so often allude to an effort by the author to make content more accessible to the non-disciplined reader, it is refreshing that Prof. Field avoids this dumbing down pitfall and engages readers as fellow academicians. That being said, this \\"layman\\" found his way through the material and can recommend Altruistically Inclined to others inclined toward the informative."},{"Title":"Sue Barton, student nurse (Comet books for young people)","review":"Sue B beats Cherry Ames hands down. Both are nursing series and I like them both but Sue Barton series includes character and plot development that the Ames books just don't have though they are amusing. Sue Barton is fully fleshed out character that you want to succeed.This book is about her probationary year in which she has several exciting adventures that firmly awaken her to why she wants to be a nurse."},{"Title":"Sue Barton, student nurse (Comet books for young people)","review":"This is the first of the \\"Sue Barton\\" series. In this story, Sue enters nursing school. She meets two girls, Kit and Connie, who become her best friends. And during their first year there, Sue learns the techniques of nursing as she is gradually moved from one department to another in the course of her studies.One running concern the student nurses have, is whether they will have the courage to risk their lives in a life-or-death emergency. Sue is especially doubtful about this. Then, one night she herself is rushed into surgery for an emergency appendectomy. Then, while recovering on the ward, she suddenly comes up against a delirious patient who is trying to escape from the hospital. Can Sue stop her --even if the situation puts Sue herself into danger?This is a wonderful story. Having been first published in 1936, some of the dialogue is a little dated, but otherwise, the story moves quickly and builds to an exciting and logical climax. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sue Barton, student nurse (Comet books for young people)","review":"This is the first book in the series. It starts with Sue joining forces with her soon to be best friends Kit and Connie on a wonderful and some times frightening adventure in nursing school. This is the way nursing should be taught ......with the students living in the hospital having classes in the morning and working with patients part of day.This book gives a delightful view of a bygone era. I highly reccomend this series for all ages.An interesting bit of trivia......Helen Boylston was living with Laura Ingalls Wilder while writing some of the Sue Barton books. Helen and Rose Wilder were friends."},{"Title":"Sue Barton, student nurse (Comet books for young people)","review":"I loved these books as a child, and 40 years later (30 of them, nursing) I still love them. The books are a fascinating time capsule of nursing in the 1930's through '50's. The surface of nursing has changed immensely, but the spirit of it is shown vividly in these stories: respectful, non-pitying caring for people in their crunch times. And on a third level, they're fine stories of growing up, in any age."},{"Title":"Sue Barton, student nurse (Comet books for young people)","review":"These were probably my absolutely favorite books back in the day.Every single one of them are a great read.It brings back sooo many memories seeeing them again!I encourage any young person (or older for that matter!), toread the series of the books.They're all wonderful!"},{"Title":"Sue Barton, student nurse (Comet books for young people)","review":"This is the book that inspired me to be a nurse - I read my original copy (I won't say how many years ago!) until it fell apart. I just re-read it and it took me right back. It reminded me of when it was common to be kind, caring, and loving. It was a good reminder that maybe we all should take time to care about others and maybe want something NOT for how much money or fame it will bring, but for how much it will help others.The next books from those days that I want to find are the biographies of Florence Nightingale and Dr. Tom Dooley."},{"Title":"Sue Barton, student nurse (Comet books for young people)","review":"35 years after reading this the first time, I found myself wanting to read all about Sue and her friends again.

I love it."},{"Title":"Whose Bible Is It?: A Short History of the Scriptures","review":"This is an introduction to the History of the Bible, but even readers who are already familiar with the outline of the subject will, I think, discover many details that are new to them in this very well told story.The first half of the book deals with the establishment of the Jewish and Christian Canons. The summary of what is in the books of the Old and the New Testament is perhaps a little pedestrian, but I found the discussion of the Septuagint and its importance interesting.In the second half of the book, Pelikan discusses how the Bible was used, revised and interpreted from the Middle Ages to the present time. It includes, for instance, a discussion how Christians squared the making of sacred images in illuminated manuscripts or icons with the prohibition against such a practice in the Old Testament; a section on the Qur'an's relationship to the two parts of the Bible; one on new translations of the Bible during the Renaissance following the revival of Hebrew, Greek and classical Latin; and one on the hugely important role the Bible played during the Reformation. He discusses \`lower criticism' - the clearing up of linguistic problems presented by the texts - and \`higher criticism' - the work done from the 17th century onwards which examined the Bible as one might examine a text attributed to, say, Homer: as a patchwork put together by human beings of human writings produced at different times, rather than, as in the case of the Five Books of Moses, being the text by one author working under divine inspiration. Other challenges to the literary truth of the Bible were to come from historical, archaeological, anthropological, and finally of course scientific disciplines, starting with a critique of the Pentateuch but eventually reaching the figure of Jesus himself. Pelikan suggests interestingly that the Roman Catholic understanding of the Bible was slightly less vulnerable to these developments, since the medieval Catholic Church had long taught that the Bible could be understood on four different levels: the literal, the allegorical, the moral and the eschatological, whereas the Protestant beliefs had based themselves firmly on the literal meaning of the Bible. Even so, it was Protestant scholars who were most active in Higher Criticism.None of this, Pelikan points out, affected the increased circulation of the Bible. In English the Authorized Version has been followed in recent times by a flood of revised versions in more modern English. In 1986 the American Bible Society distributed nearly 290 million bibles. There has been an explosion of bibles in Africa (Pelikan gives a charming extract from a Masai creed in which \`Jesus was always on safari doing good').The last chapter and the Epilogue are Pelikan's own eloquent meditations on the eternal value of the Bible to him, to our culture, but first and foremost to the Jewish and Christian communities, \`neither of whom would be anything without it'.I regret the absence of an index, and having the source notes at the end of the book rather than at the bottom of the relevant page is a minor inconvenience; but it does not detract from the value of this scholarly, sensitive and thoughtful book, a fitting memorial to a distinguished author who sadly died in May this year."},{"Title":"Whose Bible Is It?: A Short History of the Scriptures","review":"INTRODUCTION:It is unfortunate that most Christians in the US are clueless of how the Bible (Old Testament + New Testament) came to be compiled or made into the canon that we have today. Pelikan's short history (that spans 256 pages) of Bible's origins, translations, transmission, re-discovery, preservation, and publication is one of the most readable and accurate book in this topic of the history of the Bible.Unlike the subtitle, the title question spurs the reader to search for the answer. In its introduction, it seems the answer is ... it belongs \\"to all the people that believe\\" (the Jews and Christians) ... but the real answer is revealed in no uncertain terms at the very end, in the Afterwards chapter.AUTHOR:Recently deceased Dr. Pelikan, former Yale professor, Lutheran believer progressing towards and adopting Orthodoxy, is one of the best historical theologian America has ever had. For a man who jokingly said recently that he would be \\"dying without an unpublished thought\\" and with over 30 scholarly books written, he is best known for his magnum opus 5 volumes \\"The Christian Tradition - a History of the Development of Doctrine\\", \\"Jesus Through the Centuries\\", \\"Mary Through the Centuries\\", and \\"Creedo.\\"CONTENT:As someone who loves history and for whom the Bible is not a strange topic, there was lots of things to underline and notes to write in \\"Whose Bible Is It?\\" Too much to even list here. What I will say is that the mystery behind such terms as Septuagint or TaNaKh have been demystified. Also, as a result of this read I know better how to discuss with Muslims about the Jewish and Christian Bible. The most insightful chapter, I have to say, has been \\"The Strange New World within the Bible\\" (the one beforethe Afterwords chapter.CONCLUSION:* Have you ever read a book and said, wow!?!* Do you wish you had an appetite for reading or studying the Bible?* Do you wonder how this complex book called the Bible (Jewish and Christian ones) came into being and how it was read throughout the centuries?\\"Whose Bible is it?\\" provides more than answers to these questions. This book provides a delectable account of the history of the book Jews and Christians revere so much and call the \\"revealed word of God\\" - a great short history geared for everybody: Jew, Christian, and Muslim; for believer and non-believer; for the curious, the timid, and also the devout ones; for the liberal, the fundamentalist, and the moderate ones; for the novice and scholars; for the young and old.Enjoy your re-discovery of the historical and literary beauty of the Bible !"},{"Title":"Whose Bible Is It?: A Short History of the Scriptures","review":"Following the example of Aristotle, who in his Poetics summarizes the Odyssey in three sentences (\`This is essential; the rest is episode'), one might offer a brief summary of the Bible thus: \\"God creates the earth and makes a covenant with his people. They enter the promised land and build the temple, then survive its destruction and their dispersal. God sends his Son, who dies on the cross and is resurrected. Various letters follow.\\"But of course, this would not do justice to the greatest book written by mankind under divine inspiration. Jaroslav Pelikan's Whose Bible Is It? pays its proper due to the Holy Book and to the scholarship that it has inspired, not by providing a summary of its content (although some paragraphs come close to paraphrasing the plot line) but by presenting a brief and personal survey of how the Bible was compiled, translated and interpreted throughout the ages.It is, if you wish, the Bible's making-of, the behind-the-scenes documentary that will make the reader eager to watch and rewatch the film all over again. It is replete with snippets and excerpts from the Old and from the New Testaments that make you grab your volume of the Scriptures to check the original context, with teasers sampling the most famous scenes from the church's history that you may or may not remember from school days, and with a cast of characters that makes church fathers and reformationists look like intellectual heroes. The soundtrack should be set to one of the classical masterpieces that the Bible has inspired: Bach's Saint Matthew Passion or Haendel's Messiah are the director's top recommendations. Bonus features include an introduction to the Jewish tradition that may be unfamiliar to some readers, but which illustrates the close ties between the \\"peoples of the book\\"--an expression which, interestingly, comes from the Qur'an, a reminder of the lacking third party when one speaks about the Judeo-Christian civilization.There were many notions or words that I was not familiar with, and I made notes to check their definition and remember their meaning. The Tanakh, the expression that the author uses to designate the Old Testament, is an acronym for the three parts of the Hebrew Bible: the Torah (\\"Teaching\\", also known as the Pentateuch), Nevi'im (\\"Prophets\\"), and Ketuvim (\\"Writings,\\" or Hagiographa). The Septuagint (the earliest Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, from Alexandria in Egypt under the Ptolemies) was generally abandoned in favour of the Masoretic text as the basis for translations of the Old Testament into Western languages from St. Jerome's Bible (the Vulgate) to the present day. In Eastern Christianity, translations based on the Septuagint still prevail. A number of books which are part of the Greek Septuagint but are not found in the Hebrew Bible are often referred to as deuterocanonical books by Roman Catholics referring to a later secondary (i.e. deutero) canon. Most Protestants term these books as apocrypha. Evangelicals do not accept the deuterocanonical books as canonical, although Protestant Bibles included them in Apocrypha sections until around the 1820s. However, the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox churches include these books as part of their Old Testament.But these reading notes do little justice to Jaroslav Pelikan's beautiful prose and gentle humor, and they make little more sense than attempts to summarize the Bible. There are entire paragraphs or even chapters that I would like to quote extensively to convey the impression they make on the reader. Here are three excerpts that I find typical of the author's sense of humor:\\"[Serbs and Croats] speak basically the same language--which means they can understand each other very well when they call each other some of those obscene and quite untranslatable names, and they are kept apart by a common language. Sometimes it almost seems as though the peoples of the Balkans might get along better if only they could not understand each other's language so well.\\"\\"An appalling ignorance of the Bible seems to have become epidemic in our time, as is evident from the nervous laughter when on a stage or at a dinner party someone mentions the subject of angels or prayer or the immortality of the soul. Nevertheless, one of its positive features (although it is hard to think of what the other positive features may be) is the thrill of discovery that comes to otherwise fairly educated people when they confront it for the first time.\\"\\"To invoke a Kierkegaardesque figure of speech, the beauty of the language of the Bible can be like a set of dentist's instruments neatly laid out on a table and hanging on a wall, intriguing in their technological complexity and with their stainless steel highly polished--until they set to work on the job for which they were originally designed. Then all of a sudden my reaction changes from 'How shiny and beautiful they all are!' to 'Get that damned thing out of my mouth!'\\""},{"Title":"Whose Bible Is It?: A Short History of the Scriptures","review":"I decided to read this volume after a friend mentioned an interesting history of the creation of the King James version of the bible and I thought it behoved me to make sure I had a good picture of the several thousand years of biblical history that preceded the KJV. I really didn't expect it to be particularly interesting or insightful. Much to my surprise Pelikan managed to be both of those things, and a number of others, without displaying any particular axe to grind.The bible is hardly the staid, stodgy collection of pages that many of us think it is. Whether you think of it as a collection of tales and philosophy, or direct revelation, any number of peoples have adopted it, and changed either its wording or its interpretation. Often with unexpected results. Pelikan captures much of this as the bible shifts from the Torah, to the Tanach, and then the Septaguint, etc., etc., etc. This isn't dry history but a tale of human development and many of the great intellectual movements of Western culture.Pelikan is most interested in how to religions can use the same book and draw contradictory meanings from it. In Judaism, the bible is the public side of Jewish law and thought, as well is the (admittedly sometimes distorted) history of a people. It is important in itself. Christianity often views the Old Testament as the the source of evidence of Jesus' divine nature. As such the two can read the same text and see different things. In addition, They are reading in different languages with that whole set of complications. As Pelikan traces the history of the bible we begin to see a vast tapestry of the conflict between tradition and change. We begin to realise that this diversity is important and that what is needed is understanding, not conversion.There's no lack of scholarship here, but Pelikan is very good at avoiding excesses if detail which shedding light on the important facts. If you are looking for a book that discusses the bible without any layers of bias this is it."},{"Title":"Whose Bible Is It?: A Short History of the Scriptures","review":"Since others have already published excellent reviews, let me simply add this.As one who has studied Scripture, the history of Christianity, textual criticism, and exegesis, this book's greatest assistance for me was in tying all of these topics together. Pelikan ties things together in such a way that the reader is able to see how worldview has impacted how one understands the Scriptures and how one understands the Scriptures has impacted world view.This book will especially be helpful for the average reader who has little understanding of how we got the Bible that we have today, but is also good for the advanced student because Pelikan weaves things together in such a wonderful way."},{"Title":"Whose Bible Is It?: A Short History of the Scriptures","review":"This is not the type of book one would expect from a scholar such as Dr. Pelikan. As an avid fan of Dr. Pelikan, I my expectations were set too high, perhaps. Conclusions concerning many questions are avoided and what we are left with is a sentimental feeling about the Bible. That is all well and good if that is your intent for reading. There is little to offend (or challenge) Jew, Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, or even Islam in this book. That could be a strength or a weakness depending on your expectations. As a history, such an approach forces the author to leave a great deal of detail out. As a popular historical work, there is nothing wrong with that approach and indeed it may be a wonderful introductory text on the topic.The discussion of problems in translation and the formation of the Septuagint are particularly interesting. Though we would like more detail, it is sufficient to make one hungry to seek out more in other works as a good introduction should do. However, Dr. Pelikan's writing style, mentioned by some other reviewers already, is often complex and could prove difficult for an introductory text.There are mixed feelings with this work. Perhaps it is good as a popular introductory text on the formation of the Bible and questions of the canon. Ecumenical factors seem to be the guiding principle rather than following the evidence where it might lead. The moment a path of exploration presents itself, Dr. Pelikan quickly changed direction to avoid polemic. The result is a book with a lot of content but without much point other than feeling good and self assured no matter your religious background. But, as a popular historical study, perhaps that is as good as it gets."},{"Title":"Whose Bible Is It?: A Short History of the Scriptures","review":"Wonderfully mis-titled, \\"Whose Bible Is It\\" will leave those seeking an authoritative document that proves their particular position regarding ownership of the Bible woefully disappointed.

Going deeper than a cursory overview yet short of a scholarly critique, this work will be found to be quite informative for those who seek a better understanding of how God's known Word came into being.\\"If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\\" John 8:31-32Whose Bible Is It?: A Short History of the Scriptures"},{"Title":"Whose Bible Is It?: A Short History of the Scriptures","review":"Not quite what I was expecting, but I wasn't disappointed.

To put it in plain English, for the Jews, it is the sacred Law; for Christians, it is a Love allegory. Pelikan, does not lose sight of some of the larger issues raised by his title, but his question of who owns the Bible, has always been there. So, today, when an overwhelming majority of Americans believe in a strict literalism of the Bible, how controversial to inform them of the number of people who lost their lives because they favored a certain interpretation, based on a particular translation, then the matter becomes tragic. Pelikan even goes so far as to acknowledge that a deeper study of the Bible may cause some of its students to lose their blind faith in it as a Textus Receptus. Pelikan informing and thoughtful book debates that the question of who owns the Bible is, basically, contemptuous; but to consider it in those terms, then the best way is for Jews and Christians to realize that it is the keystone of their faith.

But the Bible didn't stop growing 2,000 years ago; it continues to be interpreted, modified, translated through the ages.Did Christianity steal the Bible from the Jews? Pelikan has a way of uniting Christian and Jew even while recognizing an impenetrable rift.

He sees diversity as something to be appreciated, not condemned.One cannot help but appreciate the Bible more as a living, growing, entity after reading this. The Word is alive!

It appeared that the author had done his historical research and then needed to share that learning through the dialogue of his characters. Writing in hindsight the author had material the characters would never have known.

He died before editing was completed, though. This book starts well, with all the promise of a typical Uris story. Big, brawling, filled with colorful characters and faraway places...but once Amanda Kerr walks on stage, downhill things go from there. She's not credible as a character, nor is Zachary O'Hara, the tale's protagonist.The rest simply doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The plot takes off in different directions, but never quite comes together anywhere until a conclusion that brings in a \\"family secret\\" which fails to justify that conclusion's assumptions. Still, some of the secondary characters are loads of fun in the manner of Uris at his best. There are authors in print who don't write as well in their prime years as Uris did at the last, with fate not allowing him to finish the job here. Mildly recommended to Uris fans.

As a matter-of-fact, I thought the last chapter was anti-climactic.There's plenty of events that help convey the &quot;times are changing&quot; secondary theme to the story. Examples of this included the change in attitudes toward slavery and the education to be afforded women in society during the late nineteenth century.I had trouble keeping track of the lead character since the lead switched back and forth between O'Hara, the strong Marine male lead, and Amanda, the very headstrong female lead.This book was NOT in the same catagory with Exodus and Mila 18. Sorry 'bout that."},{"Title":"O'Hara's Choice LP","review":"It's the late 1800s. Horace Kerr speaks: &quot;Our most thrilling declarations for freedom and our most noble documents notwithstanding, America belongs to white Protestants. The Civil War did not change things; it merely altered them with scar tissue. The true battle cry of freedom has not come to pass.&quot;Set in tumultuous times for the Marine Corps --- and for America --- O'HARA'S CHOICE joins two headstrong young people in a love that many covet but few ever experience. Amanda and Zachary, as far apart on the social scale as A is from Z, try to rid themselves of the unstoppable attraction that gnaws at them, but resistance proves futile. A chunk of time in the latter half of the 19th century sees these two risking status, career and even their lives to quench their desires. Amanda, possessed of a striking beauty, could have her pick of beaus. She is stubbornly drawn to the dashing young Marine, at first a gesture of defiance --- a gesture that backfires. Born to wealth, she alone holds her father's heart and her quick intelligence earns her his ear too. Horace Kerr has influence, but hungers for more power. When it becomes obvious that Amanda has fallen for Zachary O'Hara, her father's attitude turns sour. He pitches himself into a rage, on the verge of disinheriting his favorite child. Horace Kerr didn't raise his daughter to throw away her life in the role of a marine's wife.Irish immigrant Paddy O'Hara raised his son among the Corpsmen, driving him to enlist as a Marine. Tormented by too much drinking and dangerous bouts of anger, Paddy sets the course for his son's life. Zachary becomes a man filled with anguish, torn by his love for Amanda and his allegiance to the Corps.At this point in history, the Marine Corps teeters delicately on the brink of extinction. Saving it will take great effort and loyalty on the part of the remaining few officers. Zachary looks like the brilliant light that could guide them back to the top. He immerses himself in a highly secret, critical report that is designed, if put together right, to make the Corps indispensable and, in the bargain, to help protect America's shores. Its success seems to pivot on O'Hara's leadership, which would require a minimum of two heartbreaking years away at sea. So how does he choose? After much soul-searching and agonizing, he makes his choice. And Amanda makes hers.It has been nearly a half-century since Leon Uris's first novel, BATTLE CRY. As with his other stories, O'HARA'S CHOICE is a historical epic laced with political overtones. One is never left doubting which way the author leans on any one of a myriad of subjects. Uris can stuff more into 400 pages than most authors can fit into twice that many. And here, once again, he tackles one of his favorite subjects, the Marine Corps, with his fondness for the brotherhood stemming from his years in the Corps. Don't miss this, his last, great novel --- with an ending that will leave you stunned.

Surprised to see it on the half-price table, I bought it from curiosity and finished it out of loyalty, having read 'Battle Cry' in the '50s and almost all his subsequent books. This book has almost no military action, an almost melodramatic plot, and (worst of all for me) the dialog sounds like people speaking in modern times. Having served with the Marine Corps, I found some of the sentiments and attitudes hoaky and the romance between the two main characters (this being a clash of strong wills) was wooden. You'd do better with Ayn Rand. Shortly after starting the book, I noticed that Uris died this year; I'm betting his secretary and a sophomore American Lit major finished it for him. This is a sad way to cap a fine career, one that brought me enjoyment most of my adult life."},{"Title":"O'Hara's Choice LP","review":"My advise: read the whole book (it is pretty good), but skip the last chapter. Compose your own ending. Believe me, your ending will be a better ending than the one the author penned.Being a former Marine, I was satisfied with the treatment of the Marines, in general. The ending, however, was all wrong. It was as if Uris had died (which he did in 2003), and some anti-military feminist finished the last chapter for him.You've been warned."},{"Title":"O'Hara's Choice LP","review":"From the opening pages of Battle Cry, through Mila-18 and Exodus, Uris develops his fine stories of people in battle. Battle against prejudice, against poverty, against class structures, against themselves. This, his last novel, once more places people in jeopardy. Covering a period from just before the Civil War to the early 1890's, it is a tale of honorable men fighting to save what they believe in, most noticeably Uris' beloved Marine Corps, but also fighting for a chance to live life and love as they wish, to acknowledge the right of all to be free, and for honor itself.Zachary O'Hara is the model Marine; practically raised within the corps by his father, Paddy O'Hara, a Civil War Medal of Honor hero who, at one point or another, had saved most of the lives of the male characters in this book. Zachary must fight the battle common to children of famous parents, that of making his way in the world out from the shadow of his parent. His external battle takes the shape of drafting policy papers that will show the necessity of Marine Corps as a functioning part of the U. S. Military, both in the present time and in the foreseeable future, as in the late 1880's the general feeling was that the Marine Corps was a body that had outlived its usefulness.But this battle must take place alongside his battle to be able to love Amanda Kerr, daughter of ship-building magnate Horace. As Zachary is clearly below Amanda's station, marriage would seem to be out of the question - but Amanda herself is a strong-willed, intelligent woman who knows how to broker deals.With this as the skeleton upon which to construct his novel, it would seem that sure-handed Uris would have an easy time building a strong novel. But perhaps because Uris died before doing the final edits on this work, the novel comes off as somewhat disjointed, characters (especially the minor ones) not as clearly delineated as is normal for Uris, and occasional pieces of text are repeated, something I'm sure he would have eliminated had he had the chance. As it is, there are places that feel incomplete, dialogue that seems to assume the reader knows more than has been presented, and the prime story, that of ensuring the continuance of the Marine Corps, does not seem to carry the sense of urgency and criticality that I'm sure Uris intended the novel to portray. The historical backdrop of both national events and his character's past does not have enough detail to really make this era come alive. The climax of the story comes as something of a surprise, as only minimal hints about it have been set in earlier portions of the novel.What could have been a strong story of love and nation-building is compromised, leaving only the feeling of what could have been with perhaps another hundred pages and some strong editing.

His final two novels, \\"A God in Ruins\\" and \\"O'Hara's Choice,\\" rank as the two poorest novels that I have read in the past 5 years. Not only were the plots sketchy and improbable, but the main characters were contrived, stereotypical and forgettable. His attempt to push a certain modern political agenda through his books conflicted with events of those times - and in the process alienated many of his faithful readers who enjoyed his previous agenda-neutral historical novels. You would be best served to read all of his earlier works - which I found masterful and riveting - and forget these two books that only show the sad decline of a once-great author."},{"Title":"O'Hara's Choice LP","review":"Trinity may not be Leon Uris's best book, but personally it's my favorite book. That being said, I'm not out to trash Uris, but O'Hara's Choice is a waste of time. I'll leave character development and plot intracacies to other reviewers, my focus is the story itself. As the book unwound, I was reasonably well captivated. I wondered along the way how much actual Marine history played into the story, in terms of the fight to keep the Corps alive. (Interested enough to research that later.) The problem is that the story wasn't compelling enough to have an ending that wasn't supported by the events that lead up to it. 390 pages of showing someone's emotions progressing in one direction so the reader can be tricked with a \\"Gotcha!\\" at the end. Well that's fine, if the 'gotcha' seems plausible, but in this book it absolutely didn't.SLIGHT SPOILER - The ending reminded me of 'The Partner' by Grisham, which had the same problem. I don't read Grisham anymore, because to me that was a big let down. The last two pages were not reasonably supported by the first 390 or so, and to me, that makes for a bad book."},{"Title":"O'Hara's Choice LP","review":"Uris' death, three months prior to this book's publication, not only cut short the career of a great novelist, but also another sequel.I loved his novels Trinity, Redemption and QBVII. They were great stories spun in the tradition of historical novels. His story-telling ability and character creation communicate the humanity of the age and culture about which he writes.O'Hara's Choice is no exception. Patriotic Duty and family loyalty duel in this tale set in the Gilded Age that followed the U. S. Civil War. Leon Uris was a great writer. He had the ability to create characters who communicate the age and times in which Uris set his novels.The worst part of coming to the end of this book is the nagging awareness that this is the last Uris novel the reader will read."},{"Title":"O'Hara's Choice LP","review":"Perhaps I was spoiled by Leon Uris' fine work, Trinity, and expected too much from a novel dashed off late in his writing career. Whatever the reason, I came to O'Hara's Choice with high expectations, too high as it turned out. The novel is little but a high-class \\"bodice ripper,\\" a modern romance with no well developed theme and poorly justified actions. The characters appear flat as well, leaving the novel very much as they entered it with little discernible character development en route. Let's take a look first at the strong points of the book. Unfortunately, this will not take us long.Uris does have a fine command of the language and has produced 394 pages without allowing trite, overused phraseology to weaken either description or dialogue. At rare times, the writing does flow at a rapid clip, carrying the reader along almost effortlessly, and I offer the description of the battle of Bull Run (to become known as the first battle of Manassas) as a welcome example of this. The early sexual tension between Zach and Amanda is also handled adroitly although elsewhere it sometimes mimics the \\"bodice ripper\\" genre. The inter-service jealousy and derision between the Navy and the Marine Corps is realistically portrayed but becomes tedious and repetitious after a while. Horace Kerr's internal dichotomy between his progressive thoughts toward the recently-freed Negroes and his culturally learned biases against non-white races comes to the fore several times, but some of his explosions are not well supported by earlier thoughts and actions and appear artificial and contrived. So much for the strong points.Uris' introduction of the various characters strikes me as poorly accomplished. It is as though one is watching a disconnected slide show (or, for our younger readers who may never have seen a slide show, let's call it a PowerPoint presentation). Characters pop up rather unexpectedly, and the reader has a poor idea of what their relationship may be to the other characters until much further along in the reading. Fortunately, Uris begins each chapter with the date and location of the action. These \\"stage directions\\" do help keep us somewhat oriented as to where and when we are, but we must be careful top pay attention to them or risk significant confusion.Several \\"red herrings\\" crop up here and there with no particular contribution to the story line. For instance, Horace Kerr, Amanda's rich industrialist father, is set up to lose his life in a storm at sea but survives with a few bumps and bruises. Later he is equally foreshadowed to suffer a debilitating if not fatal stroke, but that coup de grace never comes after all.Then there is Emily, Amanda's older sister, who is mentally unbalanced and is generally stored away out of sight in the unfrequented north wing of the mansion. I suppose she functions fairly well as one of several skeletons in the Kerr family closet, a fact that is strongly underscored once the reader finally learns the horrible secret that explains her insanity. Still, she never plays even a strong supporting role in the Amanda - Zach relationship, which is the unifying thread throughout the book, and the reader is left to wonder whether her character might have been more fully developed--or omitted.Is there even an identifiable theme in this novel? Basically we find two young lovers, one torn between her duty to carry on the family fortune and power and her desire to marry her Marine lover; the other torn between his love (or lust) for Amanda and his \\"marriage\\" to the Marine Corps. The latter problem is exacerbated by a dreadful secret that Zach carries with him concerning his Marine-hero father. None of these conflicts ever finds satisfactory resolution. There is no denouement. The lovers are conflicted to begin with and are equally conflicted when the novel ends. Their situation, while at times compared with that of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, never reaches the tragic level of those more famous lovers, whose position as the symbols of unachievable love remains unassailed by Uris' novel."},{"Title":"O'Hara's Choice LP","review":"Leon Uris is one of my absolute favorite writers, i cannot begin to write how sad i was to read about his passing last summer.This book was still &quot;in production&quot; (for lack of a better phrase) at the time of his death and it is all too apparent in the pages of O'HARA'S CHOICE; the characters are sparsely written, intense detail is uneven though the story and the overall &quot;theme&quot; of the novel-- a critical moment after the Civil War in the history of the Marine Corps-- is spotty and sometimes taken for granted. Still and all, Uris utilized his stock characters: the handsome and idealistic young man, the headstrong yet confused young woman. What I have loved about his novels over the years is how the more minor figures in the plots of his books have seemed entirely three dimentional and integral to the line of the story; yet in this novel the more minor characters are restricted to the corners of the tale.Bearing all this in mind, for any strong Leon Uris fan i would still recommend this book (just wait until it's in paperback). that it was his last novel which he was working on at the time of his death makes it all the more poignant and though i personally do not care for this book, i am happy to have read it and make it a part of my Uris collection and my respect for him and his work shall continue."},{"Title":"O'Hara's Choice LP","review":"Having always heard great things about Uris's writing I was excited to read this work about the US Marine Corps.

Unfortunately what I got was a implausible love story told in flowery overemotional language that more suited a Romance novel.I would definitely not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Tichborne Impostor","review":"Published in 1957, this book traces one of the strangest criminal cases in Victorian era. That is, The Tichborne Claimant case, which seized the national attention in the late 1860s and early 70s in England. The case is so improbable and ridiculous at first sight, but it is all true.In 1865, one Authur Orton, living in the frontier town of Wagga Wagga (I'm not kidding), Australia, visited the local lawyer, and claimed that he is Roger Charles Tichborne, the heir to the one of the most wealthiest aristocrats. Roger was supposed to be lost at sea 11 years before, and presumed dead then.This seemingly typical case of fraud develop into one of the longest trials (including two, civil and crimial) in British court when Roger's mother, crudulous old lady, believed that HE is the real Roger. Things get more complex (and funny, unintentionally) after the people in general also start to support Arthur Orton, and moreover, one of his lawyers, very hot-tempered, begins his speech before the judge in the most ill-advised manners.Physically, Atrhur (very fat) never looked like slim Roger. Authur spoke only English while Roger's first language was French. But somehow this apparently easy case languished even after the truths were too obvious to ignore.Gedded MacGregor's book records the facts about this now almost forgotten historical events, using the documents and letters. Though the writer's own 'wise' remarks about the case are unnecessary, the book itself is always readable, and the things described themseves are no doubt intriguing. The book is nothing that would help you understand more the Victorian people, literature, or society, -- the case is too original for that -- but it surely is a proof that some people just don't change.Recommeded for those interested in unique trials in Victorian era."},{"Title":"History of the Jews: From the Beginning to Early Christianity","review":"This is richly written and deeply emotional history of the Jews. The author, Simon Dubnov, wrote his tale from a social rather than a religious perspective, giving an excellent account of Jewish life and events from ancient times to the 20th Century. Particularly moving is the thought that the Russian Dubnov, whose life was so intensely dedicated to the preservation and telling of Jewish story, should die at the onset of the Holocaust, and thus be spared the living of this final and most horrific episode.If your library contains but one volume of history in this field, let it be Dubnov's."},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","review":"We don't get enough books to review here at Punknews.org HQ. To quote an old PSA, \\"Reading Is Fundamental!\\" I wholeheartedly agree. While a CD can let you hear the music as it's being played, a book on music can let you feel the music pulsing through it's pages and onto your fingertips. This is why I love reading books that have to do in some form with punk rock.Clocking in at a light 132 pages, Aimee Cooper's \\"Coloring Outside the Lines\\" is a light read, perfect for a Saturday afternoon or a long car ride. The book tells the story of Aimee's discovery of punk rock [via a stood up date and a very inebriated Johnny Thunders], and her subsequent involvement in the burgeoning LA punk scene. This woman was a part of \\"the Connected,\\" a now infamous group of LA punks who stuck together. She also worked for Slash magazine, where she met such punk rock luminaries as Exene and John Doe from X.The book goes into a decent amount of depth for it's abrupt length about Aimee's experiences with work, friends, shows, and the like. It reads in a very \\"diary\\" type of format - Aimee has opened up her soul in these pages and exposes it to the reader without fear of scrutiny. I, for one, applaud her for it.It's funny, because the book this reminds me of the most is \\"Amped\\" by Jon Resh [review here], and as I look up the info on this book on Amazon.com, I see that someone has already recommended \\"Amped\\" in addition to this book. I couldn't see a better pair. If you're looking for a belated Christmas present for someone, these books are it. Aimee's writing isn't perfect, nor will this book shatter any stereotypes, but it is a quick and interesting look into the 1980's LA punk scene [by someone other than Henry Rollins]."},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","review":"When punk came calling during the late 70's in Southern California, thousands of internally rebellious voices shrieked and many kegs of beer used as a shower. Unlike the NYC and UK punk movements, the LA punk scene was in a class of its own and a young college student, Aimee Cooper, got caught up in its mosh pit. Cooper spent 18 months within the scene, at the very tail end of the good years, and had numerous adventures with the misfits that followed her home and nearly created a punk rock commune in her duplex. Working as a receptionist for Slash magazine, Cooper has numerous occasions of being completely invisible to the punk rock elite like X's Exene and John Doe. On her days and nights off though, she was out having memorable rendezvous with riot police and rumbles down in Mexico. Often the innocent bystander, Cooper got the black eye for her commitment to her fellow punk rockers. She was also one of the players that demonstrated against Adam Ant during his visit to LA with the slogan \\"Black Flag Kills Ants On Contact.\\" Even though Cooper was not a major mover and shaker of punk rock history, her book Coloring Outside the Lines, is an honest biography about what it was like to be a girl and live the punk lifestyle before commercialism and New Wave took over. - Ruby GirlMedia.Com"},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","review":"Well, I've got to say that this quick-paced book was fun to read. The author obviously put her heart and soul into writing this memoir, and it shows. Her story was poignant at some points, exciting at others, often quite funny, but always entertaining.As someone who witnessed the LA punk scene first hand, I found this book mirrored many of my own experiences, both good and bad. It brought back a lot of memories. Thanks, Aimee, for sharing this part of your life with us!"},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","review":"I'd recommend this book not just to those with an interest in the heyday of punk rock, but anyone who simply enjoys a great read. Of course, it was fun reading all the \\"inside stories\\" that the author wrote about with such wit and insight. However, I also just had a terrific time moving from one chapter to the next -- most made me laugh, but some made me cry. But all along, I couldn't put it down!\\"Coloring Outside the Lines\\" was simply a wonderful book. Thank you, Aimee, for sharing your life experiences with me!!"},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","review":"I can't remember the last time I read a book that made me smile as much as &quot;Coloring Outside the Lines&quot;! It brought back some great memories of an important part of my life. Just as important, the book was very well written -- it really was hard for me to put down.I'd recommend it highly, not only to anyone who has an interest in what the punk rock scene was really like, but to anyone who simply enjoys a good read. My wife was never into punk music, but that didn't stop her from raving about the book, too!"},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","review":"Gigs. Riots. Adventures. Friendhip. Betrayal. It's both funny and dramatic. A true story that took place during 18 months in L.A. Also has a great message about standing up for your own beliefs, even if you lose friends because of it.LOOOOVED IT!"},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","review":"All I can say is that I felt that with each and every word written, that I was part of this punk scene that the author herself was in. As I read on and on, I visualized each and every day of her life and the lives of the characters. I felt like I was there. It would make a great film. I hope to see more books from this new author in the future. Kudos to her! A book well written for any age. I really enjoyed it and will let all my friends know about it. Cooper is well spoken and quite diverse."},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","review":"I'm a few years younger than Aimee Cooper, the author of this book, but I grew up in Los Angeles, and I was obsessed with all the bands she writes about, especially Black Flag. I was only ten years old, but I still claimed Black Flag as my own. The music meant something to those of us who couldn't relate to the vanilla music that was being played on Kasey Kasem's Weekly Top-40. And the more our teachers, social workers and probation officers criticized punk and alternative music as bad, the better it sounded to us, and the louder we played it.My only disappointment with this memoir is that it seemed as if the author left out too many critical details about her life. If an older person writes an autobiography, they've lived long enough to skim on the details, but writing a book when you're barely 30 years old means that you haven't lived long enough to leave out entire chunks of your life.Some reviewers have accused the author of being a poser, a punk rock wannabe, but I disagree. She never claims to be more than what she was, a huge fan of LA punk rock music, one who loved the music so much that she took a job as a receptionist for a punk rock magazine, even though she had a college degree and she had endless life choices open to her.Aimee writes about having a dream that turned into an obsession, and then finding a way to live out every second of that obsession with punk rock. Most people just sit around and wish they did, but she went out and lived the life that she wanted for herself.For anyone interested in the critical years of the punk rock scene in Los Angeles, I highly recommend this book as a companion to the more in-depth books written about the subject, including \\"We Got the Neutron Bomb: The Untold Story of L.A. Punk.\\""},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","review":"This book is a quick read but still satisfies in story and how it's told. It sort of gives you a feeling of how it must've been in that time and place without going into too much detail. It's an art to tell a story with just enough words. And in my opinion this book does just that."},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","review":"Coloring Outside the Lines is a fun compilation of vignettes during an often misunderstand era of music and youth. It is great to follow the development of the author's growth and persepective as she lives through the adventures of punk rock that most consider legend. I recommend this for anyone who is interested in the culture, whether you were there or not."},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","review":"I really enjoyed this book - you will too! It has it all - humor, suspense, tragedy and drama. Can't ask for more than that. And the best part is that Aimee's stories are all true!My teenage daughter just started reading it and she can't put it down. Just an all-around great book!"},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","review":"Coloring Outside the Lines by Aimee Cooper was a very easy read. I felt like I was reading someone's diary, expressing all the sad times and happy times in one's life.Having been pretty much a conformist most of my life, it was interesting to read about a lifestyle totally foreign to my way of thinking. We tend to judge people by the way they look, but this book made you realize that the punks were just like everyone else, with insecurities and strengths, just expressing it differently.As with most periods in our lives, we tend to look back on them with a certain amount of fondness, but realize that we have to move on. Coloring Outside the Lines does just that."},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","review":"I read this entire book the afternoon I got it, I just didn't want to stop. Cooper's writing stlye is simple and quick to read, but still grabs you and pulls you into a vivid 1980s L.A. punk scene. I felt I could well relate to her character, but I think even if we didn't have much in common I still would've enjoyed reading this book. I just finished it yesterday, and I'm already looking forward to re-reading it, 5 stars just doesn't say how great this book is."},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","review":"I just finished this book and I thought it was great! I've read a bunch of punk books, but this one made me feel like I was really there.

I'm lending it to all my friends!"},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","review":"What an amazing book, the author had me hooked from the very first page. This was a very well written publication that undeniably captivates the reader. Reading it took me to an altered time and place. I found myself becoming the character. It was so easy to put myself in her place and live through her experiences. Once I started I had a hard time putting it down and when I was done I desired more. Thanks Aimee for sharing and allowing me to experience a portion of your life. I truly adored the book and I recommend it to every one."},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

This book does this. The book does a make good read and is well writing but it is more of a tease then a full course meal.The book is written from an incredibly interesting period in LA punk. The period between the changing of the old guard Hollywood scene and the building ultra violent OC scene and she was smack in the middle of it but you get the vibe from the book that she was only there is observe and not involved. Time and time again the story seems to building to something and then only falls off into the next chapter which is disappointing.It does give one a good insight into those that \\"dabbled\\" in punk. Those people that made up the edges of the crowd and later would start stories out with \\"when I was going through my punk phase...\\" For her and this book it only lasted 18 months and it has full filling of name dropping. She had some incredible encounters with the best LA had to offer but you get the feeling that she didn't really interact with them or at least didn't share it in the book.If you have about 4 hours to kill it's a good read but if you want the meat of the experience go elsewhere."},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","review":"If you're into punk rock, this is the book for you! It isn't a dry history book, but rather a lively recounting of the real-life experiences of a young girl who lived through the heyday of punk rock. It's basically an inside look into her personal diary, and details some truly unforgetable stories. I won't give it all away - you've got to read it for yourself. Trust me, though, you're gonna love it!!"},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","review":"I'm 13 years old and I really enjoyed this book. I was so interested that I couldn't put it down. I like how the author wrote this book, it was so unique. I felt I was there in the book with the characters. This book is great for teenagers and grown ups, too.

I know whoever reads this magnificent book will enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","review":"You'll never find anything else that compares to the discriptions in this book, she not only tells us what it was like but she gives different points of view, a must have!!!"},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","review":"This is basically just a bunch of random memories from a minor player in the &quot;scene&quot;. The crowd that she ran with was hardly anything interesting or noteworthy, as are all the anecdotes she relates to those of us who might have not been there. I was there, and I suppose if I thought about some of the minor scuffles and brushes with the law I was in I could have written the same book. Only I think I wouldn't be so vague as Ms. Cooper in describing the events and their outcomes.

Scott's book is absolutely first-rate, written in a clear, friendly style that keeps the reader's attention. Backing up the technical content, the book offers plenty of history and answers to the &quot;why?&quot; questions asked when learning network protocols. For example, why do various Ethernet frame formats exist (Ethernet/DIX/Ethernet II vs. IEEE 802.3 w/LLC Header vs. IEEE 802.3 w/LLC SNAP extension)? Short answer -- blame IBM! Long answer -- read pages 82-86.The logically arranged material makes Scott's book a powerful learning tool. After introducing protocol analysis in chapter 1, he devotes a full chapter to each of the seven layers of the OSI model. (No, he doesn't skip the session and presentation layers!) By taking a layered approach, Scott compares same-layer protocols and makes each understandable in context (i.e., DNS vs. NetBIOS vs. Netware SAP, all at layer 5 -- somewhat controversially; DNS at layer 5?) Chapter 9 finishes with advice on measuring latency and throughput. I learned something new about protocols at each layer, even after reading many authoritative TCP/IP volumes. For example, Scott's explanation of NetBIOS as a session protocol and Server Message Block (SMB) as an application protocol finally made it clear how these standards interact on Windows networks. The text is backed up by numerous screen captures of protocol decodes, adding to the learning value.....The few typos or mistakenly omitted material do not detract from the book's overall message. If you've read Richard Stevens, Eric Hall, etc., and you think you've run out of resources for understanding network traffic, give Scott's book a try. You'll be informed and pleasantly surprised!"},{"Title":"Network Analysis and Troubleshooting","review":"How many times have you used a network protocol analyzer and wished you knew more? The Expert system didn't solve 100% of the problems? This is the first book I've found which takes a sensible, systamatic approach to decoding protocols from the bottom up. It does not go into every protocol in existence, but covers general rules of how to use a protocol analyzer properly. It is essential reading if you are just starting out or have been consulting for years, and is equally applicable if you have a low-end analyzer like Microsoft NetMon or a high-end analyzer such as Sniffer PRO from NAI. In fact I gained more knowledge from one book than I did from a several thousand dollar course. Excellent stuff!"},{"Title":"Network Analysis and Troubleshooting","review":"I've read numerous texts on Analysis and Troubleshooting Networks and this was the best. Taking years of experience and training and creating an outline for use in the field is what the Author's done. Having studied everything from the 802.3 standard itself to analysis handbooks by vendors and other authors, I found this to be concise and direct in application and use in the field. Being the Lead Analyst in a company with over 150 nations globally, this text will be valuable to our teams and is being disseminated as a field handbook for troubleshooting. It's a thorough review of protocols from physical through application layers over the majority of topologies extant in today's corporate infrastructures. My Thanks to the Author and those responsible for it's publication."},{"Title":"Network Analysis and Troubleshooting","review":"I just finished a course by the Author..... He really knowshis stuff!

Scott's book provides a variety of case studies that decipher detailed trace samples. It's a great check-point for all those details you should remember, but often don't. This is a one of a kind book, and a must have reference for the serious networking professional !"},{"Title":"Network Analysis and Troubleshooting","review":"Scott doesn't just provide a light at the end of the tunnel, making you trudge through other details to make complete sense of a topic... he lights the whole tunnel, from the Physical Layer up through the Application Layer. Network Analysis can be very frustrating to learn, but with the help of a complete reference that provides a logical look at troubleshooting with different tools, even a novice can learn the ins and outs of network analysis. Well done!"},{"Title":"Network Analysis and Troubleshooting","review":"Scott Haugdahl' style of writing mixed with the depth of the material covered, and his attention to detail, makes it one of the best texts I've ever read (including other titles from Addison Wesley, McGraw Hill, Cisco Press, M&amp;T, O'Reilly, Prentice Hall, MTP, et al). Network Analysis and Troubleshooting has been a mind meld for me, filling &quot;the gaps&quot; that so many texts leave out while reinforcing existing knowledge. It is definitely 'a top shelfer' for my reference library! ...Thanks Scott!"},{"Title":"Network Analysis and Troubleshooting","review":"The book is now over ten years old and yes is an excellent description, discussion, and detail of how computer networks operate. While most people now have become more aware of the equipment used to do this, the IT world has more to keep it busy. \\"Routers\\" are more than $40 devices, WiFi security is more than \\"Let's not broadcast ESSID\\" and VoIP is a commodity sold by everyone.Scott's book captures the essence of the things an IT person needs to know. He provides structure, layers, details, and it's all factual.I recommend it without reservation.Disclaimer: I was one of the reviewers of the book. I don't mind sharing my thoughts with your fellow Amazon readers.Disclaimer #2: I have maintained the NANOG Traceroute for ages... although now tracepath is a much better tool.I encourage everyone wanting a career in IT or even just the networking portion of IT... to give this a read. It is worth your time and money.Regards,Ehud GavronTucson AZ"},{"Title":"Network Analysis and Troubleshooting","review":"I found this book very well written, and a different approach to a poorly documented topic in the IT world. The book is properly, very thorough, and best I can tell somewhat dated as it discusses a lot of Token Ring, Novell IPX, Netbios, Netbeui, Win95, 98, NT4 topics. It covered many items I had long forgotten about, but are still relevant and important. What I would love to see, is an updated version of this book, that drops IPX, Token Ring, and all the outdated topics, and concentrates almost exclusively on IP. I would greatly appreciate a concentration on real packet captures and decoding longer streams. Ideally, the book would either come with a cd, or a web site link to captures. Reading about Network Analysis is one thing, but what is most helpful for some of us, is a hands on, following along with the book, to try it first hand.Regardless, the book is first rate. It's isn't a Laura Chappell style book if that is what you are hoping for. It is more of a, here's what you learned years ago, and now, why it matters. When I first learned the OSI 7 layer model etc, I had no clue how it applied in the real world, now that I do, this book helps bring a deeper understanding to it.Great job!"},{"Title":"Network Analysis and Troubleshooting","review":"Impressive! Mr. Haugdahl's explanation of the various OSI layers is killer enough. Got too deep on certain topics; but then again, you wouldn't want someone preaching complete network analysis to skimp on details now, would you? Great reads on the use of NA's Sniffer and MS' Network Monitor tools, as well as full illustrated details on the DOs and DON'Ts of network design. Awesome book!!!"},{"Title":"Just for you;: A special collection of inspirational verses","review":"This in one of the first books that I've ever read by this famous writer. The poems are heartfelt and totally inspirational as Helen Steiner Rice shares her precious thoughts with us, and eases our burdens through her written word.Mostly for those bent in acknowledging God's precious creation also the magic of love.....and also some poems suitable for kids. Her work is very simply written and it is so amazing that one woman who went through so much illness and misfortune could still look at life in such a positive manner. Readers you can't miss this. This book is worth your time."},{"Title":"The Monster of the Madidi: Searching for the Giant Ape of the Bolivian Jungle","review":"I don't read a great deal of adventure/travel writing, but Simon Chapman's The Monster of the Madidi is a fantastic romp through the jungles of Bolivia. The premise of the trip is a search for the legendary DeLoys' ape, of which we have only a photo from the 1920s and plenty of local accounts of its reality. I won't reveal if Simon found the ape, but the story of the search makes great reading full of log jams, murky jungles, \\"hostile\\" locals, inept flight officials, screaming monkeys, hitch hiking Australians, and--well you get the picture. A fun read."},{"Title":"The Monster of the Madidi: Searching for the Giant Ape of the Bolivian Jungle","review":"The author has an amazing ability to paint the Bolivian jungle for you and put you right there in the middle of the adventure. It's hard to put down."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I have to say that Lisa Valdez is an very good writer. Her prose, dialog and running character situtations are well worth buying the book to read. The interactions with the secondary characters are entertaining and very well written.Since I read Passion, I pretty much new that this wasn't a vanilla regency and quite frankly, I didn't expect it to be.The problem I had with this master/slave relationship was there wasn't an ounce of true passion between Matthew and Patience. The garden rain spanking scene was borderline abusive. In not one single sentence of that scene was there any hit of erotic play. Especially when Patience was practically bawling through-out. The music room scene was another - WTF? - and I came away wondering if Matthew kicked puppies as a child. Was that suppose to be cathargic? Did Patience need to be pounded on to clear her pain of her mother's death? Where was the passion? The play? Are we to assume that now she is \\"cured\\" the next time it will be enjoyable? As another reviewer pointed out, Patience spent most of the \\"love scenes\\" crying. In the first three chapters, I loved Patience. Love her thoughtfullness, her wisdom, caring. By the end of the book, I thought she lost herself more than found herself."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"This book is all about domination and sex. In my opinion there was not a good development during the story to actually get the message that Patience and Matt might have fallen in love; thats the why of the 2 stars instead of a 3 a 4 or 5. The whole book is about Matt trying to submit patience to his own desires. I felt that Matt was a selfish hero and the whole submission thing was his way of dealing with his own problems and frustrations. This whole theme is a little more believable in a contemporary romance not in a historical one.I even feel that this book in some way degrades women. The book refers to Matt enjoying \\"Patience\\" tears. My God how cruel is that! It felt painful to me to read some of the sex's scenes where fellatio took place. I had to skip many pages to make it through the end. There is never a book that I start that I don't finished but I almost did it with this one. By the end of the book I ended hating Matt instead of falling for him too. The ending was sweet but it didn't make up for the whole book. The book was sold as a historical romance but the context was more appropriate for Ellora's Cave. I paid for one thing and got another. I don't understand what is happening nowadays that sex has to overtake the whole romance. In my opinion a few good sex scenes filled with romances does it better than a whole bunch of cold sex scenes. This book has been a big disappointment to me. I did enjoy the previous book \\"Passion\\" very much. I highly do recommend that book to people who enjoyed spicy historical romances.I also enjoy the secondary characters such as Aunt \\"Matty\\" and the few appearances that Passion made.Even though this book did not meet my expectations I am planning on buying the next book if it ever get published and I keep my hopes that can be as good as \\"Passion.\\"The way I feel is that a not so good book does not defined the whole carrier for a writer. Lisa Valdez has potential and I have to give her that.If you are into Submission this might be a reading that you enjoy."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"While I enjoyed the first book, Passion, to say this book left me cold is an understatement. There was no way you could connect any kind of love between Matthew and Patience, is was just all sex scenes that were obviously written to try and shock the reader, which in truth left this reader cold and annoyed as we have all waited so long for this 2nd book. In the 1st book my heart went out to Matthew and the way he was treated and turned upon. And quite frankly I am angry at Valdez. The ending is thrown together so badly that you are left there thinking to yourself, \\"Oh please\\", and not in a good way. So all I can say to Ms. Valdez is, \\"Poorly done, very poorly done.\\" For this avid Romance reader this book is in the trash, not even worth selling to a buy back book store, it needs to be put out of its misery."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Wow...thoroughly disappointed. I wasn't expecting the same love story that I received from Passion....but where was the love and the story? Maybe if I was into dominance/submission I would give the book a better rating. I tend to like my heroines to be a bit independent....but I never read where Patience was independent....aside from the fact that she wanted to go away to study her musical instrument with an exceptional teacher. Is that truly independent? I mean come on....she never ran away, she was never disobedient to her family, and she did not have a smart mouth. So where was this huge independent non-submissive streak?Ms. Valdez truly missed writing a great novel. Matthew is broken, truly broken by his mother's and fiancee's betrayl--I expected to feel badly for Matthew and I hoped that his story would be even better than his brother's. Instead it was the story of a broken man who is intent on breaking his woman. I think the most shocking part of the novel is Matthew, who has been shunned by society, falls back on the societal rule of male dominance and women submissiveness to \\"win\\" Patience.I honestly do not know if I will now purchase or read Primrose."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I waited so long for Patience. 5 long years of cancellation after cancellation was killing me. And when I finally had it in my hands I could not believe it. Finally the part 2 of my beloved Passion. I'll tell you I do have more than 4,000 books( All romance, I like happy endings). I started reading back in my country when I was 10 years old and I rented spanish books for $ 0.5 and read them with candles after my homework was done. So I am a ravid reader. I used reading to learn English when I came to this country. For those reasons it only takes me to go to the first pages to know if I am going to like the book. So by page 10 I knew I'd be disapointed by Patience. Passion was so fresh, so shockingly sexy and I felt in love with it in the first pages. From all my books Passion is my # 2 favorite book. I think that I was expecting Passion all over again and when it started to turn different and I grew bored and found it hard to finish it. It took me 3 days to read around to the end. I feel sorry I hate to give bad reviews to any writer. I do respect them so much after all writing is their career and for many a way of supporting themselves. But I suffered with this one, not with the extra hot sex or BSDM but with the characters and the story. Matt was so selfish and in some ways cruel and unloved. Patience had so many insecurities and a weak character that made me mad at her at times. I think that my problem was that I was expecting Passion 2 and Patience came short of being spectacular. I did enjoy the end \\"the letterr\\" was a good way of explaining many things. I hope the next one is of my taste though i will buy anything that Lisa Valdez writes because she gave me Passion."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Patience...I don't really have words to describe what I feel about it. First of all I loved Matthew in the first book. He was sweet and funny and he loved the people he loved and showed it. I was shocked to learn he was into spanking and submission; it kind of just wigged me out a little. The bad things in this story outweigh the good in my opinion.Things I didn't like:-Matt's continual spankings to Patients. It was too much after a while.-I hated how Patience cried about everything. Dry it up woman!!-How much Matt said his pleasure would turn into hers. Well if he was my man I would have probably told him to shove it! lol-I would have liked to have more of an emotional connection between the characters. I cried so hard in Passion but in Patience I didn't even sniffle.Things I liked:-I liked how Matthew was taken down a peg and remembered what an honorable man he truly was.-I liked Aunt Matty.-I liked Matthew's friends that remained close to him... One of them should end up in the last book with Prim!!!To sum it up I was not overly impressed with this book. I would have given it a two but I wanted to go one better than that. Just because I am not into dom stuff doesn't mean she didn't write her story well. Hopefully the next one will be much better (without spankings ;)..)."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Libro letto in italiano; trama forte ma Patience e Matthew non mi hanno deluso, nonostante i loro gusti sessuali siano \\"particolari\\"!Ho amato moltisismo lo sviluppo della storia tra i due, il modo della Valdez di descriverlo(molto bene) lui che con la dominazione si libera delle ferite, quasi una catarsi, una purificazione, un volersi accettare, purificare ed elevare attraverso la capacit&agrave; di conquistare lei.

Yes, it was good but so is Patience. If you've been following the evolution of erotica over the past 5 years since Passion was released, BDSM is the 'new Black'. Ms. Valdez did a good job in following that trend. I thought that Patience the character was a crybaby but so what. The scenes were well-written and in my opinion, made sense from a historical point of view, and were HOT! (as the youngsters say).For those of you that didnot appreciate the BDSM aspect of the book, oh well. There's plenty of vanilla novels out there so that all readers can get what they pay for.I look forward to reading about Primrose next ....."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Before I even start explaining why this book does not live up to its predecessor, let me just state that the odds were stacked against it to begin with. Fans of Passion have been waiting for this book for what seems like forever and every time the publication date was pushed back the anticipation hiked up a few notches. And then there's the fact that Valdez's first novel was HUGE: it had great angst, great wit, and great eroticism. Into this highly expectant atmosphere comes Patience, which had promising characters that never developed the kind of connection that Passion and Mark did in Valdez's first novel.Valdez was too focused on the practice of BDSM and didn't give enough of a sense of why it's so central to the main relationship. BDSM can really work and I am not squeamish about it in romance novels, but I think it works best when it's an outgrowth of the couple's dynamic, not something the romance is crafted around. There's a lot about why BDSM must be the way Patience discovers her sexuality and not enough about what makes Matthew the one inclined to usher her into this lifestyle. And then there's the fact that the meticulous cataloguing of their BDSM exploits comes at the expense of their emotional attachment to one another. I found myself wanting them to turn it off for a few seconds and just interact with each other.That said, I'd still give Valdez another try just based on how much I enjoyed Passion. I'd like to see what she might cook up for Prim, and I'm hoping that this will end up being a trilogy even if I was disappointed in the second installment."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I did not like this book. I have a serious aversion to anyone being physically hurt and controlled by anyone. Additionally distrubing to me is that Matt's selfish behavior and Patience's doormat like resistance, continue outside the \\"bedroom\\". SPOILER: I can't fathom how Patience's decision to give up studying with a Master Cellist strengthens their relationship. Matthew's relief that she decides this, to me, simply solidifies his selfishness rather than showing he's interested in supporting his partner's aspirations.I liked Ms. Valdez's first novel, Passion. The characters of Mark and Passion were empathetic in their selflessness and clearly communicated and demonstrated caring for one another and other characters in the book. I hope she writes other novels like this.Beyond this author's work, I'm concerned that this book may set a precidence for allowing content into the romantic genre of book writing that I am DEFINITELY NOT interested in reading. I thought this content was reserved for erotica and was grateful for a way to avoid this kind of material prior paying for it/reading it. Specifically, I do not want to read about a character being intentionally physicially hurt by their partner."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Patience by Lisa ValdezHistorical Romance -April 6th, 20105 starsI have been awaiting the release of Lisa Valdez's second novel, \\"Patience\\" for so long! Ironically, I became a little impatient because I loved her debut novel, \\"Passion\\" so much. It contained all the elements of romance that I look for: strong/lovable characters, dialog that flows naturally, and sexy romantic elements. \\"Patience\\" delivers on all these elements and deserves all 5 stars. Both these books are among my all time favorite romance novels.This story takes place immediately after Matthew's illegitimacy is revealed to society and his fiancee leaves him for another man. This was revealed at the very end of \\"Passion\\". It has been sometime now that society has shunned him and the people who were supposed to be there to support him have left him. He only has his brother Mark and his sister-in-law. Matthew was always intrigued by the second Dare sister, Patience, but now he has the opportunity to explore those feelings. Every chapter reveals a new dimension of how Matthew's past has made him into a honorable man, despite his very dishonorable mother and disloyal fiancee whose father is on a mission to destroy him.Matthew stays strong and fights for his company, and now, for the love of a truly strong woman who unquestioningly stands by him. I loved how perfectly suited for each other Matt and Patience are. I especially loved how they both played the cello and enjoyed the scene when they play together.This story was not what I expected when I ran into the 'submission' element. Normally, I am incredibly turned off by submission themes because I just don't get it. I can't describe what it is exactly that made this story different and made it work for me, but I actually found it kind of hot. I think it's because the submission is actually about learning to trust each other. Both Patience and Matthew have reason to be untrusting of people in general, but learn to trust each other. There is a lot of sexual tension throughout the book, but it isn't until 200+ pages into the story that Patience trusts him enough to gift him with her virginity.I just love Valdez's writing. \\"Patience\\" is incredibly well written, believable, and romantic. I cannot wait till the next book about the last Dare sister, Primrose!!!Reviewed by Sophia from the Bookaholics Romance Book Club"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Patience Dare has the pick of the gentlemen, but none excite her. None quicken her pulse and make her desire marriage. That is, none other than her brother-in-law Matthew Hawkmore. Although he's been outed in society as being a bastard, Patience not only finds him intriguing but also defends him to society whenever given the chance.Matthew has wanted Patience for a long time. After a night's stolen kiss, he firmly knows he will stop at nothing to make her his. During a dance, he whispers her heart's desire into her ear, seducing her with scenes of domination and submission. She finally capitulates and as they embark on a torrid affair, one which would only add more scandal to his name if found out, Matthew finds himself wanting more. But Patience is firmly set on becoming a student of a renowned musical scholar in London and will soon be leaving. Can Matthew convince her that where she belongs is right there with him?I must say I was incredibly surprised to read a historical romance with BDSM undertones. It felt like such a deliciously sinful pleasure to read! Matthew is a decadent hero. Not only is he eye candy for the imagination, but he has just enough gruff angst to scintillate. His dominance is almost on the edge of domineering, but then he'll do something tender that has me swooning and rethinking my opinions. Patience is a heroine every woman yearns to be. She's feisty, speaks her mind, somewhat independent for the time, and yet even as a virgin knows enough about herself that she yearns for more than the insipid \`ton' can provide.This book was a delight to read. I reveled in every chapter, one moment laughing and the next moment seriously aroused at the bedroom play. After learning that Patience was the second book in the series called The Passion Quartet (and can be read as a stand alone, if necessary), I immediately went online to snatch up a copy of Passion, named for Patience's sister, and can't wait for book three, which is about their sister Primrose.Courtesy of Fallen Angel Reviews"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"a whole lot pages of nuthin. the only chacter i like was aunte matty. only one sex scene and it happen after 400 pages. he turn self rightous at the about his revenge. he took her advice n she was a vicar daughter of course she want to do things right. it would been a duel at dawn in the second chapter if it was me. basically the book was boring."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"What you already know via previous reviews: This book has a lot of sex scenes, BDSM themed sex, a Dom/sub relationship, extremely explicit, strong language, spankings, fellatio, and thick, long nipples.Okay, fine, the author made sex in this book just as dominant a theme as love/romance. I had no problem with that, and even though BDSM is not my thing, I can deal with it in order to enjoy good literature. That wasn't my problem.Like a few of the other ratings might say, I really tried to like this book, but there were somethings I just could not tolerate. \\"Tolerate\\" being the key word. My tolerance level was not only nudged, it was thoroughly raped.I first picked up this book and read it up to chapter 12. In my opinion, when a man stops a woman from leaving town to better herself in any way because the separation would discontinue the D/s relationship he has started with her, he is not only considered a controlling boyfriend, but an abusive one. Especially if he does not ask for consent and does it secretly for his own benefit. This relationship moves from being Dominant/submissive to Master/slave.So at that point, I stopped reading Patience. But then I reread Passion, which got me interested in the author in the first place, and I decided to give this book another go. Maybe I missed something that made this book worth while. So I started reading Patience for the second time.I should have stuck with my first decision to set this book aside. The sex was not the problem, its the dynamics of the relationship that really peeved me. What should be stressed to potential readers is the amount of humiliation Matthew subjects Patience to, and all for his pleasure, which feeds her pleasure (or so it says). The ones that stand out the most...-The tears that fall from her eyes during the sex scenes. It pleases him, so he goes out of his way to make them appear more often during their time in the bedroom. Because it pleases him.-Forced nudity while he remains dressed. He doesn't immediately move on to the sex. He studies her until he notices her squirm. This imbalance diminishes the feeling of equality. It makes oneself feel vulnerable and less than the person who has clothes. In one scene he literally rents the clothes from her body, outside during a storm BTW, and reprimands her when she tries to preserve her modesty by covering herself with her hands. Because it pleases him.-The straw that broke the camels back?... In a scene, in order for her to find \\"release\\" or to climax, he orders her to HUMP HIS BOOT CLAD FOOT!!! Like a dog!!! I don't know what upset me more: the fact that he made her hump is foot or the fact that he had a boot on the entire time, not even giving her the benefit of a human touch, flesh to flesh. All because it pleases him.At this point I thoroughly HATE Matthew for what he has trained, conditioned, manipulated, and brainwashed Patience into doing because she has the misguided conception that she is meant solely to bring about pleasure for him; she has stopped being the mistress of her own desires and became a slave to his.Believe it or not, I am more upset with the editors, marketers and publishers, not Lisa Valdez, for thinking that this book was a Historical Romance. Miss Valdez wrote what she wrote and should not be ashamed of it, nor should she have to defend her imagination like she does on her website. But its not Historical Romance. Its extreme Historical Erotica, meant for the people who appreciate this kind of M/s lifestyle.I don't, and I feel like this book was misrepresented in its back-cover summary, the chosen genre, and the publishers label.This book is not meant for the romantically faint at heart."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I think people that labeled this as porn need to change the way they are reading it. You can't just see the sex. You have to look at the entirety of the character that was created.I saw this as a lovely romantic story about two people who have very specific needs and more than a little damage in their emotional makeup. Neither character was lacking or one dimensional. If you examine their backstory you can see how they both ended up with each other. They were really perfect for one another.I think Ms. Valdez is a complex and very interesting author who excels in the unexpected. She makes me LOVE her characters and I am eagerly awaiting her next book."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Well, we waited and waited and were very patient but were not rewarded. It is hard not to be harsh in reviewing this book after such a long wait. Although, this book has some (not alot) of reminicent writing style from Passion, it is a far cry from the great story and characters. I found this story slow moving and tedious with no real plot moving the story forward. I wanted to skip ahead. That is not a very good sign considering I had been waiting impatiently for five years for this sequel. It just goes from one boring sex scene to another. They are all so similar I can hardly remember what happened to move the story forward or tell you what the actual plot was outside of dominate male breaking in submissive female and saving his reputation and business. Who cares. Elloras Cave has better BDSM books with more romance. That's not saying much. I didn't enjoy the couples chemistry if they had any. I found most of this book hard to get into. I never felt emotionally involved in the story and was left entirely unfufilled. I am not even curious about the third book. If there ever is one after this. I was afraid the long wait didn't bode well for Ms Valdez and was correct. A stunning failure. Two stars for effort."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I was anxiously awaiting Lisa Valdez's new book Patience . What a disappointment and waste of money.If you are fond of S & M , you might like this book. The 2 main characters revolve around male dominance, him humilating her , abusing her, and her role as a vicars daughter crawling around mewling with a spanked rear. There is more slapping her around stuff, very little true romance, the characters are not very well \\"fleshed out\\" pun intended.I guess LV had one good book in her. Read Passion, forget Patience unless you like violence, pain,humilation with your \\"romance\\"..now if you get the book for free..."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"After reading her first novel, I was enthralled with Lisa Valdez. I eagerly awaited her 2nd novel, but overall found it somewhat disappointing. Passion was remarkable for its explictness and eroticism, but was also very emotional and Romantic. It seems that with Patience, the author has made a decision to concentrate more on erotica than romance. The story begins with Matthew Hawkmore having been \\"outed\\" as illegitimate by his mother. He's ostracized from society when he meets Patience, Passion's younger sister. He's immediately taken with her and aims to seduce her.Matt has a proclivity toward (fairly mild) BDSM and much of the book is devoted to his lessons to Patience in how to act the submissive to his dominant. He repeatedly tells her she must submit to him. He very nearly turns her into a sexual slave by withholding her orgasm until she does exactly as he orders. These scenes, while initially interesting and well written, soon became repetitive and far too long. Interestingly, Patience tells Matt she is a virgin & wants to remain one. She manages to technically stay a virgin until page 305, but they engage in every other imaginable sexual act. The book suffered from pacing problems. The beginning was interesting, but it got bogged down in the middle with (of all things) to much sex and BDSM. It did somewhat redeem itself in the end, however. The Cello lesson scene is marvelous. I think there was also a missed opportunity in that much more could have been done with the revenge theme. This was a book in search of an editor. With some editing down of the middle of the book and the expansion of the ending, it could have been a great book. As it stands, I can only give it a C rating. The author delayed publication because she had \\"lost her muse.\\" It's clear after reading Patience that the muse is still missing in action. I can only hope that she regains her muse before writing the third book in this series, Primrose. Her talent is still apparent, and while flashes of brilliance can be found in Patience, they are, unfortunately, few and far between. I hate to think a talented author has only one great book in her."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"This is my first Lisa Valdez book, and whoa, what a book it was! First off, if you are a person who is easily offended by graphic sex and dominance and submission, then you should probably save your money. Now for those of us who are not faint hearted, Patience is definitely your cup of tea.I did not think this book lacked romance between Patience and Matthew. It was very clear that they cared deeply for each other. It was also refreshing to see that Ms. Valdez did not use prolonged misunderstandings as a way to further the story. Misunderstandings were taken care of rationally. No TSTL heroine here.If you are open minded and want a well written love story with lovemaking scenes to raise your temperature, then I highly recommend this book. I just wished more writers would take a hint from Ms. Valdez and actually deliver on the spice level, while not letting the love story suffer."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"What a sad disappointment! This novel was not a romance, this novel was not interesting, this novel was not what I had hoped Lisa Valdez would give her patient readers after a five-year wait! Her characters and certainly her fans deserved much more than she delivered. I question almost every aspect of this novel. The plot line is patently ridiculous, the characters are shallow and sad, and the hurried ending is a dismal failure! I know I will not wait with any anticipation for any further novels from Lisa Valdez."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I think the concensus is that after Passion, Patience, which everyone has waited for patiently, is a let down. The BDSM theme was not cleanly woven into the story and the story of Matthew's redemption was not very believeable. It also didn't seem very believeable that Patience, a vicar's daughter, was so accepting of Matthew's demands. We don't get to see where in Matthew's upbringing he developed his love of this lifestyle. But that was not the only questionable thing, what's with the sister-love jealousy between Patience and Passion? It was great to see Passion and Mark again, but their appearance in Patience did not advance their story, because we already knew that they had a child, and that Passion was expecting again, so the timelines don't match unless Matthew and Patience had a relationship at the same time as Passion and Mark. Am I missing something? All in all, not a bad read. I won't be buying the Kindle version, and I won't be holding my breath for Prim and Fitz Roy's story..."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"This was a great book and follow-up to Passion. Granted it is not \\"Passion\\". Would you want sequel to be the same. Matt's love for Patience was just as deep as Mark showed for Passion and certainly verbally showed her father and her in no uncertain terms. I look for a sequel to have some of the same old characters but not be 'just the same book' repeated and this certainly did that. I, for one, am extremely glad that I did read this book and now cannot wait for Prim's book."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Lisa valdez rock it with patience! I loved it! I can't wait to read primrose. I just need to find that one next. Well done Lisa you know how the readers like it!"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I just read Patience, and LOVED IT! I only read Passion a few weeks ago, and was just blown away, so I had to read Patience. While waiting for the book to arrive, I read comments about Patience and was surprised to see that many people didn't like it. It's fairly predictable that people would compare Passion and Patience, but after reading the books, I find that the comparison doesn't do the books any justice. You have to go into it expecting them to be different. Passion and Patience (the books) are different; Passion and Patience (the women) are substantially different; And Mark and Matthew are most definitely different.I appreciate the way Lisa Valdez made the characters different in ways that were truly believeble. And in spite of the much talked about BDSM aspect of their romance, Matt was a different lover than Mark was. He just does not have Mark's intensity (don't get me wrong, I adore Mark!) Matt is gentle, again in spite of the BDSM aspect of their relationship. Speaking of, I don't know that I'm even interested in trusting anybody that much, but the whole thing was hot! Lol..even the infamous \\"boot\\" scene was very hot in context. I loved it, loved Patience.Oh and hell yeah Fitz Roy, Prim better get it! I can't wait...."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Let me begin by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed Passion, and it was always going to be a tough book to follow. That said, I felt let down by Patience. I don't intend to synopsize the story, but this book sees Matt and Patience explore a D/s relationship. I enjoy BDSM romance, but for me, this book just lacked chemistry, and it didn't have any of the angst that made Passion such compulsive reading. I thought the storyline was predictable, and the reader could see what was to happen well in advance, and it seemed to me that the author was a little uncomfortable with the D/s interaction between Matt and Patience.Overall I think Patience failed to stand out from other romances. Unlike Passion, it was quickly forgotten, and I hope Valdez can recapture the incredible magic of Passion, when she writes Prim's story."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I loved the first book - \\"Passion,\\" there was no doubt that Mark and Passion loved each other but \\"Patience\\" on the other hand, i have to question whether or not Matt and Patience are in love. I do not mind BDSM but on a virgin? I dont know if i liked that. There was too much of that in the story by the way and if the author thought that was a way to show their growing love, i didnt buy it. I felt like Matt was brainwashing Patience into molding her into the woman he wanted her to be. And why was there so much concentration on Patience submitting than Matt handling his scandal? And what happen to Patience's cousin Charlotte? I wonder how she survive the scandal but there was no mention or did I skip it? I'll admit there were times were i just skimmed which is not a good sign.There are 28 chapters in this book and i only enjoyed the last 6, i thought finally were are getting somewhere (and Matt was finally losing his control) and then it was over too quickly.Overall it was more of a frustrating read than anything and sadly the emotional depth i found in 'Passion' was missing here. I will however, read the third book in the series when it finally comes out and i hope to find some closure there."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Passion was my first historical romance book since I went back to my childhood passion of reading. It was erotic, romantic and touching at times and has led me on to bookcase full of other series and adventures. I had high expectation for Patience, the second book of the series(?). I thought is was just okay. It was a much angrier book then the first one. There was less connection between the characters and less actual sex. I got past the S&M in the book that I had expected based on other reviews. There just wasn't much more to the story. I typically re-read books that I really like, I can see this one gathering dust on the shelf until it is sold at a garage sale. I hope Lisa Valdez finds her spark again and writes a better story for Prudence."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"If you loved Valdez's previous book Passion, be warned that this is not even close to being as good. I gave it 3 stars but for me, it was more like 2 1/2. Without going into the entire plot, I couldn't understand why Matthew needed to dominate Patience and why she needed to surrender to him. I think that could have been played out better. I also didn't like that he needed to spank/punish her to accomplish what he needed to teach her. For me, I found it difficult to read. I didn't find it \\"erotic\\", I found it disturbing. Kate Pearce does a better job in Simply Sinful.I also didn't find the plot as compeling as the first book either. Matthew is out for revenge, but quotes scripture. (The scripture is also the excuse to dominate Patience.) Of course, in the end he puts aside his revenge to get the girl. The villian pays anyway and they all live happily ever after.It just wasn't what I had hoped for."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I almost didn't purchase the book because of the reviews, but I am glad I did. Yes, it is explicit (so too was Passion) and yes slightly uncomfortable (at least for me.) But Lisa Valdez is a great writer and it comes across in the book. I wouldn't actually give it five stars, closer to 4 but I think the reviews unfairly drag it down. I agree with one reviewer that wrote it isn't something to read in public though!"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"George Michael and Handel inspired THIS?!It didn't work. It takes her five years to write what..a failed attempt at BDSM??? Or DS or whatever it is. Give me a break! All this anticipation and excitement--for nothing!Yes. I was hoping for a PASSION sequel--equal or better--didn't matter. Just something similar to the emotional intensity, passionate romance, and over-the-top sex--especially the sex! Come on. Valdez has a knack for it; readers expect it. However, I'll say that the first sex scene was actually pretty good (and there's also another one--can't recall which scene), but overall nothing compared to PASSION!!Instead, Valdez goes on this tangent (i.e., the light BDSM). This is an aimless story about sexual discovery--on Patience's part. It's totally unconvincing, however. Even Matt's issue doesn't ring true. Not enough background information or detail on why he's so into it. In addition, the verbose Q&A; and repeated phrases are so annoying! For example, the heart thumping and the \\"member\\" throbbing or aching (for every few paragraphs, mind you). Also, there's just too much emphasis on the DS thing. It's like...I get it, ok! Can we get to the good stuff now--like the romance!Sadly, this just ended up being an empty romance with no character development for either Matt or Patience. I hardly know these people. I love Matt before. Of course, he gets the shock of his life, but geez...what happened? He just acts like a robot, with all his commands now. No passion; he's just sort of lifeless...his cello didn't even get any playing time, which is a shame, since music plays a major role in his life.Now I'm not even looking forward to PRIMROSE. I don't even care when it comes out. PATIENCE? What a waste."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I have to say first that I'm a little shocked at how many people disliked this book. I loved it! I had never read the previous book but I didn't feel as if that made this book any better. I thought it was well done stand on novel and even while there may have been scenes that may have shocked more vanilla readers, I can't believe how many people felt as if it wasn't worth reading. I have a feeling that those who didn't like this were the same people who thought the Kushiel series by Jacqueline Carey was just meaningless drivel. Yes, I admit, it wasn't Pride and Prejudice, but I mean really. I guess I'm just shocked at how narrow-minded some reviewers were. In a time when there are so many novels that feature non-traditional romances such as menage, I guess I'm just a little disappointed that a wonderful story showing the beauty of a woman's submission for her one true mate can be considered vulgar and disgusting.Second, did no one read what the story was about before they purchased it? The back cover could have told you this wasn't your granny's old bodice ripper novels. I see that amazon didn't offer much of a review but if you were a fan of Valdez, and waiting for Patience to come out as so many people said they were, I can't believe that you wouldn't have done a little more research about the story line before purchasing.Finally, I felt that while Matthew was more alpha that most heroes out there, there was a level of vulnerablity about him that made him desirable. I also admit that Patience did tend to cry a lot in this book but submission to someone else can bring out those emotions in people. It's a complex and complete giving of one's self that can make you bathe yourself in tears and became another person. I do disagree with one reviewer who said that this relationship was abusive. With every word that Matthew uttered to Patience, I felt as if he was telling her repeatly how much he loved her. I knew within moments of their first submission that he was already head over heels in love with her.So I guess in closing, if you're looking for vanilla in your submission, this is definitely not the book for you. It is one that will make you see the love that can be shown between a dominant and his submissive."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I loved Passion and waited with baited breath for this book only to find a dysfunctional abusive relationship that definately wasn't related to love. If I could I would have taken a paddle to the hero! Why couldn't he be beaten a few times to know what it is like How anyone can read love into abuse is beyond me. How did an innocent bible toting virgin turn into such a ho? She was too excepting from the beginning of the things the hero did to her. It didn't make any sense. Picked this up expecting a nice romantic novel and ended up with BDSM. I do not recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Just finished reading Patience **CAUTION** IF YOU FIND DOM.SUB-BDSM OFFENSIVE YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS BOOK I was not aware of the previlace of this element in the book and the latter is not a part of my personal habits but I liked this story for what if offered: explicit sexual interaction, a bit of romance ( according to some reviewers none); quite a bit of humor i.e. Aunt Matty, Lord Asher and his brother, and the love and loyalty of family! I was a bit disappointed that more time was NOT given to Matt's self discovery since this aspect was only give 2 or 3 pages, and little time spend on how or why Matt developed or discovered his particular sexual interests, thus the 4 stars rather than 5 star rating. I also thought the price, set by the publisher by the way, rather than amazon for a Kindle version was a bit too much.

I found it incredibly moving, powerfully sexy and very daring indeed. If male dominance/female submission disturbs you, this is perhaps not the book for you. If explicit sex disturbs you, this is DEFINITELY not the book for you. If, however, raw erotism is not inconsistent with romantic love in your world but rather part and parcel of it, then I highly recommend this book. It will take your breath away and move you to tears. It did me. Both Matthew and Patience are strong and vulnerable, interesting and very likeable, with an intense sexuality and a moral core that anyone could admire. I am entirely satisfied with their happy-ever-after. They earned it. Bravo, Mrs. Valdez, and thank you so much for another great love story.

Her tears turned him on?and enough with the \\"Yes, Matthew!\\" She is not a dog! I mean, \\"Stay, Patience\\"?? Really?There was no warmth, and BDSM goes both ways.

I've written a huge review relating every way in which this book doesn't rise to where Passion is. Comparing them leads nowhere, nor does defending Lisa Valdez's work based on the few lines that were really good (I mean that, there were some lines that I loved, they stuck with me and gave me hope to read until the end because they contained that something that only Valdez has).To get to those lines you have to do a lot of skipping (the half of the book containing the coal mine conflict, taking a lot of space and so easy to ignore), get past the emotional discomfort and the unlikeable characters and ignore all your hopes that, at least in the end, Matt will show some feelings or display tenderness, you know, the little things that make a relationship seem enjoyable.I understand he had to look stern and detached so that Patience wouldn't ignore/mop the floors with him or whatever she was doing wrong with all the other admirers.

I absolutely loved \\"Passion\\" - the storyline was excellent, the sex was perhaps a little much for some, but I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I cried like a baby at the end of the book. All together, I thought it was an excellent read and is a book I'll be holding on to. \\"Patience\\", on the other hand, was a HUGE disappointment. I couldn't relate to any of the characters, I felt nearly every word out of Matt's mouth in regard to his and Patience's relationship was a load of bull and impossible for me to even understand. I didn't feel any connection between them, I was completely perplexed about the sexual aspect of their relationship, and downright mad at Patience for putting up with it and had no clue as to how she could enjoy it. I do not understand relationships like that and therefore don't like to read about them, but perhaps if this had been written in such a way that I could get even a small glimpse of why these two were attracted to each other in such a way it wouldn't have been so bad. The one and only reason I finished the book was in the futile hope that it would get better, which it did not. Aside from the disturbing sexual escapades, the plotline was weak, I didn't give a fig one way or the other about the characters with the exception of being mad that Patience was such a door mat (pun intended), and the ending was completely predictable and lame. Ms.Valdez must have been worn out from at that spanking and just slapped (pun intended) a \\"The End\\" on it to be done with it.I know Ms. Valdez is capable of writing excellent books as proven by \\"Passion\\", but I'd be extremely wary to waste my time and money on anything else she may write.

OK...Passion wasn't perfect but I adored the romance and the very sexy love scenes. Passion remains for me an all-time favorite historical romance.\\"Patience\\" does not live up to its predecessor at all. I'm afraid the sub/dom did nothing for me - I didn't think the sex scenes were sexy at all - they felt cold and unromantic...sex for the sake of sex. Matthew was lovely in \\"Passion\\" but there seemed to be a disconnect between his character in Passion and here. The main problem for me was that Matthew tried to turn Patience into something she was not and I just couldn't work out why he would do that.I have dithered about the rating. I want to give it 1 star for the romance and terrible sex scenes. But at the same time, I enjoyed the last third of the book because it was only then that Valdez started to get on with the story. So I've stuck with 3 stars with the additional comment that this book is not a keeper for me."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Patience by Lisa Valdez is disappointing and lacking in a true romance between the major characters of Patience and Matthew. Her previous novel, Passion was romantic, suspenseful, entertaining and at the end of story we cheered for Mark and Passion. Not so with Patience. I still don't know why Matthew and Patience are \\"in love\\". The cringe worthy spanking and crying scenes are inserted without rhyme or reason. Matthew is \\"fighting for his life\\" after he was revealed as a bastard in Passion, however, that part of the story is never really developed and the resolution at the end of the story was weak and manufactured( I could have done without another senseless \\"letter\\"). Did the author lose her way? The story was disjointed and jarring. Who are Matthew's allies and why? Enemies and why? To her credit the scenes between Patience and Passion were the most well-written in the book, in fact, the author's \\"voice\\" was most real there.This book was not worth the four year wait."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"After a few years, Patience is now released to the public. And, the bad news is this book was a let down. Yes, Matthew is dark, as in i like to spank a butt and into torture and like seeing his woman in tears spanking. Dangerous, no, not at all.I'll have to say that I'm highly disappointed with the book and her writing. She has turn a strong, independent woman into a insecure, passive woman. Matthew is into domination and making Patience to be the submissive slave for him, what guy wouldn't want that? I also find it hypocritical of the writer to quote bible versus and thinking that it's ok to abuse a woman and be so sexual with them as well. This book failed in so many levels, it has for sure been a disappointment for her new fans who were anxiously waiting for this book to come out after her first.Review: Matthew Hawkmore lost his place in society, when the secret of his illegitimate birth was revealed. He lost his engagement with Lady Roselind, whose father ended the relationship with accusation that Matthew knew about the secret all along. His career is also on the line as well. So along the time he is seeking revenge against his ex future father in law, he plots to figure out how to save his career and finds himself wanting to master Patience.Patience can't help but do what Matthew says, even though she is strong willed and independent, she seems to lose both as she is under Matthew's spell throughout the book. Matthew helps her deal with her past and resolve issues to help break down barriers that guard her heart in thinking she doesn't need love or marriage.I'm not saying that bondage/dominant-submissive roles didn't happen in historical times, I think the writer could have been more subtle about it, and not make it so in your face, I\\"m the master, you're the dog feel to it. There was one part in the book that made it sound like Matthew would be turned on if he forced himself on her.I don't think this book should past a rate of one.DEfinitely one to borrow from the library!I think in some levels, those that are into the dominant/submission/bondage, you may find no reasoning with what's been done throughout this book."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I did not enjoy Lisa Valdez's novel, Patience, I mean I really wanted to but I just could not empathize with her characters. For me this is essential, I have to like the protagonists and understand them, in this novel I just could not get past both character's need for punishment and submission.The first few chapters of Patience are fairly good. The author sets up the wounded hero, Matthew and Patience the virginal vicar's daughter quite nicely. Matthew is still smarting from his fianc&eacute;'s horrible treatment (she despises him ever since she discovered he was illegitimate). Patience is attracted to Matthew and at first they have a passionate kiss that leaves them both astounded. They meet again three months later and both have not forgotten that night. Sounds good right?*Spoiler* These two fall into a very quick sexual relationship that is well, very different, a little dark and frankly bizarre for this reader. Virginal Patience quickly obeys every one of Matt's desires in and out of the bedroom. Matt absolutely dominates Patience and I found this strange indeed. Where was the fiery redhead? These interludes were way over the top for me; a leash, really? It seemed so demeaning. Also, hearing Matt recount how he was basically serviced by a maid at age twelve every night was awful to even think about.This novel was so lacking a romance. These two communicate mostly through physical intimacy that is lusty with Matthew calling all the shots. Now what really surprised me was how much I liked Matthew when he was not dominating Patience. His revenge against his former fianc&eacute;'s family was actually pretty interesting. I enjoyed that part of the book and I also liked Matthew's relationship with Patience's interfering and sweet Aunt but whenever the leads ended up in a bedroom it was too odd and at times distasteful.*Spoiler*Even though the author tried to explain Matthew's predilections (it took less than a page and involved a governess), she never really explained Patience's desire to be punished. I just did not buy the pain/pleasure principle, especially when Patience is crying out from the pain and Matthew enjoys seeing her tears!It seems there is one more sister in this storyline and I really hope that her novel has a more romantic tale than her older sister's story. Unlike Ms. Valdez's prequel, Passion, this is not going on my keeper shelf."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I would have enjoyed this book a lot more if Matthew hadn't been whaling the tar out of her hind end throughout the entire book!!!

You really must read the first book (Passion) to understand the history of Mark and what he was going through.While the relationship wouldn't appeal to many, we must remember the day and age. Plus their history and for these two Lisa made it work. And it was work.It was a love story handled roughly and lovingly, just what Mark & Patience needed. We aren't here to judge their relationship to revel in how these two came together and worked it out.There is some things in here that some people will find offensive but you must remember, this is THEIR relationship.to me.

I've read other reviews of 'Patience'. If readers think this is shockingly graphic, they haven't read nearly enough romances. Readers are all different, so what appeals to one may not appeal to another. Regardless, the quality of work Valdez gives us is top notch. Excellently done."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Just finished reading Patience, and from the other reviews that I've read thus far I'm sensing that you either love it or hate it. I'm going to fall on the I loved this book side. As a reader of erotic novels the BDSM did not bother me and of course I knew before hand that it was that type of novel so I was prepared for it. Also, as I was reading Patience I had remembered a couple of scenes from Passion that gave some fore sight into Matt's penchant for domination. (One scene in particular from Passion was when Mark had asked Matt does Rosalind know about your desire for fellatio? And Matt responded no, but she will after we're married.) I was glad that Valdez did not spend the time and effort into Matt's dwelling on the I'm a Bastard so woe is me. I felt that Matt had accepted his fall into society and I loved how his attitude was that of I'm not going to sit around and cry about it, but I'm going to do something about it, and that included winning Patience over which wasn't easy because we discover that she doesn't have an easy time trusting and loving anyone because of an incident from her past. In my opinion, the submission was necessary for him to earn her trust and love. My biggest gripe is that I felt that the ending was rushed.I love how Valdez develops her characters and how well rounded her female characters are. Passion and Patience are both beautiful but they are also talented and grounded. They were both willing to take chances with their men even though it went against their upbringing. Neither one of these women were afraid of sex they embraced it which is why Valdez (I think) was able to push the gamit with her sex scenes in both of these books which I found to be very hot!From what I could tell it looks like Roark Fitz Roy is going to be the hero for Primrose. I could be wrong, but some of the hints from this book just lead me to him. I just hope that I don't have to wait another five years for the next book."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"It has been a while since Passion. So while the 2nd book was always titled Patience, this book title has more prominence with the readers of this book. I will start by saying that I have been disappointed in some of the reviews I have read. It would seem that most of the reviewers wouldn't have bought this book after reading the first one. Therefore I wonder about the credibility of some of them.Lisa Valdez is an erotic romance writer. So to be surprised by the body of work is ridiculous.What I will say is this book starts off very quickly. The language is a bit coarse but it moves like a good Emma Holly book.If you have been waiting 5 years for this book, I doubt you think this is a wholesome regency instead of a sophisticated period book.Have a great read."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Frankly, I loved this book... and I'm shocked at the negative reviews! When it comes to historical/Regency romance, Mary Balogh and Mary Jo Putney are my all-time favorites. But Lisa Valdez packs a punch most historical romance authors smother in euphamisms and \\"fade to black\\" love scenes. Yes, the sex scenes in Patience are somewhat graphic. But I think she does a wonderful job exploring how love (and how we demonstrate it) comes in many different forms. NEVER did I feel like Matthew was abusing Patience or pushing her into waters she didn't want to chart. The submission/dominance wasn't about power and pain... it was about vulnerability, trust and honesty. I thought it was lovely. I want to also point out that they didn't have penetrating sexual intercourse until the last 25% of the story. By the time they did have sex, and most of the way through the book, the author made readers blindingly aware that these two characters loved eachother and that their sensual games didn't stem from ugly emotion. I can't tell you how many historical romances I've read that contain coersion (to the point of forcible rape.. a la Karen Robards) and THEN love. From the begining, I felt like Matthew respected and cared for Patience and vice versa. He wasn't scummy or perverse about his sexual preferences and fetishes. Like I said, I loved it. And will definitely be looking out for book #3. After this, it's hard to go back to watered down, milktoast versions of love after the \\"BM\\" (big misunderstanding). Potential readers - this one truly is spicy. Some people can't stand the heat, but personally, I enjoyed the burn."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"This book needs to be under erotica. It is not a romance novel by any stretch of the imagination. This is porn plain and simple and should be catagorized as such. As I am not into bondage and S/M I did not bother to read past the first chapter. Books even on Amazon really cost too much to throw away without reading. Next time please let me know what I'm buying."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I won't bore you with a synopsis of the book as many others have done an excellent job describing the story line of this book.I thought this was a good book considering I'm not a fan of historical romances. I discovered Passion just last week. I felt fortunate to discover it so late after it's original release so as not to have to wait 4-5 years as many of you had for the release of Patience.I bought the book knowing there was a strong dominance theme so I was not surprised, put off or offended by the content. In fact, as an avid reader of both contemporary and erotic romances I'm quite used to books that are heavy in BDSM. I thought this book had a good story with alot of detail about the period. The story was strong and the characters were strong and deep. I found the addition of the supporting characters added humor and compassion to the story. It was nice to see there were some members of society who were willing to stand by Matthew in his hour of need.Why I gave it a 4 star rather than a 5 star was 2 fold. I didn't really get how Matthew and Patience developed such a fascination for each other so quickly. Matthew barely met her in Passion and when the story continued in Patience, I didn't get the feeling they had spent a great deal of time together prior to their D/s episodes. For it being such a conservative time in history, Patience was quick to give up her values (she was raised by a vicar for Pete's Sake) to fall into an unconventional affair with someone she essentially barely knew.The other reason I gave it a 4 star was I felt the \\"spanking\\" was a little overdone. I found most of the love scenes to be very erotic and hot but even with all I've read in erotic romance, I felt that the spanking went a little overboard. I totally understand and get the BDSM lifestyle but this was a little overdone on the spanking to the point that I felt it was going to cause her harm. Good Lord! That poor woman's backside had to be so painful by the end of some of those episodes!! I would have liked to see more bondage as well as more variety in the BDSM theme rather than the constant focus on the spankings.I would recommend this book but beware that if you are a bit squemish about erotic pain/spankings, you may want to either skim those parts or avoid this book altogether.I'm definitely looking forward to Prim and Charlotte's stories. I hope I won't have to wait 4-5 years for the next book now that I've discovered Lisa's writing!!"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I absolutely loved it. The BDSM was extremely hot and the love between the two characters flowed."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"My problems with this book:1. I generally avoid BDSM books, but I wasn't quite expecting it in a historical.2. I like my heroines to be assertive, and I have definite problems with anything so blatantly male-dominant/female-subordinate. I don't feel at all comfortable with heroes who tell their heroines to be obedient and submissive in all things because it will bring the hero pleasure, therefore giving pleasure to the heroine. That sounds right on the way to being an abusive relationship.3. I'm not even going to start on \\"punishments\\". I don't care if they're actually pleasurable, calling them punishments makes the heroine seem five. Spanking is not something I find attractive in a hero.4. WTF is a proper, virginal, Victorian vicar's daughter doing having an affair? (And even keeping her virginity was just to prevent pregnancy.) She seems to be completely throwing all values of the time right out the window, and I can't really respect a heroine with so little regard for the potential harm she could do herself and her family. And how exactly did she learn and become comfortable enough with to use all the many dirty words she does? Because as far as I know, your average Victorian vicar's daughter is generally not exposed to words like f**k or c**t.5. How the heck does Matthew just \\"know\\" exactly what all her secret desires are that she had never imagined before? How does he \\"know\\" exactly what she wants and feels, even when she herself doesn't? This felt, well, creepy and kind of as if he was forcing her into things she didn't necessarily want but went along with anyway because she just wanted to please him. How does he know what her \\"true self\\" is?6. The religion. I generally avoid religious books at all costs, and Christian erotica is just, well, kind of odd.7. The purple prose. His, ah, appendage was described as \\"truncheonlike\\", which sounds far more painful than sexy. It is also an \\"organ of dominion\\". He \\"grunt[s] his dominance\\" and \\"submission sparkle[s] in her eyes\\" when they're not \\"glow[ing] with a calm docility\\".8. The hero. I did not like him. He was a manipulative misogynistic jerk and just ugh. I don't care if they're realistic Victorian beliefs, I still don't want my heroes to be misogynistic. And deliberately sabotaging her dream, and even just expecting her to give up her chance to study with the cello master to stay with him, when the hero could easily move to London to stay with the heroine, seems cruel.\\"Besides, what is strange about the feminine desire to submit, and the masculine desire to dominate? Are these not the roles we most often see acted out in nature? Are these not, at the most basic of levels, the natural tendencies of the sexes?\\"My skin crawls just typing that. No, I do not have any desire to submit, thank you very much.9. The destruction of clothing. That stuff costs money, you know? At least with ripping it can conceivably be sewn back together, but throwing her dress in the fire just seems rude, and possibly hazardous.10. It just seemed to be lacking the passion thatPassionhad. I actually liked Passion, despite some problems. This book, though, just didn't have the same spark Passion did. (And the fact that I didn't like the sex scenes at all was something of a problem in a book that seems to be made up of mostly sex scenes.)I was ready to abandon the book about half way through, but I kept reading to see her blow up at him. And she did, finally, but it wasn't even all that satisfying. I wanted the hero to suffer more than was shown.Well, at least the heroine knew she knew who the hero was before jumping into bed with him, unlike Passion. That's a positive, right...?"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I didn't get this one.Maybe it's because after such a long wait and so much anticipation...Patience couldn't live up to my expectations. Maybe it's because I don't really understand the \\"pleasure\\" of submission, domination, masochistic, and sadistic tendencies. Maybe it's because I was expecting something so different. Maybe it's a little bit of all these things. I just didn't get it.What I loved about Lisa Valdez's first novel Passion was that although it pushed some of my limits, I absolutely fell in love with the characters of Mark and Passion. I was touched in so many ways by their love, that the degree of sensuality did not offend me by the end. Not so much with Matt and Patience.Patience is unlike anything I've EVER read before. I've never read \\"submission/domination\\" before and just to be completely honest....it made my skin crawl. If both partners are ready and willing...I'm all for it, but there were times where Patience seemed afraid, hesitant, manipulated, and forced into sexual situations. I found myself feeling \\"pushed to far\\" as I read about Matthew's domination of Patience both in word and deed. It seemed like unhealthy, abusive, mind control...I don't know how else to describe it. At one point Matt spanks Patience so hard that she is sobbing....and her tears arouse him. I am sorry...I don't get that. That's not romantic in my opinion.I prefer mainstream romance, and this is NOT mainstream romance. For those lovers of BDSM....this may be for you. Valdez's ability to write is remarkable....she can take you to a whole other world in just a few paragraphs....I just didn't appreciate the world she took me to in Patience."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I am sorry I cannot recommend this book. Patience's constant crying and Matthew constantly spanking her, where very disturbing to me. Their was something very dysfunctional in their relationship. I don't find being spanked and being given commands such as sit and stay very romantic. This has no place in romance novels. Very Badly Done!!!!"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"As I read Patience, a few things stood out for me:The virginal heroine Patience has an interesting family trait: thick, distended nipples. She's also is skilled at using her mouth in special ways because when she and her sisters where little girls, they spotted one of their maids \\"servicing\\" their butler. From that educational viewing, they decided to grab some cucumbers from their family's garden and practice their sucking techniques. Patience becomes so good at \\"servicing\\" cucumbers that she soon wins the, \\"very excerpt at not scoring the skin\\" blue ribbon. Patience also enjoys having her bottom spanked by the hero countless times, over the other incredible sexual pleasures his is more than willing to give her.The hero Matthew deeply appreciates Patience's skills of the mouth, so much so, his release is much like the \\"fiery waters of the river Styx, his *** was a fierce and flowing tide.\\" And as his river floweth, Patience \\"found her rapture while drinking voraciously of the virile communication he fed her.\\"Patience picks up a few months after the heroine Passion, and the hero Mark, of Passion have been married. Matthew Hawkmore's (Mark's half-brother) reputation is in tatters. His witch of a mother has admitted to an affair she once had with her gardener. Matthew was created from that union and now all of British society knows he's a bastard. His ex-fianc&eacute;, Rosalind Benchley, who comes from one of the purest lines in England, has turned her back on him. Her father wants to ruin Matthew because he assumes Matthew hid the truth about his parentage. Matthew in turn wants revenge against Benchley, because Benchley is spreading vicious rumors about Matthew and hopes to push him into selling his pride and joy, the Grand West Railway. Matthew is enraged and wants to lash out against his skanky mother, his friends who now ignore him, and most of all Rosalind, who will soon marry another man, but still wants Matthew, but as her lover.As Matthew is trying to recoup, he can't get another woman out of his mind. She's Patience Emmaline Dare, his new sister-in-law, and current obsession. He first met Patience while he was still engaged to Rosalind before everything hit the fan. And because he thought he loved Rosalind and wanted to be faithful to her, he chose to ignore those pangs of lust that have grown steadily for the fair Patience. But now that Matthew is a free man, he wants Patience. He feels if he can dominate her and have her succumb to his masterful lovemaking, he will feel whole again.Patience wants Matthew dearly and hates to see him suffer so. While she stays with her sister and her new husband, she tries to confront her own demons of the past. She's very skilled at playing the cello and thinks of this instrument as her one true love. (No, she doesn't \\"love\\" her cello in that way you maybe thinking) In a few weeks, she will go off and train with a talented master of music, who coincidentally also taught Matthew to play the cello. Matthew refuses to let Patience leave and wants to be her only master and rule her body, mind and soul. He knows deep down Patience wants nothing more than to receive pleasure and give it in return. He wants to channel her inner submissiveness and have surrender to him. Matthew decides on a course of action that will change both their lives forever.Patience accepts Matthew's rules, with only one consideration, her virginity must stay intact. Over the next few weeks she and Matthew will come together, and through heightened sexual pleasures, with no intercourse, he will reach deep down into Patience's soul and through his skilled caressed and kisses, she'll kneel at his alter, to the point she'll live and breathe Matthew and won't ever think of leaving him. When Matthew finally has Patience where he wants her, he'll claim her as his own.Patience has pages of pages of intense foreplay of many sexual euphemisms for various sexual acts, nicknames for the female and male anatomy and enough purple prose to make your head spin. We have an alpha, brooding, forceful hero, who pushes the envelope in such a way that should be shocking, but isn't. He's all for giving out punishments to his lover of the cucumber, who wants nothing more than to bend over and take it. But that bending over is not what you think. See, Patience is very much a giver, her mouth is always open too receive Matthew. As a reward, Matthew spanks Patience, where she grows a fetish for it. I expected her tush to have a permanent hand mark, a tattoo if you will, from all the heavy paddling Matthew gives her. And even though Patience can barely sit, she wants even more.These boundaries that should be broken and should come across as all consuming, passionate and tempestuous, are not. The sexual play Matthew and Patience act out another is very cold and calculating, much as if I was reading a gynecological how to exam. It's pretty sad to find yourself bored and not titillated in anyway, especially since this is considered to be an erotic romance. I was not engaged, aroused or connected emotionally in any way with Matthew and Patience. Matthew came across as a manipulative, whiny bore, and although I did like the way Patience was portrayed, she was just so long winded, especially during those tender, let's spill our souls, scenes with her sister. I was bored half-way through and it took a great deal from me to continue reading.Something was very much missing between these two main characters. Whereas I felt the connection between Passion and Mark right from the beginning, I couldn't see anything special between Matthew and Patience at all and everything fell flat.I really wanted to root for Patience and Matthew and find enjoyment when they came together, but they were just too dull. Even with the passionate pleas of claiming on Matthew's end, and Patience's inner turmoil and final therapeutic breakthrough, and the knowledge that their love has set them both free, I never believed in their mutual attraction and communion by fiery lust for one another.I will say that Lisa does have a great historical voice, but overall the core of Patience is very much a thin wallpaper tale with a very tepid and lacking erotic appeal.KatiebabsPassion"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Lisa Valdez had set her own bar so ridiculously high 5 years ago with \\"Passion\\" that probably no matter how she wrote \\"Patience\\" it would still be somewhat dissatisfying to die-hard Passion fans (like myself). But in all honesty I can still appreciate and respect what Ms Valdez was trying to do here with Patience. It just wasn't my cup of tea and as it seems, not many others' either. I can see the good and bad in this novel, I don't completely hate it nor love it.Amidst all the sex and BDSM I truly did get the romance between Matthew and Patience by the end. Valdez really does have a flair for writing everything cohesively- dialogue/banter, visual descriptions, inner thoughts, etc. Can't fault her on that.But I have to echo what others have said, the actual romance parts were few and far between. All the BDSM stuff got very repetitive and frankly I was bored with it by halfway through. I found I was skimming through the numerous 'non-cosummation sex' scenes to get it over with.I also have to say some of the romantic lines blurted out by Matthew to Patience about love and forever and all that jazz were at times extremely cheesy. I've only read Passion once but I don't remember it ever being TOO cheesy.. in fact, I was so touched by Mark and Passion, I truly felt for them that I was tearing up because they couldn't be together. It's not the same here with Matthew/Patience. Their problem that \\"forces\\" them apart doesn't seem as huge a deal as it was like with Mark/Passion. As a reader I'm devoid of emotion for Matthew/Patience although still rooting for them somewhat half-heartedly because I'm supposed to.I'll still read Primrose and whatever else Valdez writes because I have faith she can still pen another winner like Passion. It just depends on what direction she chooses to go, really."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Lisa Valdez can write a story. What is lacking in this story compared to \\"Passion\\" is more of a balance between the sex and romance. I am not at all into this extremely graphic and erotic type of story, but in \\"Passion\\" the beautiful romance and story captured me. That is what this story needed, more story and romance and less graphic sex. Lisa's writing in this story again captured me and I have enjoyed reading it. I just find myself wanting more of the story and romance that you find in between the sex scenes. I liked both characters better in those parts of the story. I do look forward to \\"Primrose\\", I just hope there is a better balance and we get more romance and story and less shock factor and detail to the sex. I believe Lisa's writing is strong enough that she could back way off on the sex and tell a great story."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I wanted to like this book so much, I am probably giving it more slack than it deserves (pun intended;). But the truth is, the BDSM factor in this story was just too over the top. Some of the stuff they did sounded just plain ridiculous, not to mention icky. And Matthew seemed like an entirely different person in this book than he did inPassion. I liked Valdez's first novel, and have been looking forward toPatience (Passion, Book 2), but I have to admit it was a serious let down. The reason I gave the book three stars is because, well, no matter the subject matter, Lisa Valdez knows how to keep readers turning the pages."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I found Patience's story to be a hot, deeper, darker and more complex story than Passion's story which was quick and hot. I'm looking forward to Primrose."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Matthew Morgan Hawkmore has just been ousted as the bastard son of his mother's gardener. He has lost his title, his fianc&eacute;e and his pride. Meanwhile, his elder brother Mark is living in wedded bliss to the woman of his dreams. The one plus to Mark marrying Passion Dare is that Matthew is now family to her delectable little sister, Patience. Patience of the fiery red hair, sensual mouth and kind nature. Now that they are related through their siblings, it's impossible for Matthew to ignore his lust for Patience . . . with her he can explore his dominant side, and introduce her to the bliss of submission.But Matthew still lives in ton society and is trying to claw his way out of the social faux pas his bastardry has created for him. He needs to navigate a social landmine that could see him lose his business and his standing in society, especially if his ex- fianc&eacute;e's father has anything to say about it . . .\`Patience' is the second book in Lisa Valdez's \`Passion Quartet' series. I was warned about this follow-up being a little let-down from the outstandingly luscious \`Passion'. I thought a lot of fan ire surrounded the fact that \`Passion' came out in 2005, while \`Patience' was only released last year . . . but having now read this second instalment, I can see that it was more than just a frustratingly long interim.Passion and Matthew have a similar relationship-start to Mark and Passion in that it is quickly ignited. Mark and Passion met at London's Crystal Palace exhibit. Matthew and Patience meet because of their sibling's betrothal - and it's a temptation neither of them can ignore. Living in close quarters and meeting at family events, Matthew succumbs to his lust and seduces Patience. And with her, Matthew unleashes his dominant side and ignites Patience's desire for submission.BDSM in the 1800's is a little saucy, but the attraction is mostly sexual rather than charismatic. Patience and Matthew connect on a sexual-level, but their affection for one another feels rushed and artificial. Matthew decides very quickly that he is going to marry Patience; and honestly it was so rushed I felt reader whip-lash.One of the great things about \`Passion' was the twisted concurrent plotlines that crashed together into a brilliant finale. While also writing about Mark and Passion's meeting and falling in love, Valdez included a storyline about Mark being blackmailed into marriage with another woman . . . it heightened everything, the foreboding was nail-biting and the conclusion all the sweeter. But it feels like Valdez missed a few potential plot twists in \`Patience'.There is a small point of contention concerning Matthew's suffering business, thanks to his illegitimacy. But to be honest, the business side of things was boring and clerical. Things could have picked up when Matthew's ex-fianc&eacute;e, Rosalind, showed interest in rekindling their relationship. Matthew could have been much more duplicitous in his dealings with Rosalind, and Valdez really could have heightened tension for readers by tempting Matthew to ruin Rosalind in a bout of revenge (but at what price to Patience?). I honestly thought that was where the storyline was going - towards a love triangle between Matthew/Rosalind/Patience. Sadly, no. Where Valdez wrote an intensely twisted plot in \`Passion', she misses the mark with \`Patience'.Valdez fails to deliver a satisfying follow-up to her brilliant \`Passion'. The romance between Matthew and Patience is mostly compiled of good sex, making their relationship somewhat hollow. The BDSM storyline is titillating, but repetitive \`tie-me-up-tie-me-down' sex scenes, in the absence of a more interesting plot, means \`Patience' is a lukewarm historical romance. And it's a real shame because \`Passion' was such an outstanding first-outing from Valdez. Hopefully things pick back up with third book \`Primrose'."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I was a huge fan of LValdez's debut novel Passion when it came out several years ago and eagerly awaited the release of Patience, even though it took quite a long time to be completed. I have to say that I am disappointed with the story and the characters in Patience.The hero Matthew is struggling to re-establish a life and role for himself in London society after it was publicly revealed that he's illegitimate and not of noble blood. He doesn't resent the reason for why his legitimacy was ousted (in order for his older brother to break free of a blackmail betrothal and marry the woman he really loved). However he resents not living life as he used to: as a well loved, popular member of London's elite. Patience is Matthew's sister-in-law and had found him intriguing since she first met him; but she is harboring a secret that makes her fearful of pursuing Matthew.Sounds good you say, well I thought so too until the story actually unfolded. Matthew turns out to not be very lovable or likable at all. He takes his frustration and resentment out on Patience, punishing her for his inability to recapture his former glory as a reigning rooster. The punishments are in the guise of teaching Patience about being a submissive, however it just comes off emotionally cruel, awkward and unrewarding. There is no sense that the hero ever led a dominant/submissive lifestyle prior to his fall from stature, thus it feels very disjointed to have him teach Patience to be a submissive. Plus it never feels as if she wants to learn, more like it was forced on her in order to add some sexual \\"excitement\\" to the storyline.Patience's character is very weak-willed and uninspiring. She harbors a secret as to why she's emotionally afraid...and it's not much of a secret. It turns out that Patience plays the cello very well, and at one point as a teenager she had a crush on her music teacher who told her he thought she played much better before she started making puppy eyes at him. Apparently this comment was enough to make her close herself off from any experiences requiring emotional investment. Plus the whole cello talent seemed contrived as the hero, magically, also is a great cellist and at one point they play the cello together (not literally, but you get the drift).The overall story felt very forced, and it seemed as if LValdez did not know what to focus on in this story: the dominant/submissive lifestyle, bringing hero/heroine together through their love of music, or resolving the hero's dilemma in having to create a new life for himself. In the end, none of the plot lines worked or were satisfactorily solved. The hero was still a jerk in the end and still had no clue as to what or how he wanted to live his life, the heroine played the cello again but you weren't sure if it was a one off thing and if she would ever play again, and the sex scenes were very tame compared to LValdez's Passion and Lora Leigh books considering the chosen premise of the sexual relationship.This is definitely a book to check out from the library and save yourself some money. I have hopes that Primrose is much better, but I will definitely be checking it out from the library instead of purchasing."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Now before I start my review, I want to mention that I have no qualms about erotic romance, heck one of my all time favorite romances is in that category.Patience is not a romance book. It is a manual on 'how to train a sub in 30 days'. Matthew is a one dimensional character, and 99% of the book, shows him ordering Patience what to do in the bedroom to please him. They don't even have conversations !For the most of the book Matthew is either barking instructions ('Sit.' 'Stand.') or complaining about his fate. Dear reader, that is NOT the makings of a D/s romance story...When we have characters who express their sexuality this way, there is always a reason behind it, and the point of the romance is to peel away those layers to expose the person underneath. We as the reader need to know why the heroine wants to be used and give all control over to her partner or why the Dom needs to be in control. We get a 2 line explanation on Matthew and honestly I'm not clear about Patience.I am really disappointed in this book- because the love scenes came across so mechanical, I actually skimmed most of them, and rolled my eyes through what I did read. I think the actual 'training' of Patience should have taken up less of the book, and the romance should have been more.Other reviewers who have echoed this sentiment rated this book with more stars however I am done rating authors more than they deserve.Now I highly recommend a few books if you want a BSDM *romance*One Breath at a Time (Black Lace)--> warning:menage, BSDMBound to PleaseDare to Surrender"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"This is a wonderful romance book albeit the bds scenes which seem to have caused so much controversy and understandably so, as historical romance novels are rarely so graphic, therefore these well expounded scenes must have come as quite a surprise to many unsuspecting readers. Personally, I don't find the idea of \\"corporal punishment\\" sexually appealing but this book extrapolates on Patience's sexual preferences and she finds Matthew's methods highly arousing, exciting and liberating. As for me, I would have taken a branding iron to his well shaped, sexy bottom if he attempted such games on me, but we all have different needs and he has found bds as an effective way to ignite Patience's passions. The author goes into the reasons why Matthew acts as he does in detail which I found intriguing as well as informative, since this aspect of sexuality is not one I can pretend to understand. Personal preferences aside, I enjoyed reading the book and appreciate the fact that this author goes many steps further in exploring the sexuality of her Victorian heroine. For those who believe that those were times where women were sexually repressed let me inform you that Queen Victoria herself had a very active sexual life with Albert, equipping their bedroom with all kinds of sexual toys. She made her famous phrase \\"Close your eyes and think of England\\" after her husband's assassination when she turned puritan. Most marriages then were of convenience so it's no wonder. Besides, I am getting rather bored of the dainty and fragile heroine line in most regency romances who only feels \\"a slight twinge of pain\\" when being deflowered by a hero built like a stallion and is within minutes \\"cresting the waves of rapturous ecstasy\\". I enjoy reading more realistic love scenes that fire the imagination and are sensually descriptive.The story is about Matthew, Mark's brother, whom we briefly meet in \\"Passion\\". On the revelation of his lowly birth he becomes a pariah of his social circle with most of his aristocratic acquaintances wanting nothing to do with him. Not only has his fiancee, Rosalind, dropped him like a hot brick but her father is determined on Matthew's total ruination both financial and social. He sets about by spreading rumours regarding Matthew's enterprises with a view to driving him to bankruptcy. Matthew's hatred makes him bent on retribution, so he won't rest till he sees his almost father in law groveling. He is caught in a catch 22 situation with his only ray of hope being beautiful, intelligent, sensual Patience. Though she appears so sensitive and passionate she has vowed never to get married but to devote her life to her cello at which she aspires to excell. This does not mean that she cannot explore the sensual delights Matthew seems eager to bestow on her but she will not give her heart away as having been betrayed once at the tender age of fifteen, she is not willing to risk another such humiliating, heartbreaking experience.Matthew senses that \\"a tough approach\\" strategy is what Patience needs to release her well guarded emotions so he keeps her on her toes by awakening her sensuality and then keeping her constantly aroused but unfulfilled. This way he leads her to the well but does not allow her to take a sip so Patience has to face the dilemma of whether she needs Matthew more than she needs her cellio. Matthew is unrelenting, not really allowing her any succor or choice for that matter, but only forces her to come to terms with who she truly is and to bring to the surface her deeply buried desires and wishes. It is a well orchestrated plan to which Patience is drawn though she remains unaware of Matthew's plans of revenge and Rosalind's reappearance.Overall, \\"Patience\\" is an intriguing book on many levels which keeps the reader's keen involvement and intrest. I could not put it down and since I was prepared about the content by reading the reviews on amazon, I was not caught unawares so I was neither shocked nor distracted by the sexual content. Reading such a hot historical romance was actually a pleasant change and though I would rather be spared the spanking scenes in Ms Valdez's next novel, I hope she keeps the sex combustible."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"After waiting so long for this novel to make an appearance, it was an extreme let down. While sex scenes are hot and contribute to the novel overall, it should not be the main focus of any novel. I feel as if this book was 90% sex and 10% story. Nothing of substance was ever really developed here. But, if you are looking for 50 different ways to perform fellatio - this may be the novel for you."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I won't give away the contents of the story but I find it ironic that the names of each book speak for themselves. \\"Passion\\" was not just a clever name. That book was literally filled with such emotion and passion that I have read it at least 7 times. Patience is another story altogether and the name of the book is very fitting. I found myself attempting to have patience as I struggled to read through the boring, loveless, repetitive, emotionless sex scenes. I would say love scenes but there weren't any. You don't feel the love in this book. It's devoid of emotion and extremely cold. I didn't even finish it... and I waited a very, very long time for this book."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Which would have been very unfortunate, because it is a wonderful, well-written love story, and much unlike many cookie-cutter historicals that receive much higher ratings.Lisa Valdez is not only a fantastic story-teller, but her writing, her turn of phrase, her allusions and her use of symbolism is such a rare find among romance writers (sad, but true).It seems to me that people were waiting for another \\"Passion\\" which would have been ridiculous, since that story was already told. Ms. Valdez chose not to rest on her laurels, so to speak, and wrote an erotic romance with a little more edge than Passion. However, the elements which made Passion wonderful are also here.All in all, I highly recommend this book. It is highly explicit, very erotic, and NOT for the feint-hearted. On the other hand, the other reviewer's focus on the spankings and the BDSM (which is very light, actually) is a discredit to this book and the writer. I would caution readers who do not enjoy eroticism and find trouble with the more explicit writers to, please, not read such books and then make negative comments. For us who specifically look to such writers, our ratings are based on the content of the story, not on whether the heroine cried though a spanking. (By the way, I cannot believe how many readers missed the point of that scene...\\"she was beaten!!!\\" \\"she was crying!!!\\"...um, she was quite explicitly NOT crying due to pain...draw your own conclusions.)"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Maybe I had too high expectations after Passion, but this book fell way short. Like many of the reviewers, the book served more as an instructional on BSDM than a romance. Matt and Patience were not believable in their love for one another. Patience's beauty was referred to more times than what brought Matt and Patience to their interest in BSDM or their feelings. I can almost explain why Matt is a dominant. His life is out of control and in order to get that control back he serves as a dominant in his personal life. As for Patience, as much as Valdez tries to explain Patience's background--she was scorned by her music teacher, her mother died before she got to play her cello, she felt abandoned by Passion and was alone, suitors were enthralled more by her beauty than in getting to know the real Patience--who every that is. I was left confused as to who this character really was. All I know she didn't like playing the cello and she liked being a submissive. Okay, but whhhhhhhy?As for BSDM, I try to have an open mind. Hell these days nothing shocks me, but it's just not my thing. I can't understand why anyone would enjoy being physically abused and call it love. Pain and crying equals pleasure/love? I don't get it. When Matt says he wants to see Patience's tears, I kept thinking you enjoy seeing someone you love in pain, crying? I can understand being open about your feelings and letting the person you love see that vulnerability, but being the cause of their pain I don't see that being romantic or beautiful.I would have liked to see more of the relationship between Matt and Mark, maybe a sort of reconciliation. That may have helped Mark with his breakthrough in dealing with his identity. Like many here I felt this story should have dealt more with Mark's issues on unraveling his problems not Patience. Yes, the title is Patience, but I didn't feel she had many issues apart from the thrown in issues (see above) in an attempt to build this character.All in all, I did not enjoy this book; I couldn't wait to finish it so I can move on to my next romance, which was A Courtesan's Scandal by Julia London, which I really enjoyed."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I for one did not understand the hoopla raised about Passion. I loved it. There are plenty of romance novels that were released at that time or before that were just as explicit. I did not even mind the 5 year wait for Patience. I was just looking forward to the story of Patience and Matthew. I loved their scenes in Passion and was hoping that their story would be as wonderful as Passion's and Mark's. I am instead disappointed.Instead, I got so much BDSM pushed down my throat(an unintentional pun), that it stopped being interesting. Not that I wasn't expecting some bondage and domination, because that was evident from the excerpts posted. Erotic romance tends to have variety. This book didn't. Usually a book having so much of one form of sex is not labelled a romance and published in mass market. It'd be erotica and in trade form. In fact, if I hadn't almost paid nothing for this book, I would return it for a refund.I do think Ms.Valdez did a good job of creating a relationship between the two, especially when you took the sex out of the picture. But it could've been more thorough. I think Ms.Valdez gave equal space to both Patience's and Matthew's emotions. However, it seemed like Matthew got less insight to his character since Patience's issues were all clumped and resolved together.This book was basically a miss for me. I guess BDSM is just not my thing. If you don't mind so much of it, this book is actually good/great.I hope that Primrose will be released soon and that Ms.Valdez will do her story justice. I have my fingers crossed and hope that Fitz Roy will be her hero. He sounds delicious!"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I, too, loved Passion. And, I really enjoyed Patience because it stretched my thinking. As people must have noticed by now, there is not ONE way to love another, there is not one right way. And, to be quick to judge different as bad may indicate the tendency to not accept the differences that exist in humankind. The relationship between Matt and Patience is between Matt and Patience, who are we to judge it wrong?"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I thought Passion was a 4 star book and the only reason I rated this 2 stars and not 1 is bc I did actually finish it. The problems were numerous. First problem was ultimately I just didn't care about the characters. The second problem was the spanking garbage. Pleeeease, enough with the spanking and her actually liking having a sore bottom. ugh The third problem was the long lectures he gave her on submission and finding out what she desired. They didn't even know one another and he just assumed she needed what he was going to give her. The fourth problem was there was no suspense or conflict to make me want to continue to turn the pages. I really didn't care if she played her cello and I didn't care if he lost his fortune. Overall not a good book I did finish however due to the writing style but I skipped over stuff towards the end. I just didn't care anymore and wanted it to be over!"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I loved Passion. It was the first (actually - ONLY) romance novel that made me cry. The suspense was excruciating, the romance sweet, the sex quite sizzling.Waiting for Patience was painful!That said, I hated Patience. I just could not sympathize with the characters. I really thought I liked Mark in Passion, but Ms. Valdez didn't convince me to like him in Patience. There was not enough love in this book. The sex scenes were, well, boring. I am not interested in detailed descriptions of submission training.I did learn a new word. Who would of thought there was different terminology for two very similar acts?A note of interest: There is no teaser for a follow up novel. I was under the impression there would be four in a series. I do hope Ms. Valdez writes another, but only if it is the quality of Passion.I cannot recommend this book.

A few years prior I read Passion by Lisa Valdez and that book had a preview of Patience. I could not wait for Patience. But Lisa Valdez had other ideas in mind- she made me wait. On her website she touched on being annoyed at herself for the late release but she never really states why. ([...])What actually annoyed me more was that it was not released for Kindle right away. So I had to buy the actual book.Well- Patience dragged me in and never let me go. It is not your traditional historical romance with the dark hero and shy heroine. This romance is twisted; and I like it!Patience is Passion's younger sister.Passionfell in love with Mark Randolph Hawkmore, Earl of Langley- in the previous book. Mark has what all ladies want; good looks, money, and large anatomical features. So large that it's difficult for him to find a lady that will accommodate all his needs. Mark also has an illegitimate brother-Matthew Morgan Hawkmore.Matthew was engaged, but as the news of his illegitimate birth spread- he is shunned by society. Dumped by his bride to be, Matthew goes through some dark times and he is very angry with the world.Patience is staying with her sister Passion and wants to study the Cello with a world renowned master. She has the opportunity to do so- but an encounter with Matthew turns her world upside down and ties her up in knots (pun intended).To say that this book has bondage and sadomasochism scenes is an understatement. This book is an Idiot's Guide to BDSM and Enjoy It. I learned terms I never knew before. Patience was considered educational reading in my part.[...]"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"In 1851 England Patience Dare is happy for her sister Passion, but also envious as she wants what her sibling has, a man who cherishes and loves her. However, as one suitor after another fails to heat her soul, Patience begins to believe she will never have someone like Mark Hawksmore is to his new wife Patience.That is until one kiss by Mark's brother Matthew. Both are excited by their attraction, but whereas she knows he is her soulmate and he agrees, he feels unworthy of her. Recently, Mark learned he was illegitimate and his fianc&eacute;e upon hearing the news dumped him. Instead of running away, Patience begins playing sexual submission games with Mark while also assisting him in saving his business, but honor and justice may keep them apart.With a couple of superb twists, Patience is a terrific Victorian erotic romance starring a wonderfully ethical young woman who enjoys submissive-dominance games in bed while also expects the best out of her beloved. Mark is the more fascinating character as he perceives his life is ruined ever since he learned he is illegitimate. Readers will appreciate this strong historical wondering whether Mark will ever come to grips with who he is.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Patience, the long-awaited sequel to Passion, was well worth the wait. Steamy scenes with well-rounded character development, Patience did not disappoint. I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"While Passion was a heartwrenching Regency era erotica novel, Patience should be classified as a Regency era BDSM novel. There was so much emotion in Passion that it actually made me tear up a little as it was so well written.In Patience, while still well written, there is a completely different flavor altogether. The world of BDSM is a hard one for people to understand and putting the label \\"romance novel\\" on this is stretching it a bit far. While there was a lot of emotion in the book, it was more a novel of a man wanting to dominate a woman and exploit her submissive nature.I still enjoyed the book but was a bit disappointed that it was so different from her first novel!"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"After LOVING Passion, I anxiously awaited Patience. I was disappointed. I found it lacking romance and was put off by the BDSM. Now, I am an open-minded person and believe in \\"to each his own\\". I also read plenty of erotica and enjoy it.

Just a fair warning to all."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I got this book from my local library because the summary on the back made it seem like a good read. I was totally wrong to judge this book by its cover. I was absoultuely disgusted the more I read and it truly offended me. I am so not into the punishment and bondage, if some people are thats fine but its not for me. The female character of Patience was not your typical strong willed heroine with a mind of her own. She too quickly submitted to the disgusting things that Matthew wanted from her, which was just wrong. Frankly there was far too much explicit sex and I never felt that the characters really connected on a true emotional level. And I also felt that Matthew telling her that it his pleasure was for her pleasure all the time was stupid and that her character was totally unbelievable. This is not approprately rated. The story, what little of it there was, is thin and boring. I will never be reading this author again and my local library will be getting a lengthy letter about screening the books they buy more for a proper audience. It never should have been put in the romance section since with the amount of sex and punishment it was more like porn and is totally innapropriate for the regular shelves. I'm sure this author has published other books that are wonderful but I won't be sticking around to find out."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I read Passion last year and really enjoyed it. I did like this book, but not as much as Passion. This book was a little harder to stomach and challenged me in some ways, but as I read the reviews I think some of the reviewers are missing a point Valdez might be trying to make. The intense and often hard to read sex scenes (**SPOILER**There was actually only one full blown intercourse scene) are really more about their relationship than the sex. I see how some could think of it as S&M and punishment and pain, but I think with all the Biblical talk in the book, Valdez was really making a point about (what some believe) to be God's intended roles for man and woman. She repeatedly points out a woman's role to submit to the desire of her man (husband) and the man's role to cherish, guide, and have the best interest for his woman(wife)in all that he demands/asks. Therefore, if the man is living and loving as biblically indicated, he would therefore be completely trusted and any demand should therefore be submitted to. It was really wierd to read and at times I kept wondering if Miss Valdez is a Christian with a message being delivered in a sinful manner."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"If I were to Score Passion 100 Degrees of HotnessI score Patience a balmy 80 degrees.

Shoot, I learned a lot from this book. Not really understanding what a \\"submissive\\" relationship meant- I was totally engrossed in how Matthew explained how both partners received pleasure from such a relationship. Honestly, for me it was educational.I liked how the Hero never let Patience \\"get away with anything\\" - he was devoted. Now I did take exception to the\\"humping the boot\\" scene...that was a little much; but, it did have shock value. I liked the dark vs. light of the book.One of my favorite parts of the book was the card party where Mark intervened and threw the \\"vermin\\" out. I loved it when he asked \\"who invited you?\\" It was good.One of my favorite books of the summer.Buy it, you'll like it...It's educational!"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Honestly, Passion is the best romance novel I've ever come across. I love me a steamy sex scene, and plenty of them, but there has to be that romance element to them, which in Passion there was. But Patience was another story...The sex scene at least every other chapter is not \\"hot\\" to me. The scenes actually disturbed me. I'm sorry, but I really don't understand BDSM. And they don't even have actual intercourse until near the end of the book, and it was a lot of build up for nothing. For most of the \\"sex scenes\\" she's giving him a bl*w j*b or getting spanked.If you loved Passion you'll probably give Patience a chance like I did, despite the bad reviews you read on amazon.com, but you'll still probably come crawling back to write a bad review too.In all, it was just really disappointing after the masterpiece of Passion. I wanted to give it 1 star, but I just didn't have the heart to because I haven't given up on Lisa Valdez. Yet."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I bought this book because I fell in love with the writer after reading Passion - one of my favourite books! Patience was a HUGE disappointment. I actually rolled my eyes a number of times as I was reading it - it was so annoying!!!! I really couldn't stand Patience - crying or on the verge of tears at every term. I just wanted to tell her to shut up and suck it up!! Everytime she had an intimate moment with the hero she was always on the verge of tears. I also just didn't believe in her vulnerability - some nonsense about a music teacher who shunned her - and then she wanted to commit herself to her music. And the hero of the book - he just didn't seem to match the character I grew to know and love in Passion.All I can say is don't bother with this book."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Both of Lisa's book in this series are great books worth reading. I dont understand the calling of Lisa's books derogatory names. If you dont like erotic romances dont read them. But if you are someone that likes a good spicy romance then these books are for you. She already has the excerpt of the first chapter of the 3 novel in this series up on her website."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"While I thought PASSION was marvelous - I cannot say the same for PATIENCE - I read it to the bitter end, all the while feeling very uncomfortable. All that Dom/Sub seemed to come out of left field, almost as if there was a chapter or three missing. Valdez writes really well - but this one to me seemed like a car accident, how in the world did Matthew know Patience was a sub - where in the world was the story behind how he became a Dom - oh yeah a page or so about when he was 12. What about Matthew's former fianc&eacute;e? Engaged for how long and he never? Notwithstanding that she alluded to ....something .......one huge hit with PASSION, and a very long time for a reader to wait for one very clear miss with PATIENCE"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Strong writing skills have created a superior story. The setting is our old favorite Regency England with the typical in and outs of the \\"Ton\\". Nicely handled settings each one giving us a unique view into a complicated manor house/castle and the strict, segregated lives of the many people living within those beautifully decorated walls. Here is the \\"diliemma\\"--remove those lovely words and what remains is a highly graphic book of eroticism. Having read widely, I did not think I was capable of being shocked anymore--but this book I found shocking. The manipulation of feelings, fears and emotions are always key to most erotic writings, but this relationship was so unequally balanced that it felt--unpleasant. This book is at the far extreme of what is written today so be warned."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I waited years for this book to come out. I'm sorry to say I was somewhat disappointed. There's not enough \\"romance\\" involved althought the sex scenes are plentiful and pretty good (although, not as good as Passinon's). The characters didn't really seem to be in love. Plus, Matthew was taking the whole \\"domination\\" thing waaaaaay to seriously!! It literally was all he thought about when thinking about Patience...there was no room for love, romance, or anything else."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Although this is definetly going to be hard to take for a lot of readers, I find Ms. Valdez's writing and storyline very interesting. I just read a book by the famous \\"Lorraine Heath\\" and was bored to tears and this is this author's second book, I think. However, I do think that her debut, \\"Passion\\" was much better.At least she is giving the reader appealing characters. No one wants to read about a big nosed, long faced hero (Elizabeth Hoyt, although I love her is fond of that) or a gauky, freckled frizzy-haired red-head in a romance novel. The main characters were described as being stunningly beautiful. It kind of softens one for what is going on here, especially in the mind of the hero.Yes, it is a little unbelievable that a 19th century virgin would so easily conform to a choice like this, that anyone can just readily accept this life style really. Some of it really pushed the envelope in a disturbing way that I am sure many will object too. I found myself cringing more than once. I would not make a habit of reading anything like this again.Someone stated in their review that they weren't sure if the hero loved her. That I disagree with. He loved her. Probably more than she did him and especially at first. I think Ms. Valdez still managed to turn this into a love story and it I think that she actually offered a very good explanation for the beliefs and behavior of this particular hero. I am anticpating her next work."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I could have done without the drawn out weird sex scene - I know more than I ever want to about spankings and whatnots - the dialogue during the sex/domination scenes were unnatural and archaic but in other parts of the book Very GOOD! another big BUT ------- I loved Patience and Matthew. I love the moral of the story and I loved their passion for each other.I think overall it was a great love story and if you can overlook the sex scene - I think you'll feel the same"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Valdez is finally back with the sequel to her sexually explicit historical romance bookPassion. And as anyone whose read the prequel knows this author can really push the envelope when it comes to love scenes in mainstream romance, some may call it erotic romance, some erotica and some even porn. Doesn't matter which label you use because if that is all there were to the story then it would have been easily forgotten. But Valdez is a good writer, she knows her characters, knows how to bring out emotions and best of all knows how to make a connection with the reader. I admit that I was shocked by the content of Passion but it opened up my mind to other possibilities in the historical romance genre and I was extremely excited when this sequel came out. Patience is about Matthew struggling with his recently revealed illegitimacy and his new found love, Patience, who equally struggles to define the person she really is. Its dark, intense and contains a potentially wicked revenge plot. But unfortunately I don't think Patience is nearly as good as its predecessor. In a nut shell I felt that their emotional love story was sacrificed for the sex shock factor.My major problem with Patience is the love scenes -you can't get away from them. Well, you know that there won't be vanilla sex here. But BDSM? OK, I can open my mind up to some domination and submission. And let me tell you -You think Passion was smoking? Honey, you ain't seen nothing yet! It was shocking, titilating, and frankly educational (do NOT read this book in public! *blushing furiously*)! Seriously this a new flavor to anyone not familiar with submissive sex. BUT sadly there was waaay tooo much of it!!! Yes I'm complaining about too many love scenes in a romance?!! It seemed like they were having sex or thinking about ALL THE TIME! Really I didn't want to read another line about a red, purple veined thing or waterfalls between someones legs. It got to a point when I didn't know if I was reading a romance novel or a how to book on BDSM. To be honest I don't get the whole submission thing BUT to be fair, I'm going to assume that all that stuff, including the cringe-worthy crying and spanking parts (OMG!! stop that already!), have some roots in affection. I just wish that some of the romance was more obvious to the average reader. Its a case of too much information about one thing (sex life) and not enough of the other (romantic relationship).This is not to say that whatever pages that were left over for romance weren't good, they were excellent. But they were just not long enough! Either cut out a bunch of the racy love scenes or add another 50 pages. Because by the end of the book I couldn't answer a critical question: Are Matthew and Patience really in love? Or did they just find their perfect bed partner? Yes there was a beautiful ending but I needed more (remember the scene in in Passion when Mark tells Passion he will write her letters?.... I'm getting teary already *sniff*) I wanted that same feeling in Patience too. I don't mind sex early in a book provided that eventually the author spends time revealing the characters true feelings not just their body parts. There were points in the book that gave me hope but sadly not enough. Wish there more, that would have made a huge difference and maybe gone from 3 to 5 star.What I did absolutely love was Aunt Matty, she is hilarious! Her straight talking provided the comic relief from all that intense love scenes and the fizzled out revenge plot. Thank goodness for quircky characters!I also have to mention one other thing that had me going WTH? Cucumbers. I won't be eating them for awhile. Can someone explain to me why a *vicars* daughter, who quotes the bible in the book, has experience practicing on cucumbers? and she's not making salad people!!! Isn't she supposed to be this sweet angelic woman with high morals? Oh yeah give her a few big O's and eventually she's using the f-word too. Come on! This is a historical romance. Maybe if she was a courtesan I would buy it but a piously raised girl? Victorian era? Not buying it.Anyway as far as recommendations go I recommend this to anyone that reads or has read and enjoyed any type of erotica or erotic romance but definitely not if your the type of reader that's uncomfortable with explicit love scenes with little romance. If on the other hand your like me and curious (you know its like those accidents, you just can't look away) then you should consider this book cause you know I'm keeping mine purely for scientific purposes....yep scientific purposes..that's what I'm telling myself ;).Some other red hot historical romances that I have read and enjoyed-The Stranger I MarriedLessons From a Scarlet Lady (Signet Eclipse)"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"PATIENCE is the story of two strong-willed, independent creatures that have each been betrayed by those whom they trustingly gave their hearts only to be found lacking. Now, having brutally learned their lesson, neither is interested in repeating their previous pain but thankfully there's an undeniable pull that draws these two fated beings together. And once in each others arms, their well fortified walls begin crumble as if so much dust.An incomparable beauty, Patience Emmalina Dare is coveted by all the male members of the ton. As they preen, peck and squawk their candidacy as potential suitors, they know not that their efforts fall upon deaf ears for Patience has no desire to belong to any man. Instead, her heart - her everything - belongs to her cello and the music she persuades from its strings for you see, her instrument could never forsake her, can never ever leave her thus providing the perfect guard against any who contrive to poach upon her love. However, despite Patience's instrumental guard, she also recognizes a deep-seeded yearning for one man that has the very real potential to obliterate all that she is but the secrets he dangles before her are utter temptation and they have her leaping for a glimpse of the freedom he offers.Matthew Morgan Hawkmore, formally the second son of an earl but now a known bastard and recent social pariah of the ton, is grasping with white knuckles to the remaining pieces of his former life that he can still call his own. But there are those that would glory at seeing his financial demise and none is more hungry for that than Archibald Benchley - the Earl of Benchley and Matthew's would be father-in-law if news of his bastard birth had never made light. Accused of withholding his bastardy from \\"good society\\", Matthew has been snubbed by those he had once called friends and now to have his name and his honor slandered atop of the fierce financial crush that Benchley has heaped upon him, the desire for revenge has him swirling in an all encompassing darkness of anger and hatred. There is only one light capable of piercing through the black that is now Matthew's tarnished soul and that is Patience. Her goodness and her light calls to him, beckoning with sensual promise as well as soothing acceptance.It's really no surprise that from an early age, Matthew recognized and cultivated a burning need and desire to sexually dominate. With evidence of his already controlling nature, his role as a sexual dominant is no coincidence for he's a man that inherently seeks control - needs control - and in his current uncontrollable and crumbling world this unequivocal need to dominate gravitates him on a very primal level towards Patience. As if viewing a mirror image of himself, Matthew recognizes a deep-seeded and complicated pain within her and his reaction to it is fierce. Ultimately, Matthew desperately craves Patience's absolute surrender; to strip her of all her fortified walls, crumble her resistance, and tear asunder the pain that has burdened her so greatly. Perhaps by unleashing and healing Patience, Matthew can heal his own dark pain and the only way he knows how to do this is by requiring her complete and utter submission.Patience, nervous and unsure of the submission Matthew is demanding, follows him with a tentative trust. No man has ever demanded anything of her and while she should be affronted by his commands, instead Matthew brings to light a curious feeling that she's never before felt; one that awakens a previously dormant and unknown faucet of her nature that ultimately causes her to grasp hold of it with desperate hands and an aching heart. Soon, Patience finds solace in her submissive bonds. She no longer has to control her thoughts or maintain her strict independence for in truth they're not her nature. She was meant to be a nurturer, a calm example but instead she became closed off, seemingly un-needing of anyone but her cello. For years Patience has unknowingly forced herself into something she's not and with Matthew's help she's released from these constricting bonds of her own making and instead basks in the silken bonds of his dominance.However, while Patience unveils hidden aspects of her personality, hauntingly painful moments in her past, as well as gifted Matthew with her complete trust, he's hidden a plan from her that could potentially tear apart their burgeoning relationship. His revenge scheme for his enemy, Archibald Bentley, has escalated to such a high degree that Matthew recognizes no moral bounds. It's kill or be killed in his mind and he has every intention of beating Benchley to the punch despite the fact that his conscience is saying he's wrong. There's strong evidence of this because Matthew does his absolute best to make sure that Patience is kept completely in the dark from his nefarious plotting. She is everything that is good and beautiful in his world and to make his plans known to her would only spell his doom. Instead, Matthew is so twisted with anger and hatred that he becomes nearly blinded by the revenge he seeks rather than the cling to the love he's already been given by the woman that longs to lighten his world.Truly, what I think surprised me the most about PATIENCE, and it's not the unbelievable depths that Valdez explored with the D/s relationship between Matthew and Patience, but the fact that it didn't resemble PASSION in any way. Instead, the novel is compellingly unique and held its own superbly against its famous predecessor. That accomplishment in and of itself is rare and quite splendid. Bravo Ms. Valdez!If you love intense romance with graphic sex, x-rated language, an uber alpha hero who also happens to be a sexual dominant, and a complex heroine who lives and breathes to submit to her hero, than PATIENCE is the historical romance for you."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"This book was nothing like its predecessor Passion. Now do not get me wrong I knew they were going to be different but expected the same love and intensity that Passion possessed...sadly Patience fall flat.I did not buy or believe the \\"love\\" they felt for each other it seems as though Lisa tacked that in every other minute to make you believe it because you read it as oppose to us feeling it. IMO I believed that Matthew used Patience to get through all that he was dealing with and not because he loved her. The whole dominance thing was annoying and did not make any sense, all the talk about him \\"knowing\\" Patience and what she wanted was lame...and as far as everyone saying the sex was constant...it was page after page of oral stimulation for both him and her, and not in an endearing or loving way. They did not have actual intercourse or f*** in their case until later down in the book, around page 300 then all the love and happiness followed...sort of! I found him to be abrupt and hard, she was timid and stupid acting...whatever he told her she accepted, and went along with, like she had no mind of her own!! It drove me batty reading this after waiting so long for it to be published.I did not believe the \\"love\\" they professed in the least and every time he took the dominant role and made her do something that was for her own good...it was not tasteful, it seemed deeming! There is a part in the book that disturbed me...it was when they were in the cabin stranded by the storm, Matthew stimulated Patience to a fever pitch and denied her a release as usual...he liked to prolong her desire; he had a leash on her and when he did allow her to reach her pinnacle of pleasure it was by letting her hump his foot (which was still in his leather boots) like a dog in heat!!! That irked me to no end!! I have read a few books with BDSM in them and it was tastefully done and never did the heroine come off as being demeaned in the act at all, but this was just too much and again I never got the feeling of the love he professed he felt for her.It's hard not comment and compare the two books, but Patience lacked the love and intensity that Passion had. The sex scenes between Mark and Passion were in your face out there, but behind them you felt the emotions that drove them...in a since the Passion! With Matthew and Patience I felt as though because we knew they were the hero and heroine and was destined to be together, that they just were...nothing more!I am sorry to say but this book was a letdown, I am sure that Lisa worked long and hard on it but it crashed and burned before lift off!"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Patience is the looooong awaited sequel to Passion by Lisa Valdez. I really liked Passion. wasnt what I expected in a historical romance but I thought Valdez did an amazing job with the characters. while I cringed at the love scenes in Passion involving uterus shaking, (yes really) I was able to enjoy it because Passion and Mark were so in love.In Patience, the romantic love that draws the previous couple together is missing. Patience is Passion's sister and Matt the hero is Mark's brother. I fell in love with Matt in Passion and felt for him with losing his fiance, his reputation and his mother in a sense. I thought this book would focus on Matt's struggles with all that happened to him and Patience guiding him to acceptance. I knew there would be BDSM-dom/sub specifically and wouldnt have had a problem with it except the sex was non stop. Seriously, I think they had more sex than in Passion and yet I didnt get it. There are also unflattering references to body parts but in this one *sigh* Matt refers to meat often and its not dinner.What really bothered me aside from the romance lacking was that Valdez focuses more on Matt (fixing) Patience by helping her accept her submissive nature. Oh and we dont really know how he instantly knows she's a sub. Valdez doesnt go into detail on why Matt is a dom or if he would have been like this with his ex fiance. Patience in my opinion never gets the opportunity to focus and help Matt with his issues, which in my book were plenty considering the circumstances. Its as if Matt uses there dom/sub sex life to pretend there is nothing wrong with him and that life will be great if Patience can get herself in tune. There was nothing wrong with Patience in my opinion. In the end, Matt has 5 pages of self discovery and rushes to Patience.Lastly the cello bothered me. We are told in Passion that Patience is awesome at the cello and an old flame has kept her music sterile for lack of a better word. Matt is an awesome cello player but we dont know why or what made him study under a master for 8 years. Small gripe but due to a couple of scenes where music and cello are discussed, it bothered me."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Like some reviewers, I too found parts of this book difficult to read. The Dom/Sub concepts and intimate scenes were hard to swallow (no pun intended) and totally opposite to a normal woman's way of thinking. I mean, after awhile I had to put the book down because it made me feel so uncomfortable to witness the pain and humiliation of another. But, unlike other reviewers, I got it. Even though it was extremely unconventional, it was a romance all the same. Though some will point out that Valdez's first book Passion is completely different from Patience, I strongly disagree! In Passion, Passion needed something that only Mark could give her, and in Patience, both Matthew and Patience need something that only they can fulfill. As uncomfortable as it was, I found thier love story beautiful. And though the sex scenes were more than plentifull and seemed cold, it is within those submission scenes that their kind of unconventional love blossoms, therefore doing away with traditional wooing. I think Valdez did her best to convey this, but I can see how some die hard romance junkies who are used to the same romance formula can be soooo put off by that concept."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"It may sound profane to some, but i think sex between (eventual) spouses forms a spiritual bond. Nothing in the Bible says we need to have vanilla sex with our spouse. So, in that regard, the type of sexuality in this novel didn't shock me. Rather, the sexuality in this book depicts a different form of trust than what existed in PASSION. Trust based on love at first sight. God meant for Matthew and Patience to be together, because they were able to heal each other through their love, sexuality and care for each other. I wish some of the people so scandalized by this book, could experience this level of sexual healing and spiritual bonding as I have been blessed to."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Things are going downhill fast in the bedroom department for these three vicar's daughters. First Passion falls in love with a guy who can't be bothered with some kind of added lubricant, in spite of his challenging size for sexual partners. Don't most guys carry condoms in their wallets for unexpected sexual encounters? A little bottle of oil in Mark's back pocket would have been very helpful, don't you think? But then we wouldn't have had that obvious symbolism of Passion being THE ONE to accommodate his heavy emotional baggage. Now, I don't mean to criticize the book PASSION. In spite of the gymnastic sex and 4-letter words, it was a darned romantic book and I liked it.PATIENCE is another story. Many people are saying wow, what graphic sex and so much of it! I was left with a feeling that there was less sex than in PASSION and the sexual encounters were very unsatisfying (to me, not to the H and H, I guess). Didn't even so much as titillate. It was a darned unromantic book and I didn't quite like it. Guess I'm not into that whole sub/dom spanking stuff. And the cello symbolism? Still not sure of that, except you have to open your legs wide to accept the instrument while playing it. But both Matt and Patience played cello, so that left me puzzled.On to my fears for Primrose. It seems that maybe the character FitzRoy from PATIENCE will be her partner, because she sings and he plays piano. But I worry about the sex scenes. Where do you go from PATIENCE? On to real hard-core stuff? Or perhaps it will be something more innocuous, such as FitzRoy just needing Primrose to sing C above High C before he can climax. Just so long as we don't have many menages-a-trois, snuff films, or animals involved, I suppose it will be OK.Whatever the case, it can't be denied that Valdez is a capable writer. Now if she could just channel that talent for the greater good? Please let Primrose have a real romantic romance in addition to great sex."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I was so eager to get this book, having waited years and being a fan of Passion. I still haven't finished it and despite being 200 pages in, I just can't get over the whole controlling/misogynistic male lead of Matt and how happy Patience is to be controlled and told what to do. That's just not my idea of romance or escapist reading. I read romances to get away from the realities of everyday life and, yes, to get turned on. And this book does neither for me. I will admit that there are some hot and satisfying scenes, and I occasionally pick the book back up in hopes that Matt will change for the better (that and I want my money's worth!) All that changes though is Patience's realization that she wants to be told what to do and her willingness to be a lapdog to a man."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I waited for the release of this book since 2006. Passion was a beautiful erotic romance that moved me and haunted me and I couldn't wait for Patience's story. The author had a difficult time with this book, as often described on her website, and the release date was delayed many times. After a while, I sort of gave up. My \\"patience\\" had run out. Then lo and behold, I catch a glimpse of the cover at the bookstore and gasp. It's finally out! So, delighted, I buy a copy and begin to read. Three or four chapters later, I put the book down for a moment, unable to believe that the same author who wrote Passion has written this drivel.England, 1850s. Matthew Hawkmore is ostracized from society after the news of his illegitimate birth is revealed. His fiancee breaks up with him, and her father is dragging Matthew's name deeper into the mud. His half brother Mark, who is also the Earl of Langley, and his wife Passion love and support Matthew, and they do whatever is in their power to help. But Matthew has only two things on his mind. One is revenge, and the other is Patience Dare, Passion's beautiful younger sister. Matthew's desires are dark and unpredictable -- a Dominant through and through -- and Patience complements his needs. Neither Matthew nor Patience wants to surrender to love, but will they have a choice?***WARNING: This portion of the review contains some spoilers***The plot is very thin. You get pages and pages of intercourse-free sex, and then maybe a chapter or two of Matthew plotting his revenge, followed by a chapter of Patience having tea with her aunt or her sister (or both). Remember all the conflict and emotional roller coaster ride we had in Passion? You won't find it here. The writing is very straight forward. Matthew and Patience meet up for secret sexual encounters ALL THE TIME, and that, in a nutshell, sums up their relationship. You don't get to wonder when and how they fall in love because this is revealed long before the characters admit it to themselves. We're told they're in love, but they never really show it. The BDSM part doesn't bother me the way it bothers some. I've read this sort of erotic book before. However, the way it is portrayed here bothers me very much. Matthew comes across as a madman and Patience is a simpering moron. This novel needed a good copy editor as well. This is just one example of a badly structured sentence found in the book: \\"Gasping, his hands gripped his [you-know-what]...\\" I don't blame the author for this. It is the copy editor's job to find and fix errors. Alas, Patience is a huge disappointment, an anticlimax, I should say. If you want an erotic romance with plenty of feeling, read Passion, but if you want a how-to book on different ways to perform oral sex, then this is definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"CRAP! I hated this book. I was so disappointed. The only reason I kept reading was because I didn't want to waste the money I spent for this...even if it was a kindle version.It's just a bad bad story. Patience is a mindless drone, who goes from a strong liberated women to an indecisive, crying, mewling mess. And Matthew....really needs some psychiatric help.The whole sexual relationship they had was so cringe worthy. It wasn't so much the BDSM...which maybe I could have enjoyed were it better written. It was just how their relationship evolved and the descriptions of their sexual acts that left me repulsed. All I could think was how I'd HATE to ever be with a man like Matthew and how Patience is just an idiot. There was nothing enjoyable in how it was portrayed. I mean the scene where Matthew 'allows' patience to climax by humping his boot?!?! WTF!!What a shame as I really loved Passion."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Let me qualify my rating a bit. I was split on Patience. It's more like 2 1/2 stars because I felt like I was reading two different books. One I loved and the other that left me feeling nothing.Lisa knocked me out with Passion (book one in the series) with the perfect blend of emotion, romance and very erotic sex. I didn't expect Patience to *be* another Passion, instead I'd hoped those three would be displayed in Patience with a whole new spin that I believe Lisa can brilliantly do. I can honestly say that she is the only author who can write erotic, yes I thought Passion would have been better classified as erotic, and put so much romance and emotion wrapped around it. I normally don't see that in erotic books, it's normally just meaningless sex, IMO. When it's teamed with romance and emotion it doesn't get any better. That's what Passion was. Patience had moments of this but more often did not.Lots of reviewers hated the BDSM. I'll have to agree with them. I also hated it and thought it was a shame it took up most of the book and only left one actual love scene (well into the book). For me I find nothing romantic or arousing about a dom/sub relationship, if you want to call it that. For me it's not. Since a good two thirds of Patience was dom/sub, it almost ruined the book for me. Take those parts out and you had the makings of a wonderful story that could have been exceptional. It kind of makes me sad and mad for the parts that were romantic, erotic and emotional, mostly the last third of the book.I loved Matthew in Passion. Not so much in Patience. I felt he was almost two people in this book. The Matthew I disliked? One moment, or for most of the book, he was controlling, emotionless, and just a jerk. Not only was he controlling with Patience but also with his own desires. There were times he had to control his own feelings in order to carry out his dom personality over Patience. I also thought it was conceited of him to assume, without really knowing her at all, that what made him happy would make her happy, even if it wasn't something she wanted to do. What a load of garbage. And to hear the excuse that everything was taken away from him and he had to know he had Patience's trust was just empty. It was very apparent from the beginning, through his own thoughts, that he already trusted her. He kept on saying how loyal, moral, good she was so that part doesn't wash with me. The Matthew I loved? The Matthew I saw through his thoughts. I loved that Lisa throughout the book let us hear what Matthews thoughts were of Patience, when he was with her in quiet times and when he wasn't with her but only observing her from a distance. I found those highly romantic and emotional. That was the Matthew that was a dream. You could tell how deeply he loved her, it was almost as if he worshiped her, that's how emotional his thoughts of her were. During those times I felt he couldn't live without her and saw nothing of his dom personality. I kept thinking the whole time, I wish someone though that about me. LOL To me, the last third of the book was what I'd wished the first two thirds were. ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** The turning point for me was the kitchen scene (minus the spanking). I thought that was a wonderful scene (minus the spanking). I loved the sweetness of it. The other pivotal scene, the music lesson. Again I hated the spanking scene but what it revealed and the caring that resulted from it was beautiful. I loved how caring Matthew was with Patience after she revealed why she didn't want to play. It about broke my heart how he just wrapped her up in his body and held her through her pain. Absolutely fabulous! I'm just sorry it had to happen via a spanking. The rest of the book was wonderful, with the exception of when Patience left him and as she walked out he said those two stupid words, \\"Patience, stay.\\". I cheered her on when she kept walking. Other than that one sentence, the rest of the book had no dom/sub in it. Thank you that at least the last third I could enjoy minus that crap.I'm glad I didn't wait five years for this book like most. I just read Passion so immediately was able to read Patience. Lets hope the wait for Primrose isn't as long. I'm not giving up on Lisa due to this one bad experience. So Patience wasn't what it could have been. So Patience had BDSM, which I hate. It still had moments of brilliance and I'm just chalking it up to a risk on Lisa's part that didn't work for me, and apparently a lot of people.We can only hope Primrose stays away from BDSM. And please NO menage."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I don't know what to say. I was truly expecting more from Ms. Valdez. I LOVED her last novel \\"Passion.\\" But this one was sort of a letdown. First of all, I am a huge fan of Erotica (paranormal and historical), this was very erotic, but missing something. Oh I know....it lack the passion and romance like the other book. Erotic is good, but balance it with romance and passion. I felt Patience gave in too easy to the BSM, and Matthew Morgan Hawkmore, I did not like him, he came across like a bully and spoiled brat! Yes, I get it; he went through a major personal \\"trauma,\\" but come on.......I don't know what else to say but Hmmmmm."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"OMG... I expected so more more in this story. Passion was so much better than Patience. I have longed for this book to be released. It took so long I really thought this story was going to be great. How wrong I was. I loved Matthew (hero) in Passion. In this story he seemed like a totally different person. I just didn't feel the love between Matthew and Patience. The plot was boring. Towards the end I did a lot of skimming. Maybe if there was a little more drama between Matthew and his X (Rosalind), it would have added some excitement. This could have been so much better. If you are a Passion fan, then you can understand the disappointment."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I write this review because I strongly want to encourage those who are open minded to read this book, and to balance against those who call this book vulgar and full of nothing but \\"sex scenes\\". I have not read the first book, Passion, however I definitely enjoyed this novel that Lisa Valdez has written, and afraid that I may not like the first was as much, after she has given so much of herself in this novel!I'm sad to see that many reviewers have taken offense and responded negatively to her work in this book just because of the type of relationship that Matthew and Patience have.This type of historical romance acknowledges the existence of a physical and mental relationship of those who are in to BDSM, but it is really BD/DS which is Bondage and Discipline/ Dominance and Submission. for the quick wiki like definition, it is type of relationship between partners who use their experiences of pain and power to create sexual tension, and frequently are within the roles of a Dominant type person (Mathew in this case) and a Submissive (Patience). While I am indeed no expert on this type of relationship (nor practitioner for that matter), I have read books that were exclusively those type of novels, and the way that Lisa Valdez weaves that type of relationship into a book that is a Historical Romance genre, I feel she did it quite brilliantly while staying completely true to the BDSM roles given in the novel.I will admit, this is not for those who are a little more \\"prudish\\" than others when it comes to explicit languageused in this book, however it is not so far past the \\"Risque level\\" that other historical romance writers such as Nicole Jordan and Elizabeth Hoyt frequently use within their novels.The story doesn't beat around the bush when Patience and Matthew become involved intimately, which may catch you a little off guard at first, But I think that may be because I haven't read Passion (the first book). However, I was relieved to go the more quicker pace instead of waiting more than halfway through a book for two people to finally acknowledge the attraction between each other. Lisa Valdez goes exploring the complex relationship between the two main characters, and how Matthew uses BD/DS, to learn more about Patience, her past and moving past the barriers that she has set around herself.I also adored how Valdez captures the rage, bitterness, and resentment that Matthew feels about society who has now turned their back to him after they discover that he is a bastard child with no title, and is made a culprit by his former fiance's Father who is trying to ruin him both socially and financially (I believe more detail on this is contained within Valdez's first book, Passion.\\"I strongly disagree that this book belongs in an \\"erotica only\\" genre, It works quite well in this category, and it was so refreshing to see another type of relationship that is not considered \\"normal\\" to the general public. Readers, Please take the time to be open minded and you will find yourself enjoying a story that you are least likely to forget!"},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I have read thousands of romance novels and I thought this was a truly poignant and highly erotic book. After reading the many reviews I assumed the entire book was about BDSM and spanking, which I have read on a couple occasions. I also assumed that there was just a lot of sex and no emotion. With \\"Passion\\" being one of my favorite books I decided to buy this book anyway, and I found that it was better than reported. There were only 2 major spanking scenes and the first scene does not happen until page 200. At the end of the book you are left feeling that they love each other. Even better, you don't have to wait until the last chapter to find out that they are in love, the emotion is established throughout the book many times. Regardless of the BDSM theme, Matthew is established as a character who cares about Patience, in the multitude of little things he does for her throughout the book; getting her breakfast, making sure she is warm, encouraging her to play her music, taking her places, buying her things, dressing her, fixing her hair, seeing to her comfort and seeing to both her sexual and non-sexual needs. There are some very graphic BDSM sessions where Matthew takes a dominant role, but though he may withhold sexual gratification at times, it is usually done in the effort of making the culmination of the session even more intense, because he does give her pleasure. Strangely, this was a romance book where Matthew realizes way ahead of Patience that he loves her and wants to be together, and he is waiting for her to come to the same conclusion; but he never tells her what to feel or tries to force her to feel the same way. Patience was a complex character to understand. Her emotions are locked away, even from herself, and each tear she sheds is like knocking a brick down from the wall that surrounds her heart and feelings. Her character is shaped from a combination of loosing her mother, her subsequent relationship with her sisters growing up and an adolescent rebuff from an infatuation with her music teacher. The ending and the choices that Matthew and Patience make, because of the love they share, lends to a surprisingly different yet beautiful finish to this book. An absolute plus was Mrs. Valdez's writing skill which made this a page turner and very easy to read. I think many, including myself, have waited 5 years for this book and I think they were expecting more of Passion and Mark. I feel that if others were to reread this book, for its own merits, they would enjoy it more the second time around. I still love \\"Passion\\" better, but I plan to keep and reread \\"Patience\\" and I am looking forward to Charlotte's and Primrose's stories, hopefully I won't have to wait too long."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I fell in love with Matthew and Patience's story, just as i did with Mark and Passion's story. And, Patience was well worth my being patient and waiting for the second book of Passion... Those who criticize that this story line is not a realistic reflection of the Victorian times do not understand the history: Prince Albert's \\"prudish\\" and frugal german background influenced his wife's, Queen Victoria's, behavior and her expectation of her subject's behavior. However, after the Georgian era excesses and the outright raunchiness of the Regency era, those subjects in reality were not always so quick to change their views or habits. They merely became behaviors that were not practiced as openly... Further, \\"Patience\\" is the tale of a young woman who has decided that she does not need an husband, because she has the technical perfection of her music and she is planning on furthering her knowledge by studying under a music master. Patience does not need an husband, because she does not NEED another human being. She is an independent woman, has been since she was forced to be by circumstances as a young girl. SPOILER ALERT ** following discusses plot** The story line follows Patience's growth from an emotionally isolated woman, although comfortable with her sexuality, who needs no one to be a self-fulfilled woman who truly understands that submission to her husband frees her. This gift of her submission allows her physical, emotional and spiritual fulfillment, but means Matthew has the awesome responsibility of placing ALL her needs before his. This is why Matthew stops his revenge plot and why he does everything he can to fulfill Patience's dreams for an insignificant, small town. By these behaviors, Matthew demonstrates that he is an honorable man, the man his honorable father raised. This basic understanding of the biblical relationship of a wife and husband by Patience, as she grows, is not only what Matthew demonstrates, but what she would have been taught by her father. I understand the sexual relationship of dominance and submission is a reflection of the growing spiritual/emotional relationship between the pair, but i still must confess that I don't understand the entire \\"spanking\\" relevance Ms. Valdez... I just can't \\"get\\" how one could enjoy love making while experiencing a sore bottom! Thank you for this wonderful, beautiful story! I must warn, however, that when a wife \\"gifts\\" her husband with submission, this relationship will not proceed if the husband does not \\"gift\\" his wife with willingly meeting her needs/desires before he meets his own. I am certain this will spark some unpopular views, but i agree with the plot."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"I did like the book but I felt the ending was rushed. The first book, Passion, was great and I expected this book to be just as great if not better considering how long it took for it to come out. However, if the author chose to write a third book about the third sister Primrose I would still read it."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Matthew Hawkmore's life as a perfect gentleman and smart businessman means nothing in the wake of his mother's revelations that Matthew is in fact, the son of a gardener instead of the second son of the Earl of Langley. Doors are shut in his face, his fianc&eacute; has renounced their engagement, and Matthew's businesses are failing right before his eyes. The only true constant in his life is his attraction for his regal and beautiful sister-in-law, Patience Emmalina Dare. In her eyes Matthew sees the needs she tries to keep hidden, but he knows her. He knows exactly what Patience yearns for. And so with carefully worded instructions, he brings her to him, and they surrender to the forbidden. With Patience going to London in a few weeks, Matthew is put to the test. Will he let her go or will the imaginary strings wrapped around his and her hearts be enough to keep her with him always?From past experiences that shaped her long ago, Patience has learned that she can only depend on herself. Patience shuts herself away from anything that could make her emotionally fragile and puts on a brave face in order to fool the people in front of her. The real Patience quietly craves what Matthew's eyes promise, but she is frightened - no man has ever seen past the faade that she shows the world. Patience knows that with her capitulation to Matthew, her heart will be vulnerable, but sometimes, saying no is not an option. Will Patience be able to handle Matthew's desires, or will she be unable to let down her guard and take a chance on the love she feels for this enigmatic man?Matthew Morgan Hawkmore. How can I even begin to describe this virile and dominant man? He is a combination of tender and tempestuous with a heightened sense of sexuality that makes him utterly irresistible in my eyes. He puts every thought and feeling he has ever had into his seduction of Patience. A dream come true but still just a man with his own flaws, Matthew is anything but saintly. But his seduction of Patience is enough to make angels sing. Patience is strong and strives to be independent - she is scared to give her heart and soul to any man because of hidden fears. Highly sought after because of her beauty and silent grace, Patience has never given in to the illicit feelings she has hidden - until Matthew. What a lucky woman she is that Matthew loves her.Bravo Ms. Valdez. I can honestly say that PATIENCE has definitely been worth the wait! The raw passion between Matthew and Patience is more than evident in each touch, kiss, and love scene. Highly arousing and very erotic, PATIENCE has a depth of emotion that I can't even begin to describe or even give justice to. Just know that PATIENCE is a historical romance unlike any that has been written and it will make you think, laugh, and possibly cry. It was perfection on the written page, and I can't recommend it enough. My advice to the reader? Grab a scone and some marmalade and experience one of the most erotic historical romances I have ever read!Natalie S."},{"Title":"Patience (Passion, Book 2)","review":"Wow. Such a great book. I read a lot of romantica as well as more vanilla romance, and this was, like Passion, a PERFECT melding of the two. Scorching hot love scenes (of the BDSM variety but not nearly as hardcore as a lot of what is out there, more romantically written)and sweeping emotional romance. I really liked both characters and I was actually very moved by the root of Patience sadness...genuine feeling and passionate writing in this book. Was also so fun to watch Matthew fight for her love...the scene where she plays Handel's Sarabande was AMAZING, especially if you know that piece of music...if you don't i suggest you listen to it as you read the scene. Divine! Valdez is a very sophisticated writer (if sometimes overwrought...but hey, it's romance after all) and is right up there with Lisa Kleypas and Madeline Hunter for me now in terms of historicals. Of course she is much hotter. Can't WAIT for the next one!!

No, their needs and actions would not be mine, but I completely understood and respected their love story, and a love story it truly is.

However, you should expect nothing of the sort from this thing.

A variety of well known and respected writers in the field of autism and Asperger syndrome have contributed to this guide and it is well written, but overall I found it a bit dry.

It purported to be a detailed review of the role of sex in Roman life and how it could be argued that degeneration in moral standards contributed to the downfall of the Empire.Instead, it skirts all major issues and on numerous occasions the author states that he cannot continue on a theme because the words used are too graphic or the topic becomes too innappropriate for this forum. I mean come on, what does a reader expect to learn when they pick up a book titled as such?We get a seemingly endless cut and paste of Roman poetry which at best discusses the role of love in poetry rather than the thesis title, an overview of marriage law that would be better placed in a legal reference and a brief analysis of a series of emperors with the occasional reference to their sex lives. All in all the book represents to me a collection of sound bites from other academic work, with little originality added and a fearful step back from the precipice just as we ever get close to a new idea.Very rarely do I do this but my copy is back up for sale and going in the bin if no one else wants to buy it.

I've read all the Mankell books I can get and find them superb and Wallender, the protagonist, a man I'd like to know. Thank you, Henning Mankell."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"Kurt Wallander, Swedish police investigator is again searching for answers in Henning Mankell's methodical \\"Firewall\\". Two seemingly unrelated incidents are serving as the impetus for a series of crimes that have the authorities baffled. Tynnes Falk, a talented computer software expert is found dead in front of a cash machine in Wallandar's native town of Ystaad. It is inconclusive as to whether the bruise on his skull was caused by an assault or as he fell to the pavement. At the same time, two remorseless teenaged girls are apprehended for the stabbing and bludgeoning of a cabbie who eventually succumbed to his wounds.These events lead to a series of crimes that commence when one of the teens, nineteen year old Sonja Hokberg escapes from custody owing to some sloppy police work. She is later found incinerated, as a result of being tossed into power lines in an electrical substation causing a regional black out. Wallandar's investigation takes a new tangent and he discovers that this and subsequent events point to an attack of global computer systems.With the help of his investigative team and a teenaged computer hacker Robert Modin, Wallandar decides to break into Tynnes Falk's computer to see what he was up to. He is stonewalled by a series of firewalls which retard his progress as crimes and killings related to the case continue to mount.Mankell's hero Wallandar, is the Swedish version of Columbo, unassuming on the outside but attentive and perceptive on the inside. Mankell's work is as systematic as Wallandar's demeanor. While \\"Firewall\\" wasn't the best of his work, it was a worthy novel for those with an appetite for crime drama."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"The Italian traslation is always late and so I'd like to thank the english translator.As to this new case, I think that perhaps it's the best.

I was able to finish the book, but that's about the only positive note.In short, this book is about a 2 week police investigation starting with the murder of a taxi driver but quickly unfolding into a series of events that may or may not be related. The book focuses on the very detailed actions of the main character - Kurt Wallander, the police investigator.The book cover quotes mention words like &quot;suspensful - thriller&quot;. I disagree with these. The only word that is correct is &quot;procedural&quot;. The book reads like a police report. But one where you also get information on the bad guys before the police finds out. There is absolutely no suspense in this book, and the little intrigue there may be is quickly put off by revealing key information so you can completely guess the final outcome about halfway through the book. Also, the expectation on the level of sophistication of this story is set high because of the many events decribed in very detail. At the end I was disappointed to discover that many of those details were actually unimportant to the story.Also, as the title suggest, there is quite some computer technology involved in the story. It appears to me that the author has made little research on the matter. Everything around the computer technology described doesn't make a lot of sense. The author very much sounds like the computer-illiterate main character.In summary: this book is a police report of an unsophiticated, and therefore uninteresting crime."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"I usually love this author's books but this was a major disappointment.

Highly NOT recommended."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"While the book is fairly enjoyable and a quick read, I found the characters to be, for the most part, two dimensional, and the dialogue to be stilted (perhaps due something to the translation). Also, too many disparate things occur that fit together in the end. However, it is interesting to read about police work and the legal system in a different country (Sweden) and how in what ways it is similar to (and different from) the U.S. One minor quibble which I often find in these kind of books is that one would think that where the evidence strongly suggests a far-reaching world-wide conspiracy, the main character would \\"call in the cavalry\\" much sooner."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"The printing is defective, letters and whole lines are to long for the format or simply do no appear.

You could also say that MacDonald's presents a menu.I felt like I was being barraged by short staccato sentences which were nothing more than information blasts needed to push the plot forward.Mankell goes into the same stable with Yanni and John Wayne.

Now I'll head for others that appeared earlier in the series. The details about small town Sweden were interesting, and the introspection of Wallander readable and pertinent to the story. The plot, unfortunately, is also believable in this day and age of computer geniuses (genii?). Who knows what will happen? The interaction between Wallander and his co-workers helped bring the plot along, though the final relationship between him and Martinsson was not worked out well. A question about the English version: does Mankell really write in such short, choppy sentences, or is this the work of the translator? Not exactly Hemingwayesque, but leans in that direction.

Then there's the whole aspect of KW becoming a grumpy old man.... but again, since these are largely procedural novels, showing the process would be good...

Now, as you know, Mankell is an acquired taste. Because his books are written in Swedish and then translated, they don't read like native English books. The writing is choppy and the thought processes seem more disconnected. But I have developed a genuine liking for the exceedingly dour detective Kurt Wallander, who reigns at the heart of most of Mankell's books. He gives \\"morose Swede\\" new depth and meaning. This book requires fairly careful reading because of the writing and because it is more densely plotted than other of Mankell's books. There are no gasping surprises, but a very good, forensically sound book that reads true to everything I know about computers and people who use them extensively."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"Every one of the Wallander series is so much better written than almost anything else in the genre, and this despite some awkward translating. Forgetting particulars of which is somewhat better than another, simply bear in mind that they are intelligent, credible, literate and complex. There are no \\"babe\\" detectives tearing off their badges to sleep with partners; no sex addicts, no gratuitous titillating crap of any sort--just detectives doing their work.My heart leaps for joy when I see a new one, and I've pre-ordered the upcoming Lina Wallander story. The Patricia Cornwall stories are an embarrasssment by comparison. It makes you wish you were a Swede."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"I have read (and reviewed for this site) several Henning Mankell books. Although I enjoyed this book, it is not my favorite Mankell. This is partly because the plot is so dated and partly because it's all somewhat ponderous, something like the central character, Ystad, Sweden Police Inspector Kurt Wallander.The plot is dated because the year is 1997 (the book was published in 1998) and the story focuses on a field that has undergone vast changes since 1997--computer technology. At the heart of the story is the idea that, by tampering with cyberspace, it's possible to create a global catastrophe. Mankell refers to the Y2K fears (Y2K was three years away in 1997). Of course, we now know that virtually nothing happened on January 1, 2000, and computer infections have not been linked with major world disasters. It seems that the dangers of hacking and viruses have been limited to relatively small populations. Yes, people have suffered because of a virus wiping out their hard drives, but the events have been scattered and, for the most part, quickly contained. We all hope that some time in the very near future we can use our computers like we use our phones--with a sense of security. As for the book, if you take away a sense of danger in cyberspace, you take away most of the steam that drives the story.Mankell developed a rather complex story with several diverse elements. A man dies (was he murdered?) after making an ATM withdrawal. A taxi driver dies after he is struck with a hammer and stabbed. Fanatics plot a dastardly deed. A corpse is mutilated after being stolen from the morgue. A large power blackout in southern Sweden has a most bizarre cause. And in the middle of it all there is a widely publicized accusation of police brutality directed against none other than Inspector Wallander.The book kept my interest to the end, but I can see how many readers would find the pace somewhat slow and ponderous. There's a lot of (unnecessary?) detail about things like the weather and what the cast of characters has to eat and drink."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"I was not aware of this author until I saw his book in Amazon. I bought it as a test subject. The author has an understated way of involving the reader untill the reader is fully ensconced in the story. Who would have thought that a Swedish investigater would be so enthrolling? What a happy surprise. Couldn't wait for the reveal and the next case (book)."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"I got this book as a present, and boy was I delighted; I always wanted to read something by this mysterious Mankell, I had been hearing so much about.As I got started the book seemed fine; the plot sounded intriguing, and the characters were interesting. After day three I lost courage; suddenly this book seemed to have an endless amount of pages, and the story was just dragging on. Normally I enjoy reading about the privatlives of our heroes, in fact that's normally my favourite things about these books, but now I was practically begging for the mystery to be solved and the book to end. It just went on and on and on.And wouldn't been a problem if the writing wasn't so standard and emotionless. Mankell barely bothers to give us some characters to relate to. The entire thing reeks of run-of-the-mill detective fiction; not bad, but ask yourself this question: what then makes you as a reader read this book? At the end of the book your left with a decent ending, but the book should have been so much shorter! So many pages of dreary babble!I'm sure the other Mankell books are better, try one of them!"},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"I read the German translation (\\"Die Brandmauer\\") as soon as it became available. In fact, since reading my first Wallander, I've never been able to wait for the English translations. (Why do they take so long?) Whatever you like about Kurt Wallander novels -- the shocking, unexpected turns of plot, the continuing development of Wallander as a person, his relationship with his daughter, his colleagues -- you'll find it in this novel. The character of one of those colleagues -- Martinson, whom we first met as a young, new policeman in Faceless Killers -- exhibits a surprising new side.At last, it's about to appear in English, so that I can share it with friends who don't read German (or Swedish or Norwegian or ...)"},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"I've read all of Henning Mankell's Inspector Kurt Wallender series. Mankell is an outstanding writer and Wallender is an interesting, funny, and complex cop who eats, drinks, and smokes too much. He's a real human being who has all kinds of problems including marriage and subsequent love life, and probably suffers from the serious blues if not outright depression. When one reads a Mankell/Wallender book, he or she feels the cold, grey dampness of Sweden and Scandania. The reader feels as if she or he is walking side by side with Wallender and his cop colleagues solving brutal, unspeakable murders. Read the Wallender series in the order each story was published. I think Mankel is finished with Wallender which is as depressing as the snowiest, iciest, darkest, dampest, meanest night in the whole country."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"I agree with the other one-star reviews. The plot makes no sense, nor the idea that Wallender has saved the world.Why were the characters who ran the conspiracy calling attention to themselves? For that matter, the characters rang phony and were shallow in every instance.What kind of a computer dating service asks you to write them and postal service mail them a letter. Why would the letter not even have Wallender's age in it? What kind of a computer dating service delivers letters without use of mail?Why doesn't Wallander asks the witness the age of the tall skinny man whom he is looking for--perhaps it's not PC in Sweden? Phony credit cards don't get accepted in the first instance for dinner or for a rental car. The technical defects go on and on.Who cares that Wallender needs a new car? What did Wallender's departing horse-farm friend have to do with the plot at all -- this was just part of the pounds of filler put in this book.I'm not going to waste my time any more on this author's books."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"Kurt Wallander reappears in Firewall. Extraordinary character, extraordinary book by a consistently superb writer. Just terrific. Don't miss any of the books with Kurt Wallander...they are just exceptional reading."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"Although I have read and enjoyed other Mankell books, I was unable to finish this one. The translator, Segerberg, seems to be incapable of constructing a complex sentence. One simple sentence after another makes reading this book a boring chore. There's no flow. The poor writing skills of this translator is so distracting that I lost all interest in the plot. I will, in the future, avoid any of Mankell's books that have been translated by Segerberg."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"I've read the entire series to this point and find myself putting other books aside to read the next one in the Wallander series. I enjoy the stories and the characters very much. I've been very impressed with the translation, although I've noticed that the quality of the translations has slipped a bit in the last two books (Firewall and One Step Behind - both Kindle versions). It's unfortunate as that kind of detail is quite distracting to me as a reader. Here's hoping they return to the excellence of previous versions."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"Kurt wallander is always a good read. I enjoyed following him with his family growing up on a different continent."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"For those who want to identify with a character in the story...this would be somewhat difficult...a small independnet girl, tatooed and bi sexual does not discribe the average reader's taste, American or European in my opinion....but in spite of this the plot is well developed and the characters are not far-out in terms of their behavior...this gives the book a phantastic aura and invites the reader into an interesting plot in an less than familiar world...If this is your cup of tea you will enjoy every page...."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"This book is very different from 'Sidetracked'. There, the first 100 pages were filled with Wallender's repeated introspections, so that the book only took off after that. I read this book partly while visiting S. Sweden. However, I must state that the occurence so many murders so fast in Ystad in the book contrasted sharply with the nice reality of street life and cafe atmosphere in Ystad in July! The old town (gammlebyen) is surprisingly large, not so many like it are left in Scandinavia.This book is highly recommendable, really takes off from the start. It makes references in the beginning to two of Wallender's earlier cases, Sidetracked and Hunde von Riga, and with all of Wallender's complaints about health and his colleagues foreshadows his coming retirement. I read in a German article this summer that Mankell lives in Africa and soon will replace the Wallender series with one where Wallender's daughter 'stars'.This review is based on the Norwegian translation 'Brannvegg'."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"English version - I could never sit through the TV series. But I really enjoyed the book and the introspection was a nice introduction to the character. I have bought two more Wallander books. Wish me luck."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"I have just finished reading Firewall. Although I live in Sweden, this is my first Mankell. Firewall has introduced me to this wonderful author. I have just ordered The Dogs of Riga."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"I made it to page 261 of 405 and asked myself \\"Why am I reading this?\\" Kurt Wallender, a Swedish detective is boring enough. While many authors use the inherent tedium of police work to frame their characters, Wallender is a pedant, who worries about aging, his loneliness, the incompetence of his colleagues, the unfairness of his boss and the world. He is not likeable, nor is he particularly interesting.The case at hand has a reclusive computer programmer falling dead in the street, followed shortly thereafter by two teenage girls murdering a cab driver for no rational reason. Wallander's investigation is hampered by the escape of one of the two teenage girls who shortly thereafter is murdered in a grisly manner that throws a third of Sweden into darkness. The emerging story is that some wicked fellow in Africa is plotting something big against the world that involves computers.Unfortunately Wallander knows nothing of computers and apparently neither does author Mankell.As a technologist, it always irritates me when authors either make mistakes with technology or, worse yet, simply try to fake it. Mankell tries to fake it and fails miserably.An author simply can't take a few buzzwords, cop a few excerpts from the popular press and hope to fool all of his audience. Mankell appears to think he can.The result is an utterly laughable plot that depends on the availability of a local \\"hacker\\" who is able at a moment's notice to penetrate supposedly sophisticated security and many other whoppers.I suppose if I didn't know anything about the technology involved, \\"Firewall\\" might have been more interesting. But the story itself is pedestrian, depending more on shock value than anything else. A secret conspiracy trying to cover itself by committing highly visible crimes that have no reltionship to its mission? No, I don't think so. A detective who spends most of his time thinking about how friendless and lonely he is? Nice as a bit of background, perhaps, but I really don't care about Wallander's miserable life. Compared to a master, like the late EdMcBain, Mankell just doesn't manage the task of bringing his characters to life, of making them human.The result is not noir; it is not Raymond Chandler. It is just tedium.Jerry"},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"As a fan of the Kurt Wallander series, I found this the most current and thought-provoking novel. The twists and turns of the usual Mankell plot, with mysterious dead bodies, a killer Oriental, African location, World Bank corruption and a teenage hacker as a key figure---all these and more will make you stay up way past your bedtime. Trenchant commentary on the vulnerability of our electonics-dependant society woven into the novel heighten one's interest. Will the world's financial institutions be saved ormade impotent by a virus that destroys data? That's what is mean by the &#34;Firewall&#34; title in that the malevolent computer wall protects the button designed to destroy these world-wide institutions. A good and enlightening read."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"Fascinating plots and characters as is the case with all his books. Always a battle to put it down. Kurt Wallander a human being like you and me and not some super hero. Very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"If you liked Dogs of Riga then you are going to love Firewall. It truly is Mankell at his best. This novel casts Sweden as a dark and isolated land filled with morose individuals, not the least of which is Wallander. He is faced with two seemingly unrelated deaths. A brutal murder of a taxi driver and a loner who was found dead at an ATM.Facing middle age and an ever increasing loneliness Wallander is faced with numerous deceptions as he delves deeper and darker into a network of cybercriminals that stretches far beyond the borders of Sweden.Will Wallander escape unscathed or will this be his last adventure, will he finally find love or is he destined to live out his time in bitter loneliness?Whilst Wallander plays a brilliant role in this novel, Sweden is the true protagonist, unforgiving, bleak and filled with paranoia."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"This was every bit as exciting and intriguing as you'd expect from a Henning Mankell novel -- at least until the last 50 pages or so. At that point there were far too many plot holes, contrivances, and implausibilities (as well as a ridiculous number of loose ends) for me to enjoy the story. When Mankell writes about the dynamics between Wallander and his colleagues, it's every bit as fascinating as the crazy twists he feels compelled to throw around, and far more believable, but I guess he feels it necessary to go over the top plot-wise to satisfy his readers. Too bad. I skimmed the ending, and that's kind of a huge failure in a novel of this type. Still, the man knows how to write, plain and simple, so four stars because I'm sure I'll read another Wallander soon."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"I enjoy all of his books. I really like his character Kurt Wallander and the fact that it is set in Sweden."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"As Kurt Wallander ages out of detective work his struggles with diabetes, obesity and his lack of a personal life become a large part of the books, but not in an offensive way. This last book was fabulous from beginning to end. Mankell just keeps getting better as a story teller. The book is much bigger than just a cop book or a mystery, says a lot about the human experience. I am working my way through the English translations of these books, but if Wallander's health is any indication we are nearing the end of the saga. Pity."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"The book is a gripping mystery and a great character study of the main characters, as are all of these Wallander books.However, the copy editing for kindle in all the books of this series is much worse than any other Kindle edition book I have had. The other books have been nearly as letter perfect as the print editions but this series from The New Press (New York/London) is riddled with dozens of typographic errors, spelling errors, lapses of using diacritical marks and other copy issues."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"I've read every Henninig Mankell written and wish there were more coming. He is a superb crime writer and this one doesn't disappoint!"},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"Fans of the Wallander mysteries will enjoy the high tech suspense and seemingly unsolvable mysteries that abound in this current offering."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"With all the new technology and how the whole world id connected, this story really brings out just how complex and far reaching any crime might be. Mankell is amazing in the way he portrays each characters individual nuances and how they interrelate to create a fascinating story."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"Maybe it's not a coincidence that the best police procedural series since the Martin Beck series also comes from a Swedish author. These deliberate, dark novels are not to everyone's taste, but if you liked Martin Beck, you'll probably like Kurt Wallander.Firewall starts with two seemingly random events-- a reclusive computer expert drops dead in front of an ATM machine, and two teenage girls bludgeon and stab an elderly taxi driver to death. At first it seems that there couldn't possibly be any connection between the two, but the police investigation into the murder of the taxi driver is like kicking over an anthill. It seems as if a dozen incomprehensible things happen in rapid succession, including the killing of the prime suspect in the murder case. Inspector Kurt Wallander leads a dogged team of detectives in a search for the key to the baffling series of events, even though he has been accused of brutality toward a juvenile suspect and seems to be harboring a traitor among the cops on his team.These cops work long hours, drink endless cups of coffee, and stop for numberless hamburgers and pizzas. But they also have home lives, do their laundry, take care of their sick kids, and struggle with car repairs and getting their errands done. Wallander, a divorced man in his mid-50's with diabetes and an advanced case of loneliness, balances action with thought, not all of it pleasant or useful. His resemblance is Martin Beck is strong, but this cop and his colleagues operate without the black humor that made Sjoewall and Wahloo's novels so fascinating. If society looked hopeless in the 1970's, it looks much worse in the late 1990's, and Wallander and his fellow cops see enough brutality and senseless violence to make anyone a pessimist.The best thing is, however, that the story really works. After pages of relentless police work, including much attention to the efforts of a young hacker coopted to help the police break into a seemingly impregnable computer, the pieces start falling into place. The pace quickens, and the police keep getting closer, butWallander continues to make mistakes, not knowing how complicated the plot he is investigating really is. One realistic touch is that the book doesn't end with the climax, when the puzzle finally finds it solution. Instead, it meanders on for a bit to let the reader see the let-down at the end and the chance for Wallander to re-focus on his own life and priorities. The traitor on his team is still there. The mistrust of his superiors has not abated. But Wallander decides to continue to do his job because he hasn't any other option. It doesn't get much more real than that."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"What a relief it is to read a modern thriller/police procedural whose characters seem real. Mankell's protagonist, Swedish police officer Kurt Wallander, is not a super-hero who outwits and outfights legions of bad guys. Nor is he as phenomenally lucky as the heros in many American thrillers. Wallander, a dedicated cop, has a believable internal life. His real-world personal problems include loneliness, distance from his adult daughter, and a threat to his position from an ambitious younger officer. His horrendously long hours make him feel exhausted; he gets frustrated with baffling evidence and failed plans. Yet he persists in trying to understand the connections between the deaths he is investigating. Different pieces of the puzzle appear at well-paced intervals during the story. There are surprises that don't fit theories. The conspiracy that emerges turns out to reach far beyond local events. Though the chief villain gets nailed at the end of the book, Mankell does not wrap things up in a neat package. The threat is still out there.Subsidiary themes of the book include the vulnerability of our technological society, and resentment of the growing concentration of wealth. There are a few problems. Many of the Swedish names sound alike, making it difficult to separate some policemen and policewomen from others. Mankell's writing, translated from Swedish, sometimes produces short, choppy sentences. There is a peculiar fixation on checking the time. Nonetheless, this book rises far above most mysteries."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"Henning Mankell is one the finest mystery writers in the world. He understands plotting, the building of tension and the pacing of a story. In terms of craft, he is right up there with P.D. James. Mankell's talent as an author explains why a series of books about a gloomy, middle aged detective from a small town in Sweden has developed an international following.The one problem with such a strong writing talent is that it sometimes allows an author to camoflouge a weak and unbelievable plot line. Kurt Wallander is a detective in small town Sweden and yet he stumbles onto a conspiracy with world wide implications. The scale of this conspiracy is far too great for Wallander's provincial world. For this novel to work, it requires more than virtuoso writing. The scale of the crime must fit in the scale of the hero's world. This is a very well written crime novel but in the end, I found it unbelievable."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"When I read a thriller or crime story I do not expect much, but I do expect that the mysteries are unveiled, the riddles solved and everything makes some kind of sense in the end. Unfortunately this expectation remains unsatisfied by this book. The last chapter (40) is basically a record of all those questions that remain unanswered for eternity. It is fair to say that I feel cheated somehow, because all those parts were used throughout the book to keep my attention and were used to generate the thrill and suspense in the first place. Rarely felt so disappointed! (The story itself was not bad until chapter 40...)"},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"If you like police detective novels that have a dose of realism in plot and setting, the obsessions of Mankell's Inspector Wallander provide a fine antidote to the usual run of serial/maniacals. The mystery is composed of subplots that come together slowly until they quicken as the end nears. What drives the plot is a larger-than-life, computer-enhanced doomsday clock, but Wallander's family in and outside the office give a strong sense of the man who makes it all come together. The brooding and well-realized town where the story takes place seems like the home you always wanted to run away from."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"Swedish Inspector Kurt Wallander is back with another crime puzzle that demands that he use all his experience in police work as well as take chances, bend the police department rules a bit and depend on his own intuition. (Would he like the recently published book in the U. S. called BLINK I wonder?) Wallander is altogether likeable-- at least for me. He is bright, complex, vulverable and sensitive. He listens to \\"La Traviata\\" and Jussi Bjorling, misses the companionship of a woman, wishes he had a better relationship with his grown daughter and thinks a lot about his own mortality. At the age of 50, Wallander has no more life-altering decisions to make. And in a particularly poignant moment he thinks of an old friend who will soon be moving away. \\"Their friendship had come to an end. Or rather: they had finally discovered that it had ended a long time ago. . . Widen [his friend] was going to disappear from his life. Who was left who connected him to his earlier life? Soon there would be no one.\\" The inspector has hit on a melancholy universal truth that most of us will experience if live to see middle-age-- and all this coming from a police officer in a mystery story. Wallander behaves the way we expect from characters in literary novels; but that is essentially what we have here-- in addition to a story about betrayal, rape, murder, international intrigue, terrorists, computer hackers et al that is no engaging that you literally cannot put it down.The only thing cold about this thriller is the Swedish autumns."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"This was my first Wallender mystery and I am totally hooked. I absolutely couldn't put it down. The story flies along and the plot turns are so very interesting! Mankell really knows how to tell a mystery story; some details are important, others aren't, so that the reader is truly guessing the whole time. New twists and events pop up so quickly that (as I already said) it's hard to stop reading!The protagonist is a complex, intriguing, drinks a lot of coffee, mixes big-deal police incidents with getting his car fixed, etc. so that he seems very real.My only complaint, and maybe this is just Mankell's style, is that here we have a plot zipping along at a fast pace, and then you all of a sudden you're through the climax and the book's over. The End. Maybe I'm too accustomed to the Hollywood crescendo but the climax really caught me by surprise, left me saying &quot;that's it?&quot; Plot-wise it was pleasantly satisfying, wrapping up what needed to be, and was clever enough, lengthy denoument even, but it just could have used some extra buildup or suspense right at the end.Other than that...this is the best book I've read in awhile. Interesting, suspenseful, great techno thriller plot, complex characters. If you're looking for a new author here's one to try."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"There are two primary plot lines in Firewall--a potential crime and the personal life of Inspect Wallandar, the police lead on the case. Mankell's smooth writing allows the reader to keep pace with a detailed plot. The introduction of new characters into the story is always well timed, in that they continue to hold the reader's interest and are congruent with the the story line.Inspecter Wallandar is a very human police inspector, struggling with loneliness, job anxiety, and retirement at some point in the future. His reflections on his personal relationships and career transcend both age and nationality.The translation of this book from Swedish is appears to be seamless and is easy to understand with apparently no loss of local color. This is the first Inspector Wallandar book I have read, and is good enough to entice me to seek out the others."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"Wallender is a veteran detective operating in a small police department in a southern Swedish town. He has become world famous and is portrayed with brilliance by Kenneth Branagh on the PBS Masterpiece Mystery series.Firewall is one of the most intriguing page turners in the Wallender canon! A computer geek turns up dead at one of the twon's three ATM machines. Meanwhile a 19 and 14 year old girl murder an elderly cab driver with the use of a knife and a steel bar. How are the two incidents related?Detective Wallender is assigned to the cases. He is 50ish and longs for retirement. Wallender also deals with a feud with fellow detective Martinson and his love life is in shambles. Daughter Linda is a student in Stockholm; he does not see his ex-wife Mona. He longs to revive his romantic relationship with a Latvian widow he met and feel in love with in the novel \\"The Dogs of Riga.\\" During the telling of \\"Firewall\\" he will meet and be attracted to a new woman with lovely legs.Firewall refers to an access blocking computer wall preventing hackers from obtaining computer information. It also refers to the emotional firewall existing in Wallender's relationships. The novel travels from Angola where we meet the mysterious man who is at the head of an international plot to control the financial markets of the world.Firewall is set in a brooding, cold and atmospheric Sweden. It is long for a detective novel logging in at over 400 pages in the English translation by Ebba Segerberg. If all you know about Swedish detectives is derived from the Millennium series by Stieg Larsson you owe yourself a favor by reading Mankell's novels!"},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"It's true that while the invention of cyberspace has made the flesh-and-blood world more efficient -- no matter where you are geographically, as several of the characters in this novel point out, you're always in the center of the world -- it's also made people and their institutions much more vulnerable. The story opens with the sudden death at an ATM of someone who is deeply involved in a worldwide plot involving computer networks and large financial institutions. Then two teenage girls stab a taxicab driver to death -- for the money, they say, though there's a great deal more to it than that. This sounds confusing, and it is. I suspect Mankell is not entirely comfortable with computers himself because his depiction of a young hacker and of what Inspector Wallender and his cohorts observe on the monitor is pretty shaky. Still, it's a pretty good story. Wallender is still a lonely man, searching for a viable port in his personal storms, and is betrayed not only by a woman but by one of his subordinates, someone he had thought was a friend. He comes close several times to chucking the whole thing, from frustration and despondency, but then his daughter, Linda, gives him a new focus: She's going to the Police Academy, following in her father's footsteps. There's more than one sort of \\"firewall\\" in this story. Not bad, but not one of the author's stronger efforts."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"This is an excellent read.

Given the recent attack on a number of US Banks which appears to have come from Iran, which in fact created a major disruption for a number of employees where I work and its effects on their paychecks the story resonated with me.The book is fast paced and the seemingly unconnected crimes, red herrings and personalities contributed to that. As in all of Manakall's Wallander books, the sense society neither values the police or that the police themselves are all that sure if they are effective adds to the tension. The generational difference between police of the cyber-age and their older peers also helps build suspense. Office politics also play a role in this story that could be taken out of the headlines.A good lesson of how much we are at the mercy of our technology."},{"Title":"Firewall","review":"Fourth Hurt Wallander book I have have now finished.

This is not a fast read, but a great read. I like knowing the case from Wallender's perspective and find his character flawed yet endearing. Firewall is about coincidences and conclusions wrapped up in computer terrorism. I am as unknowledgeable as Wallender when it comes to technology, but was able to keep up with him and the elements of the mystery as it unfolded. Mankell doesn't force all of the pieces together and keeps suspense building.

We live in a small town; so, this is as close to riding a bus as my kids will get for a long time. Simple story with lots of opportunity for learning. Not that great on Kindle, but worth a buck."},{"Title":"Bus Stops","review":"This Taro Gomi book has a very simple, sparse narrative but the drawings are full of so much detail. We used the books as an opportunity for our 1-year-old (now 2) daughter to learn about structures (churches, bridges), different kinds of transportation, and people (clowns, business people, etc)."},{"Title":"Bus Stops","review":"The whole family loves this book. My son, who is almost a year old, has been pulling this specific book down from the shelves for many months now, and he clearly favors it above all the others. The artwork is beautiful, interesting, and colorful. Each spread has several different objects of interest, so you can ask your child to look for different things every time you read it together. Each spread also has a different palette featured, so it's a great book for teaching colors. One of the challenges with baby books is keeping the parents' interest, but this one does not get tired because there are so many interesting details to each spread. It's a classic!"},{"Title":"Bus Stops","review":"This book doesn't hold my two-year-old's attention. The colors in the book is dull and the story is boring. It asks the readers to find certain things, so it doesn't encourage speaking. The objects are printed small so it's hard to point at them."},{"Title":"Bus Stops","review":"This attractive and simple book offers lots to look and and lots to discover. Our son will not outgrow it for a long time -- right now he is interested in looking at the busses and cars. Soon he can join in the simple &quot;I Spy&quot; game that the book presents. He has yet to discover the beautiful colors and shapes, and interesting places and people. I highly recommend this book for 18 months to kindergarten age. Fun for parents, too!"},{"Title":"Bus Stops","review":"I frequently give this book as a baby gift, and get reports back that it always becomes the baby's top favorite book, the one they want to read everyday over and over - and since it's mostly a visual book that lets the child explore objects and places, and has art-quality illustrations, parents enjoy it too. Taro Gomi's books don't aggressively teach, but just let a small child wander slowly and curiously through the pages, noticing things of interest, always discovering new details."},{"Title":"Bus Stops","review":"This book is consistently one of my 16-month-old daughter's favorites. I am sure she'll learn to enjoy it even more as she learns more concepts like numbers, places and action verbs, but right now she's happy to point to the objects she recognizes in the very detailed illustrations and name them (ball, car, dog, kids, helicopter). I really enjoy the illustrations, too, so this is a book I'm always happy to read with her."},{"Title":"Bus Stops","review":"The pages of this book take up less than half the screen. I'm sure it won't hold my granddaughters attention. A disappointing purchase."},{"Title":"Bus Stops","review":"I bought this book for my son after seeing it in the library. I have a used board book version, which is in FANTASTIC condition. I find this book is EXTREMELY durable, and would recommend getting a used one if this is for your own child.My son was ONE when we purchased it, and loved it enough to ask for it every day for several months. Now he's almost 2.5, it was at the bottom of the pile for awhile, but now he loves it all over again. WE both love the colorful pictures, and there are cute things to look for, things that you may not notice the first few times you go through it. LIke the driver in one car has a somewhat angry expression, like he wants to run over the lady that is crossing the street. I think it's funny, it's not obvious and cruel, just something that as a grown up, you may notice, that flies over the child's head. Or like, on the hospital page, the patients are Green... get it? green, sick? Too cute! ANd one guy is wrapped up in bandages like a mummy from head to toe. Each page has things it asks you to point out. But you can easily find more things for the child to notice. My son just loves it. I think it is especially appealling to kids that like cars, trucks and busses. But girls will like it too... it's not full of those things, but there are enough of them in there. It is so colorful, and it's fun to ask the child to find an orange car, or a yellow house. There's even a little kitty cat wandering in the crowd on the marketplace page.This is a very sweet book for a child... I'd say from One - Four years old, but I have no doubt mine love it enough to thumb through it himself when he's older, or maybe it will be a book he learns to read from. Great overall, I'd say one of our top 10 books! It's my favorite book in the \\"it doesn't have a deep message, and doesn't rhyme\\" category."},{"Title":"Bus Stops","review":"We have many Taro Gomi books, in both English and Japanese. His graphics are always amazing, and this gem is at the top of the list. The English translation here is great (as opposed to the dreadful \\"Where's the Fish?\\"), and my child loves the story of the bus as is winds through town. Especially nice is the touch near the end, where WE get off the bus at our house, placing the child into the story, then the driver gets off the bus at the end. Cute and snappy, a work of art that will engage child and parent alike."},{"Title":"Bus Stops","review":"My daughter has loved this book since she was a year old. At 2.5 years she still loves seeing where the bus goes on its route, who gets off, who misses the bus...She loves to answer the simple questions on each page. (Parents can always ask different questions when they get bored). The text and pictures are just right for the pre-speaking to pre-school age child. There is something on every page to captivate even the youngest child yet, there are so many interesting little details that older children remain interested. And for parents, get this, the bus stops at a movie set and who's in the director's chair but Akira Kurosawa with his white hat and sunglasses. Oh and who's that bearded actor? Toshiro Mifune. No kidding. This book is THAT cool."},{"Title":"Bus Stops","review":"My 20-month old loves this book, and with good reason. It's a fantastic example of a book that can grow with a toddler; at first he was most interested in the buses, then started noticing the cars, moved onto the trees, and now loves all the little people. It's a sweet book, gentle in tone. My toddler will spend 15 minutes at a time reading this one with me."},{"Title":"Bus Stops","review":"The pictures are fun--different.

Thanks!"},{"Title":"Less Than Words Can Say","review":"According to Richard Mitchell, sloppy language makes sloppy thought possible. When it comes to sloppy language and to the sloppy thought that accompanies it, the education establishment is king. In this provocative book, therefore, Mitchell dissects the jargon-laden nonsense that passes for thought in America's schools by subjecting to his inimitable withering critique the letters, memos, speeches, and missives of those in charge of the life of the mind. The result is simultaneously alarming and enlightening -- alarming because instructors cannot give to their students the education they themselves do not have, and enlightening because it will teach the reader how better to use language and logic.This book is a primer on subjecting one's own writing and thought to careful scrutiny. From Mitchell, you will learn that if you pause to find the right word and do not go on until you have found the right word, you will know better not only what you do think, but what you should think. If you do not pause to find the right word, you will make it clear to those who do pay attention to your words that you are thoughtless and careless. In other words, you will learn to do to your own words what Mitchell does to those of the educationists. The lesson is invaluable."},{"Title":"Less Than Words Can Say","review":"I came into contact with Richard Mitchell's books when I was a college freshman in 1990, and it was one of the most eye-opening experiences of my life. I still re-read this one often-- I usually find that I've missed something; Mitchell's style, while quite humorous, is also quite dense--nary a wasted word will you see. It also goes into what's wrong with public education today as well. It's one of the most important books ever written."},{"Title":"Less Than Words Can Say","review":"More a book on philosophy and the nature of thought than the problems and trials of language, Mitchell has put together a remarkably thoughtful and well-planned book.He takes apart bad writing with skill and aplomb, but does so without exposing the bad writers to unnecessary, uneducational humiliation. Some would say he needs to lead with a gentler hand, but I think he does a good job of showing how poor language skills lead to poor thinking ability."},{"Title":"Less Than Words Can Say","review":"Through college and in the business world we are taught a thousand ways to write. Most of our lessons deal with the style of the reader/professor/boss. Unfortunately, these people have adapted to the same writing fallacies that plague the rest of the nation. This book addresses these common problems. The author explains the problem, gives us real life examples, and shows you how to avoid the problem in your writing. Additionally, the book is written in a witty sarcastic manner that is quite entertaining. The finished product is an entertaining book that actually teaches the reader something that they can use. I'd say it is a novel concept (pun intended)"},{"Title":"Less Than Words Can Say","review":"If ever there was a must read book, Mitchell's is it. Buy it. Give it to friends. But don't give this version. It appears to be a computer typset reproduction printed without regard for typography or presentation. Those of us who remember Mitchell recall that early on he beautifully handset \\"The Underground Grammarian\\" using loose type, one character at a time, for a letterpress. Then he migrated to a Macintosh that closely duplicated the beauty and ease of reading of the original.This bastardized version has long lines that are hard to read on large pages to reduce the cost.Oh, but buy the book any way you can. Find a used original. Print if from online. Or buy this version if you must. What he says is too important to miss, if you value society and the necessary exchange of ideas it requires. Just remember that the original presented clarity in a beautiful way."},{"Title":"Less Than Words Can Say","review":"The book began very slowly, but picked up speed and became more enjoyable with the chapter entitled \\"The Columbus Gap\\". In that chapter, that author discusses a current refrain in public education, which goes along the lines that we don't know how to fix the problem in education, and the public certainly shouldn't expect it for the wages teachers are being paid. Most people besides the educators themselves can see the fuzzy logic of that, but the book goes into numerous more similar logical conundrums. I liked what the author had to say and agree with it thoroughly. His main point was that the educational system has been dumb-down over the years in order to make people feel better about themselves rather than to instill real knowledge and learning. The biggest problem I had with this book is that the author belabored each point and example he gave ad nauseum. The book was fairly short at 224pp for the 3rd printing hardback, but without repetitious passages could easily have been forty pages shorter making for a more pleasant and quicker read.Yet what the author had to say was worth reading. Although I am sure this is not a book for the masses, it would be most beneficial to those in higher education, who are the least likely to read it, or if reading it paying attention to its premises, since it wholeheartedly disagrees with what they learned in getting their basic and advanced degrees in education. It is probably worth the time and price [it was for me] to judge its merits for yourself. Give it a try, but don't expect to finish it in one reading."},{"Title":"Less Than Words Can Say","review":"I first read Less Than Words Can Say in college, as a photocopied handout, and it changed the way I think about writing and language. It&rsquo;s brilliant. I&rsquo;m now an editor, and I wanted to buy a copy for a colleague, so I foolishly ignored the reviews here panning this edition of the book, and ordered it anyway. I ended up packing it up and sending it right back. I&rsquo;m honestly not a typography snob, but in this case the typography is so bad it distracts you from the text. They used single quotes (\`\` and '') instead of real quotation marks, and dashes instead of hyphens (&ldquo;young lady straying dryad&mdash;fashion through the surviving oaks&rdquo;), so you can&rsquo;t tell whether you&rsquo;re reading a hyphenated word or two separate clauses. I&rsquo;d rather read the online version at sourcetext.com, or even a photocopy of my old photocopy."},{"Title":"Less Than Words Can Say","review":"The Underground Grammarian picks up where Edwin Newman left off, lampooning abuses and abusers of the language. But he does more than ridicule; he delves into the reasons for the abuse. While his target is primarily the educational establishment, his insights apply more broadly.Mr. Mitchell also reminds us of the power and beauty of the language, when used well.It is a good read, although it can be infuriating."},{"Title":"Less Than Words Can Say","review":"A true classic on the importance of language usage. Getting hard to find since it been out of print for many years. If you are unfamiliar with it, it will surely change your view of speech, language and writing and open your eyes to learning. Not the easiest read although exceptionally well written and amusing. You will have to focus and keep your mind running at full capacity to absorb it all.

I'm sure it will help her see things in a brighter light."},{"Title":"Less Than Words Can Say","review":"Mitchell's book, like Ambrose Bierce's Devil's Dictionary, is satire. Likewise, Mitchell's book is both entertaining and cleverly written as well as one that hammers home the thesis that that inferior thinking begets inferior writing. Unfortunately, Mitchell also resembles Bierce in his unrelieved crankiness, a trait in authors that ought to be taken in small doses unless one positively enjoys the drawing of dark clouds over the sky."},{"Title":"Less Than Words Can Say","review":"Just reading the introduction to this work will have you laughing.

But, if you are at all interested in communications or good writing, I recommend this book strongly."},{"Title":"Less Than Words Can Say","review":"I picked up several books in the past few years trying to ease the pain I feel over the disgusting abuse of the English language I see everywhere around us...This book did not give me the answers I was looking for either. At least it is well written. It is entertaining with some flow and structure, but it ends up as political ranting. Yes I agree. The system is [messed]up, but the problem is somehow more fundamental than students' inability to spell correctly. What I would expect from an analysis of the subject is either to deal with the underlying political and cultural changes that created the [messed]up situation we are in, or a linguistic-cognitive analysis of the way, the mental process by which this [messed]up state manifests itself.This book came close, but it is not it. Too much politics (yet not enough,) many great examples not explored deep enough. Still, the evidence speaks for itself, the arguments are solid and the conclusions inescapable.Should you read this book? Most definitely. You can even find it in sharetext format.

He has taken what is generally a dry and unappetising subject and turned it into a feast for the senses. How many times has anyone said they picked up a management textbook and couldn't put it down? This is such a book. The subject is addressed through a narrative text where our hero, a recently graduated engineer driving a wreck of a car, is thrown in at the deep end in a factory that comes straight out of Heronomous Bosch. His road to salvation is paved by a secretive advisor who meets him in dark rooms and restaurants and tells him where to seek the holy grail of TQM. The book has a happy ending, but more importantly, by the end of the book you have assimilated the concepts of TQM and can talk sensibly about the subject with those pointy headed ones who seek to baffle you with science. This book is a must for any manager in a manufacturing environment and maybe for a few of us in service companies as well. It makes a good read too, even if you can't care less about quality."},{"Title":"One for the Gods: A Novel (Peter & Charlie Trilogy)","review":"After reading the first book of the Peter and Charlie trilogy I thought - finally a book about a gay long term relationship.

Can't there be a book about a gay long term relationship where the couple is faithful and happy with each other?"},{"Title":"One for the Gods: A Novel (Peter & Charlie Trilogy)","review":"I'm going to break one of my rules. Generally, if I like a book, I'll give it a good review to try and help create good buzz for the writer. But if I don't like a book, I will pass on doing a review. After all, who am I to try and railroad some poor struggling writer with my poison pen? Well, \\"One for the Gods\\" is long out of print and Gordon Merrick has been resting in his grave for 19 years. A negative review from me isn't going to hamper anyone's livelihood. The first installment of the Peter and Charlie trilogy, \\"The Lord Won't Mind,\\" was enthralling fiction. The second installment, \\"One for the Gods,\\" sadly misses the mark. After ten years of married life, Charlie and Peter are spending several months on the French Riviera on business ventures when Peter falls off the fidelity wagon and has an affair with a young Frenchman. When Charlie finds out, he goes a little berserk and their marriage is put to the test. He decides they should accept the offer of an American couple to join them on their yacht for a tour of the Greek Isles. Their romance is rekindled, but Charlie wants to change the nature of their relationship by opening it up to include liaisons with outside partners of both sexes. Peter makes this sacrifice to keep from losing Charlie, but that eventually backfires as well. Unfortunately Merrick has allowed his storytelling to sink to tawdriness. While the explicit sex in \\"The Lord Won't Mind\\" was essential to taking us into the world of discovery of young Peter and Charlie, in \\"One for the Gods\\" it serves no purpose but to transform the novel into cheap erotica. I hoped for the richness of the earlier installment, but was sadly disappointed."},{"Title":"One for the Gods: A Novel (Peter & Charlie Trilogy)","review":"Published in 1971, this novel is the second in a trilogy and was considered very racey for its time. On the front cover, Charles Busch describes it as \\"Outrageous, addictive, perversely sexual .... the closest thing gay people have to the fat juicy romance novels that housewives have been devouring for years.\\" Two Americans, Charlie, an artist and Peter an art dealer, are both about 30 and very much in a stable rlationship. The story follows them over one summer where they initially are holidaying in the south of France before joining Jack and Martha on a 60 foot yact to sale to Greece. In its favour Merrick has two very macho men portayed in a very healthy positive relationship which is not without its dramas and interesting side issues. Fatherhood, fidelity and jealousy figuring prominently as well as a number of vivid descriptions of sexual encounters. An interesting novel for its time of publication as gay people were starting to become more public about their sexuality."},{"Title":"One for the Gods: A Novel (Peter & Charlie Trilogy)","review":"Believe it or not, the other two books in this trilogy actually have strong supporting plots. This one I found lacking in plot, but you know what? I'm picky. Most people don't read Merrick for the plot. I do because it provides a nice build-up to the [love] scenes, which makes them pay off more. But if you want, skip ahead to the [love] because Merrick is in fine form as usual. Highlights include when Charlie and Peter \\"switch roles.\\" The plot may be lacking but the [love] souped up so it's still worth the money."},{"Title":"One for the Gods: A Novel (Peter & Charlie Trilogy)","review":"This story of Peter & Charlie's love relationship is just something I cannot get enough of. Maybe I hope to find this type of commitment and love for myself. Whatever the reason, I love these guys. I love Gordon Merrick for writing this series.I read this series when I was about 17 or 18 and to have these books back again, after over 30 years, is like finding long lost friends, for the first time, again.Gordon Merrick has such great writing style and really builds the characters, so that they become like Real People, whom you empathize with and feel like you know them as you read the book.I could NOT put this one down... I read it in 4 evenings before bed. Of course, they stayed with me throughout my days and will always be with me in my heart.May all the Peter & Charlies of the world, be blessed in all things.

That's why this story is so appealing to so many people."},{"Title":"One for the Gods: A Novel (Peter & Charlie Trilogy)","review":"Merrick's 2nd book in his Charlie and Peter trilogy is a fine centerpiece. It is transitional, bringing forward elements of the first book and introducing us to aspects that will be resolved in the final book (or chapter, if you will). We get introductions to new characters and begin to realize a new depth to Charlie and Peter's romance.Interestingly, One for the Gods also acts as a bit of psychotherapy for the Charlie character. We learn a great deal more about this beloved character and the layers are great and deep, and like an onion we get to peel them away.No, there is no clear resolution in this book as it is a transitional piece. However, and I mean a big &quot;however&quot;...a new development takes place in this book that got my blood boiling and made me angry as $#^% at Charlie. However I did tear immediately into the final book in the trilogy to discover how Merrick resolves the situation.I know that a story of two men in love with each other cannot be happy all the time, but !@#$%, I sure would love to see it happen a bit more easily than Merrick portrays it.... but then, I did read faster and faster to find out what happens next. So, grudgingly, I'll admit that rather than being critical, I have to say that the book delivers just what its author intended.Read and read some more. You'll love it. The story delivers and heaven knows that the love scenes read in context will more than have you happy while you turn the pages.

The book The Bermudez Triangle is a very realistic and exciting book about three best friends having a pre mid-life crisis. Nina, the ultra organized, straight a student, president of the student council committee and the glue that keeps the group from falling to pieces, goes to a pre college summer camp before their senior year and leaves Mel and Avery at home. While she is away, Avery, the wild party hopper, and Mel, the girl all the guys want, have a bunch of extra time to themselves. While Nina is busy at camp falling head over heels for Steve, Mel and Avery are at home getting much closer then any of them would have thought. Then, after going to a party and getting drunk, Mel and Avery have a sleepover that leads to a long kiss between them. They begin to date behind Nina's back.When Nina returns, she feels left out of the group. Like Mel and Avery have some sort of secret, which they do. Then, while shopping at the mall, Nina walks in on a very personal moment between Mel and Avery. Now, the secret is out of the closet. Of course, open-minded Nina is very happy for them. But there are still many long, hard struggles to come for all of them. Nina is not sure weather to stay with Steve, who lives on the other side of the country, or go out with cute, nice, Parker. Avery is worried about her audition for a big music college, and Mel is still trying to figure her out.This is a wonderful, lighthearted novel that I would recommend to any teenage girl. It is a realistic view of three girls and their struggles and triumphs on the path to womanhood. Although the road may be bumpy at times, as long as you have your true friends, you can get through the hardest of all things... growing up. I promise, you will not be able to put it down."},{"Title":"The Bermudez Triangle","review":"\\"In the first moment, Nina thought Avery was helping Mel with a necklace. Then she realized that Mel wasn't wearing one. Also, putting on or removing a necklace doesn't usually involve putting you lips on someone else's.\\" This excerpt is from the exciting book, The Bermudez Triangle, by Maureen Johnson.The book is about three best friends, Nina, the outgoing, responsible leader of the group, Mel, the shy one who attracts all the guys, and Avery, the partier, and what happens when they cross the line from friendship to love. The summer before senior year, Nina goes away to a summer program at Stanford where she meets and falls head over heels in love with her earth conscience west coast boyfriend, Steve. Without Nina, Avery and Mel are spending more and more time alone together. One night when Avery spends the night at Mel's house, they share a kiss. They soon begin to secretly date, not even telling Nina. When Nina returns home, she feels left out and excluded from her best friends, sensing that they are keeping something from her. She soon discovers their secret, and as happy as she is for them, can't help but feel partially depressed, as her friendship seems to be crumbling while she is having the same problems with her long distance relationship.The Bermudez Triangle is one of few books that I have read that I never wanted put down. It showed me the hardships that so many teenagers face and the ways that they deal with them. Not only was this book compelling, but it really made me think about the fact that true friendships can conquer anything, no matter what the circumstances are. It also showed me that true friends are hard to come by and will stick together no matter what.I definitely give this book five stars. It is unlike any book I have ever read. If you want to read a good book that you will never want to put down, I would definitely recommend The Bermudez Triangle!"},{"Title":"The Bermudez Triangle","review":"The Bermudez Triangle was the last of Maureen Johnson's five books that I read. I wish it had been the first, especially after it was challenged in Oklahoma.The story follows three best friends, Nina, Avery and Mel. Nina gets accepted into a university program and leaves for the entire summer. Nina obviously misses Avery and Mel, but she meets a boy named Steve who cares about the environment as much as she does, and she falls for him.While she is away, Avery and Mel work at a restaurant and spend most of their time together. Soon Avery and Mel discover there may be more-than-friends feelings between them and the development of their relationship happens gradually, like real life.When Nina returns, Avery and Mel are distant. Nina knows something in their friendships has shifted, or changed, but she is not sure what. She is shocked when she finds out (and not in the most appropriate way) that Avery and Mel are dating, and feels like she has to take sides when Avery and Mel break up.The whole book is a refreshing look at love that just kind of happens, and how friendships change when two people you're best friends with begin dating. Nothing is contrived, but instead the issues are examined with care, and a feeling of innocence and confusion from the characters.Readers will relate to the ups and downs of falling in and out of love and discovering who you are in the process. A must read."},{"Title":"The Bermudez Triangle","review":"The Bermudez Triangle is a compelling, poignant teen novel that engages the reader with the characters, plot, and emotion of the book.The Bermudez Triangle (I liked this title; it made me think of the Bermuda Triangle) centralizes around three high school best friends: Nina, an activist and the president of student council, who goes away for the summer for a college program; Avery, with her short hair and love of music; and Mel, the shy but adorable girl that guys always seem to go after.The summer finds one of these three best friends separated. Nina is off to a college program for the summer, and Mel and Avery work at P.J. Mortimer's as waitresses. Then, one day, Mel and Avery kiss, which complicates their relationship. They soon start \\"dating\\" and it is evident they are in love with each other. When Nina finds out, she is shocked, and she feels their friendship will no longer be the same.The Bermudez Triange takes us on a journey of heartbreak, loss, identity, friendship, and love. Nina, Mel, and Avery all have their fair share of problems, but their bond is enough to bring them together and help each other out. Other characters come into play as well, including Steve Carson, Nina's environmentalist boyfriend whom she meets at her summer program, and Parker, a waiter who works at P.J. Mortimers but who soon becomes involved in the girls' friendship.Maureen Johnson has done an excellent job with this novel. Not only is it an engaging page-turner, but The Bermudez Triangle makes readers sympathize and care for the characters. I felt I grew very close to each of the best friends, especially Nina. Sometimes the subject of sexual identity and homosexuality are written about so much that the topic starts to become tedious. But Maureen Johnson is not one of those tedious authors; she brings a fresh voice to the YA scene and approaches the subject of sexual identity in a sophisticated and mature way.The Bermudez Triangle is a pleasure to read. I found I couldn't stop turning the pages - the plot just flowed so nicely and the characters were so interesting. The Bermudez Triangle is definitely one of the finer YA novels out there.I also recommend Maureen Johnson's other book, The Key to the Golden Firebird."},{"Title":"The Bermudez Triangle","review":"Three girlfriends face major changes over the summer. One finds love at a leadership camp, and the other two share a kiss and embark on their own relationship. Lots of things to like about this book. I love that one girl is comfortable (thought awkward) with realizing she is gay, while another one is \\"questioning\\" big-time. They keep each other's secrets (in a good way). The scene where one unwittingly reveals something to a parent (and the parents' reaction to the news) is terrific. On the down side, It took me fully half the book to stop flipping to the back cover to remind myself which two were in the relationship. And which one worked where, and who got fired, and if Parker liked the gay one or the straight one and where that might go. Some of the conversations and insights (the emails, for example) were just too-too mature to come from the fingers of questioning teens. But all that being said, this book is easy to recommend to mid-teens and up, and I love the fact that no one is perfect, relationships change, people mess up, and then do their best to make it right."},{"Title":"The Bermudez Triangle","review":"I've read every Maureen Johnson book, I am proud to say. I always turn to her books or her blog when I'm feeling down, because her work is medicine for the soul. The Bermudez Triangle is one of the best Johnson books (right up there with Devilish and Suite Scarlett.) And, though I've read quite a few young adult LGBT novels, I would probably choose The Bermudez Triangle as my favorite if it came down to it. A few people have told me that they found it a bit average. I think The Bermudez Triangle is one of those books that came along at the right time in my life. And I want to talk about what struck me about it.And I'm sorry of this review is a bit stream-of-conscious.The thing I love most about Maureen Johnson novels is the atmosphere that she manages to invoke. The Bermudez Triangle, though, would get my vote for Most Atmospheric. And though it is labeled as an LGBT novel the true focus of the story is the friendship of three girls: Nina, Mel, and Avery.I love these girls. They were the kind of characters that became your friends through the course of the story. They had their own quirks, their own hopes and concerns and their own trials and tribulations to deal with. The descriptions of the world they live in are fresh and familiar. (The weird people you knew in high school? All of the issues big and small that consumed your world? They're all there.)The other character I came to love was the sweet and witty Parker. He was what tied the story together and put a bow on top.Now onto the book itself.The book goes through the course of a normal school year and is divided into section by holidays. (St. Patrick's Day, Halloween, Valentine's Day, etc.) The point of view rotates among Nina, Mel, and Avery who are each dealing with their own problems. Each girl provides a unique perspective of story events which is something that I love to find in a book.I can't really pinpoint a favorite part of the book since I love so much of it. Plus I wouldn't want to accidentally give anything away. I can say, though, that my copy is marked up with dozens of colorful annotation flags--these are mostly witty lines, which this book is chock full of.And despite what the description might suggest, it's not a teen melodrama. (This was the first impression I got.) It's also not a book that's trying too hard to be spectacular or glamorous. It's truthful, for lack of a better word, and that's what made me love it so much.This book has been challenged in a few places, which is a shame. I want to show my full support of The Bermudez Triangle with this review: not only does it belong in library and bookstore shelves, it belongs in your hands right now. Happy reading."},{"Title":"The Bermudez Triangle","review":"First, check out the 5/10/07 article from the Examiner-Enterprise from Bartlesville, OK about efforts to ban this book in local communities.My response: I can't claim to be shocked that this book was challenged, since it does deal with teenage girls questioning and discovering their sexuality, but as always I'm disappointed when people choose to bury their heads in the sand rather than accepting that people are different, and choosing to recognize a book that deals with real issues in a sensitive and realistic manner.I thought that Johnson approached her subject matter in an interesting way. Rather than just focusing on the one character who winds up coming out, and her struggle to come to terms with her own sexuality, Johnson sets her story within a group of 3 girls. When one of the girls goes away for the summer before their senior year of high school, the other two find themselves in a \\"more than friends\\" situation. Johnson sympathetically relates the story of any two people who try to negotiate going from being friends to having a romantic relationship, and possibly back again. Teenagers can definitely relate to this story, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. Added to that well-drawn story, Johnson also gives us the third girl in the triangle, who comes home from her summer away and finds herself in the middle of the complicated relationship of her two best friends, while at the same time dealing with issues surrounding her own new long-distance relationship.One criticism I have is that the characters weren't all that well-drawn. I had trouble at the beginning distinguishing the three main characters, and even after I could remember who was who, they all seemed a little fuzzy around the edges. None of the secondary characters were particularly clear either. In a book that is largely character driven, I wanted to get a better sense of the characters outside of the particular conflicts they were facing."},{"Title":"The Bermudez Triangle","review":"Consummate YA author Maureen Johnson is back, with a page-turning story of friendship amongst three high school students. When Nina Burmudez goes off to a college prep program for the summer, her best friends Mel and Avery discover they're gay...at least, they're into each other. For Mel, this is a realization that's been brewing, while Avery is less sure. Flush with the feeling of young love, they don't tell Mel until she accidentally discovers their passion when she gets back home. Soon rumors are flying around school and their once super-tight friendship triangle is being torn apart quickly. Meanwhile, Nina's ecofriendly boyfriend, Steve, who she met over the summer, is becoming increasingly distant. The group has to struggle to figure out what their friendship means and what they can forgive of each other.Johnson knows what she's doing when it comes to storytelling, and this is a summer pageturner (with a waterproof cover, even!) that also addresses social issues in ways that speak directly to teenagers. Mel's and Avery's differing reactions to their burgeoning love/lust for one another, grappling with both the intensity of their feelings and the realization that they are different from the norm, plus dealing with homophobia from classmates and family, are honest and forthright. They grapple with being new to falling so passionately in love and trying to keep their love a secret. Johnson shows that even when one has a strong sense of self, being the odd woman out is never easy. Johnson also explores how Mel's new status as a girl who likes girls affects Nina, who struggles to be understanding even as she becomes jealous of Mel and Avery's closeness. There's plenty of drama and conflict to keep you turning the pages, especially as Nina and Steve, not to mention Mel and Avery, start to have trouble in their relationships. Johnson's knack for detail and emotional honesty make this book one to treasure. It's sweet without being sappy and doesn't sugarcoat the real pain of adolescence, whether you're straight, gay, or not quite sure."},{"Title":"The Bermudez Triangle","review":"Nina, Avery and Mel have been best friends all of their lives. And now, for the first time, as Nina heads off to precollege camp in the summer after their junior year, they are going to be apart. But how much could happen in ten weeks? As it turns out, plenty. Nina falls in love with Steve, the eco-warrior down the hall. And while she is away, Mel has her first kiss, too - with Avery.This book is not as good as the other Maureen Johnson books. I consider Thirteen Little Blue Envelopes to be possibly the best teen novel ever, so I was kind of dissapointed in this book. The premise seemed a little Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants to me, but unlike those girls, we never really see how the girls mesh as friends. Even though they talk a lot about how close they are, and how much they care about each other, it's hard to see. The bond between them feels more - well, fictional - than actual. It's not a bad book. Mel's struggle to come to grips with her homosexuality, as well as Avery's to understand whether she's homosexual, bi, or just in love with her best friend are compelling. But Nina's relationship with Steve is predictable. And the book drags, and ends on a vague, undefined note that left me feeling vaguely unfulfilled."},{"Title":"The Bermudez Triangle","review":"\\"The Bermudez Triangle\\" is another great book by Maureen Johnson that will intrigue you and teach you. A group of girls, Nina, Mel, and Avery, form a strain in their friendship with the two latter girls form a sexual and romantic relationship while the first is away for the summer.Returning home to find a different twist to the friendships, Nina becomes swamped in school work, working to get into the same college as a boy she met over the summer. When Avery becomes confused over her sexuality and relationship with Mel, the group of girls begin to find more seams.A story about love and friendship, Johnson creates three unique characters that come together when searching for the similar things for themselves. While Johnson clearly has a knack for writing and creativity, the novel, however, is a bit on the long side and at times can feel too immature as Johnson details the girls' physical appearances rather than leaving their looks to the reader's imagination. I found myself skipping over much of the scenarios with Nina and her boyfriend along with the slow ending, but otherwise it's a compelling read."},{"Title":"The Bermudez Triangle","review":"When I first cracked open Maureen Johnson's \\"The Bermudez Triangle\\" I was worried that I was in for a lame \\"Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\\" knockoff. I suppose it helps to actually read the flap description before reading a book.The Bermudez Triangle centers around three best friends: Nina Bermudez, class president and born leader, Avery Dekker, a grungy and sarcastic rocker, and Melanie Forrest, the sweet and shy girl guys can't help but crush on. Up until this point, the girls have been inseperable, however, when Nina goes away for the summer to a leadership camp, changes begin to take place within the triangle. Three very different girls with different interests and priorities. Oh no. Can their friendship survive? On the surface it sounds tired and overused, and yet Johnson manages to breathe enough life into this YA Fiction cliche to produce an immensely enjoyable book. The characters are very likeable yet believable, and Johnson keeps her readers hooked with a fun and fluid style. Most importantly, \\"The Bermudez Triangle\\" confronts the topic of sexual identity from several perspectives, an issue that many teens encounter firsthand.Maureen Johnson's \\"The Bermudez Triangle\\" is a fun, endearing, and important read that beautifully illustrates the struggles and confusion of friendship, identity, and growing up. Johnson is a very talented writer and I will be eagerly waiting for future releases by her."},{"Title":"The Bermudez Triangle","review":"I remember reading this book a couple years ago. Liked it back then, and still love it. Since i ordered it i was waiting impatienly for it to arrive. It came just on time, the exact date it said it was going to be delivered. I finished the book within two days. It's a good book, and it'll get there right on time."},{"Title":"The Bermudez Triangle","review":"I liked this. Quick read, teenage drama that felt real. Well-developed and relateable characters, believable plot. Nice distraction for an evening."},{"Title":"The Bermudez Triangle","review":"As one of the only YA readers who did not adore 13 Little Blue Envelopes (the first book I read of Maureen Johnson's), but being a big fan of Johnson's public persona, I wanted to give her fiction another shot. So I borrowed The Bermudez Triangle and The Keys to the Golden Firebird from the library. I will review Firebird separately, but I absolutely loved The Bermudez Triangle.The topic isn't necessarily earth shattering (my fingers want to type that it IS...) but it's not done often, and it's not done in this manner. How was it done? With love, conviction and hilariousness. This review is difficult to write, and I think it's because this fiction could be so real. I just don't really know what to write without ruining it for the reader, but I think The Bermudez Triangle is timely, relevant, and yet just funny enough to keep it light when it could be preachy. It's not, it's perfect and I love this book.Apologies for the lack of detail, but I really believe this book is best read without much guidance; it's likely to be the cause of personal reactions in many different directions, so I implore any YA lover to read it themselves The Bermudez Triangle is not the type of book someone can enjoy (or not) based upon the reviews of others. =)"},{"Title":"The Bermudez Triangle","review":"The book is great--I love the story and my fav. character is Mel. I wasn't a huge fan of the splash proof cover, but whatever. :)"},{"Title":"The Bermudez Triangle","review":"After reading 13 Little Blue Envelopes and The Last Blue Envelope by Maureen Johnson, then being thrilled by her newest novel, The Name of the Star (not to be confused with her pal John Green's novel, The Fault in our Stars), I decided to pick up some of her other works, which lead me to The Bermudez Triangle.The story begins with three friends going out for dinner, simple enough. It's the last time they will all be together until Nina, returns from her summer course at Stanford--Avery and Mel will be staying at home, working.The bulk of the story really centers around relationships - from Nina and Steve, Avery and Mel to Nina, Avery and Mel, each relationship is different and complicated and I thought that Maureen managed to capture the emotions of each of her characters with perfection. As a reader, I felt the butterflies when Steve admits that he's been trying to get Nina to notice him, the hesitance as Avery tries not to put labels to her relationship with Mel, the betrayal that Nina feels in the changing room when she walks in on Mel and Avery kissing, and so much more.The great thing about this story is that it explores the fact that relationships can be messy. It doesn't necessarily tie things up in a neat bow, but it explores the complexity of friendships, dating relationships, and even a bit of family dynamics - all in a very realistic manner.The one flaw for me was that the story dragged a little in the middle, however, the relationships kept me intrigued enough to push through."},{"Title":"The Bermudez Triangle","review":"This is realistic fiction in the purest of forms. The story follows three friends all trying to figure out something: love, sexuality, identity, commitment, friendship, their future... This is as teenagery as you can get. I really enjoyed how the narrative switches between point of views so you can see how each is dealing (though I wish the switches were marked better... Sometimes it was hard to figure out for a second). I also wish that more of Avery's POV had been included because she did a couple things that I still don't understand (though teenagers tend to do things that no one, even themselves, understand)."},{"Title":"The Bermudez Triangle","review":"Avery, Mel, and Nina have been friends - best friends - for what seems (and feels) like forever. Together the three can get through anything. So when their faced with the reality that the Bermudez Triangle will be broken for the first time, they know it will be hard, but not unbearable. Afterall, Nina's pre-college courses at Stanford aren't forever. A summer apart won't change them. Or it will it.With Nina is California, Avery and Mel find themselves, not only working at a local (grimy) restaurant, but spending even more time with one another. Their relationship is changing, yet the two don't even realize it until the morning after a party where innocent Mel wakes up hung over, and finds herself in a romantic lip-lock with her best friend - Avery. Mel has always questioned her sexuality, but at that point, Avery's kiss sealed the deal; there was no more questioning. Summer may have been ending if a few short months, but the relationship between them is in full bloom - a relationship they aren't sure of how to tell Nina about.Finally home, and practically settled in, Nina knows in her heart of hearts that Avery and Mel are hiding something. What used to be so naturally comfortable is suddenly awkward and forced. Until the day she finds Avery and Mel in a store's fitting room, making out. Can the Bermudez triangle moved past this? Or will it shatter and break?The Bermudez Triangle written by Maureen Johnson isn't just about how the lives of three friends drastically change. It's a story about growth and acceptance. The story is easy to follow, and easy to get drawn into from the first page on. Johnson's writing is open, honest, and as realistic as any work of fiction could get. The attitudes and emotions are vivid, raw, and real. She has not only crafted a well written story, she has crafted a believable one.The Bermudez Triangle is very much character driven. Not only do Avery, Mel, and Nina - the books main characters - drive the plot, but also the secondary characters. Parker for instance. He's lovable, genuine, and the kind of guy every teenage girl wants to fall for. Readers will not be able to avoid seeing the characters as real people who are simply struggling to understand and deal with declining relationships, chaotic school schedules, and absentee boyfriends, all issues in which many teenagers have to face and live through."},{"Title":"The Bermudez Triangle","review":"I have read a few of Maureen Johnson's books in the past, but none of them have really stood out for me. None of them have been really fantastic... they've landed somewhere between okay and good. But The Bermudez Triangle was better than all of her other books. The Bermudez Triangle was fantastic. It's realistic, and relateable.There was a time in my life when I was curious about what love really is. I knew that I loved my best friend... but I was so confused about what type of love it was. That's basically what this book is about... love, and the many different forms it comes in. This book kept me riveted from the very beginning, and it is definitely one that will put Maureen Johnson on my list of favorite authors."},{"Title":"The Bermudez Triangle","review":"Johnson, Maureen.

She is so determined and vocal about the craziness and stupidity of censoring books (a librarian's dream author!). But hey, maybe having a challenged book will get more people interested in her writing. I really enjoyed all of the characters in this book. They were all so well developed and unique from one another. Johnson also does a great job making this title void of the generalized stereotypes that can be found in other books dealing with homosexuality."},{"Title":"The Bermudez Triangle","review":"The book The Bermudez Triangle gives us a look at the life of a group of friends that face some problems on their way to finishing highschool. The three best friends Nina the leader of the group, and the one who already knows what she wants to do with her future, Avery the one who gets drunk and goes to parties all night, and Melanie(Mel) is the shy one who hass all the guys attention pointed her way.

While she was gone something happened between Mel and Avery. Something you would never believe!! When Nina got back from her camp, she felt discluded from the triangle of friends. It seemed that Avery and Mel only wanted to be together.When Nina finds why Mel and Avery always wanted to be together she goes on to shock. The way she found out also pushed her down and didn't make her feel any better. When she sees that Mel and Avery are kissing in a dressing room she runs out of the mall and starts crying. When something happens between Mel and Avery, Mel startss to reolize that she is indeed a lesbian, and when people find out and start teasing her she just keeps her head up high.

When Nina reolizes that Mel needs some help she decides to help her out and takes her out to some gay parties.While helping Mel out she befriends one of Mel's guy friends Parker. While Nina has been attempting to reach Steve he fianlly calls and tells her he has found someone else, and that they were breaking up. When she told Parker about this it brought them alot closer together. When Parker starts to fall for Nina, he feels that he must tell her how he feels, but when he does things don't turn out how they seem.

I first read The Key to the Golden Firebird and really liked it. Then I got 13 Little Blue Envelopes, and I never caught on to it so it left to the library unfinished, then Girl At Sea, which I absolutely loved, as you can see here. I then got Devilish, and like with 13 Little Blue Envelopes, it never caught on and went back to the library unread. So, I really didn't know about this book, but, as you can already tell, I finished it, so that's got to say something, right?The Bermudez Triangle, started off kind of slow, then it sort of sped up, but not really. Then it slowed down again and never picked up. Generally, this book was not exciting at all. It was slow, very slow, and boring in a few parts. But, but . . . it was interesting enough to keep reading and to know that it was a pretty good read.The characters were very well-rounded and fit distinquished individuals. The book and the format of the novel were put together well and it was easy to follow through the story and it was fairly enjoyable.Johnson's writing was flawed, but it was readable (Jeez, I hate that word! Why do I use it?). I didn't much enjoy the point of view, I wouldn've most rather it have been from first person through alternating chapters.Okay, in all, this novel was good, not great, and it could've definitely been much better.

But after flipping through it I saw lots of things that sounded good to try. And almost every recipe so far has been a huge hit with my 18 month old son. This is amazing to me because I thought he was picky. I guess I just wasn't giving him the kind of foods he likes. This book is, as other critics have noted, NOT sugar free. Fruit juice is a sugar. But I do not consider this a drawback because I think that people who don't eat any sugar of any kind are kidding themselves. The key is to use healthy forms of sugar and not too much. The main reason I was anxious to try these recipes is that nearly all of them use whole-wheat flour or some other whole grain flour and I am a big believer in using whole grains. So nutritious and full of fiber. Best recipes so far that I can highly recommend: Orange-date snack cake, Pilgrim pancakes, and Toddler date bread stix. The Coconut Pineapple cookies, however, were not very good. They were not even remotely sweet enough and were more like a pancake than a cookie. But I heated them up and buttered them and my son ate them for breakfast! So really, what it comes down to is that toddlers DO like these recipes. My son prefers them over the white flour, preservative laced stuff from the store. You can't protect your kids from sugar their whole lives, so give them a healthy alternative."},{"Title":"Sugar-Free Toddlers: Over 100 Recipes","review":"My 15-month-old loves the Applesauce-Raisin Muffins, and they were even a hit with my husband!

I may try these recipes using pasteurized egg-substitute in some cases, but the book should probably be revised to say something about that.Besides that one complaint, I'm very pleased with this cookbook and looking forward to making more healthy snacks for my son!"},{"Title":"Sugar-Free Toddlers: Over 100 Recipes","review":"This is a good, easy-to-follow jumping off point for parents and teachers searching for natural alternatives to all the processed, sugar laden foods out there.

I couldn't actually come across many actual sugar-free recipes at all.Ok, sure, maybe apple juice concentrate is somewhat better than pure refined sugar, barely.Also, the ratings are useless because of the author's lack of understanding that sugar is sugar is sugar, be it fructose or glucose. In fact, interestingly enough, she talks about how bad fructose is THEN PROCEEDS to use it in most of her recipes in one form or another.How about some recipes with unsweeted apple sauce or something like that?

It's my favorite recipe book for baking with and for my toddler. Some of the recipes have been disappointing, though (because they taste rather bland), but some are really good. My suggestion would be to start these before your child ever tastes table sugar, and then they'd probably all taste good. The pumpkin muffins, called \\"Peter's Favorite Mini Muffins\\" are my 3 yr. old son's favorite. He'll eat 5 or more in a day, if I don't pay attention. I've found that they act like a laxative if he eats more than a couple. The handy thing is that we've substituted all kinds of ingredients (apple sauce combined with any fruit juice for the apple juice concentrate, other fruits for the raisins, etc.) and they still turn out great!

I own hundreds of cookbooks and have never actually hated one until now. First, the majority of these recipes are made with fruit concentrate. In my book, that is still sugar, just under a different name. Fruit concentrate isn't even good for you. In the process of concetrating this fruit they strip it of everything before adding things back, so it is quite processed, even though it says 100% juice. Also, fruit concentrate still has all the same effects on your body that sugar does. I prefer using Agave Nectar in recipes for a sweetner if I have to use one because it doesn't give my 2 year old a sugar rush.

Thanks for the feedback!Susan Watson"},{"Title":"Sugar-Free Toddlers: Over 100 Recipes","review":"It feels so good to be able to bake more natural treats for my kids!!"},{"Title":"Sugar-Free Toddlers: Over 100 Recipes","review":"I found this cookbook to be a good resource for creating sugar free recipes for toddlers. Even my 7 year old enjoyed the snacks! I'm always on the look-out for ways to serve healthy food to my children especially without refined sugar and chemicals. The cheesy griddle cakes are fantastic and my toddler loves them! However, some recipes were not as big a hit, such as the zuchinni pancakes."},{"Title":"Brief History of Tomorrow","review":"Beginning with a history of the last few hundred years attempts at predicting the future, the successes and failures. The failure to predict feminism, inroads against racism and homophobia. The predictions of moon/Mars colonisation and flying cars among others. Then an overview of recent and current predictions for the future, how accurate they are likely to be in light of the history of futurism.There are chapters on 'the way we weren't', 'is futurology bunk?', 'environment', 'human body', 'mind', 'home and work', 'leisure', 'travel' and a conclusion. This covers the key areas for futurism. The author makes the point that predicting the future is always fraught with peril because so many movements, ideas and inventions have come out of nowhere eg. electricity, feminism, theory of relativity, quantum theory, the internet etc.It is generally an optimistic book despite the facts mentioned that the gap between the rich and poor is increasing and the large amount of people living close to starvation, he assumes that technological fixes will reduce hunger. There isn't much faith in the majority consensus of climate scientists that global warming is a serious problem, I assume he hasn't read enough of the relevant information. The author comes close to endorsing the views of Fukuyama that capitalism is the complete social system that the human race has been heading towards, but he is too realistic to totally endorse these views. There is a lot of interest, but for sheer futuristic leaps of imagination it doesn't quite match ' Great Mambo Chicken And The Transhuman Condition' by Ed Regis. However there are some important points made, the entertainment is kept at a premium and there is plenty of food for thought."},{"Title":"Brief History of Tomorrow","review":"This is a real dark horse of a book. It seemed kind of slim and I wasn't expecting much, but, wow! Not only is it extremely well-researched, but it's beautifully written, and has real wisdom. I can't agree with the reviewer who criticized it as rambling. On the contrary, it's taut and focused, quite brilliant at times, especially (and I also disagree with the previous critic here) when Margolis deals with environmental matters. I work in this field, and I think Margolis's is one of the fairest, most balanced and wisest assessments I've come across. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a serious book about the future that's not a geeky bore."},{"Title":"Brief History of Tomorrow","review":"I've read quite a few of the current crop of pop futurology, and this is definitely one of the best. Instead of the empty hype and hot air I've often found elsewhere, this is a surprisingly sensible, well-researched survey of the major themes of 21st century technology: biotech, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, etc. And unlike many other books in the genre, it also takes into account economics, politics, and the unpredictabilty of human nature -- something of a blind spot even for giants such as Arthur C. Clarke. My only criticism is a lack of discussion of how all these various trends might combine (for instance, it would seem obligatory to include a critique of Vinge's singularity theory). Otherwise though, top-notch."}]`),S={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],E={key:0},M={key:1};function P(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=f("PoemCard");return t(),o("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",D,[(t(!0),o(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,w)=>(t(),b(m,{key:w,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),o("span",M,"Loading...")):(t(),o("span",E,"See more"))],8,x)):p("",!0)])}const F=u(S,[["render",P],["__scopeId","data-v-eee9fa77"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/37.md","filePath":"guide/37.md"}'),j={name:"guide/37.md"},L=Object.assign(j,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(F)]))}});export{G as __pageData,L as default};
