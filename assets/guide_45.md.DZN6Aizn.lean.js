Jake Barnes is an American ex-soldier now working as a journalist in Paris. His days are spent at the typewriter diligently working, and much of the night is spent walking from bar to bar to caf&eacute;, enjoying the scenery and drinking copious amounts of alcohol. Jake's friend Robert Cohn is an apparently successful writer of novels but inside he longs to really live life. He longs to experience life as truly 'real.' According the Jake the problem with Cohn is that he only knows life from books. Now Cohn has read the \\"intensely romantic\\" book _The Purple Land_ and wants to go to South America because he is convinced that he will finally 'be alive' there. He wants Jake to come with him. Jake refuses and suggests, as an alternative, that Cohn come with him and his friend Bill Gordon on their annual trip to Pamplona in Spain. They will first spend a week fishing and then enjoy the fiesta for another week. Cohn agrees to come. Mean while Jake has run into Brett Ashley, an attractive, passionate woman who he has known since the war. Jake has a friendly but unhappy relationship with Brett as he cannot find a way to fully express his love for her. On hearing about the planned trip to Spain Brett asks if she and her current fianc&eacute; Michael can come too. Jack agrees. Mean while, however, Britt has a brief romantic liaison with Cohn. Despite this seemingly explosive web of relationships the partly sets out for Spain.Writing after the Second World War the Existentialist philosophers stressed the need for man to live 'authentically,' that is, not lying to oneself, not sleepwalking through life without truly experiencing it. _Fiesta_ in many ways prefigures those philosophic arguments. Who in the story truly lives, at least for a while? When is Jake most truly authentic? Closely allied with this theme of authenticity is the topic of triviality. How many drunken conversation can these characters, or the reader, stand? The first quarter of this book, while the characters are still in Paris, in fact becomes boring, but Hemingway has deliberately written it this way in order to make his point. During the crazy time of the fiesta the book truly takes off and it is easy to see how this story in many ways inspired the now booming tourist trade in Pamplona. Hemingway has vividly portrayed each of his characters, but the reader must ask himself do any of them change or grow? Why, or why not?This book was first published in 1927 and is Hemingway's first novel. It has been critically studied in some depth and acclaimed to a fair degree. If you enjoy reading this book you may also like his later works A Farewell To Arms (1929) and For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940). In 1954 Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"It's tough to say anything bad about this a classic, always included in \\"Best Novels of the 20th Century\\" lists. The story is about a group of partying American ex-patriots living in Paris, and their weeklong sojourn to Spain. It's full of drunkenness, love triangles and assorted debauchery. But the strength of the novel is the style. Although the book was originally published in 1926, it still feels fresh. Sure, some of the language and details are dated, but it's hard to miss how much Hemingway's style influenced modern writing. It's sharp and insightful, with crisp dialogue and characters that are all relatable in one way or another. While I wouldn't put it on my list of favorite books, the style alone is worth the read."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"A meandering novel with many meaningless conversations that really don't amount to very much. There were a few high-lights - the bull-fighting scenes towards the end were, I suppose, vintage Hemingway. Also the setting at the fishing village (or vacation spot) had the beginnings of some introspection, but was not taken very far. The first one hundred pages in Paris were repetitive and bland."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is Hemingway's first novel. It has some first novel problems, namely issues with structure in certain places. There are digressions that really aren't that important, and as hard as the author tries to understate matters, some things are beaten into your head and other details, important details, are surprisingly easy to miss.But the thing that makes this so complicated to review is the characters' overt anti-Semitism and utter unlikeability. One wonders if this combination of being unlikeable and also anti-Semitic is some accident, or if Hemingway really wanted to make clear that the only characters with even the vaguest sense of honor in the book are Jake, who tolerates the Jewish character, Cohn, and Cohn himself. At some point, Brett even points out that the rest of the characters are even worse than Cohn despite them making so many digs at his religious background. One wonders why Cohn even wanted to associate himself with this crowd.But one wonders even more which side of the fence Hemingway came down on. The novel is based on his own real-life experiences of a trip to Pamplona, so we have to wonder which of the characters really reflects him. Did he hate Jews, and doesn't realise how unlikeable and hateful his characters are, or are they a means to show the inherent contradictions of the idle aristocrats of the 20s expat community? One wonders indeed, and it is quite uncomfortable for a modern person to be left wondering along these lines.That said, the writing quality is excellent and is in the typical no-nonsense Hemingway style, but this can be a very emotionally complicated book to read, especially for a Jewish person. Read it because it's one of those books one ought to read, but don't read it expecting to really enjoy it."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Reading this novel was like taking an extended vacation back in time, to France and Spain. Though it is written like a detailed diary in a stream of consciousness style, it felt as if I was with the group of Americans and British who ventured from the artsy and partying of Paris in the 1920s on a road trip to Spain. And like being with a group on vacation, the story can at times test your patience. However, I found myself feeling as if I was experiencing the sensations, emotions, sights, smells, as if I was really with them.There is more to the story than travel though; as the drama and sexual tension of the characters - who are in their 20s and 30s - makes for unpredictable swings from one scene to the next. Told from the point of view of the American journalist character, Jake Barnes, the characters and settings seem unsettlingly real, and the travel journey gives way to the ups and downs of their individual journeys through life."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is the book that made Hemingway well known and it reminds me why classics are so enduring,Writing, character develpment, story telling. Highly recommend it to introduce Hemingway and a reread for those who want to experience again his great talent."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I will not review the book as there are excellent reviews on the internet. However, I would give 0 stars for the Publishers, Arrow Books.The front cover has a photograph of a man and a woman dancing. The woman is obviously meant to be Brett but the male could be one of many men Brett is associated with. What irritates me most is that an important description about Brett is her androgynous, boyish hairstyle and her alluringly attractive nature. The blurred photograph of this edition would seem to show a woman with a full head of hair and as most of her face is in shadow, hardly a captivating sexually appealing woman.Their back cover description reads:\\"Jake is wildly in love with Brett Ashley,aristocratic and irresistibly beautiful, but with an abandoned, sensuous nature that she cannot change. \\" Ok so far but then \\"When the couple drifts to Spain to the dazzle of the fiesta and the heady atmosphere of the bullfight, their affair is strained by new passions, new jealousies, and Jake must finally learn that he will never possess the woman he loves.\\"Warning spoilers.Brett arrives in Spain sometime after Jake and with her fiance, Michael with whom she shares a bedroom. Brett then has an affair with a bullfighter, Pedro. Hardly the series of events indicated by the publisher's precis.Arrow Books did not have to do much to produce this edition but the very little they did do in providing a front cover photograph and short narrative outline on the back cover was incompetent and showed no insight into one of the 20th Century Classics."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is the 3rd Hemingway novel I have read. The first one, Farewell to Arms, I read in high school, and never finished. The second, Old Man and the Sea, I read in college after visiting Cuba, and loved it.The Sun Also Rises falls somewhere in the middle between the two. I love Hemingway's style of writing, and the personal tone...you really feel like you are getting a glimpse into Hemingway's psyche. I have grown to like his concise writing style, it makes me work harder as a reader, and I appreciate that. I love that he gives very little description in regards to what any of the characters look like (except for Lady Brett Ashley's short hair), so an image is formed in my mind based entirely on their actions.Like some of his other books, It is easy to tell what Hemingway's true passions are...I found the sections on fishing in the Pyrenees, the running of the bulls and bullfighting in Pamplona to be the most descriptive and interesting part of the novel."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I enjoyed a well written book which had strong character definition and very detailed description of scenes.You almost felt as though you were in some of the places.

There are no real outstanding or shocking events in the book. It's just a narrative of a normal excursion. This book is not for everybody, many would find it extremely dull. But if you look closely, you see the underlying themes of a struggle for purpose in Post World War 1 europe. It's a pretty good book. I do think it's slightly overrated though."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemingway - Initially, the story and character development seems slow and my wife wanted to stop (too boring). However, things do progress and become more interesting as the story advances. By the second half, it becomes an enjoyable travelogue of bohemian entertainment, drinking and conversation. There is a lot of drinking (hey, its Europe in 1924). The best parts are his descriptions of the bullfighters and bullfighting. Really masterful. 8 out of 10William Hurt - could have been better. Some characters sounded the same, making it confusing to follow the storyline. 4 out of 10"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I've read Ernest Hemingway's THE SUN ALSO RISES a couple of times. After finishing The Paris Wife by Paula McLain my fellow book club members wanted to know more about Ernest and Hadley's life among the \\"Lost Generation,\\" so we agreed to read Hemingway's novel about that period to see if more details were available. Yes, there are more details but no, they're not particularly interesting.THE SUN ALSO RISES was Hemingway's first successful book. It's no secret that the hero, Jake Barnes, was Hemingway's portrayal of himself. He never attempted to hide that or the identities of the friends he and Hadley consorted with as he depicted them in the book. Several became ex-friends after the book was published. Hadley, the love of his life for a while, was never even mentioned in the book although several other women had prominent parts in his narration. Lady Brett was patterned after a woman who was prominent in Ernest and Hadley's life, perhaps more prominent than Hadley suspected. Hemingway eventually had the good sense to dedicate the novel to Hadley, realizing her displeasure at her omission.The book is a record of the meanderings of friends without much to do except ramble around, drink heavily, squabble with each other, eat a lot, and attend bull fights. There's not much chicken on those bones. It's a novel that comes across as stodgy and outdated, with the narrative somewhat unrealistic. It's not likely that the worldly characters Hemingway portrays would eschew the use of profanity in real life, although I can't recall a single cuss word being spoken in the book, even during insults and the administration of drunken beatings.The question, therefore, is what has the book got going for it? Most emphatically, one has to say, it's got Hemingway's nonpareil writing skills. People aspiring to be writers can only drool at his ability to forego the use of adjectives while implanting a vivid scene in his readers' minds. As an example, I offer Hemingway's description of arriving at Pamplona by car: \\"...there were trees along both sides of the road, and a stream and ripe fields of grain, and the road went on, very white and straight ahead, and then lifted to a little rise, and off on the left was a hill with an old castle, with buildings close around it and a field of grain going right up to the walls and shifting in the wind.\\"As a reader, one forges ahead breathlessly through mundane plot and archaic conversation to delight in spare and magnificent word craft. And so it is with most of Hemingway's works. What they lack in plausibility and timeliness is more than made up for in the utility and beauty of their prose.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I read this book anticipating Hemingway's sparse, minimalist use of language, but I quickly became disenchanted with the style. It may have been innovative in its time, and such a sere but straightforward use of the language may be appropriate for other subjects (I'm thinking of The Old Man And The Sea), but in this instance I found it simply impoverished and, oddly, pedantic."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I had to take a break from reading Joyce'sFinnegans Wakeso I figured Hemingway's 'The Sun Also Rises' would be an appropriately light antididonai for the heavy soup of Joyce. I think I liked The Sun Also Rises' just slightly more thanA Farewell To Arms. I thought both novels were near masterpieces, but I appreciated the characters in this novel just slightly more than those in Hemingway's next novel. Brett and Jake are amazing characters. The setting and the action of this corrida of a novel were perfectly timed and beautifully executed."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"\\"Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton. Do not think that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it meant a lot to Cohn...\\"With these words - which immediately give us a narrator with attitude - Ernest Hemingway begins his first big novel, published in 1926. This novel perfectly evokes the twenties. It is a portrait of a group of British and American expatriates enjoying the caf&eacute; scene of Left Bank Paris, who decide to take an excursion to Pamplona in Spain to see bullfighting.What could be more charming or interesting than to see (or hear in Hemingway's inimitable dialogues) these well-educated bright young things? And yet the ravages of the Great War lurk underneath the surface, with ruined bodies, ruined minds, cynicism and spiritual dissolution.It is helpful to remember that when people talk about the \\"Lost Generation\\", they mean the survivors of a horrible and wasteful war. This war killed so many young men (the first day of the Battle of the Somme in 1916 cost England 23,000 young men), that plenty of women had to live out their lives without any hope of marriage and family.It is not surprising that the twenties - when people tried to cope with the aftermath of so much destruction - evokes so many images of light and darkness. This book is particularly relevant today."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I think Hemingway attacked the theme of insecurity because, he was also dealing with his own issues.Hemingway had a history of alcoholism and this novel serves as release for the author. The speaker, Jake, takes an adventure and in turn experiences a self-discovery. The fiestas, society, and friends meant everything for Jake at the novel's opening. However through a difficult journey dealing with lost love and false friends, Jake manages to realize several truths in his life: his drinking will lose him friends and those he calls friends are not true in their loyalty.Montoya, the hotel owner that shared Jake's passion for bullfighting, no longer wished to associate with Jake after the fiesta. Due to all the rabble-rousing, partying, drinking, and the friends Jake brought, Montoya no longer could bear to be associated with Jake. Hemingway, too, lost friends as a result of his hurtful drinking habits.Despite his losses, Jake realizes that his love for Brett is merely and allusion. The novel ends:\\"'Oh, Jake,' Brett said, 'we could have had such a damned good time together.'... 'Yes,' I said. 'Isn't it pretty to think so?'\\"Jake has come to terms with the fact that he is to be a loner, that he needs to be alone.The Sun Also Rises is considered not only one of Ernest Hemingway's best books, but also one of the greatest classics of modern literature. I believe that the book is so powerful to read because the author underwent a catharsis in writing the novel. In writing the novel, Hemingway attacks his alcoholism and takes the first steps towards dealing with it. It is from that natural process that the reader is able to feel the emotions in the book. The language is curt yet true. The book is great."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This title is way over rated. Written by Earnest Hemingway, it is basically a story about a group of misfit alcoholics jumping from drink to drink. It is written in a narrative style that reminds me of a grade school reader. It does spend a few pages on the bull fighting fiesta in Pamplona Spain. Sorry, I cannot recommend this book at all.If you want a good book go read Virginia Wolfe (To The Lighthouse), William Faulkner (Light in August) or Thomas Mann (The Magic Mountain)."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"With all due respect to Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, nobody could make a better story out of nothing than Ernest Hemingway. No novel of his displays that more than his first, \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\"The world is spinning, and so is Jake Barnes' bedroom as he tries to sleep off endless boozy evenings. Living in Paris as a writer after literally losing his manhood in World War I, he wastes his days writing news dispatches and his nights drinking with comrades he can barely stand, not to mention wilting under the glow of a woman named Brett he loves but can't have.Near the end of the novel, Jake neatly summarizes his last few days with Brett with the same asperity Hemingway would probably use if he wrote Amazon.com reviews: \\"Send a girl off with one man. Introduce her to another to go off with him. Now go and bring her back. And sign the wire with love. That was it all right.\\"One nice thing about Hemingway is he doesn't need to work with much of a plot to draw you in. His writing style is so engaging in its efficient but alive-to-the-moment style that he can describe everyday things like Basque peasants passing around a bota of wine in a way that draws you in like a Jet Li fight scene, and makes real moments of action in a bullring all the more exquisite to follow.Humor, too, makes this journey worth taking, as Barnes takes stock of his situation, the people drifting in and out, the different styles of bullfighting, and the casual cruelty of Brett with her various suitors, including a fellow writer named Cohn whom Jake suspects read one romantic novel too many too late in life. \\"For a man to take it at thirty-four as a guide-book to what life holds is about as safe as it would be for a man of the same age to enter Wall Street direct from a French convent,\\" Jake narrates.The fact Cohn is a Jew gets a working over, and Hemingway at times seems in danger of producing 1926's second-most anti-Semitic book. The author also presents alarming anti-black sentiments. Perhaps women are pilloried most of all. They come off here as harpies and vultures, none worse than Brett, whom Cohn in an inspired moment calls Circe for her ability to \\"turn men into swine.\\"Some say Barnes and Brett suffer because they know they are meant for each other, which is rot. Barnes' loss of his sex organs only spares him the opportunity to be cuckolded, which both acknowledge in unguarded moments. \\"I'd just tromper you with everybody,\\" she says early on. No, Brett is one of those fascinating but heartless examples of the user as sexual athlete, and gives \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" a lot of its punch.People talk about \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" as the calling card for the Lost Generation's literary wing, but while it may be true, it is hard to pigeonhole it too much. There's little talk about politics or the Great War, even intellectual matters don't really preoccupy this crowd, and the attitudes about religion are more muddled than dismissive.Yes, maybe there's something here about the search for meaning after the certainties of civilization were blown apart by World War I, especially Jake with his love for bullfighting and paying his bills. But what makes \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" so special is the spirit of disenchantment that hangs over everything. Why bother trying to remake a world when there's drinking to be done?The principle may be debatable, but it's rendered here with such precision, passion, and charm you go along with Jake and his bar-hopping buddies, enjoy their assignations and petty gossip like it was a prime-time soap opera, and after its over go back to read it again and figure out what you missed."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest Hemingway's first novel deals with the character Jake and his love for Brett. Brett also loves Jake, but Jake cannot physically love Brett, due to an injury in the war causing his impotence.The characterizations are completely believalbe, with the jaded \\"lost generation\\" of artists and writers in Paris. The prose is famous, and deservingly so, with its clear and filling simplicity. Hemingway's lean prose influenced American prose style more than other writer. All American writers should be indebted to him.Eventually, the main characters leave Paris, and begin a trip to Pampolona, Spain. The imagery described in Spain has never been clearer.Due to their jadedness and depression over the war, the characters drink and get drunk constantly throughout the novel. Brett falls in love with different characters, even though Jake is the only one right for her.She wants to love him and cannot. The war has seperated the two lovers forever. This is why the novel is so heartbreaking and sad.

The title is symbolic in the sense that no matter what happens in the world the Sun will always Rises the next morning. Hemingway uses many ways to feed you information with out directly telling you. Jake Barnes, the protagonist of the book, has to find a way to live a normal life even with his life-changing WWI wound.Lady Brett Ashley, Jakes brief companion, causes Jake much emotion pain though out the book with her constant affairs. Her unwillingness to give up sex causes her to leave Jake for other men.

I would recommend this book to readers who like to feel the emotions of the characters they read about."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I cannot fathom how people praise this book. I can sort of understand that in 1926 almost all Americans had never been to or seen Spain and maybe were fascinated by the accounts of the running of the bulls in Pamplona.Other than that, this book is terrible. Boring descriptions of how much people drank and what they ate. As another reviewer put it, \\"If you took out the descriptions of drinking, eating, hotels, and the towns you're left with perhaps 50 pages.Hemmingway does this in A Farewell to Arms also, but at least that book is interesting. This book is just downright boring.I guess anyone can win a Nobel prize in literature."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I really don't like this book.

Everything from Huxley to HST to Dan Brown... if a book is good, I'll read it. If a book sucks, I'll usually put it down about halfway through.That's what bothers me the most about The Sun Also Rises. I've heard nothing but good things about Hemingway, how he's the greatest American author of all time. So even though page after page of this book was boring to the point of tears, I kept reading. I gave Hemingway the behefit of the doubt that at some point, SOMETHING other than dinner, drinking, and everyone taking their turn on the neighborhood whore would happen.Unfortunately, nothing happens. There's no plot, no conflict -- wait, that's not true... everyone hates the Jewish guy and everyone wants to sleep with the same woman... let me clarify -- there's no conflict interesting enough to carry a novel, no interesting characters (everyone is either an alcoholic or a slut, who you'd think might be interesting, but they are really just sad and pathetic), and absolutely no action. I wish I had read something else by Hemingway first, because odds are that ANY book would be better than this one. But now that this is my first impression of him, unfortunately, I don't know if I'll ever pick up another one of his books. It really is that bad.DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The book, The Sun Also Rises is not the best book ever written nor is worth reading unless you can handle boring drunks talking about one mans inabillity to &quot;get it up&quot;"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I can honestly say that this is the first book I have ever really disliked, and I have been an avid reader of all types of books for decades.

They go to Spain together for a week long fextival to see the bull fights. This is the first book I have read by Hemingway and I got tired of his writing style. While the topics that he wrote about really interested me, I think that he could have gone deeper into his subjects than just describing everything that happened in such great detail. I talked to my English teacher and she said that Hemingway focused on making his writing perfect and he achieved this by including every detail to make the reader know exactly what was happening.

THE SUN ALSO RISES is one of those books. I read it first as a teenager. I then read it six or seven times for courses as an undergraduate and a graduate student at Claremont. THE SUN ALSO RISES tells the story of the Lost Generation. It is Hemingway's career-defining novel as well as the novel that captured like none other the lifestyle and concerns of his American expatriot associates. Jake, an emasculated World War I veteran, narrates the story. Jake is in love with Brett who perhaps loves him in return, yet their love cannot be consummated. Robert, ostensibly Jake's best friend, and Frances, Robert's girl friend, are on hand as Jake and Lady Brett struggle with their problem. Mike, the Lady's fiance, also finds his place in the story. Hemingway, working at the top of his talent before his persona began to envelop his writing, presents the moveable feast of Paris and the bullfighting life in Spain. While THE SUN ALSO RISES is far from politically correct, it is a groundbreaking novel that still speaks to people today."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"My generation found its spokesman in Kurt Cobain. Though mine is lost for reasons entirely different from Hemingway's, the need for expression and recognition is as strong as ever. But I think in this book Hemingway offers insight that all our &quot;American Beauty's&quot; couldn't hope to achieve. His characters endure for reasons they don't realize. Life is miserable, or at best empty. Jake Barnes and Lady Brett exhibit &quot;grace under pressure&quot; as Hemingway himself defined it. Ironically, for me, this novel is a reminder of the good stuff in life. Hemingway doesn't offer much hope through the dialogues between his noble characters, but in an optimism wholly uncharacteristic of his writing, he offers us a reminder, or the title. The sun isn't always setting, sealing disappointment and despair as it falls, but it also rises. Even when we can't see the reasons, through the enduring actions that endear Barnes and Brett to us we can at least hope."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"&quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; is the harrowing love story of a man who can't get any and a woman who can't get enough. It is one of the greatest unconsummated love stories of all time. In the closing scene, as Jake and Brett share one last taxi together, the reader now fully sees that it is Jake's sexual inadequacies that prevent the further blossoming of his relationship with Brett. There lies the conflict. The resolution is in the realization by both parties that what could have been will never be. In that realization, lies further conflict, as Jake and Brett must continue to find ways to resist the want of each other. The quintessential Hemingway formula for love becomes evident: in conflict, there is resolution, and in resolution, there is conflict."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I'll admit it. I HATED Hemingway after the mandatory &quot;Old Man and the Sea&quot; in high school, but when I saw this book, I had to give it a try, even if Hemingway was the author and I wasn't dissapointed. It isn't a plot filled with action or intrigue, but it is complex and fascinating in how it describes the personal relaitonships of the impotent protagonist Jake, his less than innocent love Brett, and the annoying tag-along Robert Cohn along with a slew of others that reminds me so much of the high school &quot;in crowd&quot; I started casting the characters with people I knew. It isn't a book for everybody, in fact, unless you like working to understand meaning in a book this isn't the one for you. However if you're looking for more than a casual read you won't be dissapointed. This is one of his very best."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. The story flows like a wide river, the atmospheric changes between the wild and crazy days in Paris and the passionate and dangerous time in Pamplona is excellent. For those who have never read the book - just think about this sentence: &quot;It's terribly easy to be hardboild about everything in the daytime, but at night it's something completely different.&quot"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemingway came to his style of prose by writing the truest sentences he knew. He says so in \\"A Moveable Feast,\\" his memoir of the Paris years when he was writing this, his first novel, but it also can be felt. The sentences in \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" don't read as programmatic or mannered; they read as fresh, vivid, and clean, as if each had its own brimming source.Don't envy Hemingway that he was the first to write like Hemingway. The way he wrote was by working damned hard, harder than most writers have ever worked. He thought through each sentence as a thought as well as a sentence, and this is no easy task, and yields no easy formula. Hence the newness and subtlety, and the sense that \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" though full of frivolous characters, is sturdy and never frivolous. It is unified by a sort of analytic integrity, and it needed a man with both feet on the ground to lend it weight.The plot of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" seems to make much of nothing. Food is talked about, drinks are drunk, and young people do a lot of not thinking. Jake, the American narrator, lives in Paris and travels to Spain to fish and watch bullfights. His principle companions are a preppy leech and a weak flirt. He's in love with the girl. And yet the story doesn't meander because it isn't distracted by the allure of the inessential. Go elsewhere to feel lost in France or Spain. Hemingway was interested in making, not describing--in building art through language like Cezanne built images in paint: with deep structure trumping impressionistic reportage. Like a Cezanne canvas, \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" seems drained of anecdote but never mundane. It forsakes the grand gestures but leaves the formal tension. Startlingly strong feeling bleeds through.(Even the bullfight scenes, where Hemingway lets himself get a bit journalistic, come off as more color and feeling than event or spectacle. Maybe all were one in Pamplona.)Is \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" his best book? Maybe. \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" certainly beats it for scope and local color, and has the distinction of being one of the best war books ever written, and that's a category to care about. But he never topped his first novel in its revolutionary honesty. Read it when you're somewhat young, if you still have time. It won't give you a hero to follow or words to live by, but art with this sort of integrity can nevertheless teach you how to live. And that's heroic."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"LOOK: 1) \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" does NOT liken Brett to Circe. Rather, one of its characters, its least attractive character, in fact, likens her to Circe, and Brett and Jake, its heroine and hero, find this likening a great joke.2) Jake is NOT impotent in the sense this term is usually intended; he CAN be sexually aroused; it's just that a war injury (the lost generation, remember?) has rendered him physiologically (NOT psychologically) incapable of consummating his love for Brett. This is a very different thing.3) \\"The Sun Also Rises\\"'s \\"slang\\" has not aged at all.4) \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is NOT about \\"love and money\\"; it TELLS you right off, with its quoting of Getrude Stein and the Bible, precisely what it IS about. You don't have to go digging for deep hidden meanings; you only have to sit back and enjoy it. But if you don't find its initial description of Robert Cohn and the bit with the Parisian prostitute (which set the tone for the entire book) funny, you aren't likely to. You may SAY you enjoyed it, having heard that the book is considered classic, and assuming others will take you for an erudite, culturally sophisticated person if you do, but that's different from REALLY enjoying it."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Jake Barnes was hurt in World WarI and since then he is impotent. This injury affects his relationship to Brett Ashley, the woman he loves, as well as his whole life.Brett Ashley is an aristocratic and irrestibly beautiful but she has a trauma and this makes her unable to change her way of living. Since her fianc&eacute; died in the war she has tried to forget or to hide behind drunkenness and lust. She is unable to have steady relationships. Her lovers change as frequently as the sun rises.Yet, as mentioned above Jake Barnes is in love with her. There is, however, his injury and secondly Brett's behaviour that makes love impossible. At first Jake doesn'tsee or doesn't want to see that he will never possess his true love.. He gets more and more jealous and absorbed. It makes him an eternal spectator of life. He is not able to live his own life. He is isolated and this makes him sick and purposeless. The war and his injury, in particular, made him a member of the lost generation. A generation that is so affected by the results of the war that they lost themselves. (see All Quiet On the Western Front) Jake's purposelessness is well shown by his drinking, by his treating of women ( Georgette and Brett) and by his travelling. He is trying to get away from himself. Merely the fact that he is an expatriate shows that he is homeless, a refugee. Once Bill, his friend, tells him: &quot;You're a an expatriate. you have lost touch with the soil. You spend your time talking not working.&quot;His isolation and the fact that he is a spectator of life is well shown when he is in Pamplona watching the bull-fights. In the arena there is life going on. A bull fighter is so close to death that he lives his life with utmost intense but Jacke who is only watching outside, stays an eternal spectator of life."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"When S.A.R. first came out in the 1920's, a review of the day said that Hemmingway's prose,\\"...put conventional English to shame.\\" Well, that was then, this is now. The more I read it the more I wanted it to end. Is it entirely possible that in the American myths about Papa's alcohol soaked hunting and fishing trips, we've elevated the work because we wanted to like it as we seem to like the man?

So, my perspective will be from that point of view:I looked for this book after seeing the movie, I believe with Mel Ferrar--one of those actors you no longer see on late nite TV. Pleasantly, the book was just as good--meaning the movie was an excellent rendition of this Hemingway novel.Hemingway might have been the first person to write a story \\"much about nothing\\" (referring to the formula for Seinfeld's success). I sought out this book to read because I realize now in my 30s that I have finally lived enough of \\"Life\\" to appreciate what Hemingway has to say.I saw the movie about 10 years ago on late nite, and it stayed with me all these years. Why? The story of the protangonist and his American expatriate friends in Paris and in Spain (pre-WWII) is not as much about bull fighting and these spoiled rich kids who apparently live the good life without any need to work as it is about a snapshot of couple of months in the life of the protagonist--whom I take it to be one aspect of the real Hemingway. Isn't our real lives like that, nothing spectacular, no clear beginning, a continuing end, lots of time spent with friends whom you despise at times, but always come together. Yes, after being old enough, I really like this book. Looking forward to more Hemingways."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I would think Hemingway closed his eyes, listened to voices he once heard and remembered sites he once saw then opened his eyes and started to write. His descriptions of the Spanish fiesta and bullfight are like listening to someone reminisce so passionately about an experience, yet the memory comes to life so much that even as a reader, it becomes my memory too and the voices and sights will live on in my mind perhaps as vividly as if I too were seated at the bullfight for the first time or dancing in the narrow streets of Spain.Hemingway does this to me. I get so involved in the relationships and conversations that I feel as if they've been planted as memories in my own mind"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Lost GenerationsGertrude Stein said, &quot;You are all a lost generation.&quot; She could have describing Generation X, but she was fifty years too early. These words were spoken about another generation, a group of young people who, after World War I, were feeling disconnected from the rest of the world.Many of them were living in Europe, living the &quot;expatriate&quot; life. That meant they lived from meal to meal on borrowed money trying to develop an artistic lifestyle thousands of miles from everything and everyone they grew up knowing.Just a few years ago, Seattle was a kind of Mecca among east coast Generation Xers. Everyone I went to college with envisioned Seattle as the place where we could be ourselves. Of course, we hadn't really defined who that was yet, and none of us had been there. Yet, somehow, we knew that Seattle was the place to be.Paris was the place to be for the original lost generation and Ernest Hemingway became one of that city's most celebrated adopted sons. His semi-autobiographical novel The Sun Also Rises follows a group of young people trying to find themselves after World War I.Jake Barnes, the main character, is a veteran with an unfortunate war wound which puts a damper on his dating life. Lady Brett Ashley is the woman who loves him, and whom he loves, but also the woman he cannot have. They are surrounded by a cast of painters, writers, editors, drunks, and a bullfighter named Pedro Romero.Romero becomes the linchpin of the story. Jake, Brett, and friends head off to Pamplona, Spain for the running of the bulls and the festival of San Fermin. Jake is a bit of an aficionado of la corrida de toros and looks forward to initiating his less experienced friends.He did not anticipate, however, Lady Brett. Brett is the female equivalent of a womanizer. When she meets Romero, sparks fly and Jake is put into the uncomfortable position of acting as a go-between for the woman he loves and another man.When the novel comes to a close, Jake is still lost, but is closer to finding himself. The problem is he's not sure he likes himself. Maybe he should go to Seattle, have a mocha, and try to chill out . . . or whatever."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"One of Hemingway's better novels, features Lady Brett Ashley and a young bullfighter.

This came after a whole time period of lostness and lack of emotional feeling derived from war. This is the ultimate expression of Ernest Hemingway himself. This novel was esentially an expression of everything Hemingway had experienced in Spain about war, the courage and bravery in war, and life itself. This novel was his way of expressing his experiences along with his feelings. Jake Barnes is clearly Ernest Hemingway in this novel"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"When I first read &quot;The Sun Also Rises,&quot; its aimlessness gave me a bad case of existential butterflies. I couldn't understand why Jake and Brett couldn't get together. My English prof clued in the class in on the fact that Jake had been--how should it put it?--&quot;Bobbitized&quot; during WWI (not every reader realizes the extent of his injury). These were people who helped fight the &quot;War to End All Wars&quot; which resulted in 8.5 million dead and no stable peace. In essence, Jake and Brett and the others were still trying to figure out how to live in the 20th century, one of the most genocidal and brutal ever.So &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; is about the attempts of people to make sense in a world that is largely senseless to them. This accounts for the atmosphere of depression that pervades the book, and I think the quotation from Ecclesiastes, which supports the &quot;been there, done that&quot; atmosphere, is key. I have a much higher opinion of this book now than when I first read it. By the way, if you feel Hemingway was incapable of idealism, read &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I picked up &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; by Ernest Hemmingway after I read the original New York Time's review of Jack Kerouac's &quot;On The Road&quot;(My favorite book) comparing the novel to &quot;The Sun Also Rises.&quot; The two books had very little in common but I won't go into that. &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; is Hemmingway's tale of his lost generation of rich kids who fought in World War 1 and now do nothing but travel, eat, and go to clubs. The book's subject is a very fascinating one and the reason that kept me reading. However, Hemmingway half way through the novel starts to bore us and turns us from the novel instead of getting us interested in the characters. Judging from the split reviews I've read on Amazon, I've concluded you'll either be bored with this book or think it is a masterpiece.The novel starts us out with Jack, a wounded ex World War 1 soilder who spends his better days hanging out in Paris Cafes and nightclubs. We are also introduced to Robert; an old school friend of Jack's and despised by others around him for being a Jew. Robert is an outsider of Jack's group always trying to fit in and cursed out by the group (I'll get to that later.) We also meet Brett, Jack's-I believe ex-girlfriend- who never knows weather she loves Jack or not. People believe that she is one of the best female heroine's in 20th cent. Literature. The group with a few others decides to go to Spain and see the bullfighting. In Spain, we think the characters will somehow be changed or come to terms with their lifestyle but it is pretty much the same as their lives in Paris. Even, the bullfighting just seems like a ho-hum experience to Jack and his friends.Your average chapter in the book is something along these lines...Jack wakes up with a hangover around noon and quickly goes down for breakfast with his friends, Robert comes around and everyone yells at him, When Robert leaves everyone says anti-Semitic comments about him, Jack listens indifferently, everyone decides to meet at a place for dinner, everyone takes a nap then goes to dinner, they all order expensive wine and insult Robert more, they go to a club, Brett and Jack end up going back to their places, Brett is about to make love but then doesn't, jack falls asleep drunk. The whole process is repeated over and over through the book. Hemmingway writes in a repetition and simple tone. It all depends on your taste in the style of writing. I personally don't mind because I like Brett Easton Ellis and he has the same style; but with &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; it annoyed me because the novel was too long for it and these characters were too well-developed for that style. This novel deserved more depth and detail to it.One part that I could not stand in the novel was the harshness of the characters towards Robert. Ok understand that I know it's a novel and reflecting the times but this novel just went too overboard. Every time Robert came in, I just wanted to flip past that part of the book. Hemmingway depicts these scenes in a distasteful manner that turned me off and I'm not easily stirred by writing.In the end, I felt let down because no changes happened to the character lives and the conflict never changed. Why go through all the trouble if it's just Much ado about nothing? The novel was good however, in portraying the time period and &quot;the lost generation&quot; of the WW1 generation. That I give Hemmingway credit for. &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; is worth your time and like I said; you'll either hate or love it. Overall I gave it three stars because I neither hated nor loved it."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This Kindle edition is a big disappointment. It's full of errors and the formatting is terrible -- hundreds of misspelled words, page numbers and chapter footers in the middle of sentences, etc. It seems like a bad OCR of a scanned document that nobody bothered to clean up. Buy the other Kindle edition from 2004 instead."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Reading through previous reviews prompted me to write this one because I didn't find one that really understood The Sun Also Rises. Many reviewers saw only the surface of this great work and called it tedious and unworhtwhile. Others loved the book for the interesting characters. But not many probed the heart of the classic.This is a book about finding meaning in the world. Jake is very much like Hemingway himself. He went off to the war thinking of glory and heroics and saw only death, and horrible death at that. His illusions are shattered, the notion of life in an ordered, coherent universe gone. They see that life is random, chaotic, without meaning. How does one live in a world like this? That was the question central to Hemingway's entire life, and it's central to this book as well.Hemingway answers the question through the famous \\"Hemingway Code\\" that one can glean from his novels and short stories. Characters that stick to this code are heroic in his eyes. I won't detail the code here because it will ruin the pleasure of discovering it for yourself, but let's just say that the purest Hemingway Hero in this novel is Romero, the bullfighter. Characters like Robert Cohn and Mike are not Hemingway Heroes.One reviewer wrote that he couldn't see how one could read the book and not come away longing for Lady Brett. This guy must have been reading a completely different book than what I read. Brett is like Circe; her job is to turn men into swine, as seen in several key scenes in the novel, including a festival scene. Or, to use a key metaphor from the book, she's like a bullfighter, twirling her skirt (instead of a cape) to lure the bullish men toward her, spinning around when they get too close, and finally driving a blade into their hearts.This novel has nothing to do with surface events of the novel. Hemingway's style is like an iceberb; 90 percent of the thing is below the surface. This is a novel that has to be read slowly, introspectively, and with great care. Tune your ear to hear Hemingway, for his voice is one of the most subtle, but most powerful, in the history of literature."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"In a course I took on the American literature of the 1920s, the professor began his discussion of \\"The Sun also Rises\\" by calling our attention to a minor, sidebar scene: Jake and Georgette promenade in in Paris in the early evening past the window of the Herald Tribune offices. Jake explains to Georgette that the clocks displayed in the window show the hour in each of the four time zones across America. Georgette, who is a prostitute from Belgium, looks at the clocks in the window and says: \\"Don't kid me.\\"It is an odd little scene, and on the face of it doesn't make sense. But it is the key to the book. The novel is about time and death. For Georgette and Jake, who are survivors of the 1914-18 war, time doesn't exist in the traditional sense. For the survivors of the war, as for the dead, time is understood to be over.In the 19th century, most Americans considered the passage of time to be a metronome of human progress. The equation of time with progress was a form of boosterism, born from the great success of the industrial revolution and the Westward expansion of the country. As time went on, things got bigger, better, faster, richer and further West. Time and progress were synonymous.For the war generation, this naively optimistic view of time and industrial progress ended abruptly and in it ended in violence. It seemed that industrial progress had paid itself off in the industrialization of death - the machine gun, the French 75s, the recoilless artillery of Krupp.The Great War was not a gallant, romantic, sabers on horseback conflict like that depicted in late 19th century newspaper accounts of the Spanish American war. The Great War of 1914-18 came to be seen, from the point of view of writers in the 1920s, as an unfair fight between men and (indifferent, impersonal, efficient) killing machines. A highly mechanized slaughterhouse.Hemingway's generation, the so-called \\"lost generation,\\" was lost in fact. A generation died in the war. The statistics of mortality were for those days stunning and incredible.The novel is set in Paris around 1924, six years after the armistice. For the characters who were soldiers or survivors like Jake and Georgette, the daily circuit of the sun is a clock without purpose. Time is meaningless to them, just as it is to the dead. Hence, the sun \\"also\\" rises. It happens every morning of course but it is an event that occurs off to one side. It does not bring the hope of a new dawn, it does not mean \\"life goes on.\\" In this novel, emphatically, life does not go on - there is no progress.The war survivors' perception of time has shrunk to the present moment, in which they live. They elaborately avoid looking back - the war is just a huge hole in their personal stories -- and they cannot look forward, in the sense of \\"looking forward to\\" a superior future. For the survivors of the war, time has been turned around, flipped. Death has already happened - it is behind them. They do see the sun rise and set. But although time passes, it does not really go anywhere.The passage of time into a brighter future, the progress of the sun through a succession of time zones across the US from east to west - all this strikes the Belgian survivor, Georgette, as utter nonsense. \\"Don't kid me.\\" She says.The war is the silent, unmentionable core of The Sun Also Rises, but the characters sometimes mention it inadvertently, in asides, and the reader gets tiny glimpses of what happened to these people the war, and what it did to them.They never move forward. Writers start, or fail to start, books that they never finish. Love affairs lead to nothing, no marriages and no babies. There is a constant theme of drinking to coast through the present and to forget the past. Another diversion is an obsessive concentration on the sensual minutia of the present moment. Jake, a former combat pilot who has suffered some sort of wound to his groin, never detailed, is outside of time in the biological sense that he cannot reproduce. He has lost his \\"line\\", that is, the line of familial and biological continuity between past and future.Conflicts in the book frequently arise as mutually amazed confrontations between Americans who skipped the war, and still have their 19th century sense of optimism and progress and honor intact -- and the \\"new\\" Americans like Hemingway - expatriates from American space but, more importantly, from the old American sense of time as something positive. In what has probably become the most famous line in the book Jakes says: \\"I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories hold together.\\" As an American war veteran, Jake himself has a huge rip through his own story.This year, The Sun Also Rises is 80 years old. Frozen in time, exactly as Hemingway intended. A difficult, complicated book that is, nevertheless, very easy to read."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I'd recommend this book to anyone, it is particularly important that you read it if you're going to visit Paris, since this book will open your eyes to Hemingway's Paris... which through his eyes and perception of it, is as beautiful a city as you will find. In many ways it's a very sentimental novel about Paris, the 1920's, drink, sex, and courage. While the novel begins in Paris, the reader is taken south to the Pyranees that border France and Spain, and then further south still to Pamplona for the running of the bulls. The book's hero Jake cannot consumate his relationship with Lady Brett Ashley because of an unfortunate injury he acquired in the war in Italy, rendering him impotent. Brett is pigheaded, stunning, an attention seeker, and a flirt... this combination drives Jake crazy as she returns his love, but goes out with other men to get the one thing she can't get from him. This tragic scenario is masterfully painted for us by Hemingway from the very beginning of the book. So, the one thing that Jake wants to give to Brett he can't, and this makes him feel inadequate, and creates an ambivalence in her attitudes and behaviour toward him. Jake is the man she loves, he's right for her in every way, yet because of his injury she is driven away from him, and goes out with much lesser suitable men, one in particular is an out and out fool and a nothing compared with Jake. Hemingway makes the reader feel Jake's wistfullness and sentimentally about what could be between Jake and Brett, we also drink up the mood of Paris and Pamplona during the Fiesta... it's hard not to come away from the book with a crush on Lady Brett, a wish that you'd experienced Paris in the 1920's as Hemingway did, and perhaps more than anything else, dying for a drink... in classic Hemingway style, the characters booze their way through the novel from page 2. ***** Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest Hemingway took the title for his classic \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" from Ecclesiastes. The characters and themes of this book make Ecclesiastes the perfect pretext for anyone about to read \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\"Hemingway's novel is a simple novel featuring several acquaintances and a few weeks of their lives spent mostly in Spain watching bullfights and Pamplona's now-famous Running of the Bulls. The characters are very human and in their conversations Hemingway shows the reader their numerous faults. They are lazy, selfish, untrusting, often drunk, and very shallow. Through each other they distract themselves from finding any deeper meaning in their existences. So they drink, admire the beautiful scenery in Spain, and watch bullfights. Like the repetition of life and death in the bullfights they frequent, the characters half-heartedly attempt to solve their problems and only find subsequent troubles replacing those they do manage to slay.\\"Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had doneand what I had toiled to achieve,everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind;nothing was gained under the sun.\\" -- Ecc. 2:11Hemingway has created these characters to be endlessly frustrating and seemingly beyond hope, but in doing so he makes them approachable, captivating, and people that every human being can relate to. \\"There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins.\\" -- Ecc. 7:20\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is probably Hemingway's greatest work, and it's main theme is even sadder when viewed in relation to his suicide. With this book, Hemingway left humanity a beautiful work of art, truly worthy of its classic status... but in taking his life, he showed us a very logical end result of characters such as these. Bright, lovable, passionate, and utterly hopeless.\\"...for without Him, who can eat or find enjoyment?\\" -- Ecc. 2:25"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Let me start by saying I can't believe I am giving this book 5 stars... and only gave 4 to For Whom the Bell Tolls. I read The Sun Also Rises before I read For Whom the Bell Tolls, I thought the latter had struck me deeply and made more sense to me... but there's just something about the former. Hemingway had a real knack for telling about the struggles for finding the meaning of life. He hit the nail on the head time and again.The Sun Also Rises is all about pain and longing. I'm a couple of months removed from reading it, but that is the truest take I get from it. Each character has a distinct pain and longing they are dealing with... Let me highlight some of these:* Brett-- the beautiful and highly desired object in many man's eyes. She seems to have it all. She seems to be right where she wants to be. But she is truly searching and lost. It seems the one thing that would make her complete is the one thing she can never truly have... Jake. The late night conversations between Jake and Brett, really tug at the heart. You just wish they could somehow get together. But it could never be...--The longing and pain of unattainable and unfulfilled desires.* Robert Cohn-- the man on the outside looking in. Robert Cohn so deperately wants to be part of the group. He so deperately wants to be accepted. He so deperately wants Brett. But he can never realize any of this because the social group he wishes so much to join has already passed judgement on him and will never let him in. And poor Robert doesn't realize that it is only \\"WHO\\" he is that is keeping him out forever. Not just the fact of his ethnic background but his very personality drives him out of the group.--The longing and pain of being on the outside looking in.* Mike Campbell-- He seems to be at ease in the social group. He seems to have established himself. But when you look at his constant barbs at Robert Cohn you can see he is really insecure about his position in life. Mike isn't a main character but you can see yet another longing when you look at him. He is actually in... \\"The In Crowd\\" but doesn't seem to be very sure he is really in at all. To me that is the human condition in a nutshell. Always pushing... always grasping... always looking for more... when all we need is probably right in front of us. What a shame!--The longing and pain of insecurity within security.* Jake Barnes-- Last but certainly not least.... Jake. Jake epitomizes pain and longing in this book. Jake is the glue that holds this whole group together. That is a lot of pressure on an individual. The pressure he is under can be seen clearly by his relationship to Robert Cohn. He is forced to go through such changes in that singular relationship. At the beginning of the book he seems to at least have a tolerance for Robert Cohn and then through circumstance he has to sway completely. He keeps the clashing personalities at bay all through the story. He seems to keep Brett from crashing and burning over and over again. I'm sure there might have been a murder between the social combatants somewhere in the story if not for Jake soothing and placating all he came in contact with. He seems to be the only one in the book who has any social graces and tact. What a lot of pressure on one individual.Jake also has this mysterious wound from the war that keeps him from having a sexual realtionship and connecting to anyone in that way. How much does this hurt Jake? How does it affect him? We don't really get a deep picture of it all... but it seems to impact him at least minimally and I'm sure it goes much deeper.To me the one thing that would make sense in the whole story would be a realtionship between Jake and Brett. They seem to fit together... but they can't. Jake can't physically, of course, but he is also damaged emotionally and can't find intimacy in a purely emotional connection either. Is that lonliness or what?--The longing and pain of holding everyone else together and the longing and pain of wanting... yet not being able to.I think the one thing that makes me rate this book a 5 out of 5 is the fact that I have, at one time or another, felt exactly like all of these characters. Like I said, Hemingway hit the nail on the head consistently... he knew what we need, what we miss and what we yearn for. Hemingway like no other novelist understood how we struggle and fight for so much but rarely get what we want.He painted such a brilliant picture... take the time to gaze upon it. This is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemingway's style is a style that makes you want to live. Whether his characters are diving from caf&eacute; to caf&eacute; in search of a quick buzz or out in the woods fishing, Hemingway takes the reader there with amazing descriptive power._The Sun Also Rises_ is the story of a group of expatriates centered around the characters Jake Barnes, Lady Brett Ashley, and Robert Cohn. Their desire to live and to experience takes them from the caf&eacute;s of Paris to the bullfights of Pamplona, Spain. Along the way they love, hate, and betray each other, often as just a way to feel anything at all.Jake is in many ways the typical Hemingway main character. Jake was a soldier in the Great War who became wounded and fell in love with his nurse, Brett. We see echoes of this story in A Farewell To Arms and Hemingway's life. Jake however is physically impotent from his war wounds. He craves Brett, but she will not have him because of her sexual needs. While Jake is physically impotent, all of Brett's lovers end up being emotionally impotent, so Jake functions as Brett's one love, with no power to satisfy her: Hemingway's own \\"catch 22.\\"A masterful stroke of Hemingway is his ability to have the environment play out the emotional state of the characters. This extends well beyond the natural forces mimicking the characters feelings as in the storms of some gothic novel, or The Great Gatsby's conflict on the hottest day of the year; Hemingway uses the whole environment, natural and man-made to play out his dramas. Jake's only serenity is found in the mountains away from mankind, just fishing. But as the conflict rises the story moves back to civilization to where bull-fights become more and more intense with each day. The bulls and bullfighters themselves begin to represent various figures of the drama. The emasculated steer trying to keep the other bulls calm, as Jake seeks peace between his friends. The bullfighter's elegant grace at dancing with the bulls mirrors Brett's sexual games.The power of Hemingway ultimately lies in his short descriptive prose. His pithy statements set the scene, set the mood, and then send the reader on into the action. While the train of thought style that Faulkner and Joyce use would probably better reflect how one thinks in a given situation, Hemingway's use of terse statements gives us the scene in readable understandable chunks that draw us in easier. It may not be the way we think, but it is the way we understand.The language completely sucks you into the setting. Many point to Hemingway's and the characters' use of alcohol as their drug of choice, but the true drug of _The Sun Also Rises_ is experience. Disillusioned by the Great War the expatriate characters shift from moment to moment just wanting to live in that moment, as if it were their last. So as Jake soaks up the dancing and the drinking, so do we. As Brett feverishly tries to pray in the church, so do we. We can feel the dust of Spain settle on our necks, and we can feel the cool stream run past our legs. The jazz music makes us want to dance, and the bullfights make us want to dance with death. Hemingway's style is not just persuasive, it is compelling.So even as we find ourselves in situations we would normally find appalling-drinking in the morning, faced with a dead man lying in the road-we still find we want to be there. We want to experience what Jake experiences. We find that we want to live."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"A young Ernest Hemingway writes his first novel.

Not to be missed.Donald Gallinger is the author of The Master Planets"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I expected to like this novel. I was surprised that I did not. Perhaps I can explain why. Perhaps I cannot. Let me make an effort, though I fear it shall please no one.I do not know if I'll open another Hemingway book anytime soon, but since this was the first novel by this writer I have read, maybe it's premature to make judgments about his entire body of work. Still, as I struggled through one flat and boring chapter after the next in the dialogue-driven The Sun Also Rises, populated as it was with single-dimensional characters I did not like, situations that disgusted me, and settings that were admittedly nicely-described, I kept having a thought that no doubt qualifies among Hemingway fans as heresy: do the masses truly like Hemingway's novels, or are they swept up in the mystique of his legend to the point that this carries into the books themselves and therein explains their power to draw so much praise?Frankly, folks, I didn't see a lot to embrace here. Hemingway's sentences were like bare skeletons devoid of flesh above them. I expected genius and found mediocrity: mediocrity and a cast of spoiled, mildly tragic middle-aged figures who drank themselves sick, quarreled, traipsed across western Europe and left behind abandoned children and jilted spouses, all in pursuit of the excitement that eluded them. They did not even have the excuse of youth to exonerate them, these were by any definition adults. I kept thinking that, well, maybe if more than one of them actually had a job they wouldn't have had so much time on their hands to feel miserable and dissipate. As for them being a, to quote Gertrude Stein, \\"Lost Generation\\" robbed of meaning by war, it was made clear that so many of these characters began their lives of irresponsibility well before the outbreak of the First World War.Furthermore this novel was not a story, it was a series of loosely connected situations. In my opinion, Fitzgerald, Hemingway's contemporary, wrote rings around Hemingway, as did several other writers of the period I could name. Also for a man who won the Nobel Prize, Hemingway's habit of mixing past and present tenses (I'm talking about in his prose, not character dialogue) surprised me. To all the English teachers out there who used to get on my case for committing this compositional error, I'd like to ask, if mixing tenses is bad writing, then why did this author win the Nobel Prize, and if he won the Nobel Prize mixing tenses, then why is it bad writing?I do not wish to give the impression I loathed The Sun Also Rises, because I didn't. I did enjoy the frank exchange of views between this novel's characters on issues of race, religion, and general ethos, their use of epithets verboten today, and the politics of sexual congress, but that alone did not carry the plot to conclusion, and too much fell too limply by. Truthfully, the novel is about expatriate drunks who go on holiday to Spain to watch bulls be slaughtered by a young man after whom the central female character lusts. As for the dialogue, anyone who finds depth in the conversations the characters have is inventing that depth himself. There was simply not much here to latch onto.Honestly, The Sun Also Rises is all right, but it isn't brilliant literature, and the only way it defined any generation is in the corrective touch of wishful hindsight."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"All I can say is that the people who have rated this book with a low score are missing the point. This is a beautifully written book. The complaints that nothing happens and all the characters do is drink, fight, and fish is because this is a book about the LACK of meaning in post-WWI society. Meaninglessness IS the message. If you seek to understand modernism, this is the best novel for that purpose."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Thank God for Paris and Spain and Hemingway. Read this story.

Don't get caught up with what your high school teacher said, or deconstructionist professor said, or literary know-it-all, could-have-wrote-it-better said. Don't get caught up with all the journals and theses and textbooks that say it is not as well planned as \\"Across The River And Through the Trees,\\" or a good beginning point for a literary mind, or that real people or real events are incorporated into the plot. Don't wander around in the \\"lost generation\\" crap or expatriated American garbage, or the impotence and what Freud would say and the myriad of other things that make people spout off Epicurean/Stoic history or analogies to the nth degree.

Part of the enjoyment is the drama. I have not described the plot elements and those should be left as surprises for the reader.I had read \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Hemingway about ten years ago and then discovered an essay by Raymond Chandler on writing. He was a famous detective writer and screenplay writer of the 1930s through to the 1950s. He made the comment in his essay on writing that \\"Farewell to Arms\\" set the standard for twentieth century fiction. With that encouragement I bought the book, read it, then ran out and bought most of Hemingway's other novels and a collection of his short stories. This novel from 1926 is not his best work, and perhaps \\"Farewell to Arms\\" would be his best. Some of his other works such as \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" has much greater depth and balance than the present work. This is one of Hemingway's first, and it has a rough feel to it. It has a good balance of prose, story, characters, drama, and length, but it has a certain collegiate feel - almost a braggart feel to his macho story about having a good time in Spain and Paris.For example, the Bloomsbury Guide has picked 375 top fiction authors, and among those 375 has picked 40 \\"masterpieces\\" and they included Hemingway's \\"Farewell to Arms\\" and not the present novel.The novel does have certain originality and flair with the colourful description of the running of the bulls and the Spanish fair. The story is based roughly on his own war experiences of living in Paris and then visiting Spain to see the bull fights. The novel is superbly entertaining but a bit rough as a masterpiece and shorter than some of his great works.The title of the book comes from the Bible, Ecclesiastes 1:5 but the book is about drinking and going to the bull fights.The story is based on a trip by Hemingway with his first wife, Hadley Richardson, and several friends to Pamplona, Spain, in 1925. They - along with other friends - are the source of the three main characters and it is roughly based on their experiences. The three protagonists are Robbert Cohn a Jewish American boxer, Lady Brett Ashley, and Jake Barnes the narrator.They meet in Paris and then go to Spain and meet other friends and have a wild time for a few weeks. It has a certain \\"fraternity boys\\" feel to the book. It is macho and all about drinking lots of red wine and watching the bull fights and the celebrations surrounding the fights and then the injuries suffered by both the bulls and the fighters. He has a related book \\"Death in the Afternoon\\" which has many pictures and more details on the fights themslves and the participants. Also, some of the same material is covered in some of his short stories.Part of the fun reading the book is the plot and I would avoid knowing any more than that until you read the book.5 Star excellent and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Books come and go, but some stay. The 'Sun Also Rises' is really a magnificent piece of literature. The main characters, Jake and Brett spin you through their world of expatriate excess in post-WWI France and Spain. Reading this book makes me want to travel Europe without a care in the world. This seems to have some similarities to the themes touched on in a later work by Kerouac, 'On the Road.' Although much more polite, this book is a great look into the 'lost generation' and how the cool crowd functioned in early 20th century Europe. The descriptions of trout fishing and the bullfights in Spain are as vivid as any you will find. This is a true masterpiece.AJoseph Dworak"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I was surprised when I read a fellow reviewer's missive when he referred to Hemingway's &quot;lean, adjective-free style&quot;. I was surprised because the images from this book seemed so unbelievably vivid...but that person is exactly right. His prose doesn't tell you anymore than you need to know, but somehow tells you everything. It's kinda weird, actually.You can read the exemplary summations for yourself, but I thought I could smell the dust during the bullfights while reading the last half. A plot summary of this tome may seem slight, but I don't think that was the point. It's clearly the telling of the story, not the story itself, to which people respond.I love the fact that so many readers interpreted things from the book in so many different ways...yet all with equal enthusiasm and zeal. That phenomenon should tell you more than someone simply giving a &quot;great review.&quot; This is a relatively short book that can (and should) be read slowly, to savor every line. It will drop you perfectly in the midst of post WWI Spain. I look forward to the rest of the Hemingway canon, which I have yet to experience. This is a temporary situation."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I enjoyed this book quite a lot. I found it to be short and simple with some great scenery and senses descricptions. But in the end it is more of a self analysis book through drinking and eating from France to Spain and back. I would have to say I preferred For Whom the Bell Tolls. It has more of my kind of necessary drama through the fight for survival.

A large Group of people used to gather almost everyday to sit around and just drink. People in the story were always concerned about their self. All they thought about was sex and how they needed it all of the time. I thought Jake, the main character and the narrator, shouldn't have had to go through what he went through; .He didn't deserve all that. Jake was an innocent man who just wanted on thing, and that was Brett.This novel is very similar to modern day times. Sometimes people engage in drinking just to get away from their everyday struggles.. The time in which this novel took place and now times are similar in ways. In both the characters in the novel and people now-a-days, turn to alcohol for relief and have tendencies to party all night long. Yet, there are parts in the book I cannot believe can occur, but this may be a good part of the novel; A place where dreams may happen."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Absolutely marvelous. Loved it. The reading was excellent and the book a delight. I have read quite a bit of Hemingway but had always missed this book (DOn't know why).

It would be intriguing to follow the route the travellers took in their journey from Paris to Pamplona."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is my favorite novel. Best use of dialogue by any writer in any novel. Circles, deja vu, and echos reverb throughout. Characters reflect off one another. First and last lines are flawless. As is the rest of the text. No sentence, or word goes to waste. Unlike other masterpieces of fiction, even by Hemingway, not a moment in this novel is self indulgent. The perfect modern work.Some things to consider: Is Robert Cohn simply a fool? Does he really behave as badly as one is led to believe? Robert Cohn is one of the most misunderstood characters in all of fiction. As flawed as he is, he is a noble character, the only character who undergoes transition throughout his time in the narrative. His journey is crucial to the novel, in fact, as crucial as Jake's. Notice that he is missing from the last book.Brett is also a misunderstood character. Does she love Jake? Perhaps, in fact almost definately, but contrary to popular opinion, a case CAN be made that she doesn't. Her relationship with Jake is one of the saddest in fiction. When reading the end of the novel, note the deja vu Hemingway creates. Remember Georgette the prostitute? Reread Jake's encounter with Georgette earlier in the novel, after finishing TSAR. Then think about how Brett herself can be linked to prostitution. This might change your perception of the novels conclusion, though you will find it to be every bit as sad, if not more so.One reviewer here suggests the novel is about falling out of love. THis is very possible. Regardless of whether he still loves the idea of Brett that he had, Jake sees Brett very differently at the end of the novel. Once again, I beleive Georgette is crucial to this reading of the novel. There are many possible readings, but don't take things for granted when you read this book. Especially that the way Jake portrays Brett and Cohn acurratly reflects who they are. Remember, this is a first person narrator. This is an extremmely complex book that demands rereadings. Don't take for granted that the relationships and characters are as simple as you might be led to beleive."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The greatest book of the Twentieth Century? &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; is certainly one of them. Its themes of alienation, isolation, loss and self-absorbtion are still highly relevant today.

Beneath their revelry lies a deep disatisfaction, and it is this constrast that makes the characters so fascinating. This is a book that is not to be missed.

When Jake swims he is attempting to achieve some kind of control over his life. If you don't appreciate the novel, give yourself a chance to grow and discover that the key themes of our modern age: the recovery of lost humanity, the quest for spiritual meaning, the attempt to fashion a code of living--all these themes find their expression in this fine, poetic, and great novel.

Either that or stories that are morally edifiying in the most simplistic way possible. It's a sad, sad commentary in this age of &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; that so many people cannot appreciate the austere beauty of Hemingway's prose.

Some books are timeless--theme, characters, etc.--and others are best viewed in the year they were published. I think this is one of those books. For 1926, this would have been quite daring as a response to WWI, especially considering it was a new kind of war.The novel doesn't really make explicit assertions or come to any definitive conclusions; it's more like holding a mirror up to society: this is what is going on. I liked the dialogue and found some of the banter funny, and I did not find all of the characters completely hopeless. These stories work best as a series of short stories (Fitzgerald, Yates are good examples), which are more like a set of snapshots. This book does read like a short story in parts, especially Part I, and it is a quick read.I often see it on the Top 100 Novels lists, which is why I read it.

All in all, most members of our club are enjoying this classic."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"THE SUN ALSO RISES becomes airborne only after Hemingway establishes two characters. These are: Romero, the matador, who brings both excellence and integrity to his work; and Robert Cohn, a romantic who is in love with the alcoholic Lady Brett. When the powerful aspirations of these characters emerge in TSAR, the shallowness, emptiness, and cruelty of other characters--Jake Barnes, Bill Gorton, and Mike Campbell--finally comes into focus. Thereafter, TSAR is fabulous.But before these values are established, Hemingway seems only to be telling a story about the superficial sociability of thirty-somethings in the 1920's. These characters drink too much and are incapable of love, sometimes due to their wounding experiences in World War I. Their lives are mostly alcoholic busyness and Hemingway captures their tedious gaiety to perfection. But without the foils of excellence and idealism, these characters and their behavior seem merely dull, boyish, and humorless. Further, they are relentlessly anti-Semitic, which this reader experienced as a brainless reaction to the unrewarding and trivial content of their days and nights. (If something is wrong, blame Robert Cohn.)Stylistically, TSAR is uneven. Frequently, Hemingway uses a technique of following observations in strict temporal sequence. This works wonderfully when, say, Jake is praying in church and his mind moves, without much control, from one subject to the next. But this technique works less well when Hemingway describes the countryside, which is often. His style is: I saw this. Then I saw that. Next came this. The effect is that the writing doesn't attain focus. Here's one of many examples, this one from Chapter 10:\\"We came down out of the mountains and through an oak forest, and there were white cattle grazing in the forest. Down below there were grassy plains and clear streams, and then we crossed a stream and went through a gloomy village, and started to climb again. We climbed up and up and crossed another high Col and turned along it, and the road ran down to the right, and we saw a whole new range of mountains....\\"See what I mean? This is just a list, with Hemingway not bothering to pull what Jake sees into a single memorable and evolving image. I know: The professors say this is deliberate, with the imaginative reader knowing how this terse prose fits together visually. But aren't skilled authors supposed to do this work for their readers?"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Look at this passage:\\"We walked on and circled the island.

My husband says he feels the &#34;story is dragged out&#34; but this known famous writer is interesting, and it's good to be acquainted with one of his most famous books.

There is too much dialogue, he is not \\"at his best\\" in his descrption of the fishing day in Basque country, or the Basque country, or the bull-fights. His novel comes off, as a character in A Moveable Feast told him of his Literature, too, skinny, too sinewy.

Hemingway captured \\"The Lost Generation\\" in these pages. His use of terse, journalistic prose was revolutionary.

Read it if you are already a Hemingway fan or plan to see the recently mounted play \\"The Select\\" that used the novel as script."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is the real thing. This is the work that made Hemingway an icon of American 20th century literature. And no wonder. With its inimitable style (notwithstanding all the author's imitators), this novel brings you into the room with these characters, who are suffering, and you suffer along with them. They're suffering not only because they've just been through a ghastly war, but because they are 20-somethings, and have the same angst as all 20-somethings, besides the shadows the war has cast on all of them.This tender age group, on the cusp of life and yet often feeling tragically lost, is a fascinating subject in literature, and I've just got to mention a special favorite of mine -- a contemporary novel that explores the concerns and struggles of some of today's 20-somethings. It's called Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf and it's by Asher Brauner."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"It seems that Hemmingway readers are divided into two distinct camps. There are those who adore Hemmingway for literary and life-style reasons and those who abhor his writing altogether. Whenever I present my mild appreciation of Hemmingway to members of either extreme, they become irate. The former, tell me he's a genius, while the latter argue that a child could write like Hemmingway. Frankly, they are both wrong.&quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; contains much of the fuel that Hemmingway haters consume. The writing is quite simple and much of the dialog is strained and even a bit macho. The novel, in their opinion, could be construed as a hundred plus page promotion of the Hemmingway life style. It's got travel, brawling, love, conflict, fishing, bullfighting, and a lots of fun sportsman line stuff. It contains a Hemmingway motif that I've never really liked, namely discourse of the glamorous yet victimized war hero.Hemmingway lovers will counter these arguments by pointing out that simplicity in writing and dialog is not a bad thing, especially when the author uses it as self-consciously as Hemmingway does. True, the language is a bit strained and macho, but the story is, after all, narrated by an adventurous and heartbroken World War I veteran. I can't imagine this person and his expatriate colleagues engaging in the subtle, serpentine conversations found in a Henry James novel. As for the travel, the bullfighting, and the other activities that we have come to associate with the Hemmingway lifestyle-so what? It's a great travelogue among other things.I guess my own opinion is largely in favor of Hemmingway although I agree with a lot of his critics. Hemmingway is a great story teller and &quot;Sun Also Rises&quot; is an exceptionally good story. Hemmingway's language is imperfect but certainly adequate. Ultimately, I read literature to be transformed to another place or state of mind and Hemmingway certainly accomplishes that for me.To Hemmingway's critics, I would argue that one does not have to be subtle, nor write a novel of ideas to be a great author. To his proponents I would also argue that the man is a good writer, a great story teller, and a fascinating character in his own right, but certainly not a genius.I recommend &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; to anyone interested in a good story, a unique writing style, and an interesting portrayal of the so called &quot;lost generation&quot;."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This novel, it has been written, was one of Hemingway's favorites. It certainly is not mine. I am listening to this book on tape and I am glad I didn't purchase the book. It is ok to listen to during rush hour traffic but not with precious evening hours. If you are into the late 90's politically correct scene, this book will offend you time and time again. I understand that in 1926 it was a different time, but Hemingway degrades Jews, Catholics, and I can't even use his derogatory word for the black fighter. Bull fights? Yeah, yeah, yeah, so what?"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is the only book of Hemmingway's that I have read, and perhaps it's therefore unfair to characterize him by just one effort. However, I chose this because it seemed to be recognized as one of his best.Alas, for me, this book was nothing more than dead ordinary. If this is all that there is to Ernest Hemmingway, I am mystified as to why he has such fame. It's pretty pedestrian stuff, that (forgive me Hemmingway devotees) is really not worthy of notice. It is not awful, just awfully average. He makes no great mistakes, but also fails to do a single thing that would elevate him above the teeming ranks of authors out there. I slogged through it dutifully, waiting for the book to come alive, to show some wit, or intellect, or creative artistic expression, right down to the last page I was still waiting. And, I concluded - So! That's Ernest Hemmingway???Why does anyone care?"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I will never understand Ernest Hemingway's appeal. His labored attempts at understating everything, his affected grittiness, his belief in himself as adventurer and someone who truly experiences life all make me want to throw up. This book is the perfect example of how terrible he is. I'll give you some examples from within the book so you can think about it a little more.Number one is Brett. The \\"heroine\\" of the book, she is a heartless 34-year old nymphomaniac who is self-absorbed and callous, not to mention elitist and stupid. The \\"hero\\" of the book, manly man Jake, \\"loves\\" her. What a great love story. Jake is too \\"injured\\" to make love to her, so she sleeps with a number of other people during the book. Number two is Cohn. This character, created out of the author's anti-semitic imagination, is a simpering bookish fool who, the narrator lets us know, is too cowardly to enjoy things like bullfights. Only a manly man would enjoy the spectacle of a matador being gored by a tortured animal, of course.Cohn is apparently equally contemptable because he wants to hang out with gentiles (How DARE he?!), but Jake is magnanimous enough to let him. Brett is magnanimous enough to sleep with him, but looks down on him for being a Jew. (Lovely people, aren't they?). Hemingway wants us to revile Cohn because he took the affair with Brett too seriously and actually got jealous when she slept with someone else. We're supposed to laugh at Cohn's emotionality and inability to be a wasp.I can't tell you how pointless this book is. What's the moral? Is there one? I don't think there is. If a book isn't engrossing, or exciting, or beautifully written (therefore art for art's sake) it has to have a message. This book fails on all counts."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Oddly enough, while I was reading &quot;The Sun Also Rises,&quot; I wasn't overly impressed. As always, Hemingway's writing is outrageously good; in parts of the novel I almost had to stop and catch my breath in admiration of the work Hemingway produced. Nevertheless, I was growing impatient with the storyline, the characters entering and re-entering the novel, and the large amount of information that seemed irrelevant to any sort of larger theme. I was actually quite disappointed as I finished the book.However, without any planning on my part, the book all began to make sense once I had given my mind time to put the pieces together. I then discovered, much to my initial surprise, that &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; is amazing, absolutely incredibly engrossing literature. First of all, credit must be given to Hemingway's unique writing style. The direct, minimal tone of the novel is brilliant; no words are ever used that could be excised from the novel, and this allows Hemingway to say far, far more with a few words than other authors could with far more. Also, the characters are so well defined that they leap off the page. Each and every character in the book, including minor characters, not only ring true but become familiar to the reader as time goes on. And finally, once the book has settled in, the themes and concepts Hemingway had in mind become clear; disillusionment, amorality, and loss of innocence.In sum, &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; is not a book that will be immediately enjoyable. You're going to have to put some effort into this to get a lot out of it. Nevertheless, Hemingway rewards the work the book requires by creating one of the most fascinating, insightful, entertaining, and well-written novels I've read in a long time. It may require a lot of effort, but it's worth it."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"All other published readings pale in comparison to this one.

This novel could change someone's life. It is a good example of why Hemingway the greatest 20th century writer.Mr. Hager, there are plenty of books with raunchy sex scenes, things blowing up and ghosts and goblins.

However, I found the subject matter of the text to be exhausting. The text repeatedly describes having meals, then wine, then more wine with ample whining. All of the main players exhibit self-pity and complete absence of self-esteem (whether it be externally and/or internally presented).If you read this, be prepared to be bored out of your wits. However, also be prepared to continue reading through until the end anticipating some climax. Although not necessarily &quot;enjoyable&quot;, it is still an influential novel that is worth reading."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Writing a reader review of a classic might be considered a fool's errand (what is there to say that hasn't been said) but my re-reading of Fiesta made a sufficiently strong impression on me that I'm motivated to say a few words.I'd originally read this book ten years ago as a college undergraduate; a chore forced upon me as part of a course requirement. In the years that followed I've become a fan of contemporary writers like Richard Ford, J. M. Coetzee, and Howard Norman for their brutally economical style. But upon my re-reading of Fiesta I'm reminded of what I perhaps knew all along - it all started with Hemmingway.In Fiesta, as in all of Hemmingway's works, you find yourself concentrating on what is said, rather than how it is said. This makes the characters compelling and real. One thing that makes this novel a classic is the fact that the characters are as immediate and relevant now as they were when the novel appeared in 1926.The book has a variety of lively and beautiful settings throughout the Spanish countryside, focusing famously on the bullfights in Pamplona. Hemmingway brings these sights and sounds to life. In terms of human nature, however, there isn't much pretty to be seen. Envy, alcoholism, racism, and despair are the main currents of emotion, consuming a group of rich well-bred expatriates who on the surface shouldn't have a care in the world..A powerful, subtle, novel. If you, like me, were beaten over the head with this novel as part of your college literature requirements then give it another try."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This book is about a man, Jake Barnes and his friends, a bunch of American and English expatriates living Paris in the aftermath of the Great War. The book begins with a Gertrude Stein quote, \\"You are a lost generation ... \\" followed an excerpt from the book of Ecclesiastes, chapter 1, which I put here:\\"Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever ... The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, And hastens to the place where it arose. The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course. All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again.\\"You can see where the title of the book comes from.I think that the Stein quote, the Ecclesiastes excerpt and a little bit of a background on the existential despair that characterized Europe after WWI help us to understand the book. All these folks, Jake and his friends are stuck in life. They are constantly moving about and doing things, but they are all existentially stuck somewhere and cannot seem to move out.To say it more in an Indian fashion. These folks are stuck in a this-worldy-samsara and each is looking for one thing or another to get them out of it.* You can see this in their daily lives as Hemingway describes it. So much of what goes on with them seems to be just a constant flitting from place to place, cafe to cafe, bar to bar, restaurant to restaurant, drink to drink, lover to lover and it never seem to end or settle anywhere. Life is a bunch of circles for them. You go here. You go there. You do this. You do that. You do this. You do that. (Is this getting dull to read?) In the end you wind up right back where you started. What is the point of any of this? They are truly a lost generation.And amidst all this Jake has a particular problem that affects so much of his life and which would seem to be like an anchor dropped in this dead world making his escape from samsara futile. So what will happen? Will he ever escape? And what of his compatriots? What will get them out of where they are?*In Hinduism, there is this concept called samsara. It refers to the unending cycle of rebirth and death that we are all trapped in. Likewise I say, even within our own life, there is a sort of a this-worldly samsara, in which we get stuck in, that is characterized by unending routines, cycles and monotony. Its the same thing over and over again. \\"Meaningless!

I enjoyed reading it in college and wanted to re-experience it as a more mature reader. Knowing more about Hemingway's life made me want to explore some of the autobiographical elements of the novel.Reading this book made me want to drink! I was amazed at how much was consumed, and Jake Barnes and his friends could turn their drunkenness on and off like a switch. They often used their \\"tightness\\" as an excuse for their unsavory behavior. The banter was somewhat redundant, but the bullfighting scenes were exciting. Hemingway really captured the atmosphere of Spain and Fiesta. He also illustrated the tension and combativeness of Jake's group, specifically between Robert Cohn and Brett and Mike. The moral ambiguity is at the heart of this book and it is an enduring commentary on the \\"lost generation.\\""},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"'Fiesta: The Sun Also Rises' is the first Hemingway book I read many years ago and is one i've recently re-read. Partly autobiographical and based on his time in Paris, this book showcases Hemingways style perfectly. Short, well crafted sentences that portray the full feeling in any given scene without you realising how deeply you are being affected. You get a sense of feeling of the characters without truly knowing them, which is kind of true of life and a unique talent Hemingway shares. The book builds in tension as the group of friends move to Pamplona for the fiesta and bull running until it reaches it's climax. The end is in no way earth shattering, but a true example of human nature and the mistakes that we make that plague us so. I tend to feel that there are other Hemingway books to try first (Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls) but as the first book of his I read, this has a special place in my heart and is definitely well worth a read to immerse yourself in the style and book that truly made him famous. If you enjoy this then try 'A Moveable Feast' which is the memoirs of his time in Paris and a wonderful read.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This was a terrific purchase.

Sure,Old Man And The Sea (Scribner Classics), my Dad had it lying around when I was a kid. A month long vacation traveling through Spain seemed like a perfect opportunity to get started.It's a great description of \\"the expat life\\" and the Basque country was not so very different when I first traveled there in the early nineties. When I was last there in 2007 it had fast forwarded into what seemed like the 1980s. Shame.Two very memorable characters in Jake Barnes and Brett Ashley, forever battling the wound that will never heal. They and their motley crew have \\"a wonderful nightmare\\" at the Pamplona fiesta. I'm not going to give away the plot here but my thinking is that all of the male characters (Cohn, Bill and Mike) represent different aspects of Jake's personality that he is either suppressing (Cohn and Mike) or aspiring to (Bill). Even the great Pedro Romero - Pedro loving and Pedro fighting both bulls and men seems to represent Jake's not so subconscious. That doesn't give away the story line but see if you don't agree after reading.The Pamplona fiesta is mostly foreign turistas and creeps now. If you would still like to see a more authentic fiesta complete with bullfighting (though no \\"bull-running\\") try Ronda in September. Ronda is the birthplace of both bullfighting and Pedro Romero and is also featured in Hemmingway'sFor Whom the Bell Tolls (Paperback). People travel from all over southern Spain for the fiesta.

The bullfights are the centerpiece here, in addition to the character of Lady Ashley, who exerts her powers over most of the men in the book. I kept waiting for something more dreadful to happen. The \\"lost generation\\" of men and women who went through WWI had their so-called voice in this book.

Frankly, some 15 year old could have written this aimless plot, inane observations on life, and general inability to maintain the reader's interest.Now, will someone please explain why the hell bullfighting is such a noble effort anyway. I mean there are soldiers (even in Hemingway's time) fighting and dying for great causes, poor people struggling with poverty and disease, ...And this Hemingway decides that some boring jackass trying to bag some idiotic English woman - while wasting his time in bull fighting arenas is somehow a great, noble story worth caring about?If this book doesnt convince you that Hemingway writes junk, try 'The Old Man and the Sea' now this may intended to be a meditation on what makes a creature (man or fish) noble but to me it was another children's book which might be more interesting if it had been written by a child."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest Hemingway is the most overrated writer in American literature. Just because the man lived a romantic life (i.e. he drank a lot) doesn't mean he has to be worshipped by everybody. I hate the way people act like to be of any intellectual capacity you have to like Hemingway. Well guess what? The man can't write! The novel is boring, boring, boring. Nothing ever happens. The characters just go from one meaningless event to the other always speaking in short, little sentences and drinking gallons upon gallons of alcohol.( I'm not kidding here. These characters DRINK. There isn't a scene in this book without some form of alcohol being consumed.) Everyone raves about Hemingway's \\"curt\\" style. Well, it annoys me to no end. I think his style is due more to his limited vocabulary than his innovative ideas. I hated every single one of his characters. They all have the most annoying characteristics you can think a human being could have. They are whiny, spoiled, and lazy. I literally wanted to jump inside the book and trash them all. I think most people hate this book too but they are afraid that they'll be labeled \\"ignorant\\" if they admit it so they play the part and rave about it. Do not, I repeat, do not read this book.

This is unfortunate because Hemingway's best books were written early in his career, from about 1924 to 1940. I feel that his most complete vision was achieved in For Whom the Bell Tolls, which is a large book with all of Hemingway's ideas, interspersed with a thrilling plot. If I had a second choice, I'd vote for Sun Also Rises. Obviously the famous Hemingway style derived from Gertrude Stein and journalism. Then he wrote about Post-WW1 cynicism and a love gone awry. The famous Lost Generation mops up Parisian wine and European despair with vigor.The villain is Cohn the Jew. I have some reservations here of course. I feel the same way about Shakespeare's Shylock, but putting historical prejudices aside, Cohn personifies what is not cool about intellectual society in the Twenties. Cohn doesn't get Paris, bullfighting, or fishing. He's a great boxer, but does not box for the right reasons. Don't worry, Hem will explain what are the right reasons. Worst of all, Cohn doesn't get the sexual revolution. An \\"affair of the lady\\" has certain considerations to uphold, but in the aftermath of his liaison with Lady Ashley, the flapper vamp, Cohn hangs around like a pathetic puppy longing for bitch's milk.Barnes, the Hemingway surrogate has a problem. He's had a war accident and has lost essential male equipment, which makes it impossible for Lady Ashley and Hem, er Barnes to consummate a raging desire and love. Hence, the seething irony of Sun Also Rises, the uncool Cohn is able to perform while the very cool Barnes can only watch bulls being killed beautifully. \\"Wouldn't it be pretty?\\""},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also RisesThe Sun Also rises is no cliche love story where boy falls in love with girl,girl falls in love with boy, they get married and live happily ever after.

Money brings friends, love and happiness.The more you spend money the happier and more loved you will be.Most of these expenses are frivolous.. Mostly money is spent in bars, travel and \\"partying\\". Partying is also highly valued. Partying and wine or anything that can get you drunk.With all these priorities love is only a feeling in the background.Infatuation invokes attention more than any feelings of true love.True love rarely appears and is ignored when it does.This story took place mainly in France and in Spain. If you have never been in France or Spain this book eagerly attempts to show them to you, but in a stereotypical sense.Personally I did not like the book.. I found it hard to relate to and the occasional phrases in French did not make it easier. Nothing much happens in the way of a plot either. There is a lot of dialogue which is hard to follow because it is hard to tell whose talking. You have to concentrate to understand what your reading which some people may find intriguing but if you skip a few pages you wont miss much!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I was lucky enough to find this book at goodwill for 79 cents. I wasn't going to get it at first, but then I looked inside the front cover. The following message was written,&quot;Sam, I am sorry we did not spend more time together. Ciest la vie, Ernest Hemingway&quot; It was a copy from the late fifties. So It very well could be signed by him. And if it is whoever got rid of it is silly. If it is not his signature, oh well it is still a great book."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I really didn't like this book, and find it hard to see why anyone else would. Sometimes the prose was so simple and repetitive that I felt I was reading a Dick and Jane episode. It was unnerving to come across so many descriptions of something as \\"nice\\" or \\"swell,\\" as if this said anything but that the speaker liked something. I had to force myself to finish it, but I was determined to do so, in case Papa Hemingway could have justified this book later in the text.The characters: people who couldn't keep their hands off booze. Everywhere they went it was opening another bottle, pouring another drink, many times until they were so drunk the world seemed to be spinning around or they just got plain obnoxious. And Lady Ashley? She must have had a nice body, because her character was simply sluttish. Everyone seemed to be smitten by her, whereas she would cavort with anything in pants.I'm revisiting Hemingway and Fitzgerald, two noted authors of the first half of the twentieth century. I didn't care for Fitzgerald's obsession with the rich of the Roaring 20s, but at least he could write sentences that flowed. Compared with Ernest's endeavor in this tale, Fitz was a master stylist.This book of Hemingway's should have lots of appeal to alcoholics, just as so many of Raymond Carver's tales. Pouring drinks, making toasts, opening a bottle, ordering a drink, filling up the glass again, getting \\"tight\\" over and over and over, and then speaking nonsense for the rest of the scenes, then congratulating themselves afterward for the \\"swell\\" times they had.What was the point of all this? I have to feel those who rave about the work are just awed by Hemingway's reputation and his Nobel Prize. If this was the work of an unknown, they'd be here trashing it mercilessly.Boredom, tedium, despair, with only their drunken spells to relieve the emptiness of their lives. I find it hard to believe this book was even published, for either the prose style or the content. Hemingway must have had some friends in the publishing business."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"i had to read this book for my senior english class. now normally i try to be optamistic about assigned reading but that was nearly impossible to do conserning this piece of literature. one of the main things that annoyed me the most about this book was that the narrator doesnt even introduce new characters. or rather he will introduce them in fragments later on. he just talks about a brand spankin new character as if you had already known them your entire life.another thing that bothered me is the fact the this book goes absolutely nowhere. the narrator just tells about his day. everyhting about his day. where he went to eat what he drank, what person he ran into. its like a minute-by-minute recount of his day. it takes so long reading just the filler that, when there actually is something important going on, you completely miss it.also some characters go off on some completely random subjects, its hard to make out their point. if there is any point to be made at all.through most of the book i was in a daze trying to force myself to read and comprehend this book when all i was really doing was looking at the words without paying attention to them. i COULDNT pay attention to them.this book might be fine in dandy for people who like rambling, annoying, old style literature; but for younger, more modern people... it is a HUGE WASTE OF TIME. not that some of us really have a choice in the matter, we have to read it if we wanna have a decent grade in english class."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I must say that I am a fan of books of all types, and very rarely do I find one that I just can't follow.

Rarely have I found a book I couldn't even follow on tape. However, this was one.There doesn't seem to be a real plot to this book. It rambles on and on about people wandering all over Europe, mostly drunk or trying to get drunk, but nothing ever really seems to happen. I will not judge Hemmingway on this one work, as it is supposed to be about the \\"lost generation\\", but listening to it made me feel like I was \\"lost\\". I also just couldn't tolerate the bigotry prevalant in the writing. While I can step away from a classic piece of literature and say \\"hey, that was then, this is now...\\" when it comes to cultural attitudes, this book, with its lack of plot, made the speach about the \\"nigger\\" fighter stand out as the only section I remembered.I will not be recommending this book to anyone.

The dialogue (of which most of the book is written)is corny and the only charcters worth saving are the natives that are encountered in the Basque Region and Pamplona.Thankfully Hemingway wrote less than 200 pages. I kept hoping that the story would end with Lady Ashley, Jake Barnes, Robert Cohen, and the other &quot;ugly americans&quot; and arrogant Brits entering a detox center and becoming the initial success stories of AA."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I just finished reading \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" by Ernest Hemingway and can't imagine why he's so popular. The story was aimless meandering - pointless and plotless, and the characters were pitiful. I wouldn't normally have chosen to read it, but it was the selection of the month for my book discussion group.The main character, Jake, told the story in the first person but gave away very little information about himself. He and his loser friends wandered around Europe, staying in various degrees of intoxication throughout the book. He seemed to be having a platonic love affair with the main female character, Brett, who came to him with her problems and disappointments, declared her hopeless love for him, and then went off to sleep with one of his drunken friends.Nothing ever really happened in the book; no mission to accomplish, no barrier to overcome, no antagonist to beat. Hemingway spent very little effort describing his characters and far too much effort reporting on the scenery. There was alot of dialogue, but inane, redundant, and mostly meaningless. I don't know what Heminway's personal views on ethnic and racial diversity were, but this book was definintely not \\"politically correct.\\"The only real 'action' (if you can call it that) was a very boring description of an uneventful fishing trip to Spain, and then a fiesta and the accompanying fireworks and bullfights. At this point Hemingway broke all the literary rules of perspective and switched from first person point-of-view to omniscient and proceeded to go into detailed descriptions of the bull-fighters and their thoughts and motivations. It was the most enthusiasm he'd shown throughout the entire book.None of the characters knew what they really wanted and let life drift by them in a drunken fog. If this book has any message at all, then it must be that life is meaningless without a goal to reach or a cause to believe in."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises is an even steadiness of style and description, settings and characters. The smart reader understands this book better. After researching on Hemingway, I find that \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" reflects his life.The characters are often drunks, who love to travel and take a very big interest in bullfighting. It's a great book with many consequences that deal with human nature.The love affairs and jealousy occurs with everyday life for some people. Hemmingway's style of writing is not the \\"perfect style\\" that we read in every other book. He uses a vulgar style. Hemingway has created these characters to be continuously frustrating and apparently beyond hope, but in doing so he makes them friendly, attractive, and people that every human being can relate to.I enjoyed reading his book. And for his first book, I would say that he did very well. Once I started reading it, I could not put it own. I am interested in the social life that happens in the book. The love affairs, drunkenness, and racial comments are things we deal with or see everyday. The way he describes the different places, such as Paris is so simple and laid back, making the reader feel as though they are really there. He has a unique style. This is an enjoyable book if you are interested in the lifestyle that these characters live."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The only other Hemingway book I have ever read was \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" but this was far better. Hemingway worked hard to write his stories. And the result shows in this one. Not much plot except the constant running around France and Spain drinking all the time. Probably a lot like Hemingway's life was. His descriptions of the countryside are amazing and you can almost visualize the landscape. The British fellow Michael was by far the funniest character and he reminded me of Cary Grant. Overall I thought I wouldn't like the book because I'm not an \\"affecion\\" or however you spell it about Bull Fights. (In fact I detest them.) The story wasn't about bull fights. It was a love story that could never happen. I found myself coming in from work and grabbing right for the book. I'm young and I don't usually read but this book was captivating to me. I really enjoy reading books set in this era and have yet to see a modern day author put together a book as good as Hemingway or Steinbeck. Until then I will stick with the classics!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I had to read \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" for school. As a sixteen-year-old, I could very well say how much I thought the story [was bad] but in all honest, I really enjoyed this book. I was about the \\"Lost Generation\\" feeling out of place after World War I. Trying to go on with there lives in a war that changed their lives forever. They are looking for meaning for life and truth and freedom.I think the thing that made me so intrigued in this book is that ii was a real story. About real people. And there real problems. Real people, trying to grab a hold onto thier lives. Trying to find where they belong. With there same old boring problems and their same old mixed up lives.This book, in a way, speaks to me."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I thought this novel was quite boring. Let me give you the bottom line. A group of people drank at clubs to get away from their problems and all they thought about was sex. Everyone is this story is so concerned about themselves that it's sickening. All they think about is how they need to satisfy their sexual needs and to cope with that, they drank like every night. I thought Jake, the main character and the narrator, shouldn't have gone through all of this. He doens't deserve all this pain. He's an innocent man that just wants his \\"crush\\" Brett to return his love.This novel is somewhat similar to modern life now. People do drink to get away from their everyday troubles. But after reading this novel, you realize that love is not about sex. It's about true love."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises was a pretty good book, but I personally think that Brett and Jake should have ended up together because they both were in love with each other. Brett pretty much just played with Jakes emotions and when he thought that he was going to get his way with her she just left him for another guy or asked him for help with some guy. She may have loved Jake but she had a stronger love for money. I think that if her lust for money weren't so strong they would have ended up together.Earnest Hemmingway in all his books portrays him himself and his life excursions. Jake Barnes is the character that is depicted as Hemmingway himself. Jakes wound in World War 1 makes it impossible to ever have physical love with anyone, and especially Brett, the one he truly wanted to love. Brett's tendency to run around with different men all the time drives him even further into depression and drinking. The drinking also shows Hemingway himself, because he was a drunk."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The point of TSAR is not to convey any specific story, but the general story of the Lost Generation. The focus on atmospheric detail and characterisation rather than plot is purposeful. Hemingway gives us a portrait of youths who are aimless, without moral centre and weakened/impotent.A similar work, from ten years ago rather than eighty, is Douglas Coupland's Generation X. I recommend reading both: the deja vu is palpable. Those of us who are Gen X or Y might not find much comfort in having Hemingway as a partner in disillusionment and malaise, but it is at least heartening that those generations that get &quot;lost&quot; can still produce such beautiful (if stark) literature.The Sun Also Rises is not only a classic, it is as relevant in 2001 as the 1920s. It's also good for the Spanish tourism industry ;-)."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Most of the characters of in this book (except for Pedro and some of the other minor characters) are war veterans from WWI. The narrator of this book is Jake Barnes. The world where Jake lives in is full of carelessness and aimless hedonist. Their only cure from the war is endless drinking and visiting cafes, restaurants, dance halls, parties, traveling, and sexual relationships (their obsession with Lady Brett Ashley). All the men are craving for a relationship Brett. However, she is deeply in love with Jake. For Jake and Brett, they are unattainable, but are emotionally dependant on each other. Hemmingway does a good job in depicting the emotions of the characters and the atmosphere of the different events that happen in the book. (the parties, dance halls, fiestas, and bull fighting.) Also, Hemmingway brings the characters alive through his descriptions and makes the readers almost feel as though they are a part of all the happenings in the book. This book is strongly recommended for those of you who are willing to learn about the &quot;lost generation&quot; after WWI. Two thumbs up! :)"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This was my first read of Hemingway. It was not quite what I expected. It was a damned good read, though. Reading this book makes you almost feel like you are with Jake (the character who is the first person narrator of this book) boozing it up, and doing manly things.If you were given to harsh judgments, you might say that the characters of this book are rather shallow and without much in the way of moral character. The Robert Cohn character might be the exception in this book. Even though he is a bit pathetic, I found myself sympathizing with him.Without giving much more away, buy this book. It really is fun."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest Hemingway's first novel, &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;, is about &quot;the lost generation&quot; in Paris and Pamplona after WWI. The 1920's is a time of a crisis of beliefs, lack of faith in the world or personal values, and all the characters do in the book is drink most of the time. Well, what else can they do? The world they once knew before the war has been shattered, and Ernest Hemingway uses his own experiences to write a spare and hard prose about their lives. The &quot;main&quot; characters are Jake Barnes, Lady Brett Ashley, Robert Cohn, Bill Gorton, Michael, and other assorted characters. They all live it up in Paris, and then Jake decides to go to Pamplona to witness the bullfights during a fiesta, and Jake will be with his aficionado friends of Spain. However, the whole gang come over and Jake's last &quot;best place&quot; where he feels some kind of security is ruined as the fiesta &quot;of drunks&quot; gets worse. Since I've read this book for Engl 111 (intro course to literature), I have finally &quot;met&quot; Ernest Hemingway and his mind. I recommend this book for more serious readers, as you must delve into the theme that Hemingway &quot;paints&quot;."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"somehow, hemmingway managed to create a novel that I loved despite the lack of characters that could be described as remotely likeable. and despite a strong aversion to bullfights (due to a rather startling childhood experience) I was caught up in the bullfighting scences, even to the point where I thought of it as beautiful. it was an intriguing read, and I highly reccommend it. but as has been mentioned, with hemmingway it seems like you either love him or hate him, and if you hate him you'll probably find this one more disagreable than most."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"It's Hemingway, so, of course, the prose is sparse and the sense of place is compelling. If only the characters had any redeeming social value! Perhaps it's the times we live in, but I couldn't help wishing that these people would just shut up, sober up, stop whining and get a job!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I approached this book not knowing very much about Ernest Hemingway (I only knew that he killed himself and that he wrote in short sentences). So, I can give a review that has no assumptions.The main character, Jake, is a guy that I could go drinking with. While he has his own opinions on things, he will listen to what you have to say. You can have many conversations with the man, on a variety of topics, and Jake can keep up with you and keep the conversation lively. He doesn't thrust his opinions on you, but \\"tells it like it is\\". Jake can hang with those flaky expatriates that live in Paris, and be friends with them. However, Jake has deeper feelings that are not quite written in the book, but you can sense them.For beginners, Jake is hopelessly in love with a seriously \\"high maintenance\\" beauty named Brett - but he won't completely admit it (he actually does, but then withdraws when she shrugs him off), and he tries to fake bravado or coolness or whatever, so that he won't appear weak or desperate to her. The girl of his dreams is not really someone you'd marry and settle down with, but he's in love with her, and maybe the two of them can continue on their partying ways after they marry - or maybe Jake hopes to settle her down. To me, the tragedy of the novel is Jake's love for this woman, and it is hopeless for him to believe that he can have a life with her. Jake's character is poignant in this regard, and I was truly saddened by his character.Ernest Hemingway's writing is economical, to say the least. He writes like a newspaperman (no coincidence that the main character is a newspaper reporter). His sentences are very short/staccato. As you read the book, the pages fly by so quickly that you can devour the book in just a few hours - I owe this to the quickness of the prose and, of course, to the short length of the novel. I loved Hemingway's writing style - each sentence gets to the point, and only the point. But while many of these short sentences seem simply to describe things, there is a lot of intention between the lines. So, while the writing is economical, there is more than meets the eye.Also, I felt like I was riding along with Jake on his trip to Spain (honestly, I felt like a buddy tagging along). Most likely, I would have done the same things as Jake does (assuming I was still single, maybe a little younger). That is, we'd go out and see the sights, walk around, and drink. I have to admit that the characters do more drinking than I would on such a trip (beer with breakfast for instance), but I think I could hang with them for a couple of days. Although, in the throes of drink, the characters can get quite mean - which seems to fall in with reality.Now that you know my feelings about the book, here's a summary of the novel.Jake is the center of the novel. He's a newspaper writer who wants to go the the Pamplona bull fights in Spain. Before he goes, he introduces us to two other major characters in Brett and Robert. As an unfortunate sign of the times, Robert's \\"Jewness\\" is something that is brought up more forcefully than would be politically correct nowadays. I am not sure what the purpose of letting us know that Robert is a Jew, unless it's supposed to be some opposite of the Catholicism practiced by Jake (and the hap-hazard way that Brett practices Catholicism).In any case, both Brett and Robert end up in Pamplona with Jake, along with a couple of other people Jake knows - including a guy who has married Brett (although Brett is nowhere near a marriageable person - I think her husband suffers the misery that Jake would if Brett had married him).While in Pamplona, Jake meets these other people he knows and goes fishing. Jake does a good job of describing the scenes that they pass through, and the bull fights are given in wonderful detail. I learned a lot about these fights (personally, I find bull fighting reprehensible, but Jake describes things in such a matter-of-fact way that I could deal with them). Of course, a lot of alcohol is consumed, his girl Brett has eyes for a bull fighter, and Robert becomes a big problem.As an event, the Pamplona Bull Fights and the festivities surrounding them, were very vividly told and the reader is along for the ride.After the bull fights, Jake still has some vacation time left and manages to avoid home for another week. Brett meets with him, and it is here that we see that Jake and Brett are never to be - but I'm sure they will remain friends forever.I was really heartbroken by the character of Jake, someone who can't have the woman he wants, even though he is certainly willing to make any concession for his potential girl. I even suspect that Jake would put up with Brett's infidelities, just so long as she came home to him.One last bit of warning to the readers of today involves a certain derogatory term used to describe blacks (the \\"N word\\"). Jake, and others, casually use this word. I didn't feel like they did so in a hurtful sense, but I did think the word was meant to indicate that the blacks were somehow not on the same level as whites (Robert, the Jew, suffered similarly). The time frame of this novel was right after WWI, but I have no concept of the feelings of the time, so I can't comment on the hatefulness implied by this term - but I am guessing that its use wasn't pleasant to those to whom it referred, and it wasn't meant as a pleasantly."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest Hemingway pioneered the way for a revolutionary literary technique known as the Iceberg Theory. His writing became famous for evoking true sentiment without the use of dull, verbose language. On the surface, it appears that the words are very simple; sentences containing only three words or less are everywhere. The true wonder of The Sun Also Rises doesn't lie in its simplicity, but in the fact that the true emotion lies underneath the words through the process of omitting what is unnecessary to reveal the more important themes that too many words can mask.As Hemingway's debut novel, this book is a literary landmark. Modern writers give more consideration to deciding whether they would rather emulate Hemingway's style or avoid it than any other author. His style is very unique and broke new ground during his time. Hemingway uses terse prose focusing on short, truncated sentences and long passages of dialogue mixed with vivid description and subtle but powerful characterization.The Sun Also Rises is the quintessential novel of the \\"lost generation\\" of youth after WWI. Jake Barnes, the hopelessly depressed main character, has suffered a traumatic injury during the war that has left him impotent and unable to physically support his true love, Lady Brett Ashley. Brett is consumed by social norms and cannot allow herself to be with Jake because of his condition, claiming she would \\"tromper\\" him with other men. The relationship between these two characters, narrated by Barnes, is absolutely brilliant. The futility of love as well as the aimlessness of life carries the book.Other characters include the Jewish middleweight champion and semi-accomplished writer, Robert Cohn. Cohn is constantly teased by Brett's partner, Mike Campbell, a violent drunk who has gone bankrupt after the war but chooses decadence over frugality. Bill Smith, Jake's close friend, seems to be the least disillusioned member of Jake's group, but he is not without his violent tendencies.The story focuses on the travels of these young men and Brett as they travel from Paris to Pamplona to see the Fiesta di San Fermin. The group seems to meander with no purpose, showing the accepted beliefs of veterans after WWI. They travel from place to place with no purpose, getting \\"tight\\" at every place they can.The book climaxes with perhaps the greatest description of the Spanish countryside and culture in all of literature. In Pamplona, the friends witness the encierros de toros (literally \\"running of bulls\\") into the amphitheater where they watch Pedro Romero, a handsome and talented young bullfighter, do his work.The beauty of this Spanish festival has forever been immortalized by Hemingway's simple prose that needs to be read to be believed. The near perfect detail of the European country and urban life is very believable. Hemingway has a good balance of choosing true sentiment over sentimentality. The book is simple yet complex, and very satisfying. The language contrasts between pages of dialogue that take very little time to read and pages of long, descriptive paragraphs. Sometimes this effect was dizzying as it took the reader in and out of the scenes too quickly. I often found myself confused when the tone would shift from very limited conversation to excessive, detailed paragraphs about the surrounding area. It also didn't help that three or more people are usually speaking at once, and an indication of who is actually speaking is rarely presented. Sometimes there is no way to tell, but the reader can assume who is speaking based on their choice of words (Jake speaks very little, Brett applies forced British slang).Very often, the reader forgets that the characters in the book are American. At times, even the characters themselves need to be reminded. The characters are pseudo-intellectuals, abandoning their morals to assimilate into the luxury of European culture. They believe that money can truly buy them friends, and they flaunt about their successes but rarely reflect on their flaws.The excessive use of alcohol may not be appropriate for everyone. In nearly every scene, the characters are drinking or asking a friend to have a drink. Clearly, the characters are trying to escape from the traumas of the war. However, the repetition becomes predictable very early on and stays throughout the whole book. The idiosyncrasies of each character are only truly seen during their instances of extreme drunkenness, whether it be anti-Semitism or proclamations of love and hate or violence.The novel ends much like it begins. Jake and Brett are in a car, hopelessly lost and in love. After the celebrations have ended, the two characters can't help ending up in the same place no matter how much they try to escape, much like the sun will always rise and fall in the same place every single day.Only 1/8 of an iceberg is visible from the surface of the ocean. For readers of The Sun Also Rises, I recommend that you dig deep into the words on the page in order to reveal a better understanding of Hemingway's intention and to improve the reading experience overall."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This was the first thing I'd read by Hemingway.

I guess veterans experience that at a young age. Now that everyone from back then is dead it has special historical value."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Quoting our book club secretary: \\"Hemingway captures the essence of the Lost Generation of American expatriates in Europe after World War I. Our book club decided that while we did not like the characters in the book, we could see that Hemingway shows their disillusionment, depression, immorality, dishonesty, carelessness, and angst. Jake Barnes, the most 'stable' of the characters, seems to be the voice of the author as he tries to make some sense of the confusion and alcohol-fueled madness of his friends. Although they are always celebrating, no one in the book seems particularly happy--perhaps mirroring Hemingway's own inner feelings of sadness and lack of self worth. We talked about a number of quotes from the book and saw this one as summing up its theme: 'You can't get away from yourself by moving from one place to another. There's nothing to that.' The discussion was lively and far-ranging.\\""},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The novel is about a disillusioned group of expatriates who day after day go out insearch of a party, so that they do not have to confront their inner turmoil when left alone.When Jake sees Brett--the woman he loves--with other men, he passively goes along with the situation; it is only at night that his true emotions come out: \\"This was Brett, that I felt like crying about. Then I thought of her walking up the street and stepping into the car . . . and of course in a little while I felt like hell again. It is awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the day, but at night it is another thing\\" (Hemingway 42). This shows that in the day he might be able to mask his pain--with drinks and friends--but at night his tortured soul makes itself known. However, the revelations of the night before are quickly shoved under the rug and the next day or week the cycle repeats itself. He does not even try to get Brett for himself; he acts like the battle has already been lost and that any future actions he might take would be utterly futile, which is true because he has lost his manhood and there lies the tragedy of Brett and Jake's relationship.Jake does not suffer alone. All the characters in the book act like fate has been decided for them and remain compliant in nature. Cohn the Jew--always the outsider, even in his own country--perhaps suffers the most acutely. He desperately wants to find a place of acceptance and belonging, and is disillusioned into thinking that South America holds his answers. Jake tries to talk sense into him saying, \\"Robert going to another country doesn't make any difference. I've tied all that. You can't get away from yourself by moving from one place to another. . . . If you went there the way you feel now it would be exactly the same\\" (19). He clings the hardest to his affection for Brett, because for once someone chose to be with him and he cannot fathom that it was not real. He pathetically follows Brett and Mike around like an affectionate puppy trying to get a moment of attention, which becomes incredibly annoying to the reader.Brett is not a likeable character. She causes most of the pain and suffering of the men by toying with their hearts' and causes bitterness and conflict among them. You could say she was an early proponent of sexual liberation and femininity, however, that doesn't really describe her character because she often relies on men to pick up the pieces. Throughout the book she is such a pitiable, broken thing that regrets not making things work with Jake. Therefore she is not a strong female character.All in all the plot was a little dry with endless drinking and partying. None of the characters seem to need to work, so it was a bit infuriating listening to them complain bitterly about their lives. But as my friend pointed out, it is important to remember the context of the novel and how everyone was so disillusioned after the war that productivity, change, and hope seemed pointless. I thought the bull fighting and the bull fighters themselves were highly entertaining and symbolic; Romero represents the invincible, youth full of hope and wonder, while Belmonte full of bitterness and disillusionment represents old age. I thought Jake and Brett's relationship was touching at times, but could have been developed more. As far as style I prefer more complex sentence structure and language then Hemingway's work but I recognize his talent for the written word."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises is Hemingway's first novel. His style is lean, but there is really a breadth of depth to it. At the time of its initial release, F. Scott Fitzgerald provided suggested edits to it which Hemingway followed if not begrudgingly. I found the novel to be entertaining, full of people from a time gone by and I can only recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" by Ernest Hemingway was published in 1926, when he was just 27 years old and it was his first major novel. The expatriot American community in Paris and Europe in general after World War II brought together a band of talented writers, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, James Joyce and Gertrude Stein, whose famous quote \\"You are all a lost generation\\" is listed at the front of Hemingway's work and whose talents are later criticized by Hemingway in other writings. This first effort by the young Hemingway was noteworthy at the time as it was a bold, new style, clean, terse, abrupt and different from that being released by other novelists. Thus Hemingway first gained attention as a writer worth following.The book is a story of the daily lives of several \\"lost\\" people, including Jake Barnes and the incredibly beautiful, sexy Lady Brett Ashley, who every man desires and who has slept with nearly all of them. The plot literally revolves around three things- drinking, eating and various love affairs or near affairs of the main characters. You get a sense that Hemingway was both a participant and a curious bystander seeing this display of drunken debauchery, lewd behavior and wasteful spending of money...yet he somehow stands apart from the crowd in that he senses that things aren't right, things are going badly and that at some point, this type of behavior will cause all of them to fall into the abyss, which many of them later did...If you read this novel, you truly MUST read the later Hemingway, as he develops his writing skills magnificently over the next 30 years, with such great works as \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\", \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" and \\"Islands in the Stream\\". These later works highlight his strong development, his maturity and his calibre as one of the greatest writers of the 20th Centruy.- by Gene PisasaleAuthor of \\"Vineyard Days\\" and \\"Lafayette's Gold - The Lost Brandywine Treasure\\""},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest Hemingway believed a book should be like an iceberg. The text was the top one-eighth of the iceberg while what the reader got out of the text was the bottom seven-eights. On the surface, The Sun Also Rises appears to be a book about a bunch of rich people getting perpetually drunk in 1920s Europe. But it is about the Lost Generation. The central characters are damaged from World War One. They have no purpose in life. So they wonder around Europe getting drunk. This is also a book about what is not said between people in a situation. It is about the dark side of love. Well not in the gothic sense. Lady Brett Ashley is the epitome of the flapper girl. Women got the vote after 1920. They smoked cigarettes, wore their hair short, wore short dresses, and had causal sex. They also strung a guy or two along. They were independent. All the men in the story love Brett but Brett loves her independent. She will not be tied down by any man. Jakes Barnes loves her dearly but is the only character with enough sense to know he will never be able to have her. Hemingway was a man's man. He saw a raw sexuality in the violence of bullfighting. His love and passion for bullfighting is beautifully conveyed in this book. Hemingway wrote with such a journalistic style. But he had a gift for prose as well. He proves that just because one is rich does not mean that one is happy. Beautiful writing."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"On my third attempt, I finally made it all the way through The Sun Also Rises. I forced myself to finish it, even though the plot never engaged my interest and the dialog is terribly dated and worn. I read it to see what make it a classic. To me, the book doesn't stand the test of time. To quickly paraphrase the story: We ate. We walked over there. We drank and ate. We walked over here. We argued. We watched a bullfight. We drank some more... If there is something \\"important\\" about this book I missed it. If you're a fan of clever dialog and would like something a bit more current, I'd recommend \\"The City of Your Final Destination\\" by Peter Cameron or \\"The City of Thieves\\" by David Benioff."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I'm hardly a literature major. I read for fun, and when I don't read for fun, I read to broaden my horizons. Having never read a Hemingway book in my life and wanting to step out of the comfort zone inhabited by Koontz, Rowling, Brown, Palahniuk and other modern authors, I picked this book up, expecting something grand after reading countless praise.Maybe I'm missing something. Maybe I don't have an eye for clever literature (okay, I definitely don't have one). Whatever the case, this book struck me as unbearably boring.I'm not some child who reviews books he never finished. I read the entire thing. I'm also not some uncultured college kid whose idea of a \\"classic\\" is Twilight and Stephen King; I've read and enjoyed books ranging from The Metamorphosis to Catch-22. But I could not enjoy this book at all.Aside from a trip to see some bullfights, nothing happens in this book. People talk, get drunk, go to bed, wake up, talk some more. There's no story behind it. The narrator, Jake Barnes, is afflicted by a strange wound that apparently leaves him incapable of entering a relationship however, this wound is only mentioned in a passing glance and never revealed, expounded upon or even brought up ever again. The characters are either jerks or cardboard. There's no conflict and no resolution. It's like if Seinfeld were a book.After trying to find out what all the fuss is about over this book, I found that there are some symbolic parallels between Lady Ashley (the central figure of the book, apparently) and other people or actions in the book (the bull fighting, for example). In addition, this book does seem to give justice to the generation of the time, which is cool for history buffs. So it is a more clever book than it appears on the surface.I won't say this book isn't good. For all I know, it probably deserves its title as a classic. But what I will say is that I found The Sun Also Rises to be extremely boring and did not enjoy a moment of it. I'm very glad it was a short read."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Book ReviewDoes the woman he always loved love him back or does she just use him for his friends and his money. The Sun Also Rises by Hemingway is a romantic novel where a group of middle age successful publishers and scholars follow around a young lady who isn't sure what she wants or who she wants. While chasing around Brett the group of men grow to be friends excluding Cohn who beats them all up to make her like him, which fails miserably. The story lets you decide who she marries but the final person that she is messing around with in the book is the same one that she was messing around with in the first place. . The Sun Also Rises is a romantic, surprising, and captivating book telling an interesting story in a fun and humorous way worth reading.Throughout the book scenes that might not be considered romantic turn out to be just that. During the bull fights a man stands in the middle of a coliseum taunting a bull putting himself in a tremendous risk at every charge slowly tiring but taming the bull. Then with one dagger drenched in dried blood, which is never cleaned, he delivers one fatal blow killing the bull. Then he removes the ear and hands it to a friend or girlfriend which is worthy of its honor. Although this may seem gruesome it was very romantic and helped the bull fighter to earn Brett's love. When Brett's fianc&eacute; got drunk and protected her, although it was violent, it was also a romantic and brave move by Mitch. When Brett came running back to her first love Jake after a failed relationship with the bull fighter who was always on the move it was sad and romantic and through much contemplation he took her back. The story is left at that but it almost definite that she was going to leave him again.The first time I had learned the acts that the bull fighters did I was surprised. I was even more surprised that even after the bull fighter had slain this poor animal he cut its ear off. Brett actually liked it when he gave it to her. When the nerdy Cohn introduced himself as a boxer I thought for sure that the writer was playing a joke on me but was extremely confused when he beat up Mitch, Jake, Bill, and the Spanish bull fighter. Of course Brett did not like this much to Cohn's surprise and Cohn finally left the Fiesta. After all that these young men did to put down each other and make Brett love them what was most surprising to me was when they all sat down had a drink and had fun with each other making their first step to actually becoming friends.The scenes that were created in the countryside in Spain are majestic. When Bill and Jake sat down and fished out in the country realizing they enjoyed doing the same things and catching many trout the scenes made it interesting and captivating. The way the writer described the murders of those poor bulls and the entertainment that these people enjoyed you couldn't have been more interested. It is not that bull fighting was fun but that it kept you at the edge of your seat seeing if the bull had finally gotten him or if he had decided he was done messing with it and it was time to kill it. Also the love scenes were different and creative and never went any further than a kiss in a very captivating way wondering if this lady who seems to be a bit trashy had finally chosen the man she loved over all others.The Sun Also Rises is almost everything needed in a good book. It wasn't to long and it was not to bland. It was good enough to be motivated and keep reading and was above average. It was worth reading giving a way to use time up allowing jolts of excitement while reading and building expense while also leaving you lots to think about when its all over adding a sort of complexity that some readers like. If there is time in your day then The Sun Also Rises, a carefully constructed book is worth reading"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Everyone I know who's read Hemmingway hates him.

Having found The Sun Also Rises at a used book sale, I gave it a shot.And I was pleasantly surprised.\\"But NOTHING happens!\\" everyone whined. And they're right. This is one of those not-particularly-plot-driven kinds of books. But against my will, I found myself actually caring about the characters, even if they were fairly predictable, and even if they did drink too much. It all just seemed to fit together quite well, and I ended up really liking the book.And his prose style (simple sentence. simple sentence. simple sentence.) made for a nice break from Nabokov, who I'd been reading at the time. Not right for every book, sure, but it worked for this one, and it made the dialogue feel real, instead of forced or false.So Hemmingway. He's not for everyone, sure.

His writing is practically a celebration of how well Americans can live in Europe, how enticing are the cultures, and how exciting and liberating are the experiences. \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" indicates that, after the horror and confusion of World War I, the \\"Lost\\" Generation seem to have found themselves quite at home outside of America living life to the fullest. If F. Scott Fitzgerald's fiction suggests that only the wealthy can afford to be irresponsible, Hemingway suggests that anybody can afford to be irresponsible outside his or her own country.The narrator, Jake Barnes, is a newspaper writer living in Paris in the 1920's. His circle of friends consists almost exclusively of other writers and artists and their admirers, all of whom hang out in the cafes, indulge in the night life, and drink freely, heavily, and lavishly -- no pesky Prohibition on this side of the Atlantic. Two of Jake's friends are Robert Cohn, a Jewish boxer-turned-novelist whose love affairs with women always seem to end messily, and the beautiful, desirable Lady Brett Ashley, who is about to divorce her husband and marry an obnoxious boor named Mike Campbell.Jake takes a fishing trip to Spain with Cohn and his buddy Bill Gorton, after which they stay over in Pamplona to take in the San Fermin fiesta and watch the bullfights with Brett and Campbell. Jake is not just a casual spectator, but a seasoned \\"aficionado\\" who is intimately familiar with the bullfighting scene. As the partying continues, passions heat up, a drunken Campbell constantly picks on Cohn, who, like Jake, is infatuated with Brett, and Brett sets her sights on a hot new young matador named Pedro Romero. Although these plot points seem like they're leading up to some big, explosive climax, Hemingway, who values realism over contrivances, chooses the high road and allows the characters to resolve their conflicts naturally, like human beings, not like Hollywood caricatures.Hemingway's prose in this early novel of his is usually minimalistic but, with something like boyish enthusiasm, becomes more detailed and energetic when describing the things that really interest its author, like trout fishing and bullfighting. That he manages to capture the intoxicating freedom of these expatriates so directly and concisely is what has made him one of America's greatest literary icons."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"SAR was my first Hemingway book I read. I was in Europe with a friend whom had read SAR and she kept telling me about the book, the bullfights, the partying, lady Brett, Cohn the boxer, Romero the young and handsome bullfighter. Upon returning to the states my friend gave me a copy and again I was back in France and Spain. I could definitely relate the all night drinking, visiting the bullfighting arena and hearing the brute stories of the fights. Hemingway puts you in the story with his vivid description of the mountain sides in Spain and fresh water fly fishing. Who needs a European vacation? SAR takes you there without leaving the comfort of your own home. I've now read it twice and I've also read Hemingway's Short Stories. I'm not an everyday book reader, but now I realize what I've missed. If you are not a Hemingway fan this book is a great start,but if you've read it before enjoy SAR one more time."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"After reading \\"The Paris Wife,\\" I decided to read Hemingway's \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\" I kept reading even though I found the dialog tedious and uninteresting. Surely there will be something coming ahead that has made this book a classic I thought. As it turned out, there was nothing ahead but more of the same. If this is one of Hemingway's better novels, I won't be reading any others! Don't waste your time on this one unless you want to read a bunch of empty dialog between shallow, selfish, and soulless individuals who don't learn anything but how to continue on their own destructive paths while inflicting harm on others. However no one dies or is severely injured, because that would be too memorable or interesting for this book."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Wow, I felt drunk reading this book. The characters consume much alcohol whilst at a bull-fighting fiesta, there's drama between the characters and this can also be shown in the bull-fighting. Due to the fast pace I read this book and the continued mention of alcohol it made my head whirl....and I promise I wasn't drinking at the time.First Hemingway, won't be my last. Very quick read."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I intentionally read this book while vacationing in Key West and visiting some of Hemingway's hang outs. I knew when starting the book that Hemingway's language was spare and his style style was compared to an iceberg (90% of the story is below the surface) but I was not seeing the real story. I was about half way done when my daughter suggested reading the free, on-line analysis from Spark Notes as I went along. That made a huge difference in understanding the book's relationship to World War I, man's ongoing struggle with masculinity, and the struggle with the discontent in our lives."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"On the dedication page, Hemingway quotes his friend Gertrude Stein: \\"You are all a lost generation.\\" This is followed by a quote from the Biblical Book of Ecclesiastics: \\"One generation paseth away, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth forever... The sun also ariseth...\\"This book gets better with each reading--or maybe its because I've grown a little older and wearier myself along the way. It is a character study of a group of friends from a generation of young men and women who in the aftermath of World War I, in F. Scott Fitzgerald's words, have \\"grown up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken.\\" Hemingway sends a group of friends, American and British expatriates living in Paris, on a trip to the Festival of San Fermin in Spain to party for a week of days and nights and to see the bullfights. Of the five of them--Jake, Brett, Bill, Mike and Robert Cohn--all but Cohn have been affected by WWI, and all but Cohn have become disconnected, disillusioned and apathetic.After divorcing her husband who was driven to mental instability by his war experiences, Brett carelessly bounces from one man to another even as her new finance, Mike, is travelling with her to the festival. For his part, Mike is bankrupt and is bitter on many levels; he mostly accepts Brett as she is. Bill just doesn't care about much of anything except enjoying the here and now, and Jake is struggling with a most unfortunate war wound. They find the good things in small pleasures such as a wonderfully rendered fishing trip or a long evening of inebriation at a cafe.Only Cohn is unaffected by the War, and while he may be a bit of a twit he's basically a nice guy who keeps expecting people to behave decently and keeps being let down by this bunch of lost souls. Cohn has been among Brett's lovers and the friction created by her callousness towards him creates the dramatic fiber of the story. But it is Jake & Brett's affection for each other and the sad fact that they will never be able to consummate it that really provides the metaphor for the lost generation, rendered impotent by their experiences, sent spiraling off away from each other in different, aimless directions.The festival itself, with its rich, colorful traditions and camaraderie is a great contrast with the disillusioned protagonists. Their disregard for the welfare of the very talented young bullfighter Pedro costs Jake a friendship with a fellow bullfighting aficionado and Jake doesn't really seem to care. He simply never did fully understand the passion devoted to the sport, although he tried. And yes, Brett sometimes teases men like a bullfighter taunting bulls to their deaths.Some criticize this book as being about nothing but that isn't true at all. The people in it are careless but not without reason, and under the surface--watch the dialog and action carefully--there is great pain and struggle within them. The reader needs to bring some life experiences along for the ride to really get it. If you haven't experienced loss or disillusionment yourself it's hard to see what these characters are going on about and why they behave as they do.Hemingway's famously minimalist prose provides a rich, colorfully detailed story while letting the characters speak for themselves. I can't imagine how tedious this story would be if the narrator were constantly trying to put these motives into words. Hemingway's great talent was in describing the dialog and action simply and yet still completely controlling his themes with grace and realism. The Sun Also Rises was and is landmark literature for its story and its prose style, and today it is also a revealing historical document about the time and the mood following the First World War."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is a great novel and it is an excellent novel but it falls short of being a masterpiece. Part of the enjoyment is the drama. I have not described the plot elements and those should be left as surprises for the reader.I had read \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Hemingway about ten years ago and then discovered an essay by Raymond Chandler on writing. He was a famous detective writer and screenplay writer of the 1930s through to the 1950s. He made the comment in his essay on writing that \\"Farewell to Arms\\" set the standard for twentieth century fiction. With that encouragement I bought the book, read it, then ran out and bought most of Hemingway's other novels and a collection of his short stories. This novel from 1926 is not his best work, and perhaps \\"Farewell to Arms\\" would be his best. Some of his other works such as \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" has much greater depth and balance than the present work. This is one of Hemingway's first, and it has a rough feel to it. It has a good balance of prose, story, characters, drama, and length, but it has a certain collegiate feel - almost a braggart feel to his macho story about having a good time in Spain and Paris.For example, the Bloomsbury Guide has picked 375 top fiction authors, and among those 375 has picked 40 \\"masterpieces\\" and they included Hemingway's \\"Farewell to Arms\\" and not the present novel.The novel does have certain originality and flair with the colourful description of the running of the bulls and the Spanish fair. The story is based roughly on his own war experiences of living in Paris and then visiting Spain to see the bull fights. The novel is superbly entertaining but a bit rough as a masterpiece and shorter than some of his great works.The title of the book comes from the Bible, Ecclesiastes 1:5 but the book is about drinking and going to the bull fights.The story is based on a trip by Hemingway with his first wife, Hadley Richardson, and several friends to Pamplona, Spain, in 1925. They - along with other friends - are the source of the three main characters and it is roughly based on their experiences. The three protagonists are Robbert Cohn a Jewish American boxer, Lady Brett Ashley, and Jake Barnes the narrator.They meet in Paris and then go to Spain and meet other friends and have a wild time for a few weeks. It has a certain \\"fraternity boys\\" feel to the book. It is macho and all about drinking lots of red wine and watching the bull fights and the celebrations surrounding the fights and then the injuries suffered by both the bulls and the fighters. He has a related book \\"Death in the Afternoon\\" which has many pictures and more details on the fights themslves and the participants. Also, some of the same material is covered in some of his short stories.Part of the fun reading the book is the plot and I would avoid knowing any more than that until you read the book.5 Star excellent and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is without doubt the novel that propelled Hemingway into stellar heights. The autobiographical tones give this book a warm feeling that embraces you with every turn of the page.Jake Barnes, the main character, is the archetypical intellectual of the lost generation. He lives in Paris and associates with other expatriates, while trying to distract himself through excessive drinking. Long way from Kansas, working as a correspondent, Jake tries to find meaning in life after the Great War.And then there is Brett, the liberated heroine that makes every man who crosses her path crawl to her feet. The dynamics of Jake and Brett's relationship go beyond carnal desires. Jake's impotency turns the situation into a platonic affair that stretches through the entire storyline.The only way that Jake can overcome his suffering is by trying to find strength in the daily activities. He is a manly man. He likes fishing, hunting, binge-drinking, and most-dearly bullfighting. Hemingway goes into detail describing the excessive partying that goes with the \\"running of the bulls\\" event in the Basque country. It is understood that \\"The Great Gatsby\\" influenced Hemingway when he wrote this account.The most impressive aspect of the novel is the language without a doubt. The short and sharp sentences paint an image in one's head, very similar to an impressionist painting. Reading this book is almost like walking through an art gallery where all the pictures are smoothly related. There are great philosophical observations that are going to make you want to close the book and reflect about them for a few minutes.Highly recommended for all recent classics lovers."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"and that, I think, might explain the polarized reactions people often have to Hemingway in general, and this book in particular. This book, I think, is difficult to appreciate after all that has happened since 1926. The persistent complaints about the (perceived) lack of plot and the odd dialog will almost certainly never end, and are probably not wholly without merit. But a point needs to be made; The Sun Also Rises is not the sort of book you take with you on vacation to Myrtle Beach. It is dark, depressing, and not at all &quot;enjoyable&quot;. Yes, the characters are crummy people, they are bigoted, their activities are repetitive and pointless, and you don't exactly find yourself gripped with anticipation to see who Brett will do next. But that is the whole point. The interesting thing about the characters is not what they do, but how they came to be the way the are. As for the dialog, I'll be damned if people don't really talk the way Hemingway suggests. If it seems weird, it is perhaps because the author isn't walking you through it. The thing is, everyone is post-modern now. But Hemingway was playing that game long before the English majors of the world had a word to identify the style. If you are being forced to read this book for a class, I guess I can sympathize. But just because you don't like it, doesn't mean it isn't worth your time. Even Hemingway's detractors (and there are a lot of them) will acknowledge his role as a literary groundbreaker. After three-quarters of a century of non-stop imitation (both conscious and otherwise) it is hard to appreciate the impact that this book had on the literary world. On the other hand, if you only want to read books that you find enjoyable, suspenseful, or inspiring (and nothing wrong with that), I would suggest that you look elsewhere. Those of you who already know what Hemingway was about, don't like the idea but order this book anyway... I cannot imagine what you are thinking."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"(This review is based on the Arrow Classic edition of the book)Four years ago, I wrote a terrible review for this very novel, and it shames me to this day. I reread \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" last week, and to my surprise, I adored it. I remembered having experienced utter boredom the first time around, but now I know it was only because I did not know how to read, obviously.Hemingway's use of economy of words and understatement are things you must be aware of, which means: simply because the style appears simple does not mean the text is. There is a lot more than meets the eye, and for this, one may easily miss out on the essential heart of the novel. This is certainly what I did on my first reading.Short sentences perhaps tend to make the reader read faster, and that would be a fatal mistake with Hemingway. Because you have less, you must pay more attention. The narrative will not give you chewed meat: you have to do your own chewing. And this is Hemingway's strong point and trade-mark, and narratively speaking, it works wonders if you work with it. I was of the mind that his style only really worked for short stories, but \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" proved me wrong. This is a powerful novel, highly enjoyable, and a landmark in worldwide literature.Certainly one of Hemingway's best, and one of those novels you must read!PS: the Arrow Books edition contains numerous typos of the embarrassing type, not that they make funny new words, but \\"gve\\" instead of \\"give\\" is relatively awkward to find in a book, so are misspelled names and the likes, or forgotten quotation marks, all of which appear in the Arrow Books edition of the novel."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"As you can tell from some of the other reviews, this is a rather strange book, with no major events or startling revelations occurring anywhere within. That is not to say that the book doesn't have a strong message. The redundancy and rather aimless lifestyle of the characters IS the point. What became known as the 'Lost Generation' were known for their living without goals and becoming despondent with the day-to-day that was their life. There is also the more subtle theme of rebirth and new beginnings that will always follow periods of despondency and helplessness.Narrated by the main character, Jake Barnes, THE SUN ALSO RISES drops you into and takes you through a couple months of life for a few WWI expatriates, in which nothing much seems to happen. Drinking, talking, and occasionally fighting, Jake and his friends Mike, Cohn, Bill, and Brett take a trip to Spain for a week-long fiesta. Jake is one of the least developed main characters of any novel I've read, being extremely non remarkable and somewhat of a pushover. Nevertheless, you can't help feeling a great amount of empathy for Jake, despite not understanding his personal motivations. By far the most interesting and well-developed character is Brett Ashley, a free spirited and brash lady that delights and frustrates the reader in every scene she appears in. As the narrator is in love with Brett, it makes sense that she is portrayed in an ambiguously favorable manner.This book is perhaps the best example of Hemingway's styles of bare-bones description and character development through dialogue. I'd say about half of the book is taken up by very realistic and choppy conversation among the characters. Much of this conversation (as well as the narrators musings) seem rather inane in many parts but help develop the characters into real people.An excellent book and a great example of Hemingway's style."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"One of Hemingway's earlier works, THE SUN ALSO RISES remains one of his best. This roman &agrave; clef has it all -- drinking, misbehaving expats, more drinking, humor, sarcasm, irony, unrequited love, beautiful descriptions of Spain, did I mention drinking?, femme fatales, handsome bullfighters, fishing trips, a tad more drinking, manly-man themes, and outstanding dialogue.About halfway through the book, a character named Bill Gorton about nails it when he tells the protagonist narrator, Jake Barnes, exactly what an expat is. It's meant to be funny, but in many ways it defines the book's sense of itself: \\"You're an expatriate. You've lost touch with the soil. You get precious. Fake European standards have ruined you. You drink yourself to death. You become obsessed by sex. You spend all your time talking, not working. You are an expatriate, see? You hang around caf&eacute;s.\\"Luckily for us, Hemingway wrote and didn't just talk, but his novel is delightfully \\"talky\\" and the reader can't resist but listen in as a beautiful Brit named Brett makes verbal love with our protagonist Jake; or as Jake mercilessly excoriates the \\"phony\\" writer Robert Cohn (yes, Virginia, there IS a whiff of anti-Semitism in play here); or as Jake and Bill engage in witty and sometimes drunken badinage as they go on their memorable fishing trip in the Spanish hills. From the caf&eacute;s of Paris to the running of the bulls in Pamplona, this book is a roaming holiday. And just when things get ugly and everyone is sick to death of each other, there's the memorable scene where Jake swims into the sea as if to cleanse himself of everything -- the drinking, the fighting, the frustrating impotence. The chapter is vintage Hemingway.While I admire some of Hemingway's later work, I still feel THE SUN ALSO RISES, along with his early short stories (IN OUR TIME, THE NICK ADAMS STORIES), remains one of his strongest works. It is forever youthful both in its excesses and its beauties, yet it ages quite nicely, too. I heartily recommend it either as an introduction to Hemingway or as a reread. It will bear up in either case."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"From Hemmingway's \\"Death in the Afternoon:\\" \\"If a writer of prose knows enough about what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one-eight of it being above water.\\"Like the iceberg, Hemmingway only describes a small part of Jake and Lady Brett Ashley's relationship. Although they have obviously had a long history together, Hemmingway leaves most of it up to the imagination. Similarly, much of Jakes personality is not directly described, but left to the reader to infer based on his interactions and descriptions of Cohn. Hemmingway takes a \\"Skinner behavioral\\" approach to motives and cognitions; he only describes the stimulus and the behavioral reaction with no attempt to describe feelings, perceptions or intents.On my initial reading of the Sun Also Rises when I was in college, I think I was drawn to the party atmosphere of the book. It's the life I would love to live if I didn't need to work and had lots of money. Across country lines and from one fiesta to another, how great. Jake constantly is socializing, drinking and meeting new people. He often enters a bar with one group of friends and leaves with others. The book describes a better spring break than any MTV reality show. Subsequent reads of the novel bring out much more intimate study of human personality.The climax of the story occurs in Pamplona, Spain at the Fiesta of San Fermin. A radical festival takes place in which the people of Pamplona play the leading part, but in which the characters come to full physical and emotional conflict. Hemmingway's description of the activities and emotions of the quasi-religious festival brought the running of the bulls and bullfights into the American conscious.The Sun Also Rises is existential in its approach to life. Jake claims to be a catholic and goes to church several times. Within the story there are several references to Catholicism and catholic colleges. However, Hemmingway aims to describe life, as it should be, with no regard to an after life. As a man, you are judged based on how you conduct yourself on the earth during your life time. Based on The Sun Also Rises, a ranking system of \\"manhood\\" can be constructed according to three factors: 1) grace under pressure (in face of death), 2) level of passion (aficion) for which they live life and 3) by their response to the man-eater Lady Brett Ashley. Brett is a \\"Circe\\" who turns men to pigs, often bringing out the worst in the best of men.\\"Real men\\" as ranked by Hemmingway1. Robert Cohn: Lowest level of manhood. May seem like a likeable and insightful fellow, but becomes irritating over time. A bookish man who excels at things (boxing, writing) for not passionate reasons. He lives life like watching a movie rather than experiencing it. Considers bull fight s to be \\"boring\\" - a blasphemy for Hemmingway. In relation to Lady Brett Ashley, he is a \\"steed.\\" Has an affair with her, but acts like a puppy dog. Follows her around and acts \\"terribly.\\" A constant brunt of the mocking by Jakes friends.2. Mike Campbell: A generally rough and ready type guy who experiences life to the fullest. However, he becomes drunk too easily (a sin for Hemingway) and \\"acts badly,\\" often antagonizing other people, even if he is correct in doing so (like to Cohn). Overly protective of Brett, and she does not like to be possessed. Responds horribly to Cohn's affair with Brett. Bankrupt and drunk, she ditches him. Later returns to him, so she can continue to be safe and irresponsible.3. Jake Barnes: Passionate about life. Enjoys bull fights, the landscape, soaking up the afternoon sun on a sandy beach. Aficionado of bull fighting. Unfortunately, he is apostate due to injury suffered in war, therefore can not consummate his relationship with Lady Brett Ashley. So, to Hemingway, there relationship can never be complete despite their love for each other and he is banished to the role of eunuch. Jake can serve her only as confidant and pimp. Lady Brett Ashley is both agony and ecstasy to Jake.4. Pedro Romero: Young Matador at the top of his profession. Not just an aficionado, he actually faces death gracefully in the ring with the worst of bulls. Handsome, graceful and competent. Brett falls for him hard and runs away with him. He dominates her, actually rejects her for her hair (too short, boyish). Ultimately, she must leave him because she cannot be a \\"b-tch\\" and destroy him, like she has all other men."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"EXCERPTED FROM \\"GOD'S COUNTRY\\" BY STEVEN TRAVERS...The \\"lost generation\\" was marked by the work of American writers who journeyed to France to write in the 1920s. They included Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein, who once said of Oakland, California, \\"There is no there there.\\"Hemingway was a reporter for the Kansas City Star, a man's man of gruff, Midwestern sentiment. He came from a family of some local prominence. Perhaps because he did not face great hardships growing up, he felt the need to test himself. In this regard, Hemingway and Teddy Roosevelt have much in common. Hemingway went looking for his manhood in World War I and found it. The experience formed him. He saw action fighting alongside the Italian allies and sustained wounds. According to his own account, he had a \\"life-after-death\\" episode. While recovering, he fell in love with a pretty American nurse. When the war ended the romance did not take, in part because Hemingway had a stubborn streak of jealousy. But he used these events to launch a career of great works, writing in a tone of melancholy wistfulness, imbued with American patriotism and the manly need to face danger, romance and adventure with courage and idealism, tinged by ironic cynicism.\\"A Farewell to Arms\\" was his semi-autobiographical account of World War I, including his lost love with the nurse. Hemingway captured the \\"lost generation\\" in \\"The Sun Also Rises\\", which detailed American ex-patriates in Europe who were mentally and physically scarred by the Great War. His main character is unable to consummate a relationship with a beautiful woman who pines for him, because he sustained injuries in the war that prevent him from sexual functioning. The woman goes on to a career of carnal conquest with a variety of men, none of whom fulfill her. Amid much drunkenness and debauchery, the book addresses anti-Semitism, a relatively new theme in the 1920s, although Hemingway is not wholly sympathetic to Jews. When the book was made into a film in the 1950s, Daryl F. Zanuck cast a handsome young Jewish man, Robert Evans, as a Spanish bullfighter. When Evans approached \\"Papa\\" Hemingway at Yankee Stadium, the old man rebuffed him. He was furious that one of his beloved characters, a Spaniard, be portrayed by an American Jew.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF \\"BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN\\"(...)"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Now, I love Hemingway. What I've read of him has been great, but I found The Sun Also Rises to be a wondrous experience while reading it (as I did The Complete Short Stories). Perhaps I should have waited before writing this review as I am still struck dumb by the sparse beauty of Hemingway's prose. This is a tender, absorbing, gripping story of a group of American and British expatriats and their vacation in Spain for the bullfights and festivals. This has become one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The definitive text of &quot;The Lost Generation,&quot; this novel makes it clear why Hemingway's writing style as utilized here has become the de rigueur manual for the descriptive, narrative, novelist. The exotic locale of Paris in the 20's is peopled by Hemingway with equally interesting characters, who are believable and three-dimensional in their neuroses and post-war entanglements. Lady Brett Ashley leaves all in her wake as she convinces the reader that she is the ultimate socialite, bored by society and its rewards. The frustrations of the narrator, Jake Barnes, is no less than the voice of an entire generation made impotent by the anxiety of the post-war debacle which was the expatriate scene in Paris, bent on losing touch with the realities of the age via alcohol and all-night parties. This book is as fresh now as ever, even when the dialogue shows its age, because all extraneous description was cut by Hemingway to make this a real gem. The contrast between Brett, Jake, and Robert Cohn, a cardboard cut-out of a man used to accent Jake's anguish, is a realistic time-capsule of a cafe society whose confusion spirals into dissipation and self-destruction."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"As other reviews have stated, the descriptions of the characters' travels are interesting, but as we search for Hemingway's point, we are disappointed as no clear point is made. Are we to compare Lady Brett to the bullfighters? Jake Barnes and other men to steer and bulls? If meaninglessness is the point, then I suppose it was made."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Just a quick comment for all of you that think this novel deserves 5 stars. It does not! This is Hemingway's first novel and as such it shows a young developing artist attempting to find his voice and build his craft. Like many writers at this stage he does not fully make the grade. If you read say &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; immediately after this book you will be able to see a great leap forward in Hemingway's prose within just the first 20 pages (to say nothing of &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;). Please restrain from making a book that deserves a &quot;3&quot; at most into a 5. (By the way I have lived in Paris and been to the running of the bulls so this book was a treat for me on that level). Cheers!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is one of those books that I always wanted to read, but somehow never did. That is, until just recently. I suppose I was caught up in the romance and adventure of a Hemingway yarn, but &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; just didn't cut it for me. What well-read reader with an interest in history could not be attracted to the group of post World War I expatriates living in Paris? If this book was any real indication of the life that Hemingway lived, I am afraid that the whole scene of getting drunk and watching bull fights just isn't for me. I found Hemingway's prose to be too simple, and the story line did not hold my interest."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest Hemingway is a great American writer, certainly worthy of his highly esteemed reputation, but his gifts are not on display in THE SUN ALSO RISES, a slow, boring story about a group of expatriate Americans and Britons who travel to Pamplona, Spain for the San Fermin Festival (popularly known as the \\"Running of the Bulls\\"). Lots of drinking, debauchery, and brawling ensues. Unfortunately, there's no actual story here: the reader feels compelled to give this great author the benefit of the doubt and waits in anticipation page-after-page for something to happen, but nothing ever does. It is, to be frank, a pointless book--which, in fairness, may have actually been Hemingway's way of conveying the aimlessness of the so-called Lost Generation, but that doesn't mean it constitutes literarily meritorious writing or makes for good reading. Hemingway also struggles mightily with dialogue in this, his first novel, crafting conversations that are often awkward and confusing, and his character introductions alternate between \\"poor\\" and \\"non-existent.\\"Though THE SUN ALSO RISES is not a very good book, it should not turn prospective readers off Hemingway entirely. He matured a great deal as a writer andA Farewell To Arms,For Whom the Bell Tolls (Scribner Classics),Old Man And The Sea (Scribner Classics), andThe Snows of Kilimanjaro and Other Stories (Scribner Classics)are some of the greatest works of fiction of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises is written in the usual, stripped-down style of Hemingway, and it tells the story of several dissolute expatriate friends making their way around Europe. The narrator, Jake Barnes, is a war veteran with a unique injury that has rendered him impotent. The woman he loves, a beautiful noblewoman named Brett Ashley, craves a physical love that he can't provide, throwing them both into the agony of wanting what they can't have. The two leg it around Paris and Spain with an odd collection of friends, which includes a rather annoying Jewish writer and Ashley's drunk, broke fiancee.I didn't actually like this book, but I kept reading it because I wanted to finish it. All of the characters seem to be alcoholics, and they seem to lead lives bankrupt of any real meaning. I didn't really like any of the characters, and I kept wondering why Ashley and Barnes didn't get together . (I mean, he's impotent, but surely they could physically satisfy each other in some way. It seems rather foolish to throw away what could be true love just because the sex takes some work.)Although I realize that this is considered a classic, I finished it feeling largely unsatisfied. (Which, perhaps, was the point.) Although the book isn't particularly long, it takes a while to read it. The plot doesn't move quickly."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The book is considered great--a description of the lost generation after World War I, and an exemplar of Hemingway's unusual, laconic prose, what Malcom Cowley called \\"The Middle American Prose Style.\\" I've read the book a number of times over the years, and never quite enjoy it. The characters seem juvenile, all of one type, all variations of Hemingway's antiquated notion of manhood. The female protagonist, Lady Brett, is just a male fantasy, the femme fatale no man can have, who is unhappy and unfullfilled herself. These vamps seem to populate the literature of the twenties--modeled on famous bohemian heiresses or actresses of the day. Jake, the main character, is another Hemingway self-description, alienated and in pain, with little wit or cleverness in self-reflection. With uninteresting characters, a somewhat primitive ethos of manhood, prose style that may have been novel in its inception in the twenties but flat upon reading now, and not much in the way of unusual narrative, I am puzzled this book retains its high acclaim. One wonder if it is simply because, with its short words, it is easy to read. And oddly, nevertheless I continue to read and re-read it every once in a while--mostly because of the unwaveringly dry prose--the same kind of stoic beauty as a midwestern plain.

The main character, Jake Barnes, and a group of his friends spend their holiday in Spain. Their time there is filled with bull fights, nights of drunken revelry, suppressed love, despair, and the overwhelming tone of reality: That life is really no laughing matter. This book is a sort of lesson on what happens if a person lives life in gluttony, taking the easy way out. There is more to life than the party, and Hemingway beautifully reders this in the novel. On the other hand, one can look at this story as being a &quot;book about nothing&quot;. As one reads this book, the reader never really knows what the main idea is about. The story is essentially about a group of tourists having a good time in Spain. There is no real conflict except for the odd momentary drunken brawl. The message Hemingway wishes to present is at the end of the story, hanging precariously. The reader never really knows what the book was supposed to be about in the first place. Nevertheless, this book is a good read, and well worth buying. It's development is written in a style different than most other books, but that is why Ernest Hemingway is such a unique author. And, that is really what saves this book for the 3-star review."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I have had very little experience with Hemingway prior to picking up this book. For some reason I had it in my head that his writing would be haughty, inaccessible and laborious to read. I was pleasantly surprised that none of my preconceptions were true.The writing style in Sun Also Rises is fluid, simple and easy to follow. His sentences are short and easy to follow. His dialog is natural. His descriptions are straightforward and to the point.Even though the simplicity of the style made the reading quick and easy, I quickly saw that there was a lot going on \\"between the lines.\\" As terse as much of the writing is, it was apparent that what was left out was just as important (perhaps more so) than what was on the page.As a case in point, nowhere in the book does Hemingway explicitly identify the nature of the wound that Jake received in the war. In fact, if a reader wasn't paying close attention, the importance of that wound would quickly fade into the background. However, there are plenty of clues as to the type of injury and the nature and extent that it has affected Jake's life. The injury was probably the largest case of something \\"not written\\" that was important. There were a few other instances where I felt like Hemingway was leaving out significant details while alluding to their importance.The character development in the book was very interesting.With the first person narrative, we only really get into Jake's head (although, as mentioned above, there's plenty of detail he leaves out even about himself) and everything is tainted by his view of life. At first his view felt fairly realistic and trustworthy but it quickly became apparent that he was jaded and cynical.I felt like we got a pretty good feel for Cohn by the end of the novel. His character seemed to be the most straightforward and easy to understand and also seemed to follow along with the narrator's initial description of him in the opening.Lady Brett Ashley's character was a bit more troublesome. She generally felt like a party girl who absolutely loved life and was always happy, but as the layers came back, she had more emotional depth than first expressed.The other characters in the novel were intriguing but again it was hard to unravel their motivations and get at the heart of their character because their words and motives were often veiled by volatile or sullen behavior. The various lovers of Brett and friends of Jake were interesting but seemed to serve as reflections to play off Brett and Jake and let us gain more depth into those personalities. The drunken repartees and the random banter was funny at times, harsh at others.The overall tone of the book was almost paradoxical. As readers, we're following around a group of expatriates as they party and travel around Europe reveling and enjoying life for all its worth. From a high level, you would think that this would be great fun. But as we drill down into the hearts and heads of these characters, the true story became rather depressive. Instead of a semi-aristocratic party crowd, in the end it felt like we were following a bunch of slovenly lounge-a-bouts who only lived for the next drink.Both Brett and Jake had a yearning for some true emotion or passion in life but neither was able to find a clear path to that state of happiness. Instead, all of the characters lived lives of broken, or disabled, relationships. They wandered aimlessly through life spending money like water in order to try and find some sort of emotional high (or perhaps a liquor induced numbness) to detract from their otherwise unfulfilled lives.After reading this book, I have a desire to seek out more Hemingway and read more of his stuff. I really enjoy the style he used in this book and found his characters intriguing and approachable. The story and emotions were thought provoking and effective.Definitely recommended.****4 stars out of 5"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Written in first person, a journalist for an American newspaper meets up with friends and acquaintances in Paris France. The characters are unlikable: spoiled and self-centered. They begin their escapades frequenting restaurants and cafes overindulging in alcohol. Three of the men are infatuated with one of the women (a tramp) in the circle. The party (both definitions) then moves on to Spain, continuing to live-it-up: they go on a fishing trip, take part in the Fiesta and go to the bullfights. They end up meeting back in France to say their good-byes.The novel is typical Hemmingway: the themes are familiar, it is full of dialogue, and reads like a report----banal. I think it lacks depth and is overrated. In wonderment, I still find myself reading his work. What I enjoy is his ability to go against the rules of writing. And how much of his stories are his experiences?Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemingway is overrated and this book has serious flaws. Hem didn't even know where the book began. It begins with the last sentence of chapter II, about going out to have a drink and watch the evening crowd along the boulevard. The first two chapters about Cohn are useless and written in a style unlike the rest of the book. The count is built up to be a major character in book one, and then is gone never to be heard from again. And why the oldsters love Hem's dialogue is beyond me. And are these the most annoying people in history? Hey, Lady Bret, DO shut up! Although generation talk is a 20th century invention for mediocre journalists to have half their story already written (Ernest Hemingway, the voice of the lost generation, etc.) these people are not a part of the lost generation but the drinking, thinking that they got it made generation. I know teenagers who have been through more stuff than these knuckleheads. If you want to read great Hemingway read A Moveable Feast.

I didn't just dislike the book, I hated the way Hemmingway writes. I may be wrong because I have noticed that many great author's first novels pale in comparison to what they would go on to acomplish, but if this book is any indication, then his career can't be that good. First of all, Hemmingway writes like a third grader. The character development is non-exsistant. The plot is basically anything that is on MTV right now. The characters get drunk in every chapter, talk about how much they hate each other, and then talk about how much they love each other after their hangover wears off. This is supposed to be some great work of post-war literature about the \\"lost generation\\", who really didn't seem to have much to complain about seeing how they were all overseas getting drunk.

I oftentimes find that the book I am reading whispers the name of the next book, or next several books, rather than I having the luxury to choose for myself. This was definitely the case with \\"The Paris Wife\\", the subject of my last review. I discovered while I was devouring it that when living in Paris at the beginning of his writing career, Ernest Hemingway became enamored with Bull fighting in Spain. He went to Pamplona several times to take in the contests, after first being introduced to them through stories told by Gertrude Stein (a friend of Hemingway's who was also an ex-pat living in Paris, and who also became a famous author). In fact Hemingway's first child was named John Hadley Nicanor Hemingway. Nicanor Villalta was the name of a famous toreador who artfully slay his bull the first time Hemingway took his wife, Hadley, to the fights while she was pregnant with their son. Hemingway's first novel and work of substance, as well as the subject of this review, was \\"The Sun Also Rises\\", a story woven around and through the passion Hemingway felt for bullfighting.In 1926, while Hemingway was living in Paris, he took his wife and a group of friends to Spain for the week long festival. There were seven people in the party, mostly Americans familiar with each other from living in Paris and traveling in the same social circle. There was one other woman besides Hemingway's wife in the group, Lady Duff Twysden, who had once upon a time in one of her previous unions, married into her title. She went by Duff. She was beautiful, glamorous, and made it a point of attracting the attention of the men around her in spite of the fact that she was engaged to be married to another member of the party, Pat Guthrie. Pat drank too much and didn't hold his liquor well, but even so he was cognizant of the mutual flirtations that were going on around him involving his fiancee. To add to this amorously charged and stress-filled atmosphere, another member of the group, Harold Loeb, had only just returned from a romantic tryst at St.-Jean-de-Luz with Duff. Harold was head-over-heels for Duff, and felt that after having her to himself for a week, he had a legitimate claim to her. She was finished with Harold by then in her off-hand way, and had moved on to the attentions of Hemingway... During the course of the week, Hemingway, Harold and Pat circled Duff with the intensity of sharks at a feeding frenzy, which created an aura of discomfort for all of the friends.The \\"Sun Also Rises\\" takes place in Pamplona during the bullfighting festival in July. It is actually based on the trip Hemingway planned for his friends. Interestingly Hemingway chose not to include his wife in the novel, even though she was present during the actual event. In the book there is continuous inebriation, arguing, and fighting over the favor of Brett, who plays the part of Duff. The twist is that Brett trifles with the men, but sets her sights on conquering the beautiful young toreador after she sees the grace, power and fearlessness of his performance in the ring.It was interesting to read this book after having an understanding for Hemingway's life when he wrote it. It was also fascinating to know that Hemingway based this book on a real life experience. It was like having a window into his existence. Unfortunately, I can't honestly say I enjoyed his writing style. I know it is said of Hemingway that the power of his writing came from his ability to be succinct. I found, however, that his writing lacked the richness of description and analogy, which made it feel flat. He also repeated words and phrases, which I thought tedious. I am keeping in mind that this was Hemingway's first novel, and that he was not yet a literary giant when he wrote it. I am looking forward to reading \\"A Movable Feast\\", which was the last book Hemingway wrote before his death. It is a reminiscence of his life in Paris with Hadley."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I recently read Hemingway's memoir A Moveable Feast and quite liked it although I couldn't take it seriously.I then thought I would try one of his novels and chose this one which I first read over 30 years ago.Although fiction, it contains the kind of banal, idiotic statements that pepper A Moveable Feast e.g. \\"It was always pleasant crossing bridges in Paris\\", \\"It felt good to be warm and in bed\\", \\"It felt good lying on the ground\\" and \\"A bottle of wine is good company.\\"The only good thing I can say about this book is that it is mercifully short.It is set in France and Spain in the 1920s and focuses on the lives of a bunch of expatriates seen through the eyes of an American journalist called Barnes.Barnes was wounded in the war (as Hemingway was) and appears to have been emasculated and is therefore incapable of consummating his love for the main female character, a drunken Englishwoman called Lady Brett Ashley.The scenes in Paris consist of drunken monologues and dialogues, descriptions of eating and drinking and street-by-street accounts of walks or drives and name-dropping of sights, cafes and restaurants. Nothing actually happens.Things perk up when they go to the bullfighting fiesta in Pamplona and the violence in the ring is accompanied by some shouting and fisticuffs between two other admirers of Lady Brett. One is an American Jew whom we are supposed to believe is a boxer and the other a Scotsman although he talks like an upper class English twit.Despite this flurry of activity, much of this part reads like a leaden travelogue of the sights and sounds of bus, car, train and fishing trips with comments on every field and hill that passes.Hemingway's famous unsparing style which generations of Americans have been brainwashed into thinking is great reads like a parody.If you don't believe me, here is a sample:\\"They went up-stairs and I stopped to speak to Montoya.\`Well, how did you like the bulls?' he asked.\`Good. They were nice bulls.'\`They're all right' - Montoya shook his head - \`but they're not too good.'\`What didn't you like about them?'\`I don't know. They just didn't give me the feeling that they were so good.'\`I know what you mean.'\`They're all right.'\\"Pure Hemingway - the great bull artist!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"For the life of me, I don't understand why this is considered a classic. I've thoroughly enjoyed every other Hemingway novel, but \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" bored me to tears.I get it; Jake is Hemingway. It's autobiographical. Brett (Lady Ashley) is the near-perfect woman, able to seduce any man. I get it. Jake is either a gelding or has been, in a way, castrated. I get it. This causes a ton of trouble. Once again, the point is clear.Bull fight, drinks, walking and talking, sexual tension, relationships, a possibly scuffle, eating, Spain...wash, rinse, repeat.On the other hand, the prose, the sentence structure, the choppiness, the story flows in classic Hemingway style. The dialogue keeps the book relatively short, and the characters are very well developed. Beautifully written.It's just a boring story is all."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The novel has its moments of greatness: fishing, bullfighting, and even Jake's swim--a rather life affirming, physically invigorating moment wherein the numbness induced by a week of Spanish fiesta seems to abate. Nature is the thing that revives the deadness of human realtionships. Nevertheless, reading this novel is like watching the development of a garden slug: you keep waiting for it to change into a butterfly, but it just never, ever happens. I enjoy the majority of Hemingway's works, but, to be very honest, this is not his best effort, and certainly not worth the 5 stars that one might give Moveable Feast, Farewell to Arms, or many of his short stories. I give it three stars for its powerful, raw, descriptive moments (Tell us what you really think, Hemeinway) and the writer's ability to make me laugh aloud as I read. And, although the climax is supposed to be anticlimatic, (just as the journey in Heart of Darkness is supposed to drag on and on and on...) I did not like the lack of one, single, horrible, terrific moment that would shake me enough to FEEL and remember the contents of the 245 pages I read, only to learn that human relationships are fragile,indescribable,and expensive. Someone wrote that one would either love or hate this book--I think that I am one who loves AND hates it. Maybe that is the genius of it--maybe that is for the lack of genius.

Hemingway's novels are veryaccessible -- very readable -- even for the person whomight hate novel reading. There are no paragraphs ofdense wording like Faulkner. There is the lean, spare(would we insult the ancients to call it \\"Spartan\\"?)prose -- there is the seductive ambience conveyed withclever, clipped irony and innuendo. There is a sortof fateful \\"justice\\" here in which some of the moredeserving characters get their come-uppance (at leastat the hands of the author playing \\"god\\" -- even ifit might not happen in real life).What is wrong here? Lots. Maybe Faulkner was aboozer too -- I don't know, I never met him, neverconsorted with him. But if his Nobel Prize acceptancespeech is any indication of where his real values were,then he stands hands and shoulders above Hemingway interms of themes and values. For Hemingway only showsus forlorn, ironic, self-excusing modernist \\"brats\\"who justify messing up their own and other people'slives in the name of their supposed world-weariness,psychological angst, and post-World War I disillusionment.It would be one thing if the disillusionment and thewasteland and the frenzied lifestyle to avoid lookinginto the pit of their own apparent meaninglessnessand the meaninglessness of existence were the actualdepiction here -- but one gets the feeling that thisis only a very clever cover-up. A lifestyle andself-adulation masquerading as a \\"credo\\" -- ratherthan a heart-felt, true vision of nihilism andwhat to do in the face of it.There is an issue here of a man and an artistafraid to face his \\"gentler\\" side (I refrain frominsulting women, which HE certainly did, by callingit his \\"feminine\\" side). Now whether there is alsoa fear here of facing up to some subliminal homosocial,or homosexual impulses, and whether that is a reasonto take him to task as a writer and a person, thatis left up to you to decide. But that fear, andthe desire to let hints of it out, and yet condemnit for the sake of himself and his readers and hisacceptability -- while lashing out at women andthe female as the great white \\"Bitc--s\\" is anothernegative, in my view. Why lash out at women, if youare afraid to \\"Know Thyself!\\"???True, Hemingway was wounded, probably felt pain,maybe even some grief -- but then look at what his laterlife became after he became successful. Was his endthe end of a Stoic -- or the end of a weakened, no-longerNumber One idol, fallen from the \\"grace\\" of criticaland public adulation (like a has-been athlete whois quickly forgotten)? Of course Hemingway won'tbe forgotten -- he got the Nobel Prize, too. Funny,no one seems to remember HIS speech.Because of the sunlight, the clever irony, theunforgettable characters, the trout fishing andreadability, this is my \\"favorite\\" among theHemingway novels.

Unlike many others, I was not forced to read this in school. I later visited Pamplona during the San Fermin festival. The description of Pamplona is good if you remember that nearly 80 years have passed since it was written. According to Palin, this book by Hemingway is solely responsible for the international renown of the feria at Pamplona even though there are similar events in other Spanish towns. The story centers around an expatriate American writer living in Paris and his circle of friends. They travel to Pamplona to attend the festival. I found the novel to be dull. I was able to read it through but I don't consider it a particularly good book. Unlike people in the real world, the characters in The Sun Also Rises don't seem to have to work for a living. It does provide a good description of bullfighting and fishing in Spain's Basque region. While the novel's protagonist spends two weeks in the Pamplona area, I was bored after one day. Hemingway fails to describe the drunken mobs (dressed in vomit-stained whites with a splash of red at neck and waist) roaming the streets, sleeping on benches and vomiting into gutters that I saw."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"i read this book for a high school project. i found this book very similar to the great gastby at first but when find out what the symbolism mean then you find the book amazing. the book is ambiguous in meaning but is clear to me.its a great book."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I read this book over the summer and was taken with Hemingway's portrayal of wayward, lost people who only sought to drown their sorrows in meaningless love affairs, alcohol and scandalous adventure. I absolutely loved his dry, fast, &quot;masculine&quot; prose and careful character description. I could feel for these characters, their niavete and sorrow and grief and urge to be happy and ultimate failure almost palpable. One of the more lighthearted portions of the book, however, finds the main character and his best friend going fly-fishing in a French stream. This seemed (and I cannot quite place why) remiscient of For Whom the Bell Tolls in its general construction. In all, an excellent book, on par with Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby.

The author does an excellent job of revealing the characters by avoiding boring, lengthy descriptions, choosing rather to express their feelings through dialogue and interraction. Hemingway captures moments of his life on paper, creating characters so rugged and real that the reader cannot help but be inspired and filled with wonder. Also, the story is filled with eloquent, rich imagery that truely stirs the soul. These lavish descriptions, along with all too real bull fights, bar scenes, and romantic misgivings make this novel a charming read for any interested in an author who breathes life into the pages of his writing."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This was a pretty good book, First novel by Ernest Hemingway, but I just couldn't follow the plot like why Lady Ashely and the narrator could get married! why?

I'll assume this is a fairly accurate portrait of Europe between the wars and the dissipated doings of an expatriate leisure class. It vividly captures an endless party milieu in Paris and Spain at fiesta time. Beyond that, I didn't find it very rewarding in either plot or character development. A group of friends eat and drink and screw around, and seldom reveal any sincere or recognizably human feelings as they speak in dirt-simple declarative sentences to one another. The central relationship between Jake and Brett is intriguingly problematic (his impotence from a war wound is implied), but thinly realized. Overall, a fine evocation of a time and place, but otherwise pretty lightweight."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This book is best appreciated by people who are in their late 20's or older, esp. those who have travelled or lived in Europe. The book's vivid descriptions (you can almost feel the heat on your back in the fishing scenes) and strong characterizations (Jake especially) seem to get MORE REAL the more time you spend in Europe. As you pass low signs on mass graves in Belgium (&quot;Morts par les Allemagnes&quot;) and remember an entire generation was wiped out for-- well, not much, the moodiness and the tense chatter of the characters make sense. In Europe you don't just see where this happened, you see how it could have."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"That is all that needs to be said"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises is a story of a lost generation. It takes place in the post world war one era. The story follows the life, inner struggles, and loves of a group of thirty-somethings. It especially follows the story of Jake Barnes, an American veteran of the war who is now living in Paris as a journalist. Jake suffers from an injury due to the war. He is impotent. He returns to Paris after meeting his true love Brett Ashley in a hospital. Brett is a highly sexed woman. She loves Jake but is unable to have a relationship with him because of his injury. The story unfolds when the group go to Spain for a bull fighting festival. Tempers flare over Brett by Cohn(a weak character who obsesses over Brett) and Mike(Brett's fiance). The weeks in Spain are beautifully described using imagery. The non stop parties and drunken behaviors of the group are depicted very realistically. Hemingway does a beautiful job of making the reader feel what it is like to be in the story.experiencing all the trial s of each character. The story evolves until the end although it seems nothing is resolved. This story is really the story of individual strggle and finding inner peace. After I finished the story I did not like it or really felt it had any point. It was very tedious to get through because of all the imagery used. But, after a few minutes of thinking about it, I realized the point of the story and every aspect I had not understood while reading, all fell into place. Hemingway is a distinct writer and has a definate individual style. HIs style just takes a little getting used to."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"**EDIT from 2008**I reread the novel and entirely changed my mind, and can barely believe I once wrote such a crappy, stupid review. Please entirely dismiss the following review: I had simply been a poor reader. Originally, I had given this book a single star, and I can't change it now, but I will write a new review for this and give it its due. All apologies for this horrid (old) review.-------------------------------------------------------------------------The original review, which shames me:\\"I know I don't share the general opinion on this novel. But the fact is that I not only read the book, I also studied it in a university class, so my opinion is not based solely on a shallow reading, but also with deepened analysis and studies. This of course does not make me omniscient on it, but here's my opinion: this book is as interesting to read as reading touristic handouts. It is deeply boring and it really is about nothing (call it Lost Generation if you wish). I honestly don't understand why this novel should be so praised. Not much happens and what happens happens in a boring way.Now, the bashing being done I want to say that there are other Hemingway books that are much worthier to read. I'd recommend \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" any time rather than \\"The Sun Also Rises\\". I was fairly disappointed by \\"TSAR\\", even with knowledge of the iceberg theory and all the other things related to Ernest Hemingway; in my opinion this does not save the novel at all, barely makes it worthy of scholar interest. Now maybe I am wrong about this novel, but I'm only giving you my impressions of it.Definitely not the classic it is said to be.\\""},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest, Ernest, what the heck were you thinking when you wrote this existential treatise to the Lost Penis? Lost Generation, hell, I think Mr. Hemingway was concerned with a completely different loss, that portion of the male anatomy that seems to, ahem, stick in everyone's brain when they read this gloriously minimalist book. One of the few things I got out of college English and/or Lit classes was the observation by an otherwise pompous associate professor that Hemingway (more likely his editor) pared his prose to the point that every word was perfect and necessary, and that these words comprised equally perfect sentences and paragraphs and chapters ad nauseum. But he had a point. The only two things wrong with this book have to do with Mr. Barnes, ahem, short-coming, which seemed contrived to me, and the not so subtle racism. But the latter point is like complaining about Huckleberry Finn, The Sun Also Rises is a product of its time, like Finn was a product of Twain's, and if you don't apply today's standards and are capable of holding your unease, you'll find here some of the most elegant writing in the English language."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"We have only one life to live, so we can find some subjects worth reading and thinking about. This lost generation that is depicted in this badly written book is not one of them. Think about unsung heroes from generations that survive lesser known genocides, and the people who galvanize a society after unspeakable destructions brought by ruthless revolutonaries, guerillas, and militias. There are far better books written by less-known authors about these &quot;lost generations&quot; that do not go about aimlessly drinking, binging, and partying but instead do something more noble and redeeming, even in small ways. If only Hemingway were not so famous, anyone can recognize that this book of his was written in such a mediocre way, and he unfortunately chose a sad and hopeless subject."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I picked up the Sun Also Rises as my first introduction to Hemingway. While I was very excited - I have to say however that I was fairly disappointed with this 200+ page novel. More than once during this novel, I had thoughts of putting it down never to return to it.The pace of the book, extremely slow and methodical, make it very difficult to get through the whole story. The tone is fairly monotonous for most of the book with the plot unwinding in very ordinary fashion without much intrigue whatsoever.I found the characters in the book to be a bit annoying - their excessive eating and drinking along with their rather quick, undeveloped dialogue proved difficult to digest. The characters appeared to avoid some of the major topics, situations and events that were laid out in the novel in favor of drinking, eating & socializing.The saving grace of this book is Hemingway's depiction of bull-fighting towards the end. Even though many pages are not spent in this area, there was well-written, intriguing and even suspenseful prose in those bull-fighting pages.The main reason I read this book through till the end was to find out how things would develop and end with the character Brett - and her relationship with Jake.As I mentioned - however - the novel proved to be a disappointment."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest Hemingway's book The Sun Also Rises is a remarkably thought-provoking story that is very skillfully written. Through his use of short, factual sentences, Hemingway describes the actions of his colorful characters. These, in turn relate covert sentiments and defining characteristics of an entire era, that is, the post World War I era. The story revolves around Jake Barnes, an American expatriate who is left impotent due to a war wound. Therefore, his love of Lady Brett Ashley is crushed, even though deep mutual love exists. They met while she, as a VAD in the war nursed his wounds. Brett as she is called throughout the novel suffers through several brief affairs. Jake and his friends are among the Lost Generation, who, scarred by the war, have lost hope, spiritual belief and their sense of purpose and direction. Thus the group also including Robert Cohn, a Jewish Princeton lightweight champion, Bill Gorton, an American writer and fellow expatriate and Mike Campbell, Brett's fianc&eacute;e spend most of their time drinking in the caf&eacute;s of Paris and at the Fiesta in Pamplona, Spain.Hemingway, through this book depicts the anxiety and disorientation of the Lost Generation. He shows the men and women, just coming of age at the end of the war, who are driven to immoderate drinking and a devil-may-care attitude in order to avoid expressing their feelings of the war. Hemingway also exposes his readers to issues such as the abuse of Jews resembling that of Robert Cohn, the effects of excessive drinking and even the brutal realities of Bullfighting in Spain. Though, Hemingway also provides hope for this generation because amid the despair and heartache, the sun also rises.I would recommend this novel to all fans of Hemingway and his revolutionary style of writing as well as to anyone interested in exploring a post war novel with moving themes. Though, I would also caution all who are intolerant of profane language."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest Hemingway's entry to fame was when this piece of work was put into mass production. Over time, Hemingway's style of writing has changed quite a bit and by reading this, one of his first novels, one is able to see the progression of a man outfitted with an artistic and utterly brilliant mind. The Sun Also Rises was rather difficult to read, however, the time spent working through the novel, evaluating each character, following the plot, and picturing the development of the theme was well worth it.The novel consists of many different types of characters. The novel's main character and narrator, Jake Barnes, an ex-militant, is a journalist stationed in Paris where easily more drinking and partying takes place than any sort of actual work. Barnes is also quite possibly the reason the book is somewhat difficult to read. His tendency to keep the reader unaware of what his actions are, but describe everyone else's actions makes him quite a difficult character to understand. A second important character happens to be the love of Jake's life, Lady Brett Ashley. Ashley, like all of the rest of the characters in the novel is a heavy drinker. Barnes loves her so much, and even she loves him back but refuses to make any sort of committment because she has a very indecisive attitude. Unfortunately, her life seems to be leading to an endless sea of sadness and depression, no positive goals are in sight. Outside of Jake's relationship, he shares good times with a group of friends, one of the closest being Robert Cohn. Cohn is one of those friends that everyone enjoys picking on, but he doesn't what he would do without him. Cohn is also a drinker, but shares different ideas on opinions such as casual sex and also happens to be jewish. A fellow, yet more consistant drinker than the rest, Mike Cambell, is a rather perfect depiction of the feelings expressed throughout this novel. He is a poor alcoholic with a horrible temper. Barnes has a few other friends and meets many others throughout the journey of this novel, but none shed too far from the typical drunken aquatance.When The Sun Also Rises was published in 1926, it tells a story of the concerns a group of Americans residing in Europe during the mid 1920s. The two main characters are Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley. During the beginning of the novel we are told that Ashley's husband was killed in World War 1 and happened to work in the same hospital that Barnes was sent to after he was injured in combat. This is the beginning of Barnes' loving feelings for Ashley. Jake begins his story by telling of his pre and current relationship with a fellow drinkig partner, Robert Cohn. The morning after Jake begins his story, he is at breakfast with Cohn. It is here where Jake points out Ashley to Cohn and he is very overwhelmed by her beauty. A few weeks after this small get-together, Jake and Cohn are traveling in a small town near Paris where heavy drinker, Bill Gorton is introduced. Jake, Cohn, and Gorton spend their time together fishing, drinking, and partying following their train trip to Spain. Following 5 days of partying, Jake and Bill decide to make another trip to a small town outside spain, but Cohn decides to stay. Jake and Bill check into a small hotel where they meet a young bullfighter, Montoya, who tells them of a bullfighting festival coming up in a few short days. This festival is highly enjoyed by Jake and Bill being that it consists mostly of heavy drinking, dancing, and everything that generally goes along with it. A day or so later, Cohn arrives with Ashley. This is a suprise to Jake, who becomes extremely enraged. There is a fight and Cohn ends up knocking out both Jake and Bill. After a well thought out apology, there is forgiveness among the group of men. Following this agreement, the next day the three men rent a car and head their seperate ways. Jake chooses to go back to spain with Ashley, who has once again become indecisive about the man she chooses to be with. The ending scene takes place with Jake and Ashley speaking of how good they would have been together, but unfortunately never were. The novel ends with a depressing quote from Jake, \\"Yes, isn't it pretty to think so?\\" after Ashley tells him of her feelings for him.The characters of this novel provide the reader with quite an obvious theme. A theme depicting a society with no goals or any general direction in their lives. Instead of taking the time to plan on the future, their time is spent partying and drinking, which leads them no further to happiness, even though they may think it at the time. All this partying is merely a distraction from Jake and his friends from seeing the downfall of their futures."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Some people tend to expect too much or over-analyze the book. It is simply a story of loss and how we try to overcome it. Be it unrequited love, being socially unaccepted, lost in a foreign land, or even your generation. The book presents the questions and shows the struggles of finding meaning for our actions that Hemingway and all of us encounter. He doesn't try to answer any questions but its reassuring that we are not alone. Its beautifully staccoto style and troubled characters make this a true classic and a strong reccommendation to anyone feeling lost."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I enjoyed this book very much while I was reading it, and looking back I still believe it is perhaps Hemingway's best (although my choice shifts frequently between TSAR and A Farewell to Arms). Looking at the reviews before me, I must say that TSAR contains some of Hemingway's most interesting characters-- Jake is the typical code hero for Hemingway, but his situation is one of the best (in terms of literary device value) for a novel of this type; Brett fits the role of the Hemingway power-woman; and Cohn, well, he's just a jerk.I had to read this book for my AP Literature class in high school a few years ago, and came up with some really satisfying essays for it. There's lots to work with here-- it's a good book for school. But on a different note, I also lent it to my roommate, who was looking for a book to give her boyfriend as a gift, since he didn't read much. She determined TSAR to be &quot;manly enough&quot; and her boyfriend, so I hear, enjoyed it very much. I did too."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I was forced to read this book in high school, and it did nothing for me, but as an adult I think it is incredible.

But you have to read the whole book to measure the intensity of this amazing dialogue."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises is indeed an amazing novel and I'll leave it at that. I would like to point out to a few of the &quot;reviewers&quot; who have waxed poetic about &quot;the lost generation&quot; quote that maybe they should read An Immovable Feast to get the history (Hemingway's version) of this overused label. You might not find it so metaphoric. Also, this novel was during Hemingways slice of life period. Many of his companions were leary of mentioning stories in front of him for they would be incorporated into whatever he was working on at the time. The story of Robert Cohen and the trip from Paris to Spain were real events, Bill was based on Robert Benchly and another cohort, and the reason Jake is impotent is because Hemingway was married at the time (Pretty deep, huh).

Not bad for one of his very first works."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is, undoubtefully, the best war book ever written in Modern Literature... although there's no war scenes in it! It's the best because it shows how a war affects indivudual lives of ordinary human beings.

An emasculated man, he is the linch pin that holds this band of homeless souls together. Each of the characters lives in a fantasy of their own to cushion them from the realization of how pathetic their existences are. Except for Jake. The strength he must have in order to face life in all its harshness without stumbling is nothing short of admirable. This is Hemingway's hero."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Author Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961) burst into fame with this 1926 novel about U.S. ex-patriots living and partying in post-war Paris during the 1920's. Hemingway captures the feel of that city and the \\"in\\" crowd that partied there. The story is told by narrator Jake Barnes, an American whose mysterious wound from the war (World War One) has left him sexually incapable. This makes forever unattainable the British object of his affections, chic and lovely Brett. Others in the clique include Brett's drunken fianc&eacute; Mike Campbell, her angry ex-lover Robert Cohn, and sardonic novelist Bill Gorton. These characters hang together and enjoy themselves, despite disillusionment, alienation and longing - not too mention rather empty lives and a sad fixation with alcohol. Even their playful trip to Pamplona to watch the Spanish bullfights feels like a competing mix of good times and escape.Despite Hemingway's crisp prose this is an over-rated novel, and far from the author's top efforts like FAREWELL TO ARMS and OLD MAN AND THE SEA. Still, Hemingway was on his way, and he joined James Thurber, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, William L. Shirer, Gertrude Stein and Kay Boyle as talented U.S. writers who spent much time in Paris during the 1920's."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises, published in 1926, is a novel that makes us think about the sense of despair and disenchantment which followed the First World War, but also reflects on the meaning of life. Hemingway depicts these people in the novel as expatriates living in Paris and are members of what Gertrude Stein called the \\"lost generation.\\" The material for the novel resulted from a journey Hemingway made with his first wife, Hadley Richardson, and several friends to Pamplona, Spain, in 1925.What is most powerful in this story, is Hemingway's use of language. Hemingway's prose, particularly his unadorned sentences, understated dialogue and lean description was revolutionary when The Sun Also Rises was first published. And his idiosyncratic spare prose is still fresh today. Indeed Hemingway was one of the most copied styles of the twentieth century too. In fact, Hemingway went on to win the Nobel Prize in 1954 for his narrative and influential prose style.To read The Sun Also Rises, will let you experience what it was like in Paris and Spain for the generation after the First World War. Moreover, this novel will give you a sense of their disillusionment and hope that were lived by the expatriate community. Recommended."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This early Ernest Hemingway novel, set in France and Spain, exemplifies the lifestyle of the not-really rich and the not-yet famous Anglos who chose to live abroad. Struggling with various literary and amorous challenges in 1920's Paris, several American and British young men decide to play tourist in exotic Pamplona--the annual scene of a week-long fiesta which is highlighted by many bullfights. This carefree, dissolute crowd takes life as a lark--superficially at least; inevitably, their extravagant nightlife and lush social habits backfire and relationships disintegrate.This story of moral decadence is narrated by Jake, a laidback reporter for an American newspaper; he hangs out with colleagues who are trying to write novels. Mostly however, they are fatally attracted to theenigmatic but irresistible Lady Brett Ashley, despite her masculine affectations. Slightly married to an English Lord yet slightly engaged to Mike, she is accustomed to the homage of men, but she finds herself choked by the ardent, unwanted attentions of Robert Cohn--a Jew who does not really belong in their set, despite his Gentile education. We soon realize that poor Jake is deeply in love with Brett himself, yet he generously sacrifices his own ardor in order to facilitate Brett's temporary happiness. He accepts Mike, is amused by the Count, annoyed by Cohn, but sets her up with his newest acquaintance--a handsome young matador. Ah, but whom will the desirable lady ultimately choose?This short novel reads fairly quickly; many pages consist of dialogue of short quips, making it difficult to keep clear which characters are speaking. This would make a wonderful play, since it can easily be envisioned in scenes. The final section is brief, but anti- climactic, since the leading lady has left the stage. The subesequent plot is reduced to just Jake picking up the remnants of his dreams. No doubt this literary let-down is necessary to relax the frantic pace, but readers may resent the lack of action. Dear Jake asks no reward for his unselfish catering to Brtett's every whim. Is there life for mortal men after thewhirlwind of booze and passion in Spain? One wonders how much of Hemingway's own experiences are included in this novel...Moths to the flame? Whether one approves of Brett's antics or not, she proves one Lady you will not soon forget!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I would put this book with Catcher in the Rye for books for the disenfranchised. The characters in this book talks about a &quot;lost generation&quot; that felt a sinking in their souls after the First World War at that time referred to as the Great War. I would argue that there is a lost generation in every generation which comprises a subset a people that feel no need to mature and live life as a vagabond. This book brings those types of characters in the foreground with good characters. It includes a character with low self esteem with a weakness to be loved by a woman who gives just a little attention to him, a character that acts like a jerk whenever he has the excuse to be one, a character that can't make up her mind on who to be with at that moment and a thoughtful character that puts all of this into perspective as the first person narrator. The book is a nice one for singles to read as it give similar types of interactions.It was hard trying to identify how Paris might have been like or Pamplona because there was some but not much description of the scenery of the two cities. I mainly wanted to know the sights and sounds of the running of the bulls but the running of the bulls was mainly a background to the main plot of the story. But I wasn't really disappointed with that as much as the ending.What I got from Hemingway's style was that his stories are best when appreciated in the moment. You shouldn't try to find a logical progression from chapter to chapter about plot and where you should see the characters going. The beauty of his writings dives into the psyche of his characters and gets involved in how personal flaws can lead to bad situations and bad outcomes. It doesn't try to answer how to live or how to fix them but merely seeks sympathy for them."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Although the novel seems almost tame by today's standards, when this book (Hemingway's first novel) was released in 1926 it was a ground breaker and considered scandalous by many, including Hemingway's parents.The center of the novel is Jake Barnes, a WWI veteran who has lost the use of a certain very personal appendage as a result of a war wound. Jake struggles with what the wound means to his life and with his love for Brett Ashley, a love that in his mind will have to remain forever unrequited because of his wound.Alcohol is a major player in Jake and his friends' lives, and throughout the book he attempts to cover over the pain he is in with alcohol and traveling with his friends. Hemingway, without even informing the reader of the exact nature of the wound (I doubt he would have been able to be published had he described the exact nature of the wound), conveys both the true nature of the wound and the emotional pain that comes with it for Jake.The novel is somewhat auto-biographical in that Hemingway suffered wounds to his legs in WWI and that most of the characters were based on actual people he knew. At the time of the book's release, there was some concern that he might be sued for libel, but nothing ever came of it. In fact, several of the real individuals upon whom the characters were based bragged for many years that they were basis for the characters.A little trivia related to the book: Hemingway's parents were repulsed by the novel and made Ernest aware of it. This caused some turmoil in family relations and Ernest's pride was obviously wounded by their disgust with the book.Years later, when Hemingway was hospitalized after a plane crash, a reporter kept insisting that Hemingway's story was more auto-biographical than originally thought. The reporter kept insisting that he believed Hemingway suffered the same wound as Jake (despite the fact that Hemingway had fathered several children by then). Tired of arguing with the reporter, Hemingway finally pulled back the sheets to show the reporter that he suffered no such wound."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I read The Sun Also Rises for one of my summer reading requirements. Initially, I was skeptical as to whether I would enjoy Hemingway, but in the end it turned out to be one of my favorite books.The story begins with the introduction of a group of friends who are living in France after World War I. They go out to notorious cafes, luxurious restaurants, and wild clubs and try to drink away their disillusionment with themselves. When that doesn't seem to allievate the problem, they venture out to Spain, once again attempting to run away from their tribulations.The book is set in a generally mellow atmosphere which can get a bit slow at times, but the whimsical characters allow for more exciting events such as the bullfights, the fights, and the conversations.This book is strikingly familiar to The Great Gatsby. However, this proves no coincidence as Hemingway and Fitzgerald were friends during their time spent in Europe with the rest of the expatriates. This novel reflects the lives of the &quot;Lost Generation,&quot; and will most certainly leave you entertained."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"As recounted in Hemingway's memoir \\"A Moveabe Feast\\", none other than Gertrude Stein was very critical of Hemingway's earlier works and gave him some disparaging criticism. Over 80 years have passed, and Hemingway is still widely read today, and with good reason: the man was a born writer.Hemingway's first novel is a story of the \\"lost generation\\"; those who came of age during World War 1 and lived as expatriates in Paris. The hero of the story is Jake Barnes, a man suffering from a bad injury during the war and his relationships. Never boring, the book is at its best when the more everyday aspects of life intrude upon the narrative. The characters are all sharply drawn. I was at first worried about the bull-fighting sequences, not because I am opposed to the sport, but because I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to sustain interest, but the passages are so well-written that it's no problem. Hemingway's first is a good place to start to get used to his narrative technique. He's one of the earliest writers I have encountered who can write about \\"nothing\\" and make it Something."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"It is very hard to argue that Hemingway's writing style is not simple perfection, and his books are always enjoyable, but (and maybe it's me) I always have a bit of a hard time relating to his characters. They always seem to be wealthy gamesmen traveling the world safari hunting, or fishing, or (in the case of this book) a little of both. Should every reader be able to relate to every character in every book? I doubt it, so I would still urge anyone to pick this one up, but you may find that the characters seem a little distant and hard to sympathize with, in many cases. It's about an American newspaper man living in Europe and his wealthy, or once-wealthy, friends as they travel to Spain to fish, drink, watch the running of the bulls, drink, enjoy the bullfights, drink, screw, drink, and fight. It's a short book -- give this one a try."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemingway is a fantastic writer, however his plotting leaves much to be desired in this story of an impotent (in more ways than one) man who drifts through life as though he has no purpose.I absolutely hate the end of the book, where Brett tells him that if he wasn't impotent \\"we could've had a hell of a good time.\\"I do mark the book as 3 stars however, because Hemingway's use of language is so powerful. The plot is absolutely useless."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Something that Hemingway argued was the fact that the English language is insufficient in fully describing ideas and events. In his style, what is not said is just as important as what is said. His sentences are purposely short and require deep thought to fully realize the conceptual themes. ... This book IS taught for a reason."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I'm never sure where all the poo-pah comes from respecting this novel! Just get this: Lady Brett Ashley is worth dropping a ten spot herself. Read for, what's that fancy term, the spirit of the age. Get a look at our expatriates; they're fascinating! It's not a &quot;gift&quot; book--but for the person who knows the person within, you won't slide off the trail."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I thought this was an excellent book. After reading &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; and enjoying it imensely, I picked this book. It still amazes me the way Hemingway could explain the feeling of any given moment in such a way that reminded me of a similar moment or feeling that I have experianced in my life. I found myself wishing i could write in such a way and found it is much easier to read than write in such a style. Some have found this book &quot;boring&quot; and that the drinking was &quot;excessive&quot; but this is what an entire generation of people were experiancing after WWI. I've visited both Paris and Spain, and after this read, I wanted to go back to Spain and see if I could some how retrace Jake's steps in this story. An excellent book!

There are telegrams and wires being sent and of the stadium and the sport people are there in the flesh, not at home watching on the television.The characters drink and get tight. They travel about the countries on trains and by carriage and the modern beasts of planes, fast trains and motor vehicles on highways are not mentioned because they did not exist.But there is a familiarity with the story Hemmingway tells that it breaks my heart: That of unrequitted love. His love for Brett runs deep, it is certainly of the heart and soul, but she needs that which he cannot give.Read it."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemingway gives such a natural touch to the book that it seems like you are watching a movie. The book becomes profoundly engaging when you aproach the middle. The characters go to Spain, and there the thrill begins. Cohn, who accepts all the insults from his friends, finally does what he should do and fight for what he wants. Hemingway describes the scenes with such reality that makes you want to be there. It's simply great! You don't know what you are missing. Get up, and go read this explendid work!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"How he did it, I don't know. Like most great work, it is so complicated, it's simple. I found myself there. The final part of the book with Jake and Brett ranks up there with the greatest writing I have ever read. It honestly left me speechless."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"American expatriates and a spoilt English Upper Class woman in Europe in the 1920s, the gay life in Paris, troutfishing and bullfighting, the Fiesta in Pamplona - the ingredients Hemingway so brilliantly used to construct one of the 20th century\`s most famous and read novels. Here Hemingway\`s structure, his narrative style with the simple use of language really came on display for the first time. A book that totally gripped me and fascinated me. Excellent, brilliant, simply Ernest Hemingway!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"this summer is this book. Many detractors of this book seem to indicate there is no point to the story that Hemingway tells - and these people are, unfortunately, missing the entire point. The landscapes and quiet reflections Hemingway describes, especially throughout his travels in Spain, are timeless and make the reader feel that the author is speaking directly to them, one of Hemingway's most endearing qualities. The specifics of the storyline are secondary to the emotion and attitudes toward life many of the characters display throughout the book. See you in Pamplona!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"At best, I consider this book to be a typical of the post WWI authors- rather plotless, lost, simple story-telling.

Even though I was not forced to read this book, I was however, pushed to read two of Ernest's novels. I enjoyed The Sun Also Rises although I agree with one review that states that &quot;Lady&quot; Brett was a whore. I firmly believe the story could not have had the same entertaining efffects without her in it. The Scribner version I read did not include the fact that the narrator, Jacob Barnes, was impotent. That fact alone brings a massive wave of clearity to why they acted the way they did around each other. This is a book to read when you simply want to be entertained."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"What a jewel! Hemingway's style and prose is so refreshing. With every page I wanted to jump in and join the group of expatriates on there vacation. He capture the fine details and the pains of life with his brevity rather than relying on grandiose paragraphs and sentences. Sometimes beauty is found in simplicity, and this story is the perfect example. A must read and must own for anyone's personal collection."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This might actually be my favorite book as well. It typifies the \\"Hemingway style\\" of writine-- the infamous subject verb adverrb sentences and machismo. Brett Ashley, insecurities and all is probably his most interesting book for readers interested in a female character. It's definitely a quick read, very interesting and well constructed, especially for a first novel."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I don't know that Hemingway's work takes on quite the depths that he is given credit for, but it does have emotion and a feeling. He gives the feeling that is there, the emptiness that the characters fill with booze and Brett. It is a picture of the loss of innocence and trust in our modern world. It is sad, the only thing that any human has to seek after in the book is alcohol and sex, and both leave the person empty. The closest thing to a real relationship on the book is between Jake and Brett, which cannot be because of his incapability to fill her carnal needs, though it is the one thing that might actually make them happy, since it is not based purely on sexual attraction. The bullfights are gory, and eveything has a kind of gritty, earthy feel to it. It is a simple story of the insatiability of the human desire...there's always another bull to kill..."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises is a book of such literary power and everlasting relevance that there really aren't enough ways to emphasize how important it is. The Lost Generation of Post-World War I Europe and America is captured perfectly and flawlessly in Hemingway's prose. As my generation continues to try to carve out it's own niche, it's own place in history, it continues to express itself with futility and Hemingway's masterpiece enjoys a striking relevance today.Hemingway writes with unparalleled precision. His characters come to life more when they are merely sitting at a bar or fishing in Spain than the characters of lesser writers do throughout the entire course of a novel. His environments are real and vivid. Additionally, his writing is so accessible that it is impossible not to be completely absorbed, the reader losing himself or herself in the swirling yet empty decadence of the 1920s ex-pat scene in Paris."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises was my first introduction to a Hemingway masterpiece and it has certainly changed my perceptions on \\"writing\\" and \\"literary style\\". At first, I wondered why he was going on and on about aimless lives, and by the end of the bullfight it was so clear that Hemingway was a literary genius. Word became character and character evolved into word. His narrative absolutely captured the lives of the lost generation after the war, and that is his genius. His ability to transcend the explanatory. Althought written almost 80 years ago, I felt transported to that time when life seemed aimless and yet profoundly full of optimism and hope."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Reading one of Hemmingway's first acclaimed novels, I felt the Sun Also Rises truly transported me to a different time and place. The simple narration was colourful and great, and the descriptions of the American and English friends frolicking through the cafes and restaurants left me stunk of wine, and merriment. Reading this book made my drunk just by all the booze they were consuming.Nevertheless, I didn't feel this novel take off until they arrived in Spain. Brett is a character that is for sure, but everyone else seems relegated to supporting parts. I kind of was hoping the story would tell a litte bit more about them.I did enjoy the book but only in places, and I also feel that the book seems a bit dated. But it's a good read no doubt. Yes I liked it."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"In high school, I went through a stage where I read a lot of Hemingway, and I really didn't like any of it. I kept reading it, though I don't think I ever understood that little masochistic streak. Now, after returning to Hemingway with this novel, I think I see a little more clearly. Hemingway's &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; is such an accomplished look at the lost generation, and I think the experience of those lost searchers really parallels in so many ways the experience of my generation (and probably that of every subsequent generation). This novel really resonated with me.It's the story of Jake and several other moneyed expatriates who wander through Europe trying to forget their despair and trying to hide from their unhappiness. They wander through meaningless episode after meaningless episode, though at times, there are luminous moments where the characters truly connect with one another (during the fishing trip and when Jake and Brett are together), and you see what might have been or what could be if they could only break out of their current empty existences. The Sun Also Rises is a poignant, heart-breaking work with an abundance of meaning for today."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This interesting piece of expatriate literature is a fascinating look at the post World War One &quot;Lost Generation,&quot; to which Hemingway himself claimed to belong. Through the eyes of the main character, Jake, we see what life was like for an American living in Europe in the post-war years. The relationship between Jake and the other main character, Brett, provides another interesting view of the moral and social values of this time. The plot of the novel is focused on bullfighting in Spain, though the fights seem to be merely a backdrop for the interaction between Brett, her fiancee Mike, Jake, and their American friends Robert and Bill. Throughout the book, we see interaction between the characters that reflect Hemingway's view of expatriate society at that time.This is a very entertaining book. It is lighter than some of Hemingway's other work (such as For Whom the Bell Tolls), and is in some ways more readable. The book is very well written, but the dialogue is what makes this work truly great. It is at times funny, at times serious, at times biting, and at times just plain entertaining. This is the book that made Hemingway a force to be reckoned with, and, reading it, I can see why. This is a great book for any fan of Hemingway or for anyone interested in good modern literature."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway is an intriguing and well-written story. I enjoyed reading this book mostly because of the captivating plot. I felt that Jake Barnes was an unusual character and the fact that he never got what he wanted added more interest to the plot. However, Lady Brett Ashley angered me due to her selfishness and destructive behavior towards all of the men in this book. Although it fit in with the plot, her character aggravated me. I felt bad for Jake and how Brett treated him, but I also think that the tension between the two of them added a lot of interest to the story. \\"Oh, Jake,\\" Brett said, \\"we could have had such a damned good time together.\\" (251) Aside from the intense drama occurring during the story with Brett and her lovers, I really enjoyed reading about the crazy nights that this group of friends would have. They were always out at bars and cafes, and when they went to Spain for the bullfighting there was a non-stop festival.I feel that the most significant theme in this novel was the characters' feelings of having meaningless lives. Jake feels as though his life has no more meaning after his injury during the war. But he's not the only one who feels this sense of worthlessness. This group of friends drowned their troubled minds with drinking and dancing, and that was how they coped with their aimless lives every day. This theme does not relate to my life at all, but I'm sure it relates to the lives of many other people. Some people turn to drinking or drugs or anything they can to escape their feelings of misery or emptiness.While reading this book, I couldn't put it down. I think it's an extraordinary story and I would defiantly recommend this book to anyone. The plot is intense and dramatic, with unexpected twists and bizarre characters. I recommend this book for those interested in reading about the fictional lives of a group of aimless souls looking for trivial ways to escape their feelings."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is the first time that I read this book, and I really enjoyed it (though I think that A FAREWELL TO ARMS is my favorite of the two). I loved reading it aloud for the humor in the dialog that becomes apparent more when spoken, and I've known people who were so inspired by this novel that they've gone all the way to Pamplona to see the Running of the Bulls for themselves.There are some themes that emerged throughout and became part of the hum of the book, loneliness of the lifestyle, even though it sounds quite nice at first blush -- living without obligations turns to living aimlessly; stopping into a pub for a drink all the time, turns to a soggy, fogged existence affected by too much alcohol and drunkeness; traveling as you please turns to physical aimlessness and a desire to have someone to go to; and being so free turns to being lonely (even the traveler that Jake and Bill meet in the fishing town in Spain seems almost unbearably lonely).Hemingway's prose is engrossing and seems to kind of motor you forward, forward, forward. Again, as I was with FAREWELL, I was blown away by the contradiction of the kind of journalistic, unemotional writing and the high level of emotions reading Hemingway produces due to the intimacy that the style makes one feel with the protagonist. I really enjoyed it again here.However, I wonder if there isn't something about this novel that appeals more to men, generally speaking. I liked it, but I wasn't as moved by it as the other novel of his that I've read. I don't know that I'd go all the way to Spain based on this work alone. Perhaps its the theme of the insecurity of the men, their vulnerability to Brett that resonates with men. I just didn't like Brett too much (and thought Hemingway didn't either)."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I loved reading this book. I love the simple imagery of Hemingway and the experiences he writes about: bullfighting, fishing, drinking, dancing, fighting, drinking, going to local taverns to eat and drink, romance, travel, and drinking. I have never studied Hemingway and know not why he is a part of a generation lost, but I am 21 and love to read his short stories (which I highly recommend all to buy the complete one book version of) and found this book to be a great read."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises survives as a classic as much because of Hemingway's radical departure in writing style as for the content that made the book an immediate popular success in 1926. It roared into the Roaring Twenties and Prohibition, a generation reeling from the disillusionment of World War I and ready for liberation from suffocating Victorian social strictures and the existing cumbersome florid literary style.The Sun Also Rises appeals especially to the young hedonist whose parents never \\"did it\\" in daytime and felt guilty if they did it for any purpose but procreation. The book gushes with drinking scenes that tantalized alcohol-parched Americans whose access to liquor had been severely restricted for years. The characters behave less like mature adults than kids who've just reached drinking age.If the appeal of booze and an airy new way of writing weren't enough, Brett Ashley, the female lead and possibly the first truly liberated woman in American literature, ensured the book's success. In the United States, women had in 1920 only just acquired the right to vote. And here was a beautiful mature woman enjoying unmarried sex with serial partners of her choosing while wearing a man's hat and short hair. What a seismic shock to conservative Midwestern values.Hemingway was only twenty-four when he wrote The Sun Also Rises. He'd barely begun to live. At eighteen he'd spent a mere five weeks in military uniform before he was injured, convalesced in a hospital and got sent home. How could a twenty-four-year-old who'd never even been to college know much worth writing about other than his war experience, which the book hardly mentions? Perhaps there's an answer in the way Hemingway hurled himself at life. Life excited him. He lived the hedonistic lifestyle for which so many post-Victorian readers hungered. But he also reflected on himself and the behavior of those around him and wrote about what he noticed.It's interesting that both The Sun Also Rises and The Great Gatsby are about young men obsessing over beautiful but shallow women and were written at about the same time (Feb '25 for Gatsby and Oct '26 for TSAR) by two young men who were had been close friends.[May contain spoilers]Synopsis: Three expatriate American writers, Jake, Bill and Cohn, rendezvous in Paris before leaving on a holiday trip to the bullfight fiesta in Pamplona, Spain, accompanied by a beautiful British divorcee and her new beau, Michael, also a Brit. Jake narrates the story and is in love with Brett but impotent due to his war injury. She professes to be in love with Jake but they are not intimate. On the way to Pamplona, Jake and Bill go fishing and Cohn goes off to be seduced by Brett.In Pamplona there is a lot of drinking and misbehaving and they attend the bull-fights. Brett becomes enamored with a champion young matator, Romero, and seduces him. Cohn, jealous, confronts them and severely beats Romero, who must go into the ring the next day despite his injuries. Cohn also fights with the other two Americans. Brett runs off with Romero for an affair and a week later expels him and calls Jake to help her reunite with Michael.Jake's impotency is a twist that doesn't seem to have much purpose other than to neutralize the narrator by insulating him from being a full-on competitor to Cohn for Brett's affections. Jake's neutered status does pique the curiosity. Perhaps it stems from Hemingway's experience convalescing in hospital from the war injuries that handicapped him temporarily in bed. (Brett's complaints of being sexually frustrated may have originated with Hemingway's nurse and paramour, Agnes.)The Sun Also Rises is about the emptiness of idle self-indulgence. Through the voice of Jake Barnes, Hemingway expresses his groping quest for meaning and morality. The book holds up the mirror to a group of misbehaving expatriates and says, \\"Here, look at yourselves!\\"An absurd premise for the book might be that immorality is whatever makes you feel guilty:[Jake, drunk and narrating] \\"...I wished Mike would not behave so terribly to Cohn, though. ...I liked to see him hurt Cohn. I wished he would not do it, though, because afterward it made me disgusted at myself. That was morality; things that made you disgusted afterward. No, that must be immorality.\\" Is this the musing of a drunkard or are we supposed to take it seriously?Throughout the book, Jake gropes into moral territory, reflecting the view that life is just a series of transactions, this-for-that value exchanges. This view appears six or seven times, on pages 34, 67, 78, 152-153, 156, & 237.Brett (p.34): \\"'Don't we pay for all the things we do? ...When I think of the hell I've put chaps through. [meaning torturing men with her provocative sexuality] I'm paying for it now.'\\" [meaning she's the one now being tortured by denial of sexual relations with Jake, whom she professes to love, due to his impotency.] The operative phrase here is \\"we pay for all the things we do.\\"The values concept appears next during a string of scenes involving Count Mippipopolous (pp. 60-71):[The Count] \\"'You see, Mr. Barnes, it is because I have lived very much that now I can enjoy everything so well. Don't you find it like that?' [He feels he's earned the right to enjoy life. He's entitled because he's paid his dues.]'Yes. Absolutely.' [Jake]\`I know,' said the count. \`That is the secret. You must get to know the values.'\`Doesn't anything ever happen to your values?' Brett asked.\`No. Not any more.'\`Never fall in love?'\`Always,' said the count. \`I am always in love.'\`What does that do to your values?'\`That, too, has got a place in my values.'\`You haven't any values. You're dead, that's all.'\`No, my dear. You're not right. I'm not dead at all.'\\"Here the theory of life as a series of transactions, value for value, is asserted by the Count and Jake agrees. Brett probes for a weak spot in the theory, implying that love trumps everything, but the Count sticks by his assertion that suffering (he's been to war and is battle scarred) entitles one to appreciate the good life.The values theme appears next on page 78: [Bill] \\"\`...Simple exchange of values. You give them money. They give you a stuffed dog.'\`We'll get one on the way back.' [Jake]\`All right. Have it your own way. Road to hell paved with un-bought stuffed dogs.'\\"This is a minor repetition of the theme, hardly worth mentioning except as a reminder that sometimes the exchange of values may seem out of balance.Having prepared the reader, Hemingway next takes the philosophy of the value exchange much deeper on page 152:[Jake, narrating] \\"I had been having Brett for a friend. I had not been thinking about her side of it. I had been getting something for nothing. That only delayed the presentation of the bill. The bill always came. That was one swell thing you could count on.I thought I had paid for everything. Not like the woman pays and pays. No idea of retribution or punishment. Just exchange of values. You gave up something and got something else. Or you worked for something. You paid some way for everything that was any good. I paid my way into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time. Either you paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances, or by money. Enjoying living was learning to get your money's worth and knowing when you had it. [emphasis added] You could get your money's worth. The world was a good place to buy in. It seemed like a fine philosophy. In five years, I thought, it will seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies I've had.Perhaps that wasn't true, though. Perhaps as you went along you did learn something. I did not care what it was all about. All I wanted to know was how to live in it. Maybe if you found out how to live in it you learned from that what it was all about.\\"The above passage includes an outright declaration of Jake's transactional theory as the \\"...exchange of values. You gave up something and got something else.\\" What could be more clear?Next Jake applies his transactional theory to the mundane act of reading a book (p. 153):[Jake, narrating, drunk]\\"I knew that now, reading it in the over-sensitized state of my mind after much too much brandy, I would remember it somewhere, and afterward it would seem as though it had really happened to me. I would always have it. That was another good thing you paid for and then had.\\"On page 156 is another reflection on life as exchange transactions:[Jake, narrating about the peasants] \\"They had come in so recently from the plains and the hills that it was necessary that they make their shifting in values gradually. They could not start in paying cafe prices. They got their money's worth in the wine-shops. Money still had a definite value in hours worked and bushels of grain sold. Late in the fiesta it would not matter what they paid, nor where they bought.\\"This is another minor reference to values, reinforcing the transactional concept.On page 237 the values concept is mentioned one last time before the meaning of the book is fully revealed in the denoument:[Jake, narrating, about being back in France] \\"It felt comfortable to be in a country where it is so simple to make people happy. ...Everything is on such a clear financial basis in France. It is the simplest country to live in. No one makes things complicated by becoming your friend for any obscure reason. If you want people to like you you have only to spend a little money. I spent a little money and the waiter liked me. He appreciated my valuable qualities. He would be glad to see me back.\\"In the denoument, after musing repeatedly throughout the book on life as a series of value exchanges, Hemingway presents thirty-four-year-old Brett after her fling with the nineteen-year-old matador, threatening his career. She mentions repeatedly how good or \\"set-up\\" she feels after her conquest, which also destroyed Jake's dearly earned reputation among the afficiones of Pamplona. Her other sexual conquest led to fistfights among the men of her party, destroying their friendships. In this aftermath of destruction, Brett can think only of herself. (Beginning on page 248):\\"\`You know,\\" Brett said, \\"he'd only been with two women before. He never cared about anything but bull-fighting.'\`He's got plenty of time.'\`I don't know. He thinks it was me. Not the show in general.' [meaning the fiesta they attended]\`Well, it was you.'\`Yes. It was me.'\`I thought you weren't going to ever talk about it.'\`How can I help it?'\`You'll lose it if you talk about it.'\`I just talk around it. You know I feel rather damned good, Jake.'\`You should.'\`You know it makes one feel rather good deciding not to be a bitch.'\\" [meaning she's done Romero the young matador a favor by making him leave]Brett has been going on and on to Jake about her affair with Romero and she's just reduced the entire \\"transaction\\" between herself and Romero to a one-sided evaluation of how good it has made her feel. It's been all about her, with no apologies for the damage caused by her narcissistic ego gratification. She then turns her attention to Jake and how good he could have made her feel if things were different: \\"'Oh, Jake,' Brett said, \`we could have had such a damned good time together.'\\"But Jake has wised up: \\"'Yes,' I said. \`Isn't it pretty to think so.'\\"From Brett's angle, life is a string of transactions skewed in her favor. She's drunk. Jake's drunk. What are we supposed to make of the musings of drunkards?The book ends in logical exhaustion. The misbehaving characters will keep misbehaving. Jake may have a clearer view of Brett, but there's no sign he'll not respond to her the same way next time.Brett seems quite pleased with herself, even though she's behaved badly. Is this supposed to prove the converse of the theory that what's immoral is that which makes us feel disgusted?The book presents a segment of society who have lost their moral compass and don't know it, nor do they seem to care. Jake is groping for meaning with his transactional theory, but he's far from reaching any conclusion.Jake, who mirrors young Hemingway, reminds us of Holden Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye and John Galt in Atlas Shrugged, young minds struggling toward an existential paradigm. An identity. Atlas Shrugged gives a simple solution: to hell with Jake's \\"tit for tat,\\" do only what is in your self interest.But self-interest is in direct conflict what we are taught in the Judeo-Christian world: do unto others as you would have done unto you and love thy neighbor as thyself. Holden describes his angst arising from struggling for a value system that gives relief from \\"all the phonies,\\" the rampant hypocrisy of the adult world confronting him.Jake's transactional theory is a modest attempt at a personal philosophy, but he's much more like Holden than Galt, (both of whom were'nt around until the 1950s.)I was a little disappointed in the overall impact of the book, having read that it was Hemingway's greatest novel. I'd read three of his others and his memoir, A Moveable Feast, and over thirty of his short stories. I felt pulled along not so much by the novel's characters or plot as by my expectations, which were perhaps unreasonably high.The plot was circular. Like The Oddsey and The Canterbury Tales, a journey, an adventure. No great obstacle was overcome or goal achieved. The characters were mostly flawed and notably un-heroic. Jake, the narrator, seemed flat. He didn't share many emotions and he reported on the externals of the other characters with detachment.In the end though, by wising up to being used by Brett, he was the only character who changed. The narrative voice was the best part, authoritative, nimble, flowing like music. A pleasure to read.And so my rating:Memorable 4Socially Relevant 5Informative 3Unique 5Thought Provoking 4Well Written/Expressed 4Entertaining 4Inspires Visualization 3Sparks Emotion 4Life Changing 3Total 4 Stars (39/10 = 3.9)"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I liked the book, it definitely isn't a book I would say is my favorite or probably recommend it, but for the purposes of entertainment value I liked it.

The writing is clean and economic and always gets its point across. Lean and sturdy. Something like Kerouac with more clarity and ease. He seems to effortlessly draw up such vivid imagery.

It amazed me that they could get by without working (Jake excepted) and drink to the extent that they did. But they all appear as self-centred and at the end it's difficult to have any sympathy for them, again, Jake excepted-possibly! After all, he was prepared to live the same life."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises is my favorite Hemingway novel. There's something about his succinct style and the details that he chooses to focus on that mesmerizes me. Ashley is an interesting character, and I loved the setting. Paris in the 1920s is fascinating. The bullfighting was kind of hard for me because I love animals. The society around the bullfighting and drinking was interesting for me. I've always been curious how much of this novel was autobiographical and how much was pure fiction. I used to have a Hemingway biography on vhs. I guess it's time to see if it's available on dvd.

Enjoyed this book immensely."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"You'd think that a story centered on a Eunuch who loves a sexually liberal woman would be enjoyable, but it's not. Hemmingway's first novel, The Sun Also Rises, is anticlimactic and uninteresting, however his writing style is a treat, which leads me to the conclusion that although Hemmingway had a talent for writing effective sentences, at this point in his career he hadn't quite become a good storyteller.The story brought the reader along on a ride of people with money, no morality to drive them, too much time on their hands and a bordom of what to do with themselves. So the story is essentially made up of the characters going to clubs, and restaurants, arguing/joking in a drunken stupor and then eventually deciding to go do the same thing during the bullfights in Spain. That may sound interesting but in Spain it's the same story, they do nothing new, and there is no climax. The only thing close to a climax is that Brett cheats on Michael with another man, but the way he describes their interaction is dull and he doesn't present it in a way that hooks you. It was way too obvious and you knew it was coming.As for the writing, there is a lot to learn from. In some ways it shows how impactful terse sentences can be. There were times when I was caught off guard by the imagery that came to mind through his simple statements, but that can only be appreciated for so long. The long descriptions of Spanish countryside for instance made an already slow story come to a complete halt.So to sum it up, the story is slow and nothing that anyone in LA or modern times hasn't seen a million times over. The one thing I find interested is that I didn't realize that society then was so similar to society today: so hopeless, hedonistic and foolish in nature. Let me put it this way, if you aren't looking to be entertained, but would like literary insight on creating terse, yet impactful sentences, then this is the book for you. The book is a piece of history in Hemmingway's career when he hadn't quite found something interesting to say, but it's interesting none-the-less because of the way he says it."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The condition was excellent. Hemingway gave vivid descriptions of the spanish countryside. However, the description of the charcters was somewhat lacking."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises is one of my all time favorite books. I have read it and re-read it many times. It had been a few years since my last reading and when my wife and daughter came home with a 1960's collection of his novels that they bought at a garage sale for me for only a mere three dollars, I decided to give it another go. Conclusion: it is still great.This was Hemingway's first novel. It comes in around 90,000 words, is paced very well, and shows the foundation of Hemingway's ground breaking style of the time. The book is simple, primarily made up dialogue, of which Hemingway is a master, and broken up with stark descriptions of the country. The Sun Also Rises was an instant hit when it was published by Scribners in 1926 and made Hemingway a newly discovered star among critics and readers. It is, in my opinion, his finest work.I have read all of Hemingway's work. He is most certainly the king of the short story, a fine novel writer, and superb letter writer. He holds no punches when it comes to character and allows the reader to form his/her own opinion when it comes to them. Several times while reading The Sun Also Rises, I put the book down and commented on how much I loved the book. What I enjoy most about it is that Hemingway allows the reader to read between the lines, not an easy task and one that I try to do in my own writing. I like that not everything needs to be explained; that assumptions can be made. I enjoy forming my opinion on the matter. As a reader, I should be able to judge and convict at my will.So, for those that love Hemingway and if you have not read The Sun Also Rises in a long while, I recommend picking up this classic and burying yourself in 1920's France and Spain for a while. It will make you laugh and cringe as Jake and the gang tear up the countryside in search of a good time while trying to come to grips with lost love, forbidden love, and new found love. Oh, and the ending is as perfect as one can be. I have not read a more perfect one since."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I remember reading this for the first time, it was better than sex!I have never read a story where the characters were so clear and the writing so concise with absolutely no filler. And that last sentence of the book - I won't give it away, but it's worth the trip to get there. If you haven't read this yet, I envy you! When you start, the narrator, Jake Barnes, tells you about his annoying friend Robert Cohn. He is not likeable, but keep going. When I first attempted to read this I stopped because of Robert Cohn. He annoyed the piss out of me, but he has an important part in this story. So, keep going and enjoy one of the best written novels of all time. And, again, I envy those of you who haven't read this. What I wouldn't do to relive that experience again and again and again."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is my second Hemingway book of the past few months and I am very much a fan. His writing is clear and the story never drags. The book struck me as a \\"Seinfeld novel,\\" that is, an interesting story about nothing. At the novel's beginning, Hemingway offers Gertrude Stein's famous statement about the \\"lost generation\\" of post-World War I Europe. The characters in this story are definitely lost, or at least alcoholics. Nearly every scene involves the consumption of a lot of alcohol; I was surprised any of the characters could stand, let alone relate Hemingway's crisp prose. The Seinfeld comment aside, the novel centers on an American journalist who lives in France and travels to Spain with a group of friends. All of the friends are damaged goods in various ways, but mostly they seem bored and heartbroken (not in the romantic sense of heartbreak, but the spiritual sense). In the aftermath of the Great War they simply do not know how to comprehend life. Careers, religion, and even love seem meaningless. The people just exist -- and go to bullfights. Indeed, the book is famous for Hemingway's vivid description of bullfighting in Spain; while the writing of these scenes is superb, I found myself cringing at the cruelty of the sport, which I suspect was not Hemingway's intention. He would think I am being a weanie. I am not sure I would widely recommend this book because of its somber tone, but if you're feeling a little lost and need something to relate to, give it a try."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"To be as succinct as possible, this is my favorite book of all time.

Could Hemingway write a run-on sentence? Probably not, and he reminds me on every page. While the book often slows and the modern reader used to being shocked and thrilled continually, might be challenged, the exploration of the characters is the strength of this book as well as the powerful use of words. Or lack of. Besides, if you love Paris, The Sun Also Rises is like a travelogue, while the details of bullfighting make it as gorey as is real.

Jake is an American journalist who has been severely wounded in the war, while Brett Ashley is an English aristocrat, flamboyant and so irresistible.It is the year of 1920 and the post World War 1 expatriates cling to each other to find solace, as they alleviate the tragedy and depression of the war with Pernod and Champagne sessions and gourmet meals.The potpourri of characters consist of the Jewish boxer and tennis player Robert Cohn, who has a thirst for travel like all of his cronies; Billy Gorton the novelist; Michael Campbell Brett's fiance; beautiful Brett the brilliant chatterbox who steals the show at every given chance; and of course Jake, so cruelly wounded where no one can see.The book is marvellously entertaining as they leave the cafes of Paris for a sojourn to Spain to take in the famous bullfighting, and to enjoy a change of scenery. They continue their pleasure-seeking but then there is some strain and tension amongst certain parties which will inevitably lead to dissappointments.This is a beautiful story and an ideal read for the beach or to take on a vacation.

What happened? I read The Sun Also Rises and obviously did not get the point, unless the point I did get (life after WWI is pointless) just holds mystical revelations for some people that simply fail with me. The point that life is pointless is pointless for a book of 250+ pages; it could easily have been summed up in 30-40 pages in some short story and we could all go home to get on with our lives (metaphorically speaking, of course). The fact that the characters were more self-absorbed than any you'll meet on Seinfeld or Friends doesn't help (it gets his point of pointlessness across but gets old, oh, around page 15).I asked a friend of mine why he loved the book so much and he couldn't really tell me (not that he didn't try, just nothing useful came out). Most of what he said watered down to the first two things he said \\"There wasn't a single word in there that didn't need to be there\\" and \\"It's about vast disillusionment following WWI\\". Hm, okay, so the guy doesn't elaborate much in detail and the book is pointless (as I've mentioned). Is that any reason to read an entire novel?"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"&quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; is a classic example of watching something bad, and enjoying it. The character's in Ernest Hemingway's novel encompass every emotion from embarrassment, to greed, to downright meanness. Lady Brett Ashley has to be one of the most selfish character's I have read in a long time, and yet you still like her in certain moments, even though you should drop her right there. This group of American expatriates drinking, partying, and carelessly making their way from Paris to Pamplona make you dizzy with their recklessness while at the same time you keep turning the page, waiting for the consequences. The consequences do come, but they tend not to last too long and then they are off again for another drink. The detail written in this book is wonderful.

If you can't identify with the characters, I doubt you can identify with your fellow man. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that commuters, 7-11 clerks, and high school students don't 'get it'. Hemmingway could write about adventure and romance, but this is his best book about people."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" helped to put Pamplona on the map and showcased the sport of bullfighting to the world. Although the sport certainly was thriving in Spain before Hemingway's novel, it was he who helped introduce bullfighting to the world. Yet, his book could not have had such an impact if it was not imbued with a compelling story, vivid descriptions, and powerful imagery.Hemingway explores the aimless lives and sexual exploits of Jake and his fellow compatriots in 1920s Paris. Veterans of World War I, these are members of the \\"Lost Generation\\", who spent their youth in foxholes in abominable conditions and have never fully recovered. Jake, literally, is impotent from a war wound, and the others show scars in their emotions and relationships with each other. Although there are no flashbacks to their horrific experiences, it is evident that the war weighs down on their minds and has had a profound impact on their philosophy of life. Although on the surface their carefree, promiscuous lifestyle may lend a sense of joy and fulfillment, despair and depression lie just beneath their surface, as evidenced by their excessive alcohol abuse. It is rare that either Jake or one of his cohorts are not intoxicated.Although Jake may be literally impotent, the other male characters show a symbolic impotence in their approach toward their lives. The sexpot, Brett, has a tenuous hold on them, as she is the reason of the moment to live. Yet, their affairs with Brett ultimately leaves them cold and distant. Cohn, an ex-boxer and currently a writer of Jewish descent, is a scapegoat for all that goes wrong in their lives. Although he is no choir boy, Cohn becomes a punching bag for the others, both literally and figuratively, as their frustrations mount. The heightened sense of hostilities between Cohn and the others is not because of his Jewish heritage, but because of their own insecurities with their manhood, a direct result of the life-altering war.Hemingway uses a direct, no-nonsense approach in his writing. There is neither flowery prose nor endless paragraphs of illustrative descriptions. Hemingway's words are power-packed and provide the most poignant imagery in the least amount of words. Hemingway does not mince words. It is his direct style that is, perhaps, his greatest asset, and that which has gained him fame.Hemingway is at his best when describing the fiesta and bullfights with all its pomp and splendor. Even without a detailed description of the gore involved in bullfighting, Hemingway delivers to the reader a vivid and imaginative description of the event. A detailed picture is given of how the bulls are driven to their deaths, yet Hemingway maintains a tactful and elegant approach in his prose.Overall, \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" provides great insight into the \\"Lost Generation\\", while providing an entertaining account of the Pamplona \\"Running of the Bulls\\" and the ensuing bullfight. This may be one of Hemingway's earlier works, but it is certainly one of his best. Superb."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This challenging work by Hemmingway is not only his most profound work, but the quintessential piece on \\"The Lost Generation.\\" The main character Jake is scarred not only physically but emotionally, and these barriers prove to be impossible to cross to get to his love, the Femme Fatal Brett. The peice shows the attitude that the age of enlightenment had only produced more efficient means to kill eachother in the trenches of world war two, and that no one could ignore the monstrosity of human nature. Isn't it pretty to think that we as humans could if we worked hard enough achieve our goals?"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest Hemingway wrote in short declarative sentences putting as much stock in what he didn't say as what he did. The Sun Also Rises is the quitessential Imagist novel. Hemingway gives you an image and leaves you to develop it in your mind. Anyone could read and enjoy a Hemingway novel, because on the surface, simplicity reigns. It is an easy read. But beneath the surface is where the depth of character and meaning reside making Hemingway that rarest of breeds, the writer both accessible to the common reader and challenging to the reader looking for something more.All of that said what drives this wonderful novel is great characters. They are not great in the sense that they are outstanding people. They are great in the sense that they are wonderfully developed and wholly believable. Robert Cohn is perhaps the most annoying invention this side of Fran Drescher, but his character rings true, and while we hold contempt for him, we also pity him.The story is about a man, Jake, who lives in paris after the first world war, and works as a journalist for a foreign paper. Jake is in love with Brett, but due to an unspecified war injury, he is unable to consummate the relationship. Robert Cohn is Jakes clingy friend who takes an instant liking to Brett, and has no such shortcomings as Jake. He does however, manage to alienate Brett because she never loved him. He also alienates Jake, because of the love Jake holds for Brett. He alienates Brett's soon to be husband as well, and Jake's true friend Bill Gordon. All of this happens during the vivid description of a fishing trip in which Hemingway equates nature with God, as the stream Jake fishes in is more akin to church than church, to a bullfight festival that is a lively and vibrant as if it were happening right in front of you. To tell too much of the story would be to give away what is one of the five greatest American novels ever written, so I won't. But this a must read for anyone who can read in the English language. This is the masterwork of one of our country's greatest writers."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Sun Also RisesThe sort of book where the characters move from one place to another, in an endless party - which perfectly characterises the left bank of Paris in the 20's, where the novel opens, and the endless party of the Fiesta in Spain, where the characters make their way to.Its undercurrent of lost and unrealised love has immense appeal. The relationship between the inimitable Lady Ashley (a character with as much appeal as Holly Golightly - Hemingway hated Capote, so would turn in his grave at this comparison) and the narrator, Jake Barnes is surely one of the most interesting in all literature.The pure beauty of this novel can be put very simply: instead of almost every other book, where the reader is told what they should feel about every little moment, the reader is how put in the position of a film viewer: they are permitted to look at scenes and think: \\"ooh, what's he thinking now\\" or \\"she won't like that\\" or \\"does he love her?\\"Put simply, The Sun Also Rises is so much fun to read because there is so much more for the reader to do, because Hemingway invented the art of not saying those things - and was good enough that, in this book, they all come across vibrantly."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest Hemingway gave the world a gift in THE SUN ALSO RISES. It is many things that are good in the literary sense and it is a highly readable novel, one of those over far too soon at 250 pages.Narrated by Jake Barnes, an American journalist living in Paris, THE SUN ALSO RISES chronicles his community of fellow ex-patriots in the 1920s. The chief characters, besides Barnes are Bill, Robert Cohn, Mike Campbell, and Lady Brett Ashley. That all the male characters are in love with the promiscuous Brett is just one of the tensions building as they travel to Spain for the fiesta of the running of the bulls in Pamplona. The realistically presented bullfight yields a lesson in bull and steer herd dynamics, which becomes a metaphor for the gang's own conflicts as it steadily becomes apparent that what binds them together is the frustrating attempt to find purpose and reason in the wake of the physical and emotional devastation of wartime experience. Hemingway employs a line spoken by Gertrude Stein in conversation as an epigram: \\"You are all a lost generation.\\" He also quotes from the first chapter of Ecclesiastes: \\"One generation passeth, and another generation commeth: but the earth abideth forever. The sun also riseth . . .\\"In any other hands, Hemingway's story would have been so much melodrama. In his, it is comic and tragic. His story is charged with top of the craft writing. He excels at exposition, voice, character, dialogue, setting, and style. Symbolism sneaks in without the author having to bang the reader over the head. What seems like so many simple declarative sentences--he did this, she said that--creates a fully dimensional literary experience. The characters are fully drawn, representative of their time but also of universal conflicts. That some express antisemitic sentiments that are no longer socially acceptable (though not necessarily extinguished) provides thought-provoking material for comparing generations. There is much to discuss in this book and it is far too good to avoid by capitulating to study guides."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I loved this book, and thought it a little bit strange. The characters are so completely detached from their lives, and the bullfight and fiesta serve as an antithesis to their monotonous fleeting lifestyles. Some of the characters were so downright strange, and almost fake, that it left me with a kind of empty helpless feeling.First of all, the female character, Brett, is one of the most fascinating characters I have ever read about. Her mannerisms, and life choices are so interesting. She seems very beautiful, and I can see why everyone is is love with her. The male characters are also interesting, the main character being almost emotionless and accepting of his life, although he is in love with Brett, he is happy to just be her friend. You get the feeling that being hurt in the war has really changed him, and made him apathetic, and happy to live vicariously through the bullfight. The character of Cohn is also really interesting, and dark, although the descriptions of him seem a little anti-semitic in this day and age.The descriptions of the bullfights, and the fiesta in Spain, are truly magnificent, and make me want to go to Spain and see the bullfights, even though I am a longtime vegetarian and animal lover! The descriptions were just that powerful. The character of the bullfighter is also a classic literary character, strong and attractive.The prose of Hemingway is different than anything I have ever read, and I like it. He doesn't say much, yet he says a lot. By sticking to the simplicity of a situation, he manages to expose the depth that lies beneath. All in all, I loved this book, and I think it is relavent today, and can be related to anyone who lives their life fleetingly from pleasure to pleasure. A lot of drinking in this book!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I'm 16 and my English teacher seemed really suprised that I was reading Hemingway for fun.

But Brett is engaged to Michael, a bankrupt Englishman, and has affairs with Robert Cohn, a Jewish boxer from Princeton, and a young bullfighter. The bullfights seem to serve as sort of a metaphor for Jakes life. He's searching for happiness, for glory, but he's doomed forever to server as a \\"steer,\\" whose only purpose in the bullfights is to keep the bulls (Brett's lovers) from killing one another. This book is really quite tragic, the characters roam around Europe, out drinking every night in an effort to fill a void in their lives.

I, for one, am grateful that he does not think his reader naive - does not spoon feed us. In his description of sense, he is generous. How could we know the taste of a wine or the texture of a bullfighter's cape without being there? On the other hand, given the intentional interactions between his characters and the delicate choosing of their words, how can we not know what isn't being said? It's all there - particularly in this novel - cloaked only in the reservedness of the era. The tensions set just below the surface, as well as the simple joys (and sorrows) of four expats seeking escape at the fiesta in Pamplona are what make the book so satisfying, and what have kept its place in literary history secure. What fiction."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I hope no one finds this offensive but just remember that I really like Hemingway's writing style. That being said, to be as pithy as possible, this book and my modern day translation of the meaning of the story \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is the same as our modern day saying \\"Same old $hit\\". The story at first brought out my empathy for Jake(aka Hemingway)who is essentially writing about his messed up life. Unbelievable! The most beautiful and wealthy people have the most dysfunctional lives. The book left me feeling a little disgusted at the end. Not that is wasn't good or well written but that the moral was that some people never learn how to get their lives in order. Oh Well. I guess for some of us, thats life!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"First read \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" in 1980 and reread it every couple of years. It should be enjoy at least 5 time a decade."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Dave Foster Wallace urged writers to eschew irony. I feel the same way, and the reason is that for irony to have its effects the society at large must have a solid moral center of good permeating though it, like it did even after the first world war, although that center was by then seriously deteriorating. Then, when one reads a book like this, one clearly understands and is not afraid to feel the irony of this book; its amoral characters, and its nihilistic portrait.By 2008, that center is nowhere to be found, and hence readers look for something else in any book; sympathize with the characters, to get something warm and true in the positive sense from the experience, to \\"enjoy\\" books, rather than learning a dry lesson (the spare prose helps) in the negative. These are atrocious characters. All of them, even Cohn to whom the center of good gravitates simply because he is an old world degenerate rather than a new world one. You don't go around beating people up. I don't know how clear I was in expressing my thoughts, but I feel that irony in writing has outlived its usefulness.Also, these characters do not think, or do their best not to. They are bottom feeders on the evolutionary ladder who's only goal is to survive, not improve anyone elses lives including their own. They get drunk and seemingly take in sense perceptions like primative organisms, animals really. But they are people. Bret I can't stand, and Jake, well, what can one say? His lot in life is awful but still look how he copes with it. He gets drunk, loves a trecherous woman, takes exteme pleasure from the barberous Corrida, but I'm not judging, at least I don't want to do that, just to say that the whole senario is rather pathetic and sad.Since this was the situation for some after the First World War, and this book now stands as a symbolic ode to its aftermath, I don't know. Maybe the world did unravel, but, I belive that chronicling the fact the way it's done in this book, cloaked in symbolic characters then, is, in my opinion, two long steps removed from what art is suppose to do.I read this book in college and remember the fresh feeling I got as Hemingway puts you in a spare place and shows you around pretty well; the crisp air, the stark oulines of buildings and people. On this and final reading there was a glimmer of this, but, of course, when I first read it I didn't have the tools to think about it at all. And everything that really matters this time around totally eclipsed those immediate sensual lunges at a clean physical life."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is one of the great books of the Twentieth Century, but the at times disappointing reading by Hurt causes me to deduct one star.Hurt is too intrusive as a reader. He hams up the part of Michael Campbell with a thick and drunken Scottish accent. His reading makes a likeable character like Jake's buddy Bill seem like an oaf. His impression of Lady Ashley leaves one wondering why Jake or anyone else would even bother with her. Actors, of course, are supposed to interpret the work, but a lighter hand is necessary when reading a book as opposed to acting out a play. Moreover, Hurt's interpretation is unjustifiably negative. Yes, Hemingway is writing about the post-World-War-I \\"Lost Generation\\" and, yes, Jake hangs with a bunch of alcoholic wretches, but Hurt's interpretation is a bit too cartoon-like. There is more subtlety to these characters than Hurt is willing to acknowledge.As for Hemingway's book, it's worth reading and re-reading. And this audiobook has allowed me to re-read the book easily at a later stage in life. In some ways the book does not age well. Robert Cohn is a central character, and the rank anti-semitism of the author as well as his characters is inexcusable. Cohn's \\"Jewishness\\" is totally gratuitous. Hemingway could have sketched this character without this cheap and mean-spirited use of the easy prejudices that so pervaded his time. Yes, we have to give Hemingway some slack and not judge him by modern standards; but not everyone was an anti-semite back then and a better man would have overcome this social prejudice.On the other hand, the book is extraordinary for the muscularity of its prose. The story is told largely through dialogue and spare descriptions. It is a riveting style that draws the reader into the book and requires the reader to make many of the essential judgments about the various characters.I can't agree with those reviewers who are left unmoved by the story. The story is quite interesting and fast moving. And it touches on the elemental themes of how to define a moral code in a lost world. Also striking is Hemingway's struggle with how to define masculinity in such a world. Jake seems to strike the best balance between assertiveness and empathy, but lacks the physical abilities. Cohn has the physical gifts but none of the emotional ones. The other characters seem to suffer from various self-destructive impulses, which seems to be a common outlet for the the masculine impulse. Perhaps the best masculine role model is the bullfighter, Romero, but there are hints that even he is prone to corruption and self-destructiveness.I recommend the book, but see if there is an older, better reading somewhere."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is one of the best FIRST novels ever written. And one of the best NOVELS ever written. Papa says (I think it's inA Moveable Feastthat his goal was to write one TRUE sentence every day. There are an awful lot of them in this book.It is also an important book to read because it was written before he became famous...and before he had \\"the Legend\\" to live up to. As such, with the exception of theNick Adams Storiesit's as close to the REAL Hemingway as you're going to get.As you probably know, suicide ran in his family (RAN? Hell it practically GALLOPED!)

There was a movie made from this book (naturally)The Sun Also Risesand rumor hath it that Papa wasn't too impressed by the film. (Having seen the way Hollywood treats classic novels can anyone feel too surprised?)One more thing...The N word is used pretty freely in one chapter of the book and some suggest that this meant Hemingway was a racist (they say the same about his treatment of Robert Cohn). He wasn't, really. But he WAS a product of his generation and so had certain ingrained attitudes and beliefs that were racist in nature though he himself was not so in practice. I know that the logic of that sentence will elude the young and idealistic but later on as you mature and get to know YOURSELVES better you will find that that is true of ALL of us to some degree."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"As Harold Bloom, the critic, notes, Sun Also Rises is maybe the only Hemingway novel that these days doesn't seem like a period piece. Many of his stories are still great of course, especially the short ones like A Clean, Well Lighted Place and Hills Like White Elephants, which focus on a snatched fragment in a bar, or by a railway station to illuminate huge life truths.Over the long haul, Hemingway's style can often suffer. His terse, precise, hard man style often lags in patches over his novel length works, and at his worst he comes across as a dated, third rate social commentator. Not in this book however, Hemingway's first novel. His portrayal of wealthy, feckless expatriates in Europe in the 1920s is magnificent, with beautiful scenes crafted in sparse prose describing wet Paris streets and bars, the dusty heat of Pamplona and the tension inherent when young men travel in the company of a seductive woman.This short novel is a natural pair to Fitzgerald's masterpiece, the Great Gatsby which contains characters who are similar in many ways to the people who populate Sun Also Rises."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemingway's best and most succinctly character driven novel. Profiles the romantic angst of its protoganist all to no avail. Missing his manhood due to war atrocities, Jake Barnes is left helpless as Brett, his ideal woman sashes her way around post-WWI Mediterranean Spain. The quintesential lost generation novel, The Sun Also Rises makes one long not only for wine-spirited Spain sunsets, but for distance-land romantic get-aways. Take the reader back to a unique time-period, mentality, and geographic land - scintillating and succulent to all the senses."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This story is told by Jake Barnes a veteran of World War I. He is in love with Brett Ashley as are most everybody in the story. Jake was wounded during World War I which caused the love problems between brett and him. Pretty much everybody in the novel lives an aimless purposeless life. They are mostly heavy alcoholics and they claim that alcohol is used to ease the pain they suffered caused by the war. Additionally, they all followed almost the same routine every single day: wake up in the morning, work, eat lunch, meet friends, go to cafe bar, or club, get home, get drunk and go to sleep. This is what the sun also rises refers to, everyday the sun rises just as thier lives proceed.This story is about the lost generation, and as the book goes along you can really begin to see how this generation was lost, thier lives lacked meaning which made the book somewhat of a slow read which lacked action. Although the novel lacked action, it contained a lot of meaning and hemingway's style was very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises was my first sampling of Hemingway's novel length works. My verdict? Clearly, this is a first novel, but a very good one. The first half of the book is slow and not exactly compelling, and yet by the second half, it really takes off, and I found myself engrossed.Basically, The Sun Also Rises is a portrait of the &quot;lost generation&quot;, those who were so impacted by the war that their lives have no meaning in the traditional sense. They go about a series of meaningless activities that leave them feeling empty and unfulfilled. This premise is fairly existential and dark, and if that isn't your cup of tea, don't bother with the Sun Also Rises. That said, this novel does a great job of characterizing such members of said generation, and the style of the writing is attractively lucid and crisp, yet rich with symbolism.

Who wouldn't enjoy a European vacation like Jake Barnes'? Especially those sections where he is alone in San Sabastian swimming, eating and drinking or fishing with Bill on the Irati River. Even Jake's life as a newspaperman in Paris, filled with long, lingering lunches, and visits by eccentric characters and hard-noised newspapermen with snappy, peppy comebacks, creates a picture that is far from alienating. This is, in some ways, part of the appeal of The Sun Also Rises. The nostalgia is contagious. Throughout the novel many of the characters have nostalgia for the First World War, a war which damaged them all physically, psychologically, or both. Compared to the muddle of civilian life in the 1920s, the simplicity of war's exigencies created a mix of nostalgia and forgetfulness. The same holds for us, the readers of The Sun Also Rises, the heirs to its vision of disillusionment. Our losses and extractions are so dramatic, our culture so debased, that The Sun's bleak landscape of loss is appealing, poetic, romantic."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"As the previous reviewer indicated, this is an excellent novel. Apparently however, Mr. Biswas is not entirely familiar with Hemingway. In 1926 Charles Scribner's Sons of New York published Hemingway's first novel, \\"The Torrents of Spring.\\" Shortly after, in the same year, they also published his second novel \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\" The following year (1927) the London firm of Jonathan Cape published this second novel in England under Hemingway's original title, \\"Fiesta.\\" This reprint of that English edition is, in fact, subtitled \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\" No matter what you call it, this is some of Hemingway's finest work."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises is one of the very early works of Ernest Hemingway and it reflects Hemingway's passion for bullfighting.The story line seems a little shallow on the surface. Told from the viewpoint of one of the main characters, Jake Barnes a group of writers in Paris decide to go to Madrid for the running of the bulls and to view the bullfights. An English woman by the name of Brett Ashley whom this group all seem to be pining for tags along. Jake is very much in love with her, but has been rendered sexually disfunctional by a war wound. Her presence causes a certain amount of strife and rivalry within the group. This tension erupts into some mild violence when one of the main characters, Robert Cohen becomes consumed with jealousy.The average plot however is overpowered by the powerful prose of Hemingway. Even in this early work (This was his first novel) the lean, raw style of his writing was present. His descriptions of trout fishing, the running of the bulls and of the matadors in the arena were brought to life with the hard gritty prose that would win him a Nobel prize thirty years later.This story is well worth reading if not for the story itself, which is really not bad, but for the enjoyment of the style of Hemingway. One of the twentieth centuries most influential writers."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I just can't believe it. Nobody has reviewed this stupendous piece of work! This book is a CLASSIC. The use of language in this book by Hemingway, I think, remains unparalleled in all his works. Sad, funny and so very homely! I have read this so many years back but it remains firmly etched in my memory. An American reporter who becomes impotent is in love with this woman with loose morals - a sort of unrequited love. The characters seem so real that after so many years it remains my all-time favorites! If Hemingway deserved his Noble prize it must for this beauty!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Not many writers are like Ernest Hemingway. His style is unique and nobody will ever write like him. He is one of my favorite novelists ever and his \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" one of my most beloved books ever. I know there are some problems with the narrative --and there is animal cruelty that bothers me so much, but, still, this is one of the best books I have ever read.The feeling I had when I first read \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is impossible to compare to any other work. The vitality and joy of this story was what I liked most. Despite the fact that it is a sad story, I can feel life coming from every paragraph. The book deals with the Lost Generation, those youngsters who lost their dreams and hope with the First World War. Afterwards they were so displeased with life that their motto was \\"Live fast, die young\\".The pages of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" perfectly translates this momentum: every second counts, do it now, because in the future you may not be able to do again. This is the feeling that all the characters are after. The feeling of being fulfilled. However, it is not easy to find out what fulfill each person --so that is the reason why they make so many mistakes.At some point, Bill, one of the most joyful characters of the book, says, \\"Our stay on earth is not for long. Let us rejoice and believe and give thanks.' This perfectly summarizes the point Hemingway is trying to state. This is what he believed by the time he wrote the novel -- in the mid 20's. \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is one of the books that best show the way the writer believed people should live. All things that Hemingway liked in his life were there, like beautiful women, boxing, fishing, bullfighting and traveling through Europe. This may not be the most appropriated lifestyle for many people, but it sure worked in Europe circa 1925.Not many writers would be able to writer a book like that. If one thinks of the matter of the fact, \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is almost a book about nothing. However it never let the reader feel bored. The characters' lives can be boring --they are bored most of the time. But the reader is fully immersed in that universe that he feels like part of the group. It is not hard to believe that Jake, Lady Brett, Bill, Cohn and the others are not our friends. They are so exposed to us --that in the end we know more about them then themselves. In the end, we know so much about life that we could expect from a book. And Ernest Hemingway is one of the few who can do that."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I read this book for required summer reading, and after a somewhat difficult-to-follow book, this novel was a breath of fresh air. It said this novel was famous because of Hemingway's prose, and I agree. He does not dress up this story with unfathomable metaphors and whatnot. He tells it like it is, which is what I like. This is the &quot;Lost Generation&quot; - the people right after World War I, and everyone's pretty much...lost. Our characters capture that theme very well, with their decadence (heavy drinking) and meandering. The characters Lady Brett Ashley and Jake Barnes are memorable. They both love each other very much, but Jake is impotent due to a war injury, and this prevents Brett from committing to him. This is a poignant novel, and sometimes, I could relate to their issues (minus the heavy drinking!) very well."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I've considered reading this book for years and finally my husband and I listened to the recorded book. The reader, Alexander Adams was absolutely wonderful!Jake Barnes is the narrator of this story of disillusioned American and British expatriates who live in Paris after World War I. Jake was wounded in the war and is in love with the beautiful Lady Brett Ashley. Though never completely explained, the reader is led to believe that because of his war injury their love can never be fulfilled. Brett is reckless and goes from one love affair to another and I found her character very difficult to like. On the other hand, Jake is considerate, good to his friends and tries to help Brett out of the difficulties that are the result of her poor choices. Even when his own actions of helping Brett are somewhat despicable, Jake never explains or tries to condone his conduct.Along with their friends, Robert Cohn, Bill Gorton and Britt's fiance, Mike Campbell, they go from bar to bar and restaurant to restaurant drinking and eating the days away. The group finally ends up going to Spain and attending the bullfights in Pamplona where Brett seduces a handsome young bullfighter.At first, most of the characters seem like people without much depth or purpose, but then you realize that they have all been damaged in one way or another by the past and tragic war. Their carousing and fast living are a means of dealing with their problems. The friendships between the various characters is one of the most endearing parts of the story.Hemingway has given me more of an understanding of that time in our history and of the lost generation. Worth reading!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"No other American has written better about what it is like to be an American in Europe. Hemingway seemed to belong there. The Paris memoir A Moveable Feast is a beautiful account of those early days when Hemingway was writing his early stories. The Sun Also Rises is something quite different. Not a memoir but a novel. And a great one. Great not just because it describes 1920's Paris, which is no doubt part of it's appeal, but because it describes Americans living abroad in the aftermath of WWI. Though it does not specifically address the war, the style of life and attitude that these characters exemplify make them members of what Gertrude Stein called &quot;the lost generation&quot;. That phrase defined a generation and Hemingway's book was the best comment on that phrase and his generation. The American characters of Sun Also Rises all have their reasons for being in Europe. Part of the reason is that WWI disrupted all the old notions and fabric of society and Hemingway underlines this by showing them all in a state of aimless drift. With Jake Barnes Hemingway shows an American who understands Europeans and is at home in their company. He is a new kind of consciousness, not a representative one, but one that seems to have an understanding of life that other Americans do not. Jake's unique understanding has led him to the formulation of a code(expatriots code) which is not altogether explained but one which allows him to be at home in all cultures and deal with trying situations very well(most of the time). But Jake too is wounded. Jakes presence attracts an unusual group of friends and hangers on(some American, some European). Those who understand the code get along well with Jake and those who do not find themselves in conflict with him. Hemingway's A Sun Also Rises stands in interesting contrast to Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby. While Fitzgerald goes for a mythic rendering of American life , Hemingway describes a new kind of ground that only he occupies. Hemingway brings an understanding to things which is not specifically American but his own hard won ground. Fiction writing one imagines was his way of defining that ground. &quot;You must get to know the values,&quot; as the Count says. Each character presents an almost separate plot line. The book begins with Cohn's story but several other stories intertwine along the way as new characters arrive on the scene. Jake is the center around which all the action revolves. Although an awful lot of action revolves around Brett as well. Every one has their turn with Brett. The sad thing is that the two who should be together are Jake and Brett and yet they can't be. And that seems to be the overall feeling and theme of the book and perhaps the deepest interpretation of the oft used phrase &quot;lost generation&quot;. The war seems to have cheated a whole generation out of its innocence, and with that it's ability to love, perhaps. The bullfight segment which is very exciting is a kind of moment when all the characters try to in their own way fill their lives with something. If you want a happier book about Paris read Hemingway's A Moveable Feast instead."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Still, I'll have a go.THE SUN ALSO RISES was Hemingway's breakthrough novel. And what a breakthough it was. Before it, he had modest success with his short stories (a literary form of which he was a master, to be sure). But it was this novel that made his reputation stateside (he was an expatriate in Paris, just like the characters in this novel, at the time he wrote and published it).The book reads like a prolonged short story which is, in fact, its great strength. It is a slice of life, of very particular lives to be sure, painted in that finely crafted impressionist style which Hemingway honed in his days as a literary apprentice in Kansas City, Chicago and on the Left Bank of post World War I Paris. Briefly, the book details the escapades of a group of expatriates living it up in dissolute pleasure in the wake of the recently finished war in a recovering and still giddy Europe. Giddy, at least, within the crowded milieu in which these people mainly move. It has no plot to speak of, except for the movement of its people in and out of bars, parties and bull fights, and their conversations in cafes and taxis and, on occasion,in rural hunting lodges, most of which embody a tight and elaborate dance of almost ritual posturing. The tale follows them as they move cautiously about one another, and through various parts of Europe from their Parisian base, seeking connection and a tenuous spiritual sustenance which may only be had in the hurly-burly of a nightlife world of their own making, a world in which past troubles and insecurities can momentarily be forgotten. At its heart the novel follows, most of all, the growth of one man, its main character, from morose outsider in love with the unattainable to a person who sees his world all too clearly and, recognizing this, severs himself at the end from what he most desires. Nothing happens and yet everything does, precisely reflecting the emotional landscape through which the tale progresses.I will add my voice to some others here, as well, regarding the inimitable Hemingway style, a style he fashioned (not entirely in a vacuum, of course) from the world of experimentalist writers and painters in which he immersed himself in his Paris years. At its best, the sort of writing with which he has crafted this fascinating novel explodes into the reader's consciousness, creating a sense of reality and freshness that previous forms of prose had failed to attain. It is poetry as much as prose for its rhythms and repetitive stress on simple, basic words which combine, at times, to build an image in the mind, a concrete sense of the real world which puts to shame all the abstractions and florid prose of previous literary works.But there's no sense in trying to recapitulate the story here or to describe how it's told. The best thing is for the reader to step into it and experience it. It is still fresh and strong today and worth your time."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest Hemingway is by far one of the greatest authors of all time.

Hemingway writes good stuff. I like this novel more than A Farewell to Arms, and about the same as Garden of Eden (except that Garden of Eden has an unwritten ending)."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"For the first fifty pages or so, my thought about this book was, \\"I think I liked it better when it was set in New York, and it was The Great Gatsby.\\" This novel has a great deal in common with that one, with a cast of relatively bored and wealthy characters slouching from drink to drink as they try to extend their parties into infinity. There is not a sense of right or wrong, except on a party foul level when one character will occasionally feel slighted (rightfully or not) by another. The prose is artistic but direct, with occasional poetic musings about scenery or bullfighting. And when it comes to the similarities, I think Fitzgerald achieved much more than Hemingway.Ultimately, though, I appreciate this book for what it is. No, it's not as good as Gatsby. It doesn't have much of a plot, as the characters just float from party to party in Spain and France, and there is a shocking amount of unapologetic anti-Semitism. Still, there is a lot to like in the book. The dialogue is terrific, the kind of drunken conversations that you wish your drunken friends would have, and Lady Brett Ashley has a tragic and compelling arc. And while I don't share Hemingway's love for bullfighting, his passion itself is endearing, and I underlined a passage about the nature of greatness that has application outside of the bullfighting context. This book is worth reading, even if it isn't quite a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I've read the majority of Hemingway's books and this is the only one I return to. It has a great deal of atmosphere and always gives me a taste of what post-WWI life was like among a certain set of worldly adventurers. I feel like I'm along for the ride when Jake goes fishing or to the bullfights, and Hemingway makes me taste the cold beer Jake drinks in the heat of the day. At the end though, I feel a certain distaste for the maneater Brett and also Jake, because he's so taken with this ultimately shallow woman. Is this a great book: no, but \\"isn't it pretty to think so.\\" It's just very good. I would recommend to anyone who likes Hemingway another American writer named James Salter who is celebrated but not nearly as much as Hemingway. For my money, Salter out-Hemingway's Hemingway."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is an excellent read.

It is also an inside view on the life of young American ex-patriots living abroad during the 1920's.Reviewed by Kardia Williams"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is quintessential Hemingway at his best. It has a \\"je ne said quoi\\" - meaning that it has \\"something\\" you can't quite put your finger on. From the beginning to the great adventure of the Spanish Bullfights, Sun Also Rises can be read over and over and you will find new things every time. Hemingway wrote some bad stuff, but this was one of his best. As a Hemingway aficionado I can't help but love Sun Also Rises. It's his best work by far and he never published anything that was as good as his first novel. Required reading for anyone who loves the written word."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Back-to-School book this year was Hemingway's \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\" Glorious. A totally different book than the one I read almost 45 yrs ago! Have I changed so? Or did Ernest re-edit given my experience? Having visited Pamplona, San Sebastian and Madrid, the Spanish \\"books\\" became more real and thereby more impressive. On first reading as a student, I was struck by the gore of the bullfight, now I see the majesty. There is such a strong parallel in the telling of the grace of the bullfight - the aficion - to \\"The Old Man and the Sea.\\" Before, I was so deflected by what I read as Hemingway's macho bias, that I failed to fully admire his spare but powerful style. I had failed to recognize the poignancy and disillusionment of his flamboyant characters. Reading \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" in the early 70's, perhaps, I was not prepared to accept disillusionment -- or wanted to hold it at bay. Now, I accept the cultural ennui as a reflection and not necessarily as a vortex. My favorite line comes from a supporting character, Michael, the alcoholic, penniless Scotsman. When asked how did he go bankrupt, he answers: \\"Two ways: gradually and then suddenly!\\""},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"the only reason i gave this book 3 stars is because Hemingway is an amazing author. However, I just could not grasp the point of this book. I had a very hard time keeping up with the dialogue as well as trying to figure out what the point of the book was! Although Hemingway's description of the character's personalities was vivid and very distinct, I couldn't understand how they all connected or why they were in Spain in the first place.Throughout the entire time I attempted to figure out this book, I kept thinking how much better I probably would have understood (and therefore, enjoyed) it if I had read this in an english class in either high school or college.after finishing the book, I read reviews on amazon, and although I was able to piece a few things together, I could not undertandd why so many people are giving this book such stellar reviews."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This, friends, was the single book that so fatefully launched Ernest Hemingway's amazing and long-lived literary career. As such it is as close to being a legendary book as they come, yet some seventy five years after its initial publication, it still offers a story that is also surprisingly fresh, personal, and memorable. For all of his obvious excesses, Hemingway was an artist compelled to delve deliberately into painful truths, and he attempted to do so with a style of writing that cut away all of the frills and artifice, so that at it s heart this novel is meant as a exploration into what it means to be adult and alive. Thus we are introduced to Jake Barnes, a veteran of World War One, now forced by his wounds to live as a man without the ability to act like one, forced by impotence to forgo all of life's usual intimacies, and all of its associated life connections for which he so yearns. At the same time, Jake attempts to live a life of meaning and purpose, one crammed full with activity, work, and friendships. Yet it is within this network of friendships and connections that he must confront his painful circumstances.Enter his true love, the feckless Lady Ashley, and indeed the plot thickens, for we soon see how Jake's physical affliction has painfully affected several others. Ashley loves him, but needs a virile man who can give her the physical love she needs. While Ashley is a woman of uncommon beauty, she is also virtuous enough in her won way to want the one man she truly loves to be her lover. Like all of us, she wants most that which she can never have, and so she returns to the source of her own dilemma time after time to Jake, her emotional match, the one man who cannot give her the mature emotional love she craves. So they are condemned to circle around each other, even while some of their friends and other members of the in-crowd interfere, compete, and seek Ashley's affections around the edges of the continuing affair. What we are left with is a modern tragedy, one in which the characters must somehow resolve the irresolvable.Yet for all this emotional turmoil and existential \`sturm-und-drang' of the so-called \\"lost generation\\", people drowning in the moral anomie and circumstantial wasteland created in the gutters of their own endless wants and needs, it is most often Hemingway's imaginative and spare use of the language itself that wins the reader over. Unlike his predecessors, he sought a lean narrative style that cut away at all the flowery description and endless adjectives. In the process of parsing away the excesses, Hemingway created a clear, simple and quite declarative prose style that was truly both modern and revolutionary. What one encounters as a result is a story seemingly stripped to its barest essentials, superficially more like the newspaper man's pantheon of who, what, where, when, and why, and yet somehow transformed into a much more accurate and imaginative effort, one leaving the reader with a much more artful account of what is going on. One reads Hemingway quickly, at least at first, when one learns to slow down and drink in every word and every detail as it is related. For me and for millions of others, the true genius of Hemingway is to be found in his artful use of language. This book was Hemingway's first truly successful foray into the world of letters, and the result changed the face of modern fiction. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises is one of the few works of literature that shook me to the core, along with Remarque's Three Comrades, Gorky's autobiography, and Chekhov's The Lady With The Dog. I read a page and I was hooked. Bam, just like that. I read the thing in a day. In several hours, actually. And then I went and devoured the rest of the man's literary oeuvre. It's just that great. All the greater because when you really look at it, there's no dramatic action going on here - just some people talking, then going to Spain to see the bullfights. But don't let that fool you - boring this book ain't.Jake Barnes, like most of the characters, is a veteran of World War I. A very unfortunate wound left physical love a complete impossibility for him, and thus he is left gnashing his teeth watching the woman he loves run around with all sorts of men. The Jewish Robert Cohn, who learned boxing in college in order to conquer his feelings of inferiority, happens to become smitten with her as well. Somehow, they and some of their friends and acquaintances end up going to Spain to experience the Fiesta, and while their experience starts the same giddy, frenzied, hedonistic way as for most people, it ends quite differently, when the book's darker undercurrents come to light. Insert scenes of cafe life, fishing, reminiscences, conversations with friends, watching the bullfights, some absolutely brutal humor, and lots and lots of liquor, and you've got yourself Hemingway's first masterpiece. Every element of every great Hemingway book can be seen here - plenty of vivid descriptions; moments of strange, elegiac melancholy; the human spirit fighting against the world; loneliness, isolation, and endurance. They're all here.For some reason, this book seems to draw accusations of anti-Semitism. And all I've to say on that topic is: What? Anti-Semitism? Here? Please, what is this you speak of? Sure, Cohn's a Jew. And sure, the characters aren't too fond of him. And yet, Hemingway presents him in a very, very sympathetic light. Sure, we're rooting for Jake Barnes because he's smarmy and witty and cool, but when we see Cohn break down in tears in his hotel room because ..., he was naive enough to _believe_ Brett loved him, how can you possibly say Hemingway had any anti-Semitic sentiments on his mind? No, no, no, and a thousand times no. This is not a book about Jews, or Americans, or Britishers. This is a book about _people_, about young people searching for substance in a world that has none, trying to build up some sort of semblance of a normal life after having been through war. This is a book about people who feel life has passed them all by, and who have nothing to really look forward to. This book is filled with the genuine bitter loneliness of people who see nothing ahead of them. The sense of hopeless longing for something better permeates every page.The Sun Also Rises is the sound of people trying to find a purpose for themselves in an increasingly shallow world. And lest that not convince you to read it, it happens to rock .... Rarely have I read more bitingly acerbic insults and comebacks, wry and cynical remarks, and deadly accurate observations. Actually, rarely have I ever felt so drawn in to the world of a book as much as here. I identified with Jake Barnes and Bill Gorton and that Englishman they met while fishing and with the boozing Mike and with Cohn. I understood their copious drinking and verbal barb-flinging because I was struck by the moments of absolutely believable fragile vulnerability that lay underneath the surface. The subtle gestures, the shifts in tone, the tough, terse prose all added to the various effects when necessary. When I was done, the book left an indelible stamp on my mind. And what higher recommendation could anyone possibly give a book than that?"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I have mixed feelings about this novel. On one level I appreciate it for the fine literary work that it is. In particular, I admire Hemmingway's use of symbolism throughout the novel. But at the same time, this isn't a novel I enjoyed reading. The novel features a cast of characters that are not especially likable and the first third of the novel moves a little too slowly (Jake and his friends lead aimless lives -and the first part of the novel is pretty aimless).Jake and his fellow expatriates spend the entire novel getting drunk, being drunk, or recovering from having been drunk (or \`tight' as they like to say). They pass their days eating, drinking and being as insensitive as possible to one another. It would be easy to dismiss these characters as unpleasant, and therefore uninteresting, but in the context of the years following WWI, I found myself feeling some sympathy for them.Simply put, they're damaged goods. Jake, Mike, and Bill all fought in WWI(Jake becoming less of a man as a result) and were forever affected by it. They are now lost, drowning their empty aimless lives in alcohol.Arguably, the most interesting character in the novel is Lady Ashley (Brett) who is a toxic influence on nearly every man she encounters. Jake, Mike, and Cohn are all in love with her to varying degrees and pay an emotional price as a result. Brett's self centered behaviour complicates the lives of the men who are enamored by her. Jake, who is impotent because of the war, demonstrates his love for Brett by helping her pursue men and then picking up the pieces when the affair ends badly.There is no happiness for the lost generation in The Sun Also Rises and considerable irony in the novel's final sentence. I found this to be an interesting and insightful novel but I can't say I really \`enjoyed' reading it. As a literary work this novel warrants 4 stars. As entertainment: 2 stars. Overall: 3 stars."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Why would anyone want to read a novel about unending drunken revels by emotional cripples who treat each other badly, never-ending love conflicts, getting excited by mayhem at the running of the bulls and during bull fights in Pamplona, and wasted lives? That's the question posed by this book.The book will not draw too many readers for the subject matter. Why then does the book attract? Part of the appeal has to be the same reason that many people like horror films -- the relief you feel when you realize that your own life does not encounter such dangers can be profound.Another reason to read this book is to understand the disillusionment of the American expatriates in Europe after World War I. The book is a period piece in this sense. Clearly, Hemingway is Jake and the book is undoubtedly very autobiographical. All first novels have that quality to some degree. Imagining how the author of The Old Man and the Sea started out as Jake was very interesting to me.To me, however, the primary reason for reading this book is to encounter the remarkable structure that Hemingway built in his plot. He has created several different lenses through which we can explore the role of conflict and separation in our lives. Each lens turns out to be looking at the same object, and it is only by slowly focusing each of the lenses that we are able to see that object more clearly.The central figure in the book is Brett, Lady Ashley, who enchants almost every man she meets, and who disengages from intimate relations with each one after permanently entangling him emotionally. That leaves a string of wounded suitors in her wake, including Jake. Things get tough when several of them join her and her fiance in Pamplona for the running of the bulls. The symmetry in the book becomes more obvious during a fishing trip that Jake takes without Brett. The fish are lured by artificial flies more successfully than with real worms. Brett's exotic appeal draws men in like flies, much more than the attractions of women who want to make an emotional commitment.The symmetry becomes masterful when we reach the bull fights. Brett and the matador are inevitably attracted, for they are the same. They both play with their opponents (men and bulls) by flirting and using their capes, weaken the opponents in the engagement, and bring the opponents down (through sexual entrancement and slaughter). Hemingway makes this abundantly clear by repeatedly describing the bull's death as when the matador and the bull become one. One pet name for Brett is Circe, to help complete the picture.The closer the matador comes to the bull's horns (or Brett to making a commitment), the better the sport for the spectators and the greater the self-esteem for the matador (and Brett).I do not recall a novel that does such an excellent job of using multiple story lines to reinforce the book's main point, in this case that alienation transcends even closeness. Much as you will dislike some of the characters, the unnecessary racial and ethnic slurs, the savageness, and the emotional scenes, you will probably find the characters to ring true. You will also admire the misguided optimism and honest commitment of Jake as he fulfills his love for Brett by procuring men for her and then rescuing her when the next engagement is all over. Jake's love is that noble sacrifice that we all admire in lovers.And that's the beautiful part of the book -- you will find nobility amid the ugliness. The contrast makes the nobility more beautiful.When you are done reading the book, examine your own life and see where you draw back from closeness. Then, ask yourself why you do, and what it costs you and others. Next, consider what closeness can bring from continuing relationships.Find beauty wherever you look!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I've a broad background when it comes to books, as a youth I mostly read Tolkien, Anne McCaffrey and other fantasy. Later I started reading science fiction, William Gibson, David Wingrove, Neal Stephenson. I also read physics books, philosophy, sports.However, I have read very few \\"classics\\" in my lifetime. It's high time to rectify that, so I'm going to read all of Hemingway and many other classics over the next few years... wherever my path leads me.This is the first Hemingway novel that I have read - or at least remember reading. I'm sure I read Old Man at some point during high school, but I have no recollection of it. I also wrote a biography report on Hemingway at some point during my high school years, but admit I don't remember anything much about that either. I have been to Key West, visited his home and pub.. so I feel that despite not being familiar with his work that I have some connection to the man.When I first started the book - I was shocked by the writing style. I remember thinking - \\"wow, I could write this\\". It really sounded like it was written by an amateur. How could this man be considered one of the greats of writing? I never had to look anything up in the dictionary, most sentences were incredibly short, and everything seemed .. well... simple.After my first reading, I thought the book was good, but not surprisingly so. The characters were interesting, but not particularly deep. I must be missing something. I must be out of my league here, even though the book didn't seem all that hard.I also felt like it wasn't \\"right\\" for me to be reading Hemingway. I have no education or background in literature... I haven't studied the history of that time period. I have no great desire to become a Hemingway expert... some feelings of, \\"Well, I'd feel really strange discussing Hemingway with 'normal' people in American society.\\" This was somewhat confirmed by my Mother who said.. \\"Wow.. Hemingway... DEEP! I could never read that.\\"So, I read it again about a year later. Then again about six months after that. After the third reading, the writing style seemed to disappear into the background, and it became almost soothing. I began to see more of the characters through the clarity of the writing, and they became much more real to me. The depth of the plot and symbolism started to come through, even though I'm not particularly searching for such things.As I write this, I almost feel like I'm at the very beginning of understanding him. Almost like if you program in Lisp for awhile, you stop seeing the parentheses.I think this book is now one that I'm going to pick up many more times in my lifetime because of the familiarity of it, and the feelings of \\"home\\" it brings to me. I don't know if that's what Hemingway intended, but I feel pretty close to Jake and the rest of the characters.I suppose what I want others to get out of this review, is that if you're afraid to read Hemingway because it's going to be too hard, you're way off. There is something for everyone here. You might even find it *too* easy at the first reading and go back for more.. just like I did. I think as I go through Hemingway, it'll be like peeling away layers of an onion. Even if I never peel away more than one or two layers, it's still worth it.I'd recommend this book to anyone... really, it's readable by anyone. You don't need an education in literature or to be particularly \\"sophisticated\\". It's an easy read, so if you don't like it.. not much wasted, but I really think you won't regret it, especially if you go back for a second or third helping."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"One of Hemingway's earlier works, THE SUN ALSO RISES remains one of his best. This roman &agrave; clef has it all -- drinking, misbehaving expats, more drinking, humor, sarcasm, irony, unrequited love, beautiful descriptions of Spain, did I mention drinking?, femme fatales, handsome bullfighters, fishing trips, a tad more drinking, manly-man themes, and outstanding dialogue.About halfway through the book, a character named Bill Gorton about nails it when he tells the protagonist narrator, Jake Barnes, exactly what an expat is. It's meant to be funny, but in many ways it defines the book's sense of itself: \\"You're an expatriate. You've lost touch with the soil. You get precious. Fake European standards have ruined you. You drink yourself to death. You become obsessed by sex. You spend all your time talking, not working. You are an expatriate, see? You hang around caf&eacute;s.\\"Luckily for us, Hemingway wrote and didn't just talk, but his novel is delightfully \\"talky\\" and the reader can't resist but listen in as a beautiful Brit named Brett makes verbal love with our protagonist Jake; or as Jake mercilessly excoriates the \\"phony\\" writer Robert Cohn (yes, Virginia, there IS a whiff of anti-Semitism in play here); or as Jake and Bill engage in witty and sometimes drunken badinage as they go on their memorable fishing trip in the Spanish hills. From the caf&eacute;s of Paris to the running of the bulls in Pamplona, this book is a roaming holiday. And just when things get ugly and everyone is sick to death of each other, there's the memorable scene where Jake swims into the sea as if to cleanse himself of everything -- the drinking, the fighting, the frustrating impotence. The chapter is vintage Hemingway.While I admire some of Hemingway's later work, I still feel THE SUN ALSO RISES, along with his early short stories (IN OUR TIME, THE NICK ADAMS STORIES), remains one of his strongest works. It is forever youthful both in its excesses and its beauties, yet it ages quite nicely, too. I heartily recommend it either as an introduction to Hemingway or as a reread. It will bear up in either case."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemingway was a proponent of the &quot;Iceberg&quot; theory of writing: 90% of his themes are hidden beneath the surface of his books. He won't lay anything out for you in black and white -- you've got to be an active participant in the book. If that's not what you want from a book, stay away.The Sun Also Rises is fantastic. It has Hemingway's trademark prose, a portrait of the lost generation, and most of all the saddest love story ever written. &quot;There's no plot!&quot; the detractors scream, but they're wrong. The plot isn't spelled out the way it is in a John Grisham novel, but it's definitely there if you pay attention.Here's a hint for those who weren't trying very hard: this book is all about Brett Ashley and Jake. Throughout the book Hemingway shows Lady Brett following a very definite pattern. She meets a man, &quot;falls in love&quot; with him, sleeps with him, and dumps him. She isn't some cynical player when she does this -- she truly believes that she loves these men during her infatuations. But she requires physical proof of their love, i.e. sex, and once she has it, the infatuation dies. When the book starts we meet her latest victim, Cohn. As the book continues we see a similar relationship unfold with Romero.But then there's Jake! She met Jake and fell in love with him, but a war injury makes him incapable of giving her the physical love she requires. As a result, poor pathetic Brett never fell out of love with Jake, and imagines him as the one man who could be the great love of her life. For the longest time Jake believes this as well.&lt; He's seen what she did to Cohn, and he's had a ringside seat for her affair with Romero, and now he's finally realized the truth about her. When she fantasizes about the great life they could have had together, he knows it's just wishful thinking. If they could have made love, she would have dumped him just like all the others.At it's heart, The Sun Also Rises is a book about a man falling out of love.Hemingway's prose is a matter of opinion. Some people love his sparse verbage, others don't. If you don't care for it, try Fitzgerald, an excellent writer with a much fuller style.One reviewer mentioned that this was one of Hemingway's earliest works, and for that reason suggested it wasn't worthy of five stars (he only gave it two). I think he said Hemingway wasn't yet a mature writer and was still trying to develop his style. What a crock -- Hemingway, like many authors, did his best work early in his career. Heck, the guy eventually committed suicide because he couldn't write anything good anymore. His more &quot;mature&quot; works are only passable and can't hold a candle to the earlier stuff. His prize for &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; was more of a lifetime achievement award than anything else. So save all that &quot;maturity and development&quot; folderol for the black turtleneck gang at the coffee shop.It's a great book, but it will make you work. If you want an obvious plot and themes that you don't have to think about, maybe you'd be happier with Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"&quot;The Sun also Rises&quot; made a huge impression on me when I read it as a college student a number of years ago. It is true that one must look beyond the surface to get a clear understanding of any book by Hemingway. It is also true that the language that he used was not flowery, nor overly eloquent but the meaning revealed within the lines. It is also true that the characters are often expatriates; living on the fringe of society and hedonistic to the max. All of those elements are visible here, yet sometimes it might require a magnifying glass to see it. However, these are the qualities which make Ernest Hemingway, the seminal writer for a generation and certainly one of the best.I propose one hint when reading &quot;the Sun also Rises.&quot; Pay close attention to the relationship between Barnes and Robert Cohn. Barnes laothes Cohn for being everything that he is not. What drives him over the edge (in the inner sanctum of his own mind and demons) is the success Cohn has insofar as his relationship with Lady Brett. Barnes is impotent and this is a crushing blow to his manhood. The tragedy here is his inability to consummate a sexual relationship with her. It destroys him--yet he is still accepting of his predicament. This is what allows this character to maintain &quot;grace under pressure&quot;-- as Hemingway once coined the term or the ability to stand or hold ones ground when all odds are against you. Certainly this can be a tragic flaw for any of Hemingway's male characters--the total loss of his virility. Yet he stands his ground and never loses it. He just hates Cohn from a distance and rationalizes that he (Cohn) is one who cannot do anything just for the sake of doing it---whether it be drinking, winning the Princeton boxing title, or being in love with Brett. It is complicated but one can come away with these qualities after finishing the novel rather than while reading it.I think his friend and sometimes rival, F. Scott Fitzgerald, summed him up best when he said of Hemingway: &quot;He's the real thing.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Let me be clear: \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is a wonderful book.

And the ridiculousness about Jake's war injury making him incapable of making love...puh-lease! Did he lose his fingers and tongue along with his nether parts? I didn't get that impression. I thought the very crux of the book was his relationship w/the proprietor of the hotel where Jake, his pals and the bullfighters stayed. Jake first of all concurs w/Montoya that the pure young bullfighter, Romero, shouldn't be exposed to the decadence of the British officials who invited him to a soiree...Jake and Montoya agreed that the invitation should simply not be communicated to the bullfighter. Shortly thereafter, Jake colludes in Brett's seduction/corruption of that same 19 year old local hero. After the bullfighter ends up beaten to a bloody faced pulp, Montoya shuns Jake, obviously blaming him for his part in the whole fiasco. Jake, retreats to France where he waxes on about how good it is to be in a place where people are your friends if you over-tip them; so much simpler and easier to deal with than being in a place (Spain) where the friendships are more mysterious-- alluding, though in not so many words, to his previously valued relationship with Montoya who shared his love and understanding of all the nuances of bulls and bull fighting. I take it as an indication of Jake's cynicism that he doesn't even apologize to Montoya for \\"spoiling\\" the bullfighter...just blows off what had been a special camaraderie."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"well, I just finished speedreading this book. apparently Ernie liked to drink and drink and drink.

I read it thinking that I would be able to read a great book that launched Hemingway's career. How disappointed I was with the whole experience. From what I remember, all the characters were drunk, they spend all their time drinking and doing absolutly nothing productive with their lives. The language that Hemingway uses in the book was crude and \\"swear-like\\". Young kids (and even adults) do not need to read such language. There's no point for such language. No role models at all in the book. I see no point in a 14 year old needing to read such garbage. I think people like this book because it is written by the famous, Ernest Hemingway and they feel that they NEED to say it's good because they want to fit in. It's either that or they have no morals and don't care what comes out of people mouths. These are the people that probably like to watch \\"Jerry Spinger\\". Anyway, the book had no point and no plot. This was a very hard book to do a book report on and I ended up with a \\"C\\" on my book report because of my options did not map to the teachers. I later found out that my teacher didn't even read my book report and outsourced it to her teacher's aid. This made me mad. Teachers should grade their own students book reports, not give the job to someone I don't know. I could understand having a teacher outsourcing the grading of multiple choice/ true false tests.

Anyway, if you like garbage and wasting your time this book is for you."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I was disappointed in \\"The Sun Also Rises\\". Perhaps my expectations were too high or, perhaps, this is simply not one of Hemingway's greatest works. Methinks the latter.The essence of the novel is the meanderings of a group of American expats living in France and travelling through there and Spain during the 1920s. They seem to spend a lot of time eating and drinking but not much else. They have been described as the lost generation. I would rather describe them as lost. Their eating and drinking seems interminable and the reader is left waiting for something to happen. And it doesn't.It pains me to write this review as there is so much to love about Hemingway. His Nobel Prize was warranted and his later works such as \\"The Old Man and the Sea'', \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" and \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" are masterpieces. Unfortunately, \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" does not compare well to these other works. It's a shame, but avoid this work and your opinion of Hemingway will not be damaged."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises is a book set about 10 years after World War I that is told through Jake, a veteran of the war. He and his rather dysfunctional group of friends live in Paris and decide to take a group trip to Spain. Hemingway's purpose in writing this story was to critique the people of post war society, a.k.a. the Lost Generation.Hemingway creates a story that seems stripped to the bare essentials by using a very straightforward writing style. He omits much of the detail that would become monotonous within the plot and provides the reader with characters that are seemingly incapable of receiving sympathy. As for myself, I thought the characters were pathetic because they wasted much of their time drinking, having sex, or longing to have sex. The sexual themes within the novel are very prevalent, because Brett, the main woman present, is indeed very sexually active. The novel lacks having an engaging plot even though it is written very well.Hemingway's main characters, Jake and Brett lack in depth. Jake is almost always found drinking, alone, or pursuing the love of his life, Brett. His pursuance of Brett ,however, is pointless because the war rendered him impotent and thus lacks in Brett's favorite past time. He becomes the most sympathized for, because he nobly sacrifices his own feelings for the betterment of Brett. Brett, on the other hand, is the object of all men's desires. Being beautiful, she gets what she wants and without a bit of emotion, kicks the old to the curb and says hello to the new. Her lack of emotion and inconsiderate nature tend to pull any sense of liking Brett as a character.Overall, Hemingway creates a group of friends, and main characters that make you thankful for what you have. You walk away from the novel thinking, \\"I'm so glad that's not me!\\" As a whole, it showcases Hemingway's incredible writing style, but lacks in what makes for a most memorable experience... interesting plot."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This book is a classic..... by what criteria, however, is beyond me. The foremost impression it gives is that of an oppressive tedium. Read fifty pages, you'll be bored. Read fifty more, you will surely feel your brain turning to lead. If there are any real characters under the absolutely arbitrary routines of the wretchedly two dimensional people who populate this book, well then they are buried under the crushing weight of circularly formatted lists chronicling the daily activities of these fickle, unmotivated drunks with no imaginations. Who happen to be getting bored and drunk in pretty places. Trust me, absolutely nothing happens, WHATSOEVER.The lost generation this may have been. Judging by this book, what they really were missing was personality, a sense of purpose, and the ability to conceive of even a single shred of worthwhile, memorable drama. Lost all right. I dare you to try and read this and not lose your mind."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Believe it or not, this is the first book in my 48 years I've ever read by this lionized author. And while it probably won't be my last Hemingway book, I hope his other works are more fulfilling than this. There are really no characters I cared about in this novel. It's just a bunch of drunken expatriates hanging out in Europe. I sure wish I could afford to do that. Nevertheless, it's sort of a time capsule of this period of time with this particular group of people. There is some heartbreak involved, but nothing much really seems to happen. For a 1920's period piece with much more depth and a much more compelling story, I would recommend \\"The Great Gatsby\\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald. \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is not a total waste, so I'll give it a half-hearted recommendation just because it's Hemingway and does have a unique, lean style. I just don't think it's great. Chalk it up as a decent first effort."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This book is an account of several characters that are complete losers. The story never picks up, and the account of people getting drunk continually is uninteresting. Hemmingway makes use of a lot of dialogue that is sometimes hard to follow.

Serving Espresso maybe."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"In &quot;The Sun Also Rises,&quot; Hemingway, through his alter-ego, Jake Barnes, tells us that the true meaning of &quot;aficionad' is passion. In Spain, there is a more restrictive meaning. 'Aficianado' only means one who is passionate about the bulls. In fact, the concept is so restrictive that some bull fighters are considered to be just 'commercial' bull fighters and are not passionate enough about their chosen profession to be considered 'aficionados.' This is so according to Hemingway.In the broader sense of the word, Hemingway, in this book, reveals himself (as Jake Barnes) to be an aficionado when it comes to boxing, drinking, fishing, and bull-fighting.I had a problem with one aspect of &quot;The Sun Also Rises.&quot; I found Hemingway's excessive use of negative ethnic stereotyping to be troublesome. For starters, he has created in Robert Cohn, a character who is emotionally unstable and thoroughly unlikeable because of his 'Jewishness.' Following are a few examples of this portrayal:In reference to Cohn (observations of Barnes and his friends):&quot;He had a hard, Jewish streak.&quot;Brett's gone off with (other) men, but they weren't ever Jews.&quot;&quot;That Cohn gets to me. He's got that Jewish superiority.&quot;&quot;That kike.&quot;In reference to Jews in general: &quot;She gets five hundred quid a year and pays three hundred and fifty of it in interest to the Jews. They're not really Jews. We just call them Jews. They're Scotsmen, I believe.&quot;There are numerous other instances, but these already cited should suffice as examples of Hemingway's Jewish stereotyping.He went after other groups too. To wit:On Blacks: &quot;The n , , , , drummer waved at Brett. He was all lips and teeth.&quot;On gays: &quot;I wanted to swing on one . . . . to shatter that superior, simpering composure.&quot;He didn't quit there either. He went after the French and, on numerous occasions, showed his disdain for all casual tourists.There is so much of this sort of prejudicial stereotyping throughout the book that it was ruined for me. It's too bad, because his bull-fight descriptions obviously came from an aficionado but were, for me, tainted by his attitudes."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I wish I understood what all the fuss about Hemingway was, I have read the short stories, the old man in the sea and the sun also rises.

Hemingway is a classic writer and revered by many and has earned his place in the literary world. For me, this book is very dry and drawn out. It is slow moving and the point of the story is hard to decipher.Jake Barnes is a writer and Lady Brett Ashley is wealthy and goes through her life drinking and with no purpose. The story describes their relationship and lives. The story did not hold my attention and was not one that caused me to stay up all night to finish reading.William Hurt is a good actor but as a reader his inflection did not work for me. I had a difficult time telling which character was which by voice alone.All in all, I am more interested in writers of mystery, crime and science fiction than I am in a classic author."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I had high hopes for this book being that it was from Hemingway and regarded so highly by so many people. But I just dont get it. The metaphors and whatnot are not lost on me. But they arent that profound. Not only does this book not really say anything as you're reading it, I mean nothing happens in this book, but the message that it is trying to deliver is not so hot either. I like to read books that say something profound about humanity. When I read a book I like for my thoughts to run wild with new ideas and understanding about mankind. This book was a chore and delivered none of this. I've read the positive reviews here, but this stuff that people point out just isnt that fun or interesting to read. The point that the book makes could be made in one chapter, or could be a side point to a more interesting tale. I give it two stars instead of one because I was able to finish it (although perhaps that was because I expected to eventually be rewarded and it wasnt that long)."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemingway's fame seems to rest largely on being the anti-Joyce &amp; on his boisterous lifestyle. At a time when authors like James Joyce were using denser &amp; denser thickets of language &amp; increasingly nonlinear plots to obfuscate the novel, Hemingway brought a direct reportorial style to his writing. But, to what end?This is the story of a loose group of American &amp; British expatriates in Paris &amp; Spain in the 1920's. They lounge about cafes, drinking wine, bickering, brawling &amp; lusting after Lady Bret Ashley. None of the characters are at all likable and nothing really happens.Without delving too deeply into psychobabble, the most interesting facet of the book is that the first person narrator, Jake Barnes, was emasculated during WWI. Considering the absurdly self-destructive ends to which Hemingway went to prove that he was macho &amp; the widespread perception that his suicide was fueled by self-loathing over his repressed homosexuality, the book is perhaps most interesting as an artifact of his tortured psyche.GRADE: C-"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I'm sorry. I love to read. I love classics. But I would have to be able to discuss this in class or a book club to enjoy it. Hemingway's style is absolutely aggravating unless you read it with an eye of appreciation for what it did to American literature. This is probably a great read within a group, but I hated it as I trudged through it on my own."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"One of my most recent reads has been Ernest Hemingway's [1926] novel, The Sun Also Rises.Hemingway is one of those authors I have wanted to explore for a long time [along with James Joyce, Saul Bellow or John Updike] but I have inexplicably never really gotten around to it. Actually, this is not entirely true... I did read Hemingway's memoir-ish A Moveable Feast, and loved it.But The Sun Also Rises was my second look at Papa, and I do want to read more.It was entirely coincidental that I was reading it during the same days [seasonally speaking] in which the novel itself takes place.The bullfights of Pamplona, along with the daily early-morning three-minute suspension of sanity known as the \\"Running With The Bulls\\" takes place from early to mid-July.And that is where we find ourselves in this book.Jake Barnes, [whom I could not help but identify with what I know of the persona of the author], is an American journalist stationed in Paris. He likes bullfights, drinking, fishing, and..... not working.This book is like one long, extended party, where people venture from caf&eacute; to bar, and stay in either place only long enough to suggest the next rendezvous, the next caf&eacute; or bar where they will consume as much alcohol as is humanly possible!I've never read of such wanton dissipation since, well..... A Moveable Feast!So, in the first portion of the book we meet all of Jake's friends, beginning with Robert Cohn, the Jewish writer, ex-boxer. Cohn is the only person in this book that is not a severe alcoholic.Then there's Lady Brett Ashley, the sort of English dame hottie that everyone not only wants, but also... has! Jake and Brett maintain a close, although platonic [for reasons I will not get into] relationship throughout the course of the book, and they are paranthetical characters, in my opinion.The ever-insouciant [and ever-soused] Mike Campbell is Brett's boyfriend [well, she has others, too] and he hates Robert Cohn, not only because of Cohn's Jewishness, [racism abounds in this book] but because of the fact that Robert loves Brett.Then there is Bill Gorton, sort of a happy-go-lucky guy who rounds out this fivesome of ne'er do wells. A spicy amount of secondary characters are peppered throughout, but suffice it to say, these principal five all end up in Pamplona for fiesta week, where they trample and gore their way through all of the hotels and bars like a wild herd of multi-horned rhinos!At one point, a brief fight breaks out between Jake and Robert Cohn, and the following few lines illustrate the near skeletal way that Hemingway writes.Jake narrates:I swung at him and he ducked. I saw his face duck sideways in the light. He hit me and I sat down on the pavement. As I started to get on my feet he hit me twice. I went down backward under a table. [from ch.XVII].I went down backward under a table?Anyone writing this sparsely [not to mention disjointedly] nowadays would not be published.And yet. And yet... there is something about this book that is good.Something that makes it well worth reading. Hemingway [successfully] gets away with this sort of austere, clip-clop style... utterly devoid of pretense. Leaving you with the feeling that you have a brother, or maybe an uncle, that would have related these events to you in much the same way.Or maybe even a Papa.I enjoyed The Sun Also Rises, in a non life-altering way!So what am I saying about this, my second foray into Hemingway?Am I \`fer it, or \`agin it?I say overall, it is a thumbs up!

At the end of the day, when your larder is full, if you've some extra funds, you may spend more time in Europe than the efficient and so American Contiki tours but you kind of know, as an American whose ancestors usually came from somewhere else that it's not that important. The people in this book don't spend their time trying to out-Shakespeare the English or otherwise go native. They drink and lust after one another. And although this book is supposed to be wrecked psyches trying to get some sun therapy after the First World War, it's still going on today. Movies like the Tyrone Power and Hart Bochner adaptations and The Talented Mr. Ripley distract with their glossy visuals but really American expats are basically RV-ing their way around Europe in a well-funded cocoon, picking things up casually if those things are pretty enough or pique their interest in a bizarre way. The repetitiveness of the nonadventures in this book drove this idea home to me but the process was a chore. I'm not a fan of the writer."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Rather than simply add to the great number of reviews on \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" I would like to comment here not just on this novel, but on the Hemingway canon itself, and upon what we might make of this writer in hindsight. This I believe is possible because Hemingway seemed to stay fairly constant throughout his lifetime in both his style and in regard to the world-view he intended to express . . .Whatever one may say of Hemingway, it must be acknowledged that he was a master prose sylist. He paired down his sentences to a razors edge, to the point that they did not reveal anything of the author himself, but rather attempted to reveal \\"just the facts,\\" and this method of expression took a generation by storm. As a result he became the \\"great exponent\\" of a \\"new movement\\" in literature\\" - one that came to domminate the mid-twentieth-century.That in itself is a testament to his power as a crafter of words, and certainly Hemingway had great strengths as a writer. He was capable of wrenching the reader sharply and vividly into his settings, and of conveying the world as he saw it, vividly and powerfully. At times he even succeeded in producing a deep sympathetic response through his visceral rendering of his own internal void: of images sketched starkly against the terrible meninglessness, the terrible, futile, causation that he saw as the mechanism at work in the world! These things are powerful abilities, and speak to the seriousness of his search for meaning.Yet after reading much of his work I always came to wonder, who is Earnest Hemingway? What does Earnest Hemingway believe and what does he want us to take away in understanding from his work? His protagonists, who I always felt were all the same man, a sort of alter ego of Hemingway himself, seem remarkably void - mere shadows that flit across the face of the world without ever giving vent to any deeper expression. Their chief charactoristic seems to be that they have a great sense of their superiority to women, to nature, to fate, to the vissisitudes of life, and to men less masculine then themselves - and yet somehow we don't ever really believe in them! We don't believe that they are REAL.There is within this overpowering embodyment of the masculine ideal something EMPTY - something insecure of itself - something that clammors ceaselessly and childishly for affirmation.This is where Hemmingway falls down as a writer, and it is sad to see, because his merits as a \\"writer\\" are undeniable. Yet somehow in the end all he ever seems to do is drag us into his own private neurosis, into his own need for affirmation as a man, as a man's man, as a manly man, as the kind of man that other men like to be manly with! One always feels sullied by this juvenile need of his (whatever it might have been) that he could never resolve, and by his irresistable need to drag us into it - to almost FORCE us to adopt it.What is, under the circumstances, therfore even sadder is that this repressed and un-integrated view of life's meaning set the standard for a whole generation of writers and was taken as wisdom. . . ! \\"Yes,\\" Hemingway seemed to say, \\"I know the facts!\\"But what exactly are \\"the facts?\\" Mankind is \\"a mystery within an enigma.\\" The facts are subjective. Life, if it is anything - if it has meaning at all - is a matter of empathy between kindred spirits, and writing - if it has meaning - is the expression of what can be derived through that process of COMMUNION.Unfortunately, of these things, Ernest Heimgway knew nothing at all."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I thought the first 100 or so pages of this was incredibly tedious and flat, but it really opened up for me when they got to Spain. The descriptions of the severe, castillian country side are really lovely, and I could almost see Jake and co., hiking through the land, sipping wine, and just enjoying their drunken, gnomic conversations as they stumble and collide through their little expatriate lives. I don't really like Hemmingway or the way he writes, but I found this enjoyable. Not earth shattering, not revelatory, just enjoyable. I'd still rather work through a baroque 19th century novel, or some fractured, schizophrenic postmodern nightmare than sit down and read a chapter of his prose.

It's a great book with many consequences that deal with human nature.The love affairs and jealousy occurs with everyday life for some people. Hemmingway's style of writing is not the &quot;perfect style&quot; that we read in every other book. He uses a vulgar style. Hemingway has created these characters to be continuously frustrating and apparently beyond hope, but in doing so he makes them friendly, attractive, and people that every human being can relate to.I enjoyed reading his book. And for his first book, I would say that he did very well. Once I started reading it, I could not put it own. I am interested in the social life that happens in the book. The love affairs, drunkenness, and racial comments are things we deal with or see everyday.

As he draws readers into the scenes and dialogue, they are easily tricked into becoming characters of the story. There is a simple, active writing style that's easy to understand.

They were all a bunch of morally-bankrupt, selfish and snobby rich Americans who trot all over Europe satisfying their whims and drinking themselves into oblivion, all while imposing their disgusting lives on other people.(Autobiographical?) If you took out every reference to how drunk these people got, this would be a 50-page novella. You might say, \\"That's what Hemingway was trying to portray\\". OK, in that sense this was a powerful book because the characters' pathetic lives were so vividly impressed upon my mind. Perhaps. However, I could never recommend this novel for the very subject matter and tone of the novel. Hemingway's writing is, simply put, bizarre.

Then we started on again, and outside the town the road commenced to mount. We were going through farming country with rocky hills that sloped down into the fields. The grain-fields went up the hillsides. Now as we went higher there was a wind blowing the grain.\\" (That's in Chapter 11. It goes on, but there is no real purpose to it, so I will spare you.)Then there's my favorite passage, from Chapter 12: \\"The girl came in with the coffee and buttered toast. Or, rather, it was bread toasted and buttered.\\" Yeah, Ernie, I wasn't feeling quite comfortable with that damned adjective either. \\"What does he mean by 'buttered toast?'\\" I asked myself. But then you told me, in your simple declarative style, just exactly what \\"buttered toast\\" meant. Thanks for clearing that up.I'll give him a break, because it is a hell of a novel for a 26-year-old to write, but I wish he had gotten over the machismo thing in his writing before he died.

He was also a connoisseur of the sorts of emotion experienced as one looks forward to an adventure. The book is dedicated to EW's first wife and his child. The first copyright is 1926, eighty years ago.Robert Cohn boxed at Princeton to overcome feelings of inferiority and shyness. He fought only in the gym. In Paris he read books, wrote a novel, played tennis and bridge, and boxed. Robert went back to America with his novel. The publishers praised the work. Returning to France, Robert had become a very successful bridge player and had learned that women liked him. He asked Jake Barnes, the books narreator, to go with him to South America, having read W.H. Hudson. Robert Cohn became interested in Brett, Lady Ashley. Jake's head worked on old grievances. It was a rotten way to be wounded and it was a joke. Jake started to cry thinking he wouldn't have Brett. Brett is getting a divorce and she intends to marry Mike Campbell. At the Cafe Select Jake encounters Harvey Stone. In trying to begin his second book, Robert Cohn has lost his sureness. Jake begs Brett for them to live together. She says that it would not work.Jake plans to shove off to Spain with Bill Gorton at the end of June. They are to go to the fiesta in Pamplona. Mike Campbell and Brett and Robert Cohn will also go to Pamplona. Robert Cohn, naive, brings out the worst in everybody. Jake admits to Bill that he has been in love with Brett, on and off, for a long time. The members of the party stay at the Montoya Hotel. Senor Montoya asks Jake if Bill is another aficionado. At Pamplona Jake is reading a story in THE SPORTSMAN'S SKETCHES. Jake hears Brett and Robert climb the stairs in each other's company. There is a big religious procession. San Fermin is transferred from church to church.Pedro Romero, a new matador, is outstanding. He keeps a pure line facing the maximum amount of danger in the presence of the bull. It seems that Pedro Romero learned some English in Gilbraltar. Brett tells Jake she believes she is in love with Pedro Romero. Mike announces that Brett has gone off with the bull fighter chap. Later, summoned, Brett and Jake rendez-vous in Madrid."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I have read several of Ernest Hemingway's novels and he never fails to amaze me with his elegant prose. Both concise and detailed, his sentences seem choppy when separated from a passage but when strung together flow with aesthetic quality. And it is the simple beauty of not only the language with which he writes, but his ability to capture the human psyche perfectly within in each of his characters that makes this novel timeless. It has no need for the overly dramatic plots or climatic scenes that make modern novels so frivolous; the characters are all that is needed. Each one that was introduced into the plot was easily identifiable; I saw within each my best friend, my brother, and my neighbor, I knew exactly the types of people he wrote about. And it was this character interaction that kept the novel afloat. Whether it was Jack, Brett, Bill, or Mike's ever present drunken follies or the love triangles constantly being roused by Lady Ashley, Hemingway never missed an opportunity to comment on the lost generation; those poor, hapless souls, drained of hope and morality by the Great War, who drank away their years in Europe. With lost morality these friends loved, lived, and lost for a sunny week in Spain that helped reveal just how complex human relationships can be. Nothing was as subtly insightful though, as the underlying theme of the impotence affecting Jack which reveals that a loss to masculinity is not just physical but mental too.Ernest Hemingway has once again created a masterpiece with his laconic, masculine prose that when vaguely skimmed appears elementary and choppy but when savored reveals it's wisdom and beauty. For prospective readers out there- pick up this book and love it for the subtle ways it reveals a grander meaning."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises in my opinion is an ok book. The scenery never really changed during the book which kinda made the book boring in a way, but since it was mostly conversation it also went at a decent pace. The characters in the book were quite pathetic ecept for the narrator(Jake). He seemed to have a decent head on his shoulders when he wasn't drunk. The character Brett Ashely was terrible! If a woman acted like she did now days she'd have no friends and would have to move from place to place after she was done making her rounds with all the men in town. She was a horrible drunk that couldn't make up her mind about who she wanted to be with or when she wanted to settle down. By the end of the book she was 34 dating a 17yr old spanish bull fighter and had been with every man in the book except Jake. However they did kiss a lot in the beginning and he'd always ask her to be with him and i never knew why they didn't ever settle down b/c they both claimed to \\"love\\" each other. If you love someone and are toying with the idea of settling down shouldn't you consider marrying them? This Brett chick had me going nuts through out the whole novel because one minute she'd be with one guy for a while, wind up breaking his heart and move on to the next cute guy she found. I just don't agree with that. Another thing that kinda bothered me about this book was the fact that they were always drinking. I've never heard of people that drink as much as they do, not even alcoholics. Over all I did like the book because it wasn't just in America's back yard, it took place in different countries. I never really grasped a moral or lesson out of this book. The ending was annoying in a way because it left you wondering what was next in the middle of action. I love to read those books as long as they have another one right after to explain it.-PRCHELSEAPENNY"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I think the only way anyone could find &quot;serious flaw&quot; in this book is if the reader himself looked for things in the book that weren't there. I don't think it is necessary to compare characters in the book to the bulls or homosexuals; this book was written simply about about people of the &quot;lost generation&quot;, who were devestated by World War One. Jake was not &quot;trying to assert his manhood&quot;, he was just a man who fell in love with a woman who he loved too much to hate. I think that this book, as were many of Hemingway's novels, was largely autobiographical. A book of real people lost in a real world written by a real person. If you are a real person and not lost in superficiality as Hemingway was lost in WWI, its imposible not to love this book."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is not a book that can be taken at its face value. In order for the reader to get a true feeling of what the story is about then they have to read beyond the simplistic form. Jake is constantly trying to re-assert his manhood. That is why he hated the men that Lady Ashley was with when she is first introduced into the story. They were gay, and he sees them as having the correct tools and using them the wrong way. The bull fights are the same, its all about penetration, either the bull does or the sword does. Nearly all of the characters are expatriates, and their incessent drinking illustrates their desolation and thinking that there is nothing good in the world anymore. A common thought after WWI. Hemingway spins an intricate tale of unrequited love and desolation beneath a simplistic facade. EXCELLENT"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"SAR is my all-time favorite book. I'm not going to give you the blow-by-blow, but having read all 85 reviews, there are a few things I wanted to pass along. I first read SAR soon after high school and have read it numerous times since. Some have commented on the lack of plot; true, it's not a Steven King novel, but the subtleties of emotion are moving. Who has not had their heart ripped out once by a member of the opposite sex? (if not, you're lucky or next in line) As for Barnes' wounds and the war, they are mentioned in a few places but only by inference. I'll tell you what happened: Barnes was an aviator flying in the Italian front in WWI. He was shot through his seat by ground fire and lost a few male parts. This type of wound was unfortunately common to aviators in WWI. So common that the lids on field kitchen stoves kept disappearing to become seat armor in those flimsy biplanes. happy reading."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This book is over-rated. The story is emotionally painful to follow, and the characters are very difficult to sympathize with. HOWEVER, Hemingway is one of the greatest authors america has produced, and rather than formulating any opinion before reading the book, I encourage readers to give Hemingway a chance. Also a bonus from this book is that F Scott Fitgerald did most of the editing...you can see his style at work.I've been told that this book is exceedinly, almost scarily autobiographical. The characters aren't very likable, but the situations and the plot evolution are fairly realistic. Not Hemigway's best, but not his worst either."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"For a story without much of a plot, &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; manages to invoke a haunting realism. That was the point of Hemingway's work. This was, after all, the &quot;Lost Generation,&quot; recovering from the horrors of the &quot;war to end all wars,&quot; World War I. There is no urgency in the characters. They don't set out to accomplish acts of heroism. They're selfish and, for the most part, sit in bars and drink and tell Cohn to get the hell away from them. That's pretty much it. A trek into the Spanish countryside, however, and vivid descriptive elements of the &quot;running of the bulls&quot; in Pamplona make this a worthwhile read. Don't look for literary heights as much as the effects of world catastrophe on young lives. This work goes a long way towards explaining what happened to those who suffered in World War I. Don't feel sorry for them. Just learn from them."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Many of the reviews I've read of The Sun Aslo Rises complain that it is lacking in plot. When reading Hemingway, it is more important to focus on the theme; why did Hemingway write this book? What is he trying to say? It seems to me that Hemingway is focusing on a basic range of emotions with the essence of the book being that poeple are so limited by what they consider appropriate in relationships. Jake and Brett can not have a romantic relationship due to Jake's injury however, they have all of the emotion and commitment necessary to have a successful union. Brett becomes physically intimate with several people in the novel, yet she is not emotionally intimate with any of them. Jake, on the other hand, is emotionally intimate with many characters including Bill, and the inn keeper in Pamplona although he can not enjoy physical intimacy. I believe that Hemingway is demonstrating the difficulties involved in forming complete and healthy relationships in life. Readers who appriciate this book understand that Hemingway's purpose is not to entertain, although he does so artfully, but to force an examination of our own lives. The closing scene in the novel just wrenches my heart as it would anyone's who has ever been close to having everything in life, but has just one impossible obsticle denying their dream."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I will only say one thing. I went out and bought a fishing license because of this book."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"THE SUN ALSO RISES is hauntingly effective. In true Hemingway style, it is both painful to read and impossible to put down. Jake's struggles to reconcile himself with his new role of confidant for everyone in his group of friends even though this requires him to give up his sexual and emotional identity are passionately described in Hemingway's marvelously terse prose; the writing is all the more effective because he states emotions baldly and lets us feel the reactions as though they were our own. The use of language is wonderful: it reads as though the language is controlling the characters, as though they have no choice but to speak and think as they do. And Hemingway is in top form; characters who spend the entire novel talking never seem to have a real conversation. Hemingway skilfully weaves an intricate web of disillusionment, fear, and anxiety and manages to catch us without having to reach out. This is a masterpiece of war literature--another Hemingwaqy ! ! sleight of hand, since the entire novel takes place after the war and WWI is never mentioned."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I just loved the attitude in this book. The way these people looked on love. They did't let it suffocate them, it came as something natural. Like breathing. Life might have been hard, but they didn't let it bother them. And yet there was nothing brave or heroic in them. That came naturally as well."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"THE SUN ALSO RISES is one of my favorite books, and easily Hemingway's best (he thought so, too). One thing RISES has that Hemingway's later novels didn't is personality. Hemingway's later novels were very dry in tone (and I love them), and the characters spoke with verbal sterility (Richard Ford wrote that Hemingway's characters sound somewhat like robots. This description could in no way apply to RISES' characters). THE SUN ALSO RISES has humor and life, and the best dialogue I've ever read. I've read parts of RISES countless times. It's been knocked for being a collection of vignettes, and not strong on plot (and I don't consider &quot;plot&quot; a sin like some literary snobs do). But the vignettes (that do serve the story) are so beautifully crafted, they are a pure pleasure to read. There are two books I've read where, in parts, I wish I could have stepped inside the books and lived what was happening. WAR AND PEACE is one. THE SUN ALSO RISES is the other."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Having not read Hemingway since my teens (a few years ago), I decided to revisit him to see how he stood the test of time. I chose The Sun Also Rises because I had not previously read this one. I was disappointed. There was no discernable plot other than a group of American, English and Scottish expatriates who go on holiday with a lovely lady who they are all involved with in some way or another. The plot consists only of an obscene amount of alcohol consumption, jealous intrique and the fiesta and running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain, and pretty much ends as it began as far as the cast of characters are concerned. Many authors and novels don't wear well over time so I was not surprised when I wasn't wowed by this book. Still, Hemingway had a raw talent as a writer. I think the reason he was so popular in the twenties is that his style was so unlike the classic authors who came before him. He really introduced a very crisp style of writing, with limited description, and heavy on dialogue which moves his stories along. Also, part of Hemingway's charm was, and remains, the fabulously flamboyant and handsome man he was in real life. I would recommend reading Hemingway's A Farewell To Arms, as I recall really liking that book. Styles, like everything else, change over time. It's doubtful many hugely famous authors of the nineteenth and early twentieth century would wear well today, but that's not really the point. The point is being immensely relevant in your own time and that, in itself, is a giant accomplishment. We should all be so fortunate."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"How did Hemingway do it? How did he just put the simplest of words together, words that anyone might use, yet in such a way that shall always haunt and transcend? \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" epitomizes Hemingway's effortless, aesthetically athletic prose ... though some could easily argue that \\"Old Man and the Sea\\" was such an epitome. The most interesting character in the story may be Lady Ashley, a deliciously decadent, charmingly complicated, and irresistibly intellectual, ethereal woman. The relationship between she and Jake is nostalgically impossible, yet quixotically optimistic, with perhaps the greatest culminating line in all of literature, \\"Isn't it pretty to think so?\\" However, the witty, eccentric banter between the main characters is enough to keep readers turning pages for centuries. Anyone who thinks that Hemingway's work may be cynical, in my humble opinion, has not read the likes of this simple and deep and remarkable novel."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Such a great story, and a truly amazing read. When you read the story you feel as if you are sitting beside Jake and his friends(?) at one of the many caf&eacute;s they visit. I wish I could give it six stars.

It is a wonderful example of the Caf&eacute; Society of the 1920's."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"One of Hemingway's masterpieces, this work has everything a reader could hope for in a classic -- sparse prose, compelling characterization, and a definitive look at a whole generation.

It's also a look at how people try to drink to numb the pain that life provides. Jake, Robert, Brett and the others in this book are the arty, literary type who go to Paris to watch the bullfighting and the running of the bulls, but are soon torn apart by factions, fighting, and pettiness.The book is set in 1926 Spain and France, but it speaks of issues that transcend time and culture. It's not a great story, but it captures in a classic way a timeless problem."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"In his novel The Sun Also Rises, Ernest Hemingway introduces readers to members of the Lost Generation. These pour souls are what remains of the youth of World War I, a generation whose hope in humanity has been destroyed and who now drift through life aimlessly in a search for meaning. Hemingway takes us on a trip to Paris, where we meet Jake Barnes (the voice of the novel), a man who has been both emotionally and physically wounded by the war. We also meet the woman Jake loves, Brett Ashley, but due to his wound and her independent spirit, they cannot be together. Along with the unfortunate lovers is Robert Cohn, a former boxer and budding author who cannot keep his emotions in check. The Sun also Rises tells the intertwining story of these three Americans and their companions, as they travel from France to Spain for a Bull Fight and fiesta.Hemingway's strengths lie in his creative symbolism, nuanced dialogue, and beautiful descriptions. As the characters interact with one another, the reader can always feel something more looming behind their words. Especially when Brett Ashley speaks, her voice is that of a carefree woman who truly longs for a more meaningful life, although she will never actually admit it. When Hemingway describes a scene, he uses color to assert his feelings about the place. For example, France is often pale and slightly gloomy, while Spain is always vivid and teeming with life. Water and bulls are other symbols in the novel, but I would not want to spoil the fun of deciphering their meaning for anyone else.Like all of the classics, The Sun Also Rises does have its shortcomings. At times the plot will drag on, with characters doing nothing but drinking, complaining, and drinking some more to escape the drudgery. This novel is not for the faint of heart, it is one that requires steady reading and some contemplation. So if you are looking for a quick read on the plane or at the beach, I would recommend you save Hemingway for another time.Personally, I enjoyed exploring The Sun Also Rises. Hemingway has a unique writing style that made me pause and sometimes even chuckle under my breath. His character Jake Barnes is witty and insightful-- the kind of person you enjoy getting to know as you read along. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a little scandal, romance, and a journey into the minds of lost souls."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"For TG, a woman of valor.The exchange between the Count and Jake Barnes in which the Count reveals the secret of staying in love makes \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" one of America's great books.Ernest Hemingway provided great comfort to those of the post World War I generation vexed by the seemingly unattainable amid growing material plenty. Jake feels inadequate because his war experience has left him unable to do sexually what he used to do. He's wounded by his lack of marriage to Lady Brett Ashley. Along comes the Count to tell Jake in a veiled and thus powerful way - It's not you. It's the situation. In particular it's this noble yet easily corrupted notion that equates love with possession.Hemingway isn't fulminating against marriage - he was married four times himself. What he's warning against is making love conditional upon possession. Through the Count, the author is telling us if you love somebody then meet them where they are. Marriage is fine as long as it's based on a mutual understanding, not the desire of one to possess another.It should certainly not be dependent on any physical appearances as the words and actions of the Biblical patriarchs show us - see Genesis 12:11 and 24:57. For a hint of how the economic concept of acquisition has overflowed its banks, see Max Weber's \\"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.\\"Hemingway's meditation on possession echoes Weber in demonstrating the doctrine's wider social implications. Papa can be viewed as warning his countrymen and future generations about indulging in personal material comforts and the nation's drive for dominance in global affairs.The personal and national drives are summed up in the character of Robert Cohn. The Jewish Cohn is the embodiment of the emerging new immigrant America. Cohn's failure with Lady Ashley proves the Count correct again.Hemingway's treatment of love and possession is mirrored in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" and \\"The Bridges of Madison County.\\" Jay Gatsby is destroyed by his desire to acquire Daisy Buchanan (this is the \\"foul dust\\" that F. Scott Fitzgerald foreshadows early in the novel) although he shows himself to be the finest of men by not making his love conditional.Clint Eastwood's character in the movie version of \\"Bridges\\" (I haven't read the book yet) sums it up well - \\"They're too many lines being drawn. This is mine. This is yours...\\" Yet the lure of rescuing someone from a seemingly bad situation is powerful (see King David's experience with Bathsheva, II Samuel chapters 11 and 12) and activates the acquisition impulse. Eastwood's character is nearly seduced by it. His love pulls him up just as he's about to create strife for Meryl Streep's character.For more about the difference between possession love and true love contrast the agony of Carly Simon's song \\"You Belong to Me\\" with the serenity of Whitney Houston's \\"I Will Always Love You.\\"By studying \\"Gatsby\\" and \\"Bridges\\" we recount Hemingway's wise counsel of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" - love and strife don't go together and if you love someone set them free."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises, published in 1926, is Hemingway's great first novel about the aftermath of World War I on a group of Americans living in Paris in the 1920's. It's view of life is bleak to the very end, almost to a fault; but it has a kind of sparse poetic grace in descriptive language that carries one through the pessimism on a wave of aesthetic bliss.The greatness is a product of this original narrative style executed to nearly perfect emotional and tonal effect. It is a new kind of stream of consciousness: not flashy, jazzy and allusive like Joyce, Woolf, or (three years later) Faulkner; but instead a steady chain of observations from the inner thoughts of someone who is sane, experienced, and who looks to report reality with a kind of shell-shocked, bunker objectivity; and whose emotions come through in the cynical realism one might expect from a survivor of an apocalypse. At times the spare descriptions created insufficient clarity, so that some sentences cannot be definitively intepreted and so the meaning is lost or diminished, but such sentences are rare.The emotion underneath the cynicism is subtle, and its impact is cumulative. It develops as one comes to trust Hemingway as a truth-teller. The narrator and main character tells a story of aimless and pleasure-less indulgence, in which war trauma (physical and psychological) is the felt but unspoken source and context of all the emptiness in the characters' actions.Jake Barnes is the owner of the consciousness being so artfully described. But Brett Ashley, the woman he loves and can't get away from, is the vortex of all the emotional action. She is a woman who loves Jake and is not deceptive to him, yet because he can't satisfy her she uses several other men for sex. She seems to have some vague variety of intermittent idealism and moral pride, so she occasionally struggles to manage the side-effects of her cold impulsiveness.Brett is a remarkable character in that clearly she is damaged like Jake (psychically if not physically), and yet she has a unique power that none of the men do, and in watching how she uses that power, one cannot decide to the very end of the story if she is more or less of a person than Jake, or if she has courage, or is worth much sympathy, or if her conscience is fully developed, or if she even has a conscience. That is, one wonders if her apparent moral pride and idealism are actually just grief for having lost any moral pride and idealism.Her deep, enigmatic complexity (and how it makes the reader react) is the greatest accomplishment in this story, but given her place as the emotional center of the story, the emptiness surrounding this elusive complexity also makes perhaps the most cynical statement in a book filled with such cynicism, about the powerlessness that emotionally damaged humans have over their own will. The book has a great last line which sums up all of this tough-minded despair.It may be a matter of opinion as to whether 'The Sun Also Rises' is a classic tragedy or just a well-executed exercise in morbid masochism. In any case, it is unforgettable."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"What am I going to read next to top this?That may be your first thought as you silently absorb the last lines of this superlative novel. It sure was mine. As with \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" this is one of the greatest debuts of any novelist and a modernist masterpiece. However, unlike \\"Portrait\\" this is not a bildungsroman. The closest Hemingway ever had to a Stephen Daedalus is Nick Adams and he is forever relegated to the short stories. From this novel going forward all the main characters are going to be the adult Hemingway and his experiences, albeit with a tagged on name.Twain, whom Hemingway regarded as the greatest American novelist, is a clear influence on the breezy travelogue prose here. I'm reminded of of the kinetic stagecoach experiences of \\"Roughing It.\\" If Twain sounds old remember that Hemingway was much closer in time to Twain than we are to Hemingway. Twain died just 16 years before the publication of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" when Hemingway was 27 years old. However, I sense impressionism was also an influence in the simple broad brush he paints with when describing landscapes. In fact, I know it was via his autobiographical \\"A Moveable Feast.\\" This is what informs his Zen style. A river, some trees, a patch of strawberries growing on the side of the mountain...you're in an impressionist landscape once they hit the Spanish countryside.It is in this effortless prose that you go cruising right along into the Paris of the twenties, fishing in Basque country, and fiesta in Pamplona. Be prepared also to drink, drink, drink. It's Prohibition but we're not in protestant America, we're in the greatest city of a continent that has been drinking for thousands of years.Twain influence notwithstanding, this no freewheeling jaunt of quaint misadventures sprinkled with Southwestern humor. We're in the post-WWI, post-Spanish influenza (which killed vastly more souls than the war) years of modernism and that means godless ennui, absinthe, and the Lost Generation: arty expats saturated with drink and (self-inflicted) heartache in Paris.Some reader commented \\"I don't get it.\\" You're not supposed to \\"get it.\\" If you want to \\"get it\\" go read a Tom Clancy novel. This is about poignant irony - a high class flapper slut and a castrated vet in love with each other but forever apart. This is about wanting what you cannot have and dealing with it in one of two ways: the WASP-y approach of repression and stoicism (Jake), or the emotional way by drinking yourself stupid (Mike) or imploding and hurling yourself at others (Cohn). This is a bitter Je ne sais quoi ode to the unconsummated longings of expatriate Americans and Brits in 1920's Paris and it's not meant to be understood, simply experienced. Happy endings are impossible here.But the characters' sexcapades and drinking are only the story - the rest is the poetry of Hemingway: the river, the Basques on the bus, the festival of San Fermin and of course the bullfights. Because Hemingway is so associated with the bullfights you expect the running of the bulls to be a long descriptive event in the novel and it's a nice surprise when it is not. Jake, the narrator, is hungover and wakes up late and watches it from the balcony of his hotel then goes back to bed. When they run again he sleeps through it. Whatever your preconceptions are about Hemingway it won't matter - everything in this book reads fresh and new and the prose is effortless and flows like the wine in the bota bags.The closest Hemingway ever came to an artistic manifesto can be found not in his \\"iceberg analogy\\" interview with the Paris Review, but in the following quote from him:\\"All good books are alike in that they are truer than if they had really happened and after you are finished reading one you will feel that all that happened to you and afterwards it all belongs to you; the good and the bad, the ecstasy, the remorse, and sorrow, the people and the places and how the weather was. If you can get so that you can give that to people, then you are a writer.\\"\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is a classic example of the above. It strikes a wonderful balance between the drama of the characters and their settings. Their desires play out to a backdrop of clinking champagne glasses in Paris, they're given a brief reprieve in the fishing interlude, then take off on a rocket sled during the pagan revelry of the fiesta which assumes a lurid dimension when things all start to go the hell.If you read this book mentally pack your bags because you're going on vacation from Paris to Spain with five friends. This will forever be in my top ten list of favorite novels."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Reporter Jake Barnes, a foreign correspondent, is rather deeply in love with the high living Lady Ashley Brett. Building a relationship from this, however, is impossible for them, due to an injury he sustained in the war.The love between Jake and Brett is established in the first chapter and recalled in the last - the rest of the novel tells of an unhappy vacation in Spain wherein several men come to self-destruct when their romantic interests in Brett fail. This is the first true appearence of Hemingway's famous \\"Iceberg Technique;\\" we infer Jake's pain and scars by watching the suffering of other men. If their superficial connections to Brett are enough to cause such hurt, we can only imagine what Jake must feel.Hemingway's language is terse, his descriptions are simple, and his characters are only outlines, but none of this matters - the book is cheap, short, and easy to read (I finished my copy in a few hours). Most importantly, though Hemingway will not do everything for you, he has no need to. Where one lets the eyes and mind collude to turn single photographs into motion pictures, the heart will turn books like 'The Sun Also Rises' into something vibrant, intelligent, and alive.Jake Barnes and Ernest Hemingway, you and I, all know what it means to love and hurt. Good books teach us lessons, but great ones seek to remind us of all the things we'd rather forget."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises is a rather low-key book. Written in a terse, almost hard-boiled style, it tells the story of a wasted group of Americans and Brits living and caring for nothing in Europe after World War I. The events, some of them rather traumatic, never seem to touch the core of these people thus giving that idea that, more all their self-worship and high-faulting ideas regarding man, nature and the way things ought to be, there is really nothing to them.It is a good book, a swift read that carries you along through a series of aimless adventures that have a great deal of depth. The exploration of what is missing in these people makes up the bulk of the story, events getting worse and worse while the characters remain stangely unaffected. Events even seem to repeat themselves, again and again, in different circumstances and locales, something with even differing participants (although there is really no reason to tell them apart). One gets the feeling, in later years, of a fushion of a Henry James morality tale crossed with the heartless indifference of Bret Easton Ellis' monsters--it really does go that far in explaining Hemingway's influence on the generations of writers that followed him in light of those dismissed that came before him.It is a book that, for me, discounts a little of Hemingway's claim as 'a stylist that changed American writing forever' as I see much of Dashiell Hammett modified into something attempting to paint a picture in black and white instead of with a blood-splashed gray. It truly is a fine book but one (if this critique can be regarded as anything) that leaves one a little uncertain of comment and that gives the impression that, perhaps, it may very well be forgotten three pages into the next book undertaken."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"It would be difficult (if not unbelievable) to claim one is a student of the American novel and not have read Hemingway.

Lost generations do seem to follow a war. The Civil War for example produced enormous social discontent, and certainly the foolishness called Vietnam produced a generation of, if not lost, hopelessly confused men and women. (Have you seen some of our pictures from 1969?)So while he was drawn to post war Paris, that venue for the odd mix of abusive characters may become irrelevant, knowing what we know now.Having said that, I think that there are two reasons we treat Hemingway with awe. You ever try to write like him? I mean it's a simple paragraph. Staccato thinking. Bang bang bang. Economy of prose. Tightness of verbiage. Compression of thought. Read the extraordinary sentences of him in the Cathedral. Or fly fishing in Spain. Simple, or so it appears. But then try to replicate it. It's nearly impossible.The other point is Hemingway's disguised repetition. He tells us something. Then in a different city, with different characters, forty pages later, he tells us the same thing.Ecclesiastes tells us on page one what the story is about, everything changes, only to repeat itself: \\"unto the place from [where] the rivers come . . . .they return again.\\"I feel every character speaks for every character. Mike's bankruptcy represents all of their bankruptcy, financial and otherwise; Jake's frustrations are all of their frustrations; Brett's promiscuity not only speaks to all of them, she needs all of them.John Donne's line about the bell tolling for all of us rings true. A brilliant, brilliant book. You may not care for the story but you can't escape Hemingway."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I am quite surprised by some of the negative reviews. But I suppose Hemingway is not for everyone. I am certainly glad that I bought the book and read it. It is one of the best books I have read in a long time! And I read a few books each week. The book is a masterpiece, in my opinion. And I will read it again after a few months, and definitely get more out of it during the second reading. It is that type of book, if you know what I mean. There is a lot of depth in the story, in the dialogues, in the characters that is easy to miss if you simply read the book on the surface. I highly recommend this book!I personally bought this book based on one of the reviews I read. I simply remember that the reviewer had written that after reading the book, he continued to still think about the characters and reflect upon the story. It amazed me to consider that a book could be so intriguing. So, I bought it and just finished it. The book is amazing. Normally I read fast-paced mystery or suspense novels. But it was more difficult for me to put this book down, and there was certainly no suspenseful plot!Mr. Hemingway's characters were brilliantly portrayed. They really come to life on each page. I wish I could tell you all of the wonderful things, but it would be better for you to buy the book and discover them for yourself. Mr. Hemingway distinctively reveals each character while not taking away from the odd comradeship among the expatriates.I am an American who has lived in Europe for the last 9 years. So, I am very acquainted with the lifestyle among expatriates. And I think he very accurately described it, even though it was so many years ago. I especially like how he shows the instant comradeship among expatriates (even as they meet for the first time), and yet how they can still lack any serious or deeply intimate exchanges. It is very realistic. Perhaps that is the best description of the book: it is very realistic, while intriguing.Many expatriates I know living in Europe bounce around from bar to bar, or cafe to cafe, drinking probably more than normal. Keep the story in the context of expatriates living in Europe. If you try to associate it with normal American life, it will not make very much sense. It is the reason why the good qualities and the defects of certain characters really stand out. Everything seems to be accentuated when you are living in another culture.Also, Mr. Hemingway really amazed me at his eye and ear for detail. I never once got the impression that I was overloaded with detail. In fact, I was amazed at how much detail he could put within a few sentences. I think all of my senses were activated through his descriptive writing.Long story short: I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"There isn't a single false note or short-changed character in this book. A crisp and sharp-edged look at a few ex-patriates traveling around Paris and Spain, drinking endlessly, while they ask questions about how they are going to fit into the new post-war world around them.Frustration, anger, contempt was never better expressed than through these &quot;lost souls&quot; of the previous century.Hemingway was a master of the short sentences: his dialogue was funny without being &quot;too clever&quot; and cynical without being unnecessarily sarcastic.It's disappointing to learn others had problems with this book, I can't think of a single complaint...other than it was too short."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemingway makes you want to call up a bunch of buddies and hit sidewalk cafe after cafe ordering good food and drink. He makes these things seem like true life pleasures in the way he describes them. I can't say I did not like the book. There is no real plot, but the adventure Hemingway takes you on makes up for it. I disliked most of the characters which simply means that Hemingway did a great job making them real. Brett Ashley is the most despicable character I've ever read about. Her manipulation and mind games are painted so well by Hemingway that you want her to be real so you can tell her off. She really angered me. All this means is that if a character in a book can anger you, than the author has done his job making the character come to life. It took me awhile to come to terms that I liked this book. I first thought I hated it. When I saw myself constantly talking about the characters to friends, I realized that I really liked the book. I would suggest that it be read by everyone who wants to be wisked away to Spain during the running of the bulls, see a bull fight, and be taken to sidewalk cafes to drink and be merry. Great book! Short read. Read it!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest Hemingway has been called one of the greatest American writers of his time. He has also been called an expatriate, an alcoholic, a traitor and Papa. He was a man who never forgave his father for committing suicide, yet took his own life in 1961.Although being hailed as a great American writer, he spent much of his life living outside the US. The two seemingly contradictory epigraphs in the beginning of The Sun Also Rises were put together on the page by a seemingly contradictory man.Whether he did it intentionally or not, Hemingway wrote The Sun Also Rises in a way that keeps scholars and students in constant speculation as to his theme. His reference to his friend and mentor, Gertrude Stein's comment on the status of the post World War I society would make it seem that he is in agreement of her bleak and cynical outlook.The lost generation, like the ancient Epicureans were in the constant pursuit of moderate pleasure. They lived for the day and gave little though to the consequences of their actions, or to the low that usually follows a high. However, he does not settle for one epigraph.In reaching back to quote Ecclesiastes, a second century preacher and philosopher, Hemingway reveals that no matter how gray the world seems, there is a light to guide us. That light is hope. In his seemingly shallow characters intended to epitomize the lost generation, Hemingway shows - albeit briefly - the even they have traces of compassion and humanity left.The narrator, Jake, is a complex character. Having sustained an injury in the war, Jake is incapable of intimate physical relations with women. Jake is an authentic person. He has friends who, although some are shallow and egocentric, care for him and value his friendship. The fact that he is impotent, however, throws a shadow on his character.Although he is seen as one of the more genuine characters, it is conceivable that he would not be so virtuous without his affliction. Although Jake shows his dark and sardonic side on occasion, he is a testament that there are still people who care in the world.The fact that Hemingway made Jake incapable of siring children, is the author's way of not tipping the scale too far in the direction of hope.Pedro is another character who shows the hope of the novel. Pedro's navet&eacute; is a refreshing change to the world weary characters representing the lost generation. All Pedro knows is bullfighting. It is his world, his life and he is good at it. Pedro, too, is not a perfect character. He is seduced by Brett, and as a result , falls in what he thinks to be love with her. He allows Cohn to provoke him into fighting. Pedro took his beating and did not let Cohn take his pride. Pedro is flawed like all men, but he shows with his youthful energy and vision, that there are good people. It is no coincidence that Pedro is a bullfighter. He stood tall in his suit of lights, a glamorous spectacle for all to see. Even in his moments of shame, Pedro managed to hang on to his dignity.Although Bill seems to be the logical character to turn to next, it is in Brett that Hemingway gives the most subtle yet poignant glimmer of hope. Throughout the novel, Brett is seen as an opportunistic, cynical and uncaring woman.Completely undeserving of her title-by-marriage. She shamelessly has an affair with Cohn, then tosses him aside to return to Michael. She continues her escapades by seducing Pedro, the innocent young bullfighter. Yet there is something within her that draws Jake in as her would-if-only-could-be lover and maintains him as a trusted friend and confidant. That alone is not enough to argue for her role as a character of hope. It is her affair with Pedro that shows her potential. During the course of their affair, Pedro believes that he is in love with Brett. Brett realized that she is not in love with Pedro, but with what he represents: youth, strength, courage and prestige.Brett's realization that she would hurt Pedro, perhaps irrevocably, and that she must leave him and all he represents, is what makes her a character on the edge. She is by all rights caught up in the mentality of the lost generation, and even after her epiphany, will be so caught up again, but her enlightenment was there. She had made the realization and crossed the line from pleasure seeker to enlightened soul. For one brief shining moment, she thought of the well being of another and not merely of her own. Brett saw the light and became a symbol of hope.Hemingway's novel paints a somewhat bleak picture of things to come in the post World War I years. His characters spend their time drinking and running from affair to affair. A shallow existence to be sure. Yet when in the country, there is less time wasted on pointless dialogue and more time spent on the description and appreciation of the beauty of the wilderness. His vivid description of the panorama is a salute to hope. The fact that even his most shallow character, Brett, can have an epiphany bringing her to making the only unselfish choice in her life is a true tribute to his idea of hope."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I first read this back in high school, with a teacher who was part of the generation that was raised on Hemingway. After reading this though, and taking another look at \\"A Moveable Feast\\", I had to conclude that \\"Papa's\\" work has not worn all that well. His incessant macho outlook is now definitely a thing of the past. The hyper-terse language that he uses, inspired by journalism and manly tough guys who knew better than to try to put their thoughts into words, is no longer as appealing to me either. There is no question that he still must be viewed as a great writer, and a vastly influential one, but one who does not really transcend his era.This is the story of Jake Barnes, a decent guy who unfortunately got his balls shot off during World War I. He lives in Paris and works as a reporter. He hangs out with a bunch of English and American expats. They spend their time drinking in cafes, and running around Europe making scenes. There is a woman named Lady Brett Ashley who is a special friend of Jake. She is pretty much a rich slut, running around from man to man, dumping one, and grabbing another. She and Jake have a special feeling for each other, but they can't get down together because of Jake's injury. A number of men fall for her, and Jake watches with frustration as she screws and dumps an obnoxious, married boxer, a drunken bankrupt named Mike, and an up and coming young bullfighter. The book builds to a weeklong drunken bash in Pamplona, where they go for the huge festival attending the running of the bulls. There is a lot of interesting description of the events there, and then novel ends in a mood of resignation.Hem was the master of \\"show don't tell.\\" The only character whose head he lets us into is Jake, and even then, only a little bit here and there. The story is glamorous and interesting, but for me at least, the robotic prose gets tedious. What is interesting is how Jake proves that even somebody like him, who has lost his physical manhood, can still be a very fine man, a finer and better and more moral person than the losers and blowhards and louts and drunkards that he consorts with. I think Hemingway should still be taught in high school, but probably not this book. \\"A Farewell to Arms\\", or the short stories, or \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" might be better."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Although this is Hemingway's first published novel, it was not the first that I'd read. I had read some of his later works before I came to this one. The novel has been misunderstood for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that many people do not get the irony that is behind the story. When it was published in 1926 it became the rallying cry for what people of that era called \\"the lost generation\\". The book is about American expatriates living in France and Spain during the late 1920's. Hemingway and some of his crowd actually did this, but in spite of that, Hemingway has stated that he didn't believe in the \\"lost generation\\" stuff. He is more a proponent of man being the architect of his own life, but sometimes things get in the way. I enjoyed the book because of Hemingway's wonderful characters, and because of his descriptions of things that he actually saw and did. The section that describes the running of the bulls in Pamplona is great. Although this book is a little lesser known than some of Hemingway's novels, it's worth a read. Especially if you love Hemingway like I do."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"About the fifth time I read this book, I realized there was sometime special about the title. Let me explain the title. And in the explanation, I will give you the key to understanding this book.The title is from Ecclesiastes, the words of the Preacher, in the King James version of the Old Testament.&quot;One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth forever.&quot;The sun also riseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.&quot;Jake cannot fulfill his destiny of fathering the next generation. The war took that away from him. His destiny is personified in the woman of his dreams. Four simple words speak loudly of his desire: &quot;And there was Brett.&quot;He sends her away with her different lovers and then meets her when she comes back to him. She goes away. She comes back. They cannot stay away from each other. That is the whole story.Jakes buries himself in work. He works hard. Much of the book is about his work. And about his meals. Hemingway likes to write about food and drink. He describes all the food they eat. You can taste it. And about sleep. The people are always going to sleep.What marvelous focus.The Preacher said:&quot;There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour, This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.&quot;Jake does exactly that. But he cannot reproduce. He can never father children. He can never live with a woman.The Preacher said:&quot;Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the day's of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.&quot;The key to understanding what this book is all about is in the Book Of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament.Hemingway's novel is a very religious work of art. Too few critics and scholars note that. They are foused on other themes.To really understand The Sun Also Rises, read the words of the Preacher before you read the book and after you read the book.To those of you who have never read Ecclesiastes, prepare yourself for a major shock of recognition. You will know what I mean when you came across thos very familiar words you will recognize at once.Those words make this novel more profound that you can ever imagine."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I am quite surprised by some of the negative reviews.

In order to illustrate the disillusionment of Jake, Brett, Cohn, and Bill, Hemingway presents an &quot;anti-hero&quot; novel. It does not follow anyexciting story plot; and at the novel's end, none of the characters have resolved any enduring conflicts or havegained any acclaim. This technique achieves Hemingways' purpose of characterizing the &quot;Lost Generation,&quot; but distances his readers. I read the book for my AP English class; I found it more interesting to analyze The Sun Also Rises than actually read. Many of the book's techniques, such as symbol and Hemingways' terse but descriptive language, are not readilly visibly on a first reading. However, if you didn't enjoy the story the first time around, I wouldn't suggest tackling it again.If you're looking for a book with a Lost Generation plot and an interesting story, turn to Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. If you want another Hemingway, A Farewell to Arms is slightly more interesting. But The Old Man and the Sea is, in my opinion, Hemingway's best--and if you don't like it, at least it is short enough that you do not has to spend much time reading it."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is the first Hemingway novel I have read.I both enjoyed it and found it puzzling.

And, frankly, it's a very large thing.Talent. Skill. Hemingway had an enormous amount of it, and Fitzgerald a bit less. Fitzgerald is like one of those radio stations that plays classical music. Boring as ... to most of us, but for a few cultured ones his prose soars and lifts the spirit. Hemingway, on the other hand, writes with a deceptive simplicity. Short, powerful sentences that seem to draw you deeper and deeper into the story or novel.I cared about the people in The Sun Also Rises. And the description of their fishing trip is worth the price of admission in and of itself.Give Hemingway a shot. After all, he only wrote 6 novels while he was alive--not counting the 4 published after he died--and 4 of them are considered all time classics. Pretty good percentage, wouldn't you say...Sean"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemingway won the Nobel Prize in Literature and for good reason as this his first major novel shows. What we notice about Hemingway is his style; but for all its infamous &quot;simplicity,&quot; Hemingway's style is very tightly controlled and rich in emotional intensities. He used to practice by reciting the King James version of the Bible in order to get the power and poetry of adjective deficient prose. Hemingway's characters wander, they do not &quot;Quest&quot; so he is probably postmodern. Nevertheless, the moderist issues of self and identity are prominent. These people live in the post WW II wasteland which as shown is absolutely authentic.

Since most breadwinners were either killed or maimed in the war, many families were forced to face the devastation of loss on their own. Compounding this tragedy was the loss of irreplaceable manpower. Economic costs, caused by the destructive forces of the war, ran into trillions of dollars, bringing countries like France and England to their knees.A spirit of doom, despair and disillusionment pervaded the world. Old ideologies seemed to mock the reality of the times and the youth who had lived through the war had abandoned them in exchange for a more licentious lifestyle. This was a time when writers like Hemingway and Fitzgerald began to express a sense of lost direction in their writing, producing such timeless masterpieces as: &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;, by F. Scott Fitzgerald and , by Ernest Hemingway. Published in 1926, &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; established Hemingway as the \\"big man in American letters\\" as Allan Tate wrote. It is the story of American and British expatriates living in post World War I Paris, which gives a vivid description of hopeless love and unconstrained behavior. Battling against creative dry-spells and depression, Robert Cohn and his friend, Jake Barnes, mingle with large crowds of fellow expatriates. These single \\"thirtysomethings\\" represented the \\"lost generation\\", the youth that had emerged from the war disillusioned and directionless, living by the bottle and the temporary euphoria it provided.Drifting from the left bank of Paris and the colorful, lively clubs that dotted its landscape, to the savage excitement of the bullfighting in Spain, these young men and women desperately sought to find a connection. Whether through their friendships, or through their failed attempts at love, theirs was a struggle to beat back loneliness; to fill the void the war had gouged in their souls. But they did so with laughter, idle talk and a bottle of good wine. Days were spent walking up the Rue du Cardinal in Paris looking for a good place to eat, or fishing for trout up in Burguete, Spain, dreaming all the while of unrealized love.Hemingway's seven-year stay in Paris had no doubt contributed to the realistic, picturesque account of France in the 1920's. There, he hooked up with a group of writers and other artists in a circle known as \\"the lost generation\\", which he creatively and credibly reproduced in his novel. He also spent much of his time in Pamplona, Spain watching, and sometimes participating in, bullfighting competitions. However, it was Hemingway's own semi-tragic involvement in World War I, which nearly cost him his leg, that gave the novel its soul. Through his own experiences, Hemingway successfully fused the gap between reality and art, and offered his readers a timeless masterpiece."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I had to read this book for my English class and I loved it. I really recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemingway's beautifully poignant work, The Sun Also Rises, defines the stark reality of emotion, attitudes, wills, temper, and love. His characters, although apparently unaffected, are the prime examples of the legacy of a lost generation."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemingway is one of the most important authors the United States has ever produced for several reasons. The first being that he emerged in a period in history when not only America, but the world was searching for something to hold on to after it was discovered that the safe, secure and unchanging world of the nineteenth century was destroyed and replaced by a world of travel, communication, and war of unbefore seen horrors. The second being that his feeling of dispossession filled not only the vetrans of WWI, but also the entire generation from which he came, which had to attempt to fit in to this new world. The third and most important feature of Hemingway's writing is that its cut-down, terse, and abrupt speech was designed not out of a lack of &quot;eloquent&quot; writing abilities, but it was so that every man and woman in America and in the world could grasp everything he tried to save in his works. Hemingway did more to revolutionize modern writing then any other author in American literature.In the &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; we see Jake Barnes, the tragic hero who cannot be happy with Brett, so instead does what he can to support her. Other characters in the novel contrast Barnes by being given every advantage in the world but choose to do nothing with them. The bullfighter is the true hero, who every man wants to be, but cannot. It is through these characters that Hemingway presents the paradox of life which encircles and destroys some, like himself. Although it is true that these characters drink, participate in promiscuous activities, and seem to waste their lives, it is this which Hemingway wants to present to the reader, that for his generation and all others similarly affected, there is nothing in life but these wanton indulgences. Hemingway lets the reader see the tragedy of these distorted souls, but presents hope with the title and the promise of a new generation. The whole existence of humanity and our failed dreams can be demonstrated by the final dialogue between Brett and Jake, &quot;Damn, we could have had such a good time together!&quot; Jake replies, &quot;Yes, isn't it pretty to think so.&quot; With this statement Hemingway presents to the world everything that is sad and grotesque about human life and the way that these shortcomings make the world a beautiful place and worth the fighting for."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This book is comes as close to capturing ecsasty as any book possibly could.

It is about the need for something to fill the emptiness caused by war. It is about passion and anger and all the range of human emotions.

Just because the book doesn't follow some sort of comic strip sequence of events doesn't mean that there is no thematic development throoughout the novel. The major theme, in my opinion, was how Jake Barnes dealt with his impotency. This is a theme that was thouroughly and heartbreakingly developed in the novel. People that say &quot;this book doesn't mean anything&quot; are morons that would be better off watching sit-coms and reading comic books."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Though somewhat bleak this is an honest and engrossing read. The motivations of people who have seen life cheapened by the &quot;war to end all wars&quot; are of page turning fascination and the honest deceit that they possess still rings true today more than 70 years later. Hemingways frank handling of emasculation, both literal and figurtive, is of poignant honesty. A good book!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I first read &quot;Sun&quot; many years ago for a college course, and liked it. I reread it a few months ago and loved it. For a 26 year old man Hemingway had an admirable grasp of human behavior and motivation and, of course, a giant talent to express it. There's plenty of structure to tear into if you want to examine the literary workings or you can just sit back and read effortlessly."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is probably the best out of all of Hemingway's novels, A Farewell to Arms and For Whom the Bell Tolls included. The &quot;ol' gang&quot; format would be used to great effect in many films afterwards, especially in the Breakfast Club, as that generation was seen as &quot;lost&quot; just as Hemingway's was. Jake's hopeless, tortured longing for Brett shows the trademark passionate Hemingway style, and it makes you think about what actually happens. The smart reader understands this book better."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is undoubtedly one of Hemingways masterpieces and I rate this as one the finest books I've read to date. The way he incorporates his characters into the novel is unsurpassed, or maybe it is the lack of character that makes this a classic.The Sun Also Rises is a must have and buying this book is suggested for all readers alike. I can safely say this should be one of the Hemingway titles you should try out along with To Whom the Bell Tolls. Simply a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This book is a bit boring to me, although it shows many emotions of different characters.The main character Jake, is a very mysterious and self-conscience man. In the beginning of this novel the story taked place in Paris, France. As you read on you encounter many charatcers. In the begining of the chapter you are introduced to Robert Cohn. He plays a minor part of this story, but helps bring out Jake's personality in ths novel. Brett palkys a big part in Jake's life. Brett and Jake have feelings for one another, but cannot be together because of complications with Jkae's body. Thre are other characters, but these three are the most you will see and read about.The time in which this novel taked palce and now times are similar in ways. In both the characters in the novel and people now-a-days, turn to alcohol for reliefand have tendencies to party all night long. Yet, there are parts in the book I cannot believe can occur, but this may be a good part of the novel. a place where dreams may happen."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The characters had depth and the writing was clear, but I think I missed a plot or storyline. It moved along well, but unless you find a story about a bunch of spoiled post-adolescents tromping around Europe in the 1920's particularly interesting this one may leave you a little hungry. I already own A Farewell to Arms and For Whom the Bell Tolls so sometime down the road I will give those a shot, but for now Hemingway has not impressed me. I'll take Steinbeck over Hemingway any given day."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises is a poignant, touching story of a group of post-World War I expatriates living lives of excess in Paris. The hero, Jake Barnes, is condemned to a life of celibacy because of a war injury. Brett Ashley, the woman he loves, goes from one sexual encounter to another. Mike, her fianc&eacute;, is a hard-drinking Scotsman who is financially and emotionally bankrupt. They all seem to drink to forget, but they cant escape their many problems and are doomed to fail. The bright, sunny setting of the fiesta in Pamplona, Spain, the cafes of Paris, and trout fishing in a mountain stream contrasts the characters' feelings of depression, hopelessness, and loneliness. The action pivots around the bullfight, symbolic of Jake's situation. No matter how strong and powerful the bull is, everyone knows he will not survive the onslaught of the matador. This book is a slow paced novel with an emphasis on character development, tone, and theme. Hemingway's words are spare and lean, using powerful verbs without loading descriptions down with too many adjectives. This powerful, well-written novel gives the reader insight to what is often referred to as the &quot;lost generation,&quot; those who survived the &quot;war to end all wars&quot; but came back broken physically, emotionally, spiritually. If someone can get past the slow beginning to this book, they will be rewarded with a simply told tragedy that is deeply symbolic and deeply moving."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This was a well detailed plot, another by Ernest Hemmingway. The simplicity shone through and caused the novel to loose some of its romantic charm. Though in theory a romantic novel it is lost in the groups escapdes with different individuals. A truly depressing tale told by Jake, the nararator, is a twist through his strugle to find his masculinity while on his wilderness excursions. To read this book one must have a stout stomach and enjoy the unexpected."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This early peice of Hemingway's work captures the very essence of Hemingway's fame as a writer. In &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; Hemingway utilizes a simplisitic, humble, more comprehendable method of writing. Which in my opinion is the method that gave this writer his fame. Yet, even though his writing style in this novel is simple, there is a lot if depth and meaning that lies within the words. A lot of significant symbols are captured in this novel. This novel critically depicts the emotional power that women have over men, whether people believe it or not. Because of this one woman, Brett Ashly, the lives of such men like Jake, Robert Cohn, and Bill drastically change. This novel also relates realisticaly to &quot;real&quot; lifestyles. For instance, there is drinking (alocoholism), partying, and sexual content(namely prostitution)...all explicit aspects of real life. This book relates to me because it's content is so real, there is not the normal love story, where a woman falls in love with a man and the end. The love story is actually quite twisted, and this is what makes this novel so unique. Once again, by far Hemingway's best work.Grade: B"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemingway captures the disillusionment of a generation jilted by the Great War. He captures the nuances, feel, and attitude of this &quot;Lost Generation.&quot; This is a piece which captures the mind set of a people after the most signifigant event in modern history. But this is not just a chronicle. Hemingway's sentences are so simple yet when deciphered (even blurbs of dialouge that don't play with the scene or theme) we come to realize earthly truths from every color of the spectrum of life."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"One of the most striking features of this novel is the bland superficiality of the characters. I found that I did not particularly like any of them, and that dampened my appreciation of the story.The book is about a sort of competition for the lady Brett Ashley. She enjoys using men as her playtoys and delights in their chase after her. The persona from whose point of view the story is told is Jake Barnes. The rest of the characters are unremarkable and are mostly only memorable for their blandness.We go from France to the bullfighting performances in Spain &amp; there are fascinating allusions to the matador / bull relationship being akin to courtship and sexual intercourse between a man and woman. Images of impotence and castration abound and are made all the more significant as Jake can no longer sexually &quot;perform&quot; due to a wartime injury.This book is certainly not for everyone. I am glad I read it &amp; would recommend it as an important 20th century literary work (even though I did not especially enjoy it myself). It is not so different from the apathetic landscape of T.S. Eliot's poem &quot;The Wasteland&quot;; a world in which it is thought that feeling nothing at all is preferable to feeling pain. But nothing could be more horrifying than a notion such as that...."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"These characters' personas must have been exactly what Gertrude Stein had in mind when she coined the term &quot;Lost Generation.&quot; Especially Lady Brett Ashley fits this mold of a woman who has lost her idealism and has saught refuge in a pretend world of alcohol-inspred giggles.

It contrasts starkly with his last novel with only two human characters and one animal protagonist/antagonist (The Old Man and The Sea). It narrates the story of aimless young men and women touring France and Spain. The narrator is the observer of his friends destinies. All are in love with a flirtatious girl, but the most unlikely one (the narrator) wins in the end. This novel is beautiful for its picturesque descriptions of countryside and bull-fighting."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"When I first read this book around ten years ago I was struck at the outset by Hemingway's reference to W H Hudson's 'The Purple Land'. This was just a coincidence to me as Hudson is one of my favourite authors.I partially enjoyed the novel for its open easy-to-read style, but there was too much drinking in it for me (written in prohibition years?), and bull-fighting is not at all to my liking. I'm also not that comfortable with women who - despite regret later on - realise they have treated some men of their acquaintance particularly badly. But the mystery of what happened to Jake (ever so 'funny' but causing him to cry himself to sleep) and why it keeps he and Brett apart is so tantalising. The coincidental reflection in the clinging of Robert Cohn to Brett adds significant pathos.And now I read the novel again and there is another author mentioned midway through - a name that meant nothing to me on my first reading - Ivan Turgenev. This is getting to be too much of a coincidence!! Anyone who has read my reviews of the last year will have noticed that I have recently 'discovered' Turgenev and was very moved by the four novels that I read in fairly quick succession. And in Turgenev - but structured completely differently (Russian eyes compared to Western eyes?) - we find this same separation of men and women who perhaps never should have been separated.Now there is another book I simply must read - it will be my second Hemingway novel. Apparently he wrote a novel called 'The Torrents of Spring.' Strange really, as one of the Turgenev novels I read was called 'Spring Torrents'!!!other recommended books:'First Love' - I Turgenev'Spring Torrents' - I Turgenev'The Purple Land' - W H Hudson'Long Ago and Far Away' - W H Hudson'Under Western Eyes' - Joseph Conrad"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This was the first Hemingway book I'd ever picked up, and to best review it, I should compare it to another famous book that came out about a year earlier: The Great Gatsby.No contest.On the surface both books deal with the rich and spoiled, but there is one thing that seperates the books. And, frankly, it's a very large thing.Talent. Skill. Hemingway had an enormous amount of it, and Fitzgerald a bit less. Fitzgerald is like one of those radio stations that plays classical music. Boring as ... to most of us, but for a few cultured ones his prose soars and lifts the spirit. Hemingway, on the other hand, writes with a deceptive simplicity. Short, powerful sentences that seem to draw you deeper and deeper into the story or novel.I cared about the people in The Sun Also Rises. And the description of their fishing trip is worth the price of admission in and of itself.Give Hemingway a shot. After all, he only wrote 6 novels while he was alive--not counting the 4 published after he died--and 4 of them are considered all time classics.

'sar' is as beautiful as otis redding singing &quot;you left the water running&quot; and that cannot be summed up by saying its about one man whose girlf left the water on! the emotional power comes out through something more, perhaps something personal to you. and in some sense the lack of any great overacrhing commentray in 'sar' is its point; hemingway cant express whatever there is to express because of the horror! the horror! &amp; stoicism, its all underneath, iceberg etc, 9/10 underneath surface....look for the gaps. alll i know is that th' book meant as much to me as hearing bob dylan or elvis or al green or seeing the godfather for the first time or whatever. dont be misled by my email address either, yes i like hemingway but not that much that i cant criticse him (&quot;across the river and into the trees&quot; is total crap)..."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemingway's genius was firmly rooted in what was not written more than what was. One of the most truthful first-person accounts ever (and quite autobiographical at that), this is living prose. The narrator conveys what he wants us to know, not caring to ponderously examine every tidbit of his life to somehow reveal the 'truth'. Through this Hemingway more clearly defines his main character than he ever could through writing."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I was recommended this book because I had experienced the Fiesta de San Fermin in Pamplona myself. And there's no doubt, Hemingway really captured the experience. Hemingway is a master craftsman, an innovator, a wonderful wordsmith. He can create an entire scene in your mind or make your mouth water just in his short little sentences. His terse prose conveys perfectly the daze in which the &quot;Lost Generation&quot; lived But to be perfectly honest, all that being said, nothing much happens in this book.This may be the point. In fact, I'm sure it is, being that he wants to convey a group of people with empty lives. And I'm sure the book will go down in literary history as a great work. But I couldn't give The Sun Also Rises the highest ranking, because quite simply, there are books that are more fun to read. Books that you don't simply appreciate, like I did this one, but books that you leave and breathe, becoming completely absorbed into the world and events that the author has created. For all its merits, and there are many, The Sun Also Rises was a book that I COULD put down."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Several self-centered ugly Americans get drunk repeatedly in Parisian and Spanish locales. This novel maybe might have been 2 good short stories, one about fly fishing in Spain, one about the running of the bulls and the bullfight--those parts were lovely, but the characters and plot were boring and pointless, and worse, ugly. Perhaps the novel had more of a shock value in 1927 with the descriptions of promiscuity by an English lady and the drunkenness of the characters, but unfortunately all of our cities,d suburbs, TV sets and movies are filled with adolescents doing the same things. The later works and the Nick Adams stories are so much better than this. I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Because if you do, you won't be able to stop laughing. I made the serious, serious mistake of reading Boston's November 29, 1998 review before I read the book, and so when I finally did read it I noted every time &quot;drink,&quot; &quot;wine,&quot; &quot;bottle,&quot; &quot;bar,&quot; &quot;cafe,&quot; &quot;coffee,&quot; &quot;breakfast,&quot; &quot;lunch,&quot; &quot;dinner&quot; and their variations appeared, and son of a gun if they really weren't on almost every page. Every time I came across one of the words I'd start laughing, making it very difficult to concentrate on the book, which is mainly an extended low-level whine about how screwed up everyone was after the Great War.Seriously, Hemingway shows some flashes of brilliance, but ironically for me they didn't occur with style or even theme, but rather with extremely vivid, stripped down descriptions of the Spanish countryside and such activities as fishing and bullfighting. If you want to read the book for that, you're not going to be disappointed. But if you're expecting action and character development, por el amor de Dios, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"this is the worst audio book i have ever listened to. william hurt is a well-known actor but doesn't know how to read. he reads this book as if he is just learning how to read. he pauses every other word. hemingway perfected a spare stripped down style that made his writing revolutionary. hurt's reading is the opposite. caveat emptor."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I read this novel roughly six years ago, and found recently I couldn't remember anything about it whatsoever. So, being the borderline compulsive reader I am, I instantly picked it up and read it again. I think perhaps the reason the story didn't stick out to me much from those years ago is because there isn't much of a story to speak of. I realize Hemingway is a master of American literature and is revered by legions, but I simply am not impressed with The Sun Also Rises. Our characters are disillusioned members of the Lost Generation, those people who experienced WWI, and residing as expatriates who enjoy the many lavishes of France and Spain. I admit, this could be quite an interesting premise, and although the bullfighting sequences are exciting near the end of the novel, the rest of it is not much more than a lot of arguing and drinking. They discuss, they drink, they eat, they argue, they move to another caf&eacute;, they drink, they eat. And so on.I've studied Hemingway. I know the accolades he received for an evolving style and for changing the way many people look at prose. I understand he stripped away a great deal of fluff in order to get to the core of his subjects. I know all this. I'm afraid it does not change my opinion.Jack Barnes, our narrator, and Brett Ashely, the lady friend he loves, simply did not illicit any sort of emotional response from me, nor did their story.~Scott William Foley, author of Souls Triumphant"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest Hemingway's classic novel explores the dissipated lives of expatriates in Europe in the years following WWI, most notably the ill-fated pair of Jake Barnes, who suffers from an emasculating war wound, and Lady Brett Ashley, the beautiful woman who entrances every man she meets but shares emotional intimacy only with Jake.We are treated to the caf&eacute; lifestyle of the Lost Generation in Paris, followed by a trip to Pamplona to witness the running of the bulls, all of it liberally lubricated by alcohol. But despite the nearly non-stop pleasure-seeking, there is very little joy for the characters in this book. It all has the feel of a party that has gone on too long; the party-goers become irritated with each other because they should have all gone back to their \\"real\\" lives long ago. Unfortunately, they are not sure what their real lives should consist of, so they grasp at temporary relationships that always end badly, leaving them ever more jaded and unsatisfied. This is dramatized powerfully by the cloud of men buzzing around the lovely and charming Brett, who abandons each in turn when the threat of physical and emotional intimacy becomes too great. It is Jake's inability to perform the physical act of love that enables their extended emotional connection, making him the person she turns to after each failed affair. I suspect that if Jake were not wounded as he is, she would flee from him as well, and the final paragraphs of the novel make it clear that Jake thinks so, too.If there are few pleasures for the characters, there are many for the reader. In addition to Hemingway's masterful depiction of character, the novel works as a travelogue, particularly in his wonderful evocation of Spain. This novel is rightly considered to be a classic."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"It seems that most people read these books as a part of high school. I never read anything until a year ago when I picked up a copy of The Old Man and the Sea, which I liked. This year a friend of mine was sent ten copies of this by the publisher as a gift. Who am I to refuse?Hemingway, I think, is one of our national treasures for a number of reasons. Obviously, his sense of journalistic integrity helped him become the novelist that he is. But this book isn't just good because of the style. Hemingway also has a knack for choosing to write about things that are inherently wrenching and interesting.The story, essentially about a man castrated by the war and his doomed half-love for a slutty, spoiled ex-girlfriend, is backgrounded by a vacation in Spain, where Jake, the main character, and his friends go fishing before the fiesta of the running of the bulls. The drama behind this intimate almost-love-affair is what really puts this book over the top and where it becomes a masterpiece. The descriptions of Spain, of water, of simple pleasures, of bullfighting, of eating, of getting drunk, of fighting, of swimming, are almost grotesquely beautiful; they will turn your heart over.When it comes down to it, however, it's clear that Hemingway made an intelligent, clear stance. He's not just a writer, he's a master; and his writing style is one that he chose because he understood both that he was gifted with an incomparable grace and how to manage its effects to their most extreme. To quote him:\\"She saw how close Romero always worked to the bull, and I pointed out to her the tricks the other bullfighters used to make it look as theough they were working closely . . . Romero's bullfighting gave real emotion, because he kept the absolute purity of the line in his movements and always quietly and calmly let the horns pass him close each time. He did not have to emphasize their closeness . . . Romero had the old thing, the holding of his purity of line through the maximum of exposure, while he dominated the bull by making him realize he was unattainable, while he prepared him for the killing.\\""},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"As a young man I took the opportunity of a lifetime to spend a year living and traveling abroad in Spain. Upon making this life altering choice, I began researching what novels I could read that could give me a glimpse into spanish culture--enter \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" by Ernest Hemingway. At that point in my young life, I had never read any of Hemingway's works; since reading this, I've read the majority of his other works which, while mostly they were well written and enjoyable, no other book I've read, Hemingway or other, has had the same impact on me as \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\"Many reviews will break down the story line and interpretations of the relationships in the book, what I can say to you is that I am a mid-twenties male, married with a daughter, I love travel and sport, enjoy good wines, used to enjoy partying a bit too much, and am a bit of a guy's guy, and this is hands down the best book I've ever read. My home library is not as extensive as I'd like to say, but I have began collecting this fantastic novel in as many editions as possible, simply because each year when I open the front cover, I know that I'm going to be gripped just as tightly by the story as I was that first time.It's a simple read, and a quick one.

It was only finding myself out of town without a book that I snatched up my high school son's edition of The Sun Also Rises.This is a very well written, relatively short novel which takes about five hours to finish at a leisurely pace. I must say, that for the first 50 pages or so, I was not impressed. Not a whole lot going on and what was happening didn't exactly get the heart racing. As the characters in the book relocated from Paris to Pamplona, however, I started to become engrossed in the story. I found myself reading later into the night, not feeling sleepy at all and not wanted to leave the story.The novel follows a group of American and British expatriates in the interwar years (1920s) as they loll around and party their way through France and into Spain for the Festival of San Fermin in Pamplona. The characters are predominantly alcohol soaked wastrels whose life consists of drinking, eating, drinking, passing out, drinking, going to bull fights, drinking, eating, passing out, drinking and doing a little fishing on the side.It is a tribute to the beautiful, highly descriptive writing of Hemingway that such a backdrop can be crafted into an entertaining read, but I must say he pulls it off. This novel has certainly motivated me to read more Hemingway."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"It's difficult to review a writer like Hemingway. So often imitated, so often parodied, he practically reads like a parody of himself. One must constantly keep in mind that this guy was the original, that his distinctive style and unmoored narrative were something unique back in the day.To talk around things too big to say--that's another Hemingway hallmark, and in *The Sun Also Rises* the thing too big to say is World War I and the devastating effect it had on its survivors, in this instance, the characters in this novel. The war is alluded to so obliquely that its importance in fully understanding this book may elude altogether those unfamiliar with the psychic cataclysm it caused in society after 1918. At the time, Hemingway didn't need to talk about the war directly; his readers would have recognized its presence in the shell-shocked attitude of his characters immediately. Hemingway's people advance through a series of alcohol-fueled encounters with each other, speaking elliptically, insulting, apologizing, coming to blows even--it's all one unending bender punctuated by fishing and bull-fights.Jake, wounded in the war, has been rendered impotent--a kind of walking joke and metaphor that's none too funny. Brett is an alcoholic nymphomaniac who may ((or may not)) be driven to self-destructive excess by the inability to consummate her love for Jake. In effect, Jake is the wise, passive, philosophical eunuch at the center of this expatriate circle of friends. He is the mediating buffer between Brett's lovers, keeping the party going, as it were, defusing the potentially explosive passions around him when they don't simply fizzle out from sheer exhaustion.By the end of the novel, carried along by the precision of Hemingway's prose, caught up in the ennui-inducing cadences you tend to forget the imitations and parodies that have all but rendered his style a hardboiled clich&eacute;. Perhaps it'll take a long while still before Hemingway can be \\"rediscovered\\" and fully appreciated again for the master that he is. But even now the boredom, futility, and impotent despair that weighs so heavily upon the characters of *The Sun Also Rises* can be felt today; indeed it's still an enormous part of our psychic landscape nearly a hundred years later.If its not there already, this is a book to put on your short-list of must-read 20th century literary novels."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises turned out to be quite a remarkable read and a novel worthy of classic status. It is absolutely amazing how much symbolism and hidden meaning Hemingway can sneak in through his distinctive clear and simple prose style. On the other hand, if you are not paying attention and miss the implied messages then this novel will strike you as nothing particularly special.The book is about a group of American and English expatriates residing in Paris during the 1920s. They live aimless, purposeless lives after World War I because their whole value system has been shaken up. They are members of the \\"Lost Generation\\", a term popularized by this very book. Although the plot is simplistic, with Jake Barnes and his friends traveling to Spain for the Pamplona fiesta, the brilliance of the novel shines through in the relationships and dialogue between characters. The rambunctious Lady Brett Ashley is the target of four men's desires and Hemingway uses her to exemplify the destructiveness of sex and the male insecurity felt after World War I. It is a world where everyone drowns their sorrows in alcohol. The novel ends in an outstanding description of a bull-fight and on a hopeful, wishing note.The novel opened my eyes to how drastic the effects of WWI were on soldiers and how disenchanted some of them became with prewar values and notions. I also was truly impressed by Hemingway's bullfighting descriptions and how he made them seem almost like poetic events. The characters were likable and compelling, too, and gave the novel much life even without an enchanting plot. Although I couldn't relate to the characters all that well, I'm sure someone who has had more of life's experiences will have no trouble doing so. Altogether, Hemingway created a novel that changed the literary world forever and will leave a lasting impression in many minds for generations to come - it sure did in mine."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is one of the most touching yet completely atypical love stories I've ever read. The two main characters love each other on all levels, but there is a tragic sexual gap which cannot be bridged. The narrator does not dwell on this point, in fact it is only mentioned a few times in passing, yet it is a central piece in the novel which dominates the relationships of everyone in the book."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway is a great novel that describes the life of Jake Barnes. Jake was a soldier in World War One and is now living out the rest of his life in France and Spain. Hemingway wrote this book as a critique on the lives of people in post World War One society. He describes the lives of the Lost Generation, those who fought and lived through the horrors of World War One. This review describes the background for The Sun Also Rises, summarizes the main points, and discusses the overall effect The Sun Also Rises has.Hemingway wrote this book between 1924 and 1926, a few years after World War One ended. Many World War One Veterans came back from the war disillusioned. Life lost most of its purpose for the veterans after seeing so many die in such a brutal fashion. Hemingway is commenting on how World War One changed these people's lives for the worse. He does this through describing the lives of Jake and his friends.The book opens with Jake and his friends living their lives like normal. They are writers living in Paris. Jake says, \\"Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocks and myself. Braddocks was his literary friend\\" (5). Then Robert, Jake, and their friends Mike, Bill, and Brett travel to Pamplona, Spain to join in the fiesta of San Fermin. During the fiesta things start to go wrong for the friends. Everyone is drinking nonstop and this makes disagreements come to the front. Brett and Mike are engaged to be married but Robert Cohn wants to marry Brett, this conflict ends in a fight between Robert, Jake, and Mike. This happened during an argument, Jake describes, \\"I swung at him and he ducked. I saw his face duck sideways in the light. He hit me\\" (191). Near the end Brett ends up running off with a bullfighter named Pedro Romero. However, there is still more to the story in which you will have to read to find out how it ends.This book does an excellent job of getting the point across that Hemingway was trying to convey. Hemingway does an amazing job of showing how terrible life is for the Lost Generation. The war has completely ruined Jake's life. Jake and Brett both love each other; however they cannot be together because of a war wound Jake received. At the end Brett says, \\"Oh, Jake, we could have had such a damned good time together\\" (247). Had Jake not been injured in the war he could have lived a happy life with Brett. Instead he just passes the time, either drunk or alone. After the fiesta of San Fermin, Jake went off by himself. He did not wish to stay with his friends. Instead his philosophy was \\"If you want people to like you you have only to spend a little money. I spent a little money and the waiter liked me\\" (233). He did not need true friends; people who were nice to him were all he wanted. Life had no purpose for Jake; he was just letting the days pass him by.Ernest Hemingway's book The Sun Also Rises is set in the decade after World War One, describes Jake's life, and does a great job of critiquing the lives of the Lost Generation. This is a great book that everyone should read. It does a good job of describing the impacts of war on the soldiers. This is definitely one of Hemingway's best novels and deserves to be read and remembered for years to come."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Despite little plot and characters we never feel like we completely know, this is a remarkable book. Its strengths lie in Hemmingway's clear, spare use of language, and in his ability to create a sense of place. A few thoughts...I've read that this book is semi-autobiographical. If that is true, Hemmingway seems to be revealing considerable self-loathing, even at this early stage in his career. He was certainly capable of creating more noble characters than these!The alcohol consumption by the characters in this book is truly impressive. I vacillated between wanting to go to Spain and stay drunk, and wanting to never drink again. Brett also takes a lot of baths, but with her lifestyle, it's probably not a bad idea.Along with a sense of place, this book gives us a sense of time. When but the 1920's could this group travel around Europe seemingly endlessly, never working but yet living quite well, despite frequent references to their lack of money? If this novel were set in the present, Brett would be in treatment for sex addiction (and probably a few STDs as well), Romero would be battling PETA, Mike would be on a liver-transplant list, and Jake would be a spokesman for Viagra."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Over about the past 30 years, I have trekked thru just about all the Hemingway oevrue, including the usually panned posthumous works. Yes, there are some great moments here, especially the very last line, if you can get that far. The journeys thru Spain, the bullfights, the semi-deadened characters, some beautiful set pieces make this worthwhile, but in the end it becomes practicaly one drunken/eating escapade after the other.Sure the writing at times is beautiful. As someone else says here,and I agree, THE GREAT GATSBY is better written,more timeless, and about America then and now. As for 1920's expatriots in Paris, Hem's much later collection, A MOVABLE FEAST is, I think ,far superior,witty and amusing, and you can tell simply by the title, not desolate like this one. Still, SUN ALSO RISES has a lot to say,believable characters, and characterizations,despite the seemingly neverending alcoholic binges. It's just not the great writer's best.Perhaps that's to be expected, given that he wrote this at about age 26!!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" was first published in 1926, and it was the novel that launched the career of young Hemingway. An amazing career that should include winning the Nobel Prize in Literature, and earn the praise as one of the greatest American writers ever.\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" was my third novel by Hemingway, (the two other being \\"For whom the Bell tolls\\" and \\"The old man and the sea\\"). After reading some of the reviews here, I find that either you love this novel (and Hemingway) or you don't. But even if you don't particularly care for Hemingway, I think there are things in \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" that you could enjoy, be it bull fights or Paris in the 20'ies.I have to confess that I only started reading Hemingway last year, yet he's become one of my very favorite authors. I love his spare, almost brutally economic writing style. Hemingway uses such a simple language, yet one feels it as the richest ever.The setting of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is in Paris in the 1920'ies. A bunch of rich kids, American and British expatriates, (\\"the lost generation\\") who fought in WWI, are now doing little but strolling around the streets of Paris, looking for a nice restaurant to eat and drink, or attending the \\"occasional\\" party. If they are not clubbing/partying, they are traveling around. What a nice life!Hemingway lived for many years in Paris and also spent much time in Pamplona, Spain, which of course has contributed to the spot-on accurate, realistic account both geographically, and also from the life of expatriates and social events happening.This is a classic masterpiece, ready to be re-read anytime!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Everytime I read a novel by Hemingway I enjoy it. I came to &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; expecting the same satisfaction. But I was wrong. &quot;The Sun&quot; is even better! Hemingway captures the voice of his characters through dialogue brilliantly. His sensitive portrayal of Jake Barnes, I'm thinking of the fishing scene, which conveys his loneliness, of the way he takes his friends to Pamplona to try to share his passion for bullfighting, his thwarted love for Brett. I would highly recommend this book for new-comers to Hemingway or those well read in the Papa-genre."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I have a great deal of respect for writers who can produce great literature composed of simple language. Hemingway has always been one of those authors who I've held up to others as an exemplar of such writing, and I was surprised to find such an ordinary piece of work in Fiesta. His charcterisation, which is usually so deeply and thoughtfully evoked by memoir and circumstance,is flat and unmotivated in Fiesta. The plot is weak, the drama shallow and the interpersonal relationships are at best puzzling.If this is your first encounter with Hemingway, don't give up - &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;, &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; and &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; are all magnificent, and EMH deserves his reputation as one of this century's greatest authors."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"So, yeah.. I read The Sun Also Rises.. twice. I even watched the movie. There is nothing interesting here. His prose plods along. His characters say 'extroadinary' things. They drink. They are 'just too much', they argue ..oh, well.No, I'll never get why people like Hemingway. What fascinates me about this book is how someone can take such interesting characters and paint them in such a dull manner. What can be done with this book? Do as Hemingway always said. Be practical, take a book like this and use it practically. Roll it up, ..wow! ..it's a small cricket bat or tennis racket! Yeah, maybe he'd like that!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I've read the book at least fifteen or so times in English, and at least five - in Russian, my native language. Of course, some of the incredible moments are lost in translation. Every time I read the book, I find more and more moments that interconnect the story, the bull-fight symbolism still intrigues and interests me. I'm 20, and I really believe the book has to be read more than once to be understood, digested, appreciated. My early impressions of Hemingway were not as high, but this book conquers me every time I open it. Read it; if you don't find it interesting, I don't know what would interest you at all."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"After 30 odd years I reread this and it was a whole new book and a frighteningly realistic one. More so then when I read it as a young man. Now, it is a sad and pathetic story about a bunch of drunks where not a page goes by that they are not having a drink, going to get a drink, or leaving the place where they just finished a drink. Without intending to, but with an innate, brutal honesty, Hemmingway describes the shrinking lives and fates of alcoholics."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I picked up an old copy of this Hemingway book at an antique mall for $4 or so, and was excited to read my first Hemingway novel. I'm a huge fan of classic literature and have read many books by Steinbeck, Dickens, and Bronte. I read half of this one and then one night threw it across the room, my patience at an end. Here's the first half of the book: \\"We had dinner and a few drinks. We went to a cafe and talked and had some drinks. We ate dinner and had a few drinks. Dinner. Drinks. More dinner. More drinks. We took a cab here (or there) in Paris and had some drinks, and maybe we danced and flirted and talked sh*t about somebody. More dinner. More drinks. I love you, I hate you, maybe you should come up to my room, no you can't.\\" What absolute boring nonesense. I can only pray for those who've stuck it out to the end that something meaningful happens. I flipped through the second half of the book a day or two later and saw the words \\"dinner\\" and \\"drinks\\" on nearly every page and figured it wasn't worth the risk. I really wanted to get into Hemingway, too, so much so that I suffered all the way through the first half before giving up. Perhaps I quit too soon, but there was nothing in the entire first half that made me want to continue reading. Nothing at all."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Just a book about a few friends hanging out and all the stuff that happens to them. No explosions. No crazy mysteries to solve. No car chases. No bombs to diffuse or world to save. No complex love triangles. It's all really rather mundane. It's basically Seinfeld/Entourage in the 1920s. It's a book about nothing.I love this book because it reminds me of my times with my friends--road trips, bars, clubs, hangovers, girl troubles, lazy summer days, etc. It's not the specific details in the book, but the interactions of the characters that strikes a familiar chord.This book is classic Hemingway: simple, but surprisingly rich and engaging. Like I said, it's a book about nothing, but as you turn that last page, you can't help but feel as though you've been hanging out with them all along. You don't want the road trip to end."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemingway's simplistic style is surprizingly hypnotic. It's subtle ride, gives way for the reader to use their own imagination into the heart and soul of the story."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Simply put, The Sun Also Rises is the story of a handful Parisian-based expat men who go on a trip to Spain to fish and enjoy the running of the bulls. (The anthropology of the bull-fighting is the most famous part of this book.) As classics go, this one has a high chance of disappointing: the tension in the novel, such as it is, comes from their all being in love with the same soon-to-be divorced Englishwoman, and if the characters change at all over the course of the novel, it's vanishingly subtle --- except they're all much closer to the day that a doctor diagnoses them with cirrhosis of the liver.Yeah, yeah, I know we're also supposed to genuflect before the icon of the great Revolutionary of Style, but in truth, Hemingway leaves me cold. The way everyone talks about how \`economical' his writing was makes him sound less like a writer and more like a home-front housewife who cleverly figured out how to stretch her family's ration coupons further. Take for instance this passage:>There were lighted bars and late open shops on each side of the street. We were sitting apart and we jolted close together going down the old street. Brett's hat was off. Her head was back. I saw her face in the lights from the open shops, then it was dark, then I saw her face clearly as we came out on the Avenue des Gobelins. The street was town up and men were working on the cartracks by the light of acetylene flares. Brett's face was white and the long line of her neck showed in the bright light of the flares. The street was dark again and I kissed her. Our lips were tight together and then she turned away and pressed against the corner of the seat, as far away as she could get. Her head was down.Say this out loud and it just sounds silly: you have the clumsy instances in which back-to-back sentences end with the same word (\`street' and then \`flares') plus the repetition of four-word sentences actually sounds wordy because you the reader have to stop and supply the missing connections. This writing might have played a key role in the evolution of fiction, but it can't, on its own, be said to be good writing, or even decent writing. And the clipping of words gets to be downright irritating in three-way conversations when you're not told who is speaking and the dialogue is so vague that the words are not obviously in the style of one person.The novel isn't all bad. Hemingway's style, for instance, can sometimes lend itself to capturing the essence of drunken conversation, and since everyone is always \`tight' in this novel --- in every scene you're told what they're drinking --- he gets a lot of chances to nail it. Two moments in particular stand out. One is in which a guy gets silly as his blood alcohol level increases and he makes an argument that ends with, \\"[The] Road to hell [is] paved with unstuffed dogs.\\" In context, this makes sense and for a moment the character seems like a warm and funny person. The second successfully inebriated moment is when the tension over the woman breaks above the surface and one drunk launches a relentless verbal attack on another man despite everyone telling him to shut up. The scene is brilliant, but it was too little too late: as I paused to absorb the scene, I glanced up to the top of the page and thought, \\"Page 146 and something is finally happening.\\"But what really sinks _The Sun Also Rises_ are the comparisons it begs. The novel fits into two saturated genres. Two vastly superior \`expats of Paris' novels are George Orwell's _Down and Out in London and Paris_ and Geoff Dyer's more recent _Paris Trance_ (and there's a lot in between). One could argue that novels like this have the benefit of having _The Sun Also Rises_ to draw upon. That's true, but it doesn't make Hemingway anymore fun to read and it doesn't hold water when talking about the other saturated genre this novel represents, namely, accounts of the Great War generation. In that case, F. Scott Fitzgerald's _The Beautiful and Damned_ dances circles around _The Sun Also Rises_, like Fred Astaire sensually gliding around a dumb fire hydrant. Ironically, Fitzgerald, who helped in the editing of _The Sun Also Rises_, would go on to die in obscurity while this novel began Hemingway's march to the Nobel Prize. Such is justice in the literary world."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Because if you do, you won't be able to stop laughing. I made the serious, serious mistake of reading Boston's November 29, 1998 review before I read the book, and so when I finally did read the book I noted every time \\"drink,\\" \\"wine,\\" \\"bottle,\\" \\"bar,\\" \\"cafe,\\" \\"coffee,\\" \\"breakfast,\\" \\"lunch,\\" \\"dinner\\" and their variations appeared, and son of a gun if they really weren't on almost every page. Every time I came across one of the words I'd start laughing, making it very difficult to concentrate on the book, which is mainly an extended low level whine about how screwed up everyone was after the Great War.Seriously, Hemingway shows some flashes of brilliance, but ironically for me they didn't occur with style or even theme, but rather with extremely vivid, stripped down descriptions of the Spanish countryside and such activities as fishing and bullfighting. If you want to read the book for that, you're not going to be disappointed. But if you're expecting action and character development, por el amor de Dios, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I had a difficult time getting into this book. It was not difficult to read and finish, but very difficult to have any feelings about or connections with the characters."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Wow, having not read a single Hemingway novel (I put him in the old and boring category), I read this one and was blown away. Nothing super-spectacular, just well-written characters that make you read on and on without caring about laundry or dinner or cleaning the house. I read for hours and didn't want to stop other than to sleep and then start again. Witty writing that made me laugh out loud, great detailed descriptions of foreign countries, and unbelievable emotion evoked from a few characters that you've met in some form during your life.

It is his best piece of longer fiction. His best work is his stories. When he goes on too much he gets to the bull, and the bull is often too much bull for what he really has to say.This is too the quintessential Hemingway. Jake Barnes is the wounded Hemingway hero who must act with the silence and dignity and not show his feelings'.He must not be like the Jewish Robert Cohn middleweight boxing champion of Princeton(Hemingway here displays the polite Anti- Semitism so common to his class in that time. Fitzgerald does the same in Meyer Wolfsheim world series scene in 'Gatsby') who cries and is sentimental, and thus violates the Hemingway code. \\"Grace under pressure\\" means admiring the bullighter who under pressure acts with the grace of minimum motion .It means for the code hero Barnes living his life with the same kind of emotional economy that the model bullfighter, sports hero , simple man of action does.The whole Hemingway myth of heroism is in this work including the beautiful aristocratic rich bitch Brett Ashley whose impossible love with Barnes is the ' romantic story heart ' of the work.My generation was raised to think of the Hemingway-twenties expatriate people as heroic forebearers. They seem to me now in the distance of time spoiled party-goers redeemed only by the masterful prose and perception of their creator. Hemingway read the Bible and out of it made a simple style of conjunctions. He made out of it a way of seeing and describing all his own. In doing this he did what most writers hope to do, and only a few can.Hem could really write, and he could really describe with a kind of poetic intensity the details of the world he was perceiving. Despite my great admiration for the Nick Adams' stories, and my sympathy for the ' wounded Hemingway hero ' and my love of a number of other great Hemingway stories I simply find the ' myth ' and the Hemingway hero , an artificial construction contradicted not only by the author's famous boasting and bragging within the work and without, but by the much more complex world of living real characters American expatriate, or not."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemingway is without a doubt my favorite fiction writer of the 20th century. I have never read an author whose style matches his. As his style, so his stories: unique and captivating. This novel presented a look at life that has now passed away. Why is this book good? Because Hemingway describes feelings that occur in everyones lives. Because Hemingway portrays so many personalities of society correctly. This story is about life and circumstances mold our lives.Cohn has been dominated most of his life. He attempts to escape that domination and is crushed. Boxing could not save him and neither could love. Mike lives a blissful life without care of money or whether he has any. He allows his temper to show, and it gets in the way of his happiness. Brett is a women who cannot be satisfied. She had a hard past, and cannot find happiness in the present. Barnes is the one in control of himself. He understands what he can and can't expect. He is one who enjoys life. Bill also understands life. They understand not to be caught up in what others think. They find people like themselves; people they can enjoy being around without making an effort.The talent of Hemingway is exhibited in The Sun Also Rises."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises was Hemingway's first full-length novel, and in it, he began to perfect the characteristics of what Philip Young would call the &quot;Hemingway hero.&quot; Jake Barnes is a profoundly and permanently wounded WWI veteran. The novel is about Jake's struggle to find a way to deal with his wound and the desire he has for the great love of his life, Brett Ashley. This is not Hemingway's best book, but Jake's struggle is heart-wrenching nonetheless. In this novel, Hemingway's &quot;iceberg technique&quot; is alive and well, which has led many readers to misunderstand Jake's wound and its implications. The Sun Also Rises should be read by anyone who values great literature. It is hard to believe that Hemingway was only 27 years old when this novel was published! A wonderful read by what I consider one of America's finest authors."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"After reading &quot;The Sun Also Rises,&quot; I think of how unnatural and ineffective Hemingway had sometimes been as a writer. When he is uninspired or just writing filler, his prose becomes monotonous and nearly unreadable. Brett and Cohn were the best-drawn characters while most of the others, including Jake, were nothing more than cardboards. However, the one fishing scene was absolutely vivid; there is no one better at writing about fishing than Hemingway. Oh well, he was a lot more versatile in &quot;A Farewell to Arms,&quot; which for me was his best book."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"While I must admit, it was difficult to grasp at first, once the prose captured my attention, there was no putting this book down. One understands Hemingway's gift when reading this book. It is filled with such beautiful language, and lyrical descriptions that sweep you from the heart of Paris to the mountains of Spain.Hemingway's first published work describes the ex-pat lifestyle in Paris exceedingly well. Having lived very near to where Jake, the main character lived, I could identify with his vivid descriptions he paints very well. His foray into Spain with his fellow ex-pats is also very vivid.Hemingway's descriptions are unmatched. While some may not particularly like his writing style, if you do, you are in for a treat.I feared that I would loathe this book as I had onced loathed another Hemingway, The Old Man and the Sea. However, that was not the case. The Sun Also Rises is a much more involved story, not quite as steeped in symbolism and weighted by lengthy descriptions.The Sun Also Rises is a fair balance of prose and description, settings and characters. If you've read other Hemingway and were not certain whether or not you liked it, try The Sun Also Rises. If you enjoy Hemingway, don't avoid this because it is his first novel, savor it.5/20/02"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I read this book and it made me fatasize about knowing the wonderful mind it's words were written from. I absolutley feel in love with Hemingway's style and work. I felt as if he were &quot;talking&quot; to me. The book is written in such a way that it makes you feel as if you are sitting in front of this interresting young man hearing of his day. It made me want to read more of his works and to read more of his life. I only wish the world were small enough for Hemingway's in our day in time."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" was apparently Hemingway's \\"breakthrough\\" novel, and for that I'm glad it's the first of his novels I decided to read.Hemingway uses a stripped-down, bare-bones approach when it comes to writing prose, and has a firm bite on the concept of less is more. Most of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is written in such a way as to eliminate background information on the characters, leaving the reader to discern what is important and what is not by reading between the lines.This book is touted as an examination of the \\"Lost Generation\\" of post WWI individuals. If \\"lost generation\\" means directionless, alienated, drunken miscreants, then Hemingway hits the nail right on the head. These characters are unlikable drunken slobs who exist for nothing more than to wander around and drink themselves stupid.We follow the lives of Jake, a writer of some sort who is mostly blue collar yet pals around with the \\"social elite\\". Brett is the rich lush who seems to sleep around with every chap she meets at one point or another. We also have Mike, Brett's supposed fianc&eacute;, and Cohn, the pathetic hanger-on. Every male character is in love with Brett on some level or another, probably because she behaves exactly like you'd expect a man would: drinks like a fish and likes it fast and loose.The story is very vague and muddled at times, although this was probably done on purpose. It wouldn't do to tell a story about directionless people and proceed to have them acting purposefully, now would it? The characters do little more than go on vacation to Spain to fish, watch the bullfights, and visit every damn bar in the country. Of course, aside from the fishing and bullfighting, visiting bars is what they do while not on vacation as well. It matters little what the players do, however, since it is their moody interactions with each other that sets the tone for the bulk of the novel.I'm not completely sold on this novel being a masterpiece as many have claimed. While it gave me a nice challenge to read, \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" also has ugly characters behaving in ugly ways. As much as the gritty delivery kept my attention, I found myself waiting for a flash of insight regarding the characters lifestyle choices or the world they live in that never came. There is nothing likeable about the goings on here, and for that I have to reduce my rating. The novel would rate 5 stars if I were ranking on style alone.Hemingway's economy of words makes him one of the most studied writers in history. Although \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is a relatively short novel, there are many conclusions to draw from it and a great deal of insight can be forthcoming should you choose to study it like many other readers have over the years."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I read this book twice, and I'm glad I did. I saw many things I didn't see the first time: the constant reminders and symbols of manhood and how Jake was not a \\"complete man\\"; how Jake and Brett are happier together than with anyone else; the streamline style of Hemingway--who is a master of \\"show don't tell\\". I could go on. If you read this book, read it twice. I was disappointed the first time, but delighted the second time."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also RisesThe Sun Also rises is no cliche love story where boy falls in love with girl,girl falls in love with boy, they get married and live happily ever after. In this sense the book is good. The author does not rely on cliche and has a unique writing style which carries the story forward with an interesting rhythm.The themes of the book seem to be love and money. Nothing out of the ordinary,but it is highly exaggerated and confused.In this book money is very important. Money brings friends, love and happiness.The more you spend money the happier and more loved you will be.Most of these expenses are frivolous. Mostly money is spent in bars, travel and \\"partying\\". Partying is also highly valued. Partying and wine or anything that can get you drunk.With all these priorities love is only a feeling in the background.Infatuation invokes attention more than any feelings of true love.True love rarely appears and is ignored when it does.This story took place mainly in France and in Spain. If you have never been in France or Spain this book eagerly attempts to show them to you, but in a stereotypical sense.Personally I did not like the book. I found it hard to relate to and the occasional phrases in French did not make it easier. Nothing much happens in the way of a plot either. There is a lot of dialogue which is hard to follow because it is hard to tell whose talking.

We should read this and remember the devasting effects war can have on a generation of young people.I also think that The Sun Also Rises, a timeless classic, no doubt.No other author could capture such a tragedy as elegently as hemmingway.

I'm just kidding.I thought The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway was an excellent story. Hemingway intergraded real life situations into the story making it easier for readers to relate to the book. Today there are people like Bill and Jake. Alcoholism is a big issue, just as it was then. Also, people still go traveling for leisure and partying to drink.Today there are still expatriates. Maybe not as much in the book for the same reason -maybe there is-, but in a I can say that there are a lot of people today who do because their profession causes them a LOT of frustration. Hemingway way showed his point of view in destructiveness through drinking and sex.Which is the reason why I like the book. Hemingway wasn't afraid to write about what was going on in society then.Another reason why I liked the Sun Also Rises is on how the relationships weren't clich&eacute;d. In the story, the characters constantly found themselves in doubt of one another. This can be found today, too. Is that person really my friend? Or are they just trying to be loyal? Does he/she like me? What signals are they sending me?To sum it all up, it's a great book.

I liked the nobleness of the main character who is cursed with all the feelings of a man, but is unable to pursue them because of his &quot;war injury.&quot; In this way, he becomes best friends with Lady Ashley, as there is no confusion of ulterior motives ... none of the messiness she experiences with her other men.The &quot;War&quot; is kept very much in the background, making it clear that these characters don't want to talk about it much, which suggests that it is too painful to talk about it. When it's mentioned, it's mentioned briefly and passingly. And yes, there is lots of drinking, lots of it, and they drink to celebrate, and drink to forget. I think the final scene, when Brett is talking, that it is clear they drink to forget their feelings and she doesn't want Jake to do that, to drink away his feelings. When they're drunk they are allowed to do almost anything they want, all in the name of drinking; they are allowed to turn rotten or belligerent.Mostly I loved the writing, which in this early novel is not fully realized yet by the young Hemingway, but it still powerful in its stark, poetic simplicity. Oh, he says more, and says it more elogently, than all but a handful of writers who take up pages describing what he does in one sentence. The dialog is sharp, witty, and true to life. I recommend this book for anyone who is serious about writing. If you're only looking for cheap entertainment, skip it."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"An extraordinary, mostly dialoged novel. We encounter with a young Hemingway who describes the life and splendor of the Spanish Fiesta thorughout his interesting and lostgeneration type of characters. A brutally realistic description of the bullfighting fiesta in Pamplona. A terrific display of the age of the Lost Generation, unrealized love, spiritual dissoulution and vanishing illusions."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I think &quot;Papa&quot; Hemingway is one of the most influential writers of our time. Yes, he is the master of prose. He makes you feel as if you are actually there with the characters. I have to agree with one of the comments made here by another reader:Pedro Romero is the real hero of the story. He choses to be a torero and nothing else. Brett truly is a &quot;whore&quot; and she has no direction. Thank God Romero was saved just in time and she had the sense to dump him and do himself and the reader a favor. I have been to Spain and I have walked the same steets in Pamplona as the characters. It is very inspirational. Overall the book was good aside from the excessive drinking, name calling and the so called &quot;Lady Ashely&quot;. This is one of &quot;Papa's&quot; greatest works."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I enjoyed the story, particularly after having been to Paris last summer. The emphasis on drinking is interesting during the age of American prohibition. I found the writing style to be most interesting: concise and bordering on too concise. I do not think that Hemingway's reputation as a great writer was made with this book alone, but I do now want to read For Whom The Bell Tolls."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This story is told mainly through dialogue, which made it hard for me to follow the plot. I don't remember ever reading in the book that Jake Brnes is impotent. I only realized the depth of this novel after reading the Cliff's Notes. I had to read in a place where I could devote all my concentration to the book so I could get the best possible understanding of it. This book does have a lot of thematic issues, though, and the reader really needs to think to be able to pick up on all of them. I would recommend that other readers of this book also get the Cliff's Notes. If you are good at figuring out a plot and themes from a story that is mainly dialogue, then this is a good book for you."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Get in touch with that hard edge of yourself, the tough deadpan we all romanticise. But then step back and revel in the fact that we're not the heroes of Hemingways work, we have to risk to get the finer rewards and his characters are all about playing it safe under the disguise of dangerous living. It is this subtext of the hidden side to Hemingway that lends a bittersweet taste to his breathtakingly stark writing. He wants the world to be this raw, this manly and cynical but you get the feeling he cannot help but acknowledge he is also just defending himself. It is this schizoid quality of defensive toughness that gives us the undertones of fragility and longing in the work of the consummate male. Look deeper as you go because it is this that raises old papa above his hack followers. Its not just all bravado. The only failing is that the messages he delivers are a little emprty in that we know they are delivered in a fashion we like."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is simply the best book I have ever read.

This is definitely a book that I would recommend to anyone interested in fine literature, as well as anyone looking to free their mind from the daily grind. Hemingway writes about the dreariness of everyday life, but somehow manages to take this life up to the next level, making it a paragon of escapism available to all who can pick up his books and simply lose themselves in them."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemmingway is terrific with dialouge. An extremely funny book and at the same time, it's sad."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Two recently read books prompted me to reread this book, The Paris Wife by Paula Mclain and Pat Conroy's My Reading Life. The former is the story of Hemingway's marriage to his first wife, Hadley, and their life together in Paris. The latter is an enjoyable and informative book about the people, authors, and experiences that influenced Conroy. Hemingway is one.The moment I began reading The Sun Also Rises, I remembered reading it in college. I didn't \\"get it\\" then, and although I now understand Hemingway's situation and the climate of the times a little better, I can't say that I LOVED the book. It could be because I kept wondering about Hadley, his faithful wife, and wondered what he was doing/thinking while she was in the shadows being supportive and encouraging. From The Paris Wife, I learned that she was hurt not to have been mentioned in even a slight way in this book.While I admire Hemingway's terse style and his extraordinary use of symbolism, I feel that this is more of a man's book. Jake, the main character, and his chums, including Lady Ashley, pal around together and do a lot of drinking, carousing, fishing, and watching bullfights. Everyone is in love with Lady Ashley, Brett, and also she's engaged to one of the men, she falls in lust with a young bullfighter, Romero, with whom she runs away. Jake ultimately rescues her, but before this time, there has been a lot of fighting and heartache related to this gal. All the men seem to be in love with Brett, and she seems to be in love with being happy.While the post war crowd appears to be intent on a hedonistic lifestyle, there is much more to The Sun than that. It has several universal themes woven throughout its pages including love, hurt, betrayal, the quest for meaning, loneliness, unrequited love, and the endurance of the human spirit despite all of the tragedies of war...and life itself."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"In Hemingway's classic Lost Generation trailblazer, the lifeless Jacob Barnes is a thirty something American living in post-World War I Europe. Barnes is an emotional desert, defeated by his physical injuries from the war and unable to please the love of his life, he sits idly by as the lovely Brett tramps about to both's unhappiness. His physiology goes unmentioned and begs the reader ask if his impotence is just a psychosomatic manifestation of a broken psyche. He and the other expatriates vamp around Europe and drink feverishly, reflecting their escapist desire for a never-to-be-found home-away-from-home.Otherwise inert, Jake lives vicariously through the Spanish bull fights. Perhaps he is unconsciously drawn to them by their symbolic significance - triumph of man's nature over his impulsive animality; perhaps by the likeness of the fight's rhythms to his own unrequited game of love; or simply by its reputably macho and morbid allure - a palpable conflict of life and death. Hemingway's own fascination with the sport may be gleaned from his Death in the Afternoon: \\"Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance is left to the fighter's honour.\\"In this work, Hemingway's emblematic prose embodies the aridness of his characters. It also serves to place a sharp focus on the story and on the characters, rather than on flowery and shallow language."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"fantastic book if you are an 'active participant'.Aside from a great portrait of the lost generation I think that Ernest Hemingway did a great job in exploring concepts such as life, love, nature, frienship and masculinity. So if you are an 'active participant' you will love this book."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I've seen some bad reviews of this book, and that just blows me away, because I find Hemingway's first big novel to be a brilliant ride that perfectly evokes the vibe and angst of the Lost Generation. It literally takes you for as trip along with a group of American and English expats as they journey from 1902s Paris to the gritty and brutal bullfights in Spain. The romantic side of the story features the flamboyant Lady Brett Ashley, who Jake Barnes is hopelessly besotted with. As a reader you can easily become immersed in Hemingway's distinctly vivid descriptions of both the romantic locales and violent bullfights, and with the characters' disillusionment, moral bankruptcy and unrequited love. It's got tragedy, romance and locations to die for--and language that lingers in your mind.Hemingway's pacing allows for you to really soak everything in, and forces you to pay attention to his beautiful prose. If a reader is used to speed reading and doesn't have a true appreciation for the language, they will find the book too slow. For those who really appreciate classic literature, you will find the prose stylish, detailed and beautiful. The characters are vibrant, charismatic and quirky, and it's amazing to see how they lived life to the fullest and indulged in debauchery so far back in the day.This book will inspire you to travel, specifically to Spain!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Full disclosure: I love Ernest Hemingway! I don't know why. My Late mother didn't care for him. She enjoyed F. Scot Fitzgerald. I don't so much. Both men wrote sparingly under Gertrude Stein's tutelage. Both men were part of the same expatriate crowd living in Paris after the conclusion of WW I. Hemingway and Fitzgerald both lived \\"the lost generation\\" lifestyle. Fitzgerald drowned in it; Hemingway left and grew as an important literary author until he could no longer write shortly before his suicide in 1961. He became as impotent as Jake Barnes suffering from not a physical malady but that of mental illness, probably Manic Depression Disorder. But his genius started with this book that was published in 1926.The dialogue is strong and compelling as he digs into the moral morasses of excessiveness of that shallow, drunken, and selfish crowd Hemingway belonged to. Jake's pain pierces our heart as he narrates the story. He is poetic. \\"Brett was damned good-looking. She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy's. She started that.\\" He can never make her happy as a man should, because a war injury left him physically unable. We flinch with him as Lady Brett flaunts both her fianc&eacute; and her affair with the beautiful matador in Spain. Both Jake and Cohn (the Jewish Boxer) can only watch her destruction through a drunken haze. They are powerless in their love for Lady Brett Ashley.But Brett is powerless in her love for Jake. She loves him wholly, but needs what Jake can't give her. They dance the bull fight; she is the matador luring Jake by wearing his love down and pierces his heart time after time. It is the price Jake and Brett must pay for wanting what can never be. They will always dance the matador's dance of death. Though they are truly in love, the pair can't help hurting one another. So, they drink and drink some more. And this tragic dance is beautiful in Hemingway's great novel."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"What you have to realize before picking up this book is that it is literary fiction -- that is, the focus of the novel is on character development and setting, rather than simple genre formats like romance, thriller, etc.That being said, The Sun Also Rises is a fantastic book. Many people hesitate to pick up classics from authors like Faulkner, Wolff, or Bronte because they are wordy or slow reads -- but Hemmingway is the exact opposite. Gone are long winded descriptions of characters and setting; the prose is stripped down the most minimal form. Yet the brevity of the sentences has a strange beauty, and the staccato prose is strung together into vivid imagery and realistic dialogue.The strength of this novel lies in its characters and their conversation. Their interactions continually push the story forward while giving value insight into the speaker's past.On the other hand, the novel starts off quite slowly, and it can be difficult to get past the first third. Once Jake leaves Paris and travels to Spain, the story becomes a bit more interesting. If you are looking for an action packed thriller or juicy romance, you won't find anything here. What you will find are a colorful set of characters, from great friends to bitter enemies. You become connected to Jake and his struggles with the elusive Brett, his un-acheivable love. You feel yourself in the colorful hills of Spain and in amongst the streets of Pamplona.If you can get past the slow start, and look at the beauty of what Hemmingway has created with such a different writing style, you will appreciate this book. Whether you are studying the writing itself, or just wan't to enjoy a classic, The Sun Also Rises will not dissapoint."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Jack Barnes is impotent, and Brett Ashley is a woman seeking her own self-destruction and those who dare come near her. \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is Hemingway's first book, and in my opinion I think it's his best. The writing is deceptively clear and simple, and the story is poignant and haunting.\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is ultimately a meditation on the tragedy of beauty (Brett Ashley), and the beauty of tragedy (bull-fighting). It's a book that like good wine only gets better with age."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest Hemingway's novel \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" creates a sense of passion in the reader's perspective by using dramatic emotion to portray the characters senses, while effectively creating a set that is believable and accurate. Hemingway uses alcohol in the novel, as a way to create this emotion and mix it with imagery that ranges from sharp to blurry to depict the scene. The different sets create a world that is realistic and yet free from the mundane. With bustling fiestas, to flowing streams and mountain valleys, Hemingway lures the reader into his own world of love and lost.The beginning of the story starts out with a character description of the self made man, Robert Cohn. It takes the first few chapters to really describe Cohn, but without them the reader would be lost later in the novel. The story then turns to the relationship between Jake and Brett, two main characters who have had a relationship in the past and still love each other. The passion that is seen between these characters is the main focus of the book, showing how two broken hearts deal with the pain in different ways. Whenever Brett is alone she goes to Jake and they put themselves through the pain all over again. However, when they are finished Brett runs off with another man when really she could only be happy with Jake. On the other hand, Jake uses alcohol to deal with his pain until Brett comes back to him. This is the only time that Jake feels like himself, when Brett is with him breaking his heart, or when he is completely drunk.Imagery becomes the focal point in Hemingway's settings by creating worlds and filling them with his experiences. He uses adjectives that make the reader feel as though they are a part of the scene, standing in the crowd amongst the people. Jake and Bill, another main character, take a detour before going to a fiesta to go on a fishing trip. The detail that was put into this scene makes it possible to see inside of Hemingway's mind, picking out what he wants the reader to experience. When someone reads this, who knows something about fishing such as myself, they will find that it is extremely accurate and descriptive, not to mention exciting and full of life. Hemingway turns scenes that would normally inform, and makes them into inspirational stories of success and grandeur.The last scene of the novel is a fiesta created by Hemingway to stir the senses of the reader. The detail that he puts into the party makes it seem like the reader is inside the story sitting at the bar with the characters. Unlike many other authors, Hemingway did not leave the reader out of anything, from drinking out of homemade wineskins, dancing in the streets, and the famous bullfights, he produced it on paper as a director produces a movie. Even the little things such as tables and chairs become objects of creativity, \\"The marble- topped tables and the white wicker chairs were gone, they were replaced by cast iron tables and severe folding chairs. The caf&eacute; was like a battleship stripped for action,\\" (Hemingway 153).The passion and creativity that Hemingway puts on paper creates a sense of emotion that enthralls the audience. The style that he preforms in the novel sets the stage for emotional build-ups and creative conclusions. The ability to include his reader in the novel is another plus to the totality of his creative talent. Hemingway's style creates such a vivid world that only the characters themselves know what they're missing."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises is, in my view, the best of Ernest Hemingway's novels. it is full of good humor, raucous characters and interesting events. it is upbeat and optimistic even in its downbeat moments. Unlike his later books there is none of the pending doom that foreshadows the action. The story centers around a small group of relatively young persons who start out in Paris and then go to see the bull fights in Pamplona, Spain. They drink a lot, argue a lot, and then drink some more. it is all good fun and sometimes sad. The dialogue is as good as it gets. If you haven't read anything by Hemingway, this is the place to start. If you have read some of his other works, but not this one, then you are missing something that should not be missed."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Literature is art and when we think of the visual arts or the performing arts a hallmark of great artistic works is the ability to revisit the work and gain something from it each time.

The novel is short; at only 251 pages, it can be read in a few hours (although you'll want to read it slowly, since Hemingway packs so much into each short, declarative sentence). Despite it's length, reading the book is like alternating between running through mud and running on pavement. Sometime the prose is captivating, but at other times it is frustrating to deal with such annoying characters. How can Robert Cohn be so spineless? Why can't Brett Ashley understand that she's leading these men on? What is Jake trying to get out of pursuing Brett?What I ended up enjoying most about the book, and contemplating for some time after, were the same things that annoyed me when reading. The characters are flawed, annoying, constantly giving in to emotion and self-indulgence, but these things make them real. I can compare them to people in my own life; I can imagine how these people actually are. Hemingway is able to successfully convey how these people are because he omits so much. If he described their appearances and antics with too much detail, they would become difficult to relate to, but by keeping them somewhat mysterious, like a new acquaintance, they become easier to understand and fit into what I know.Unfortunately I cannot comment on how \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" compares to his other works. What I can say is that this work is possibly Hemingway's most well-known work about his time in Paris in the 1920's and many people recommended that I start with it. Hemingway's understanding of people and character is enthralling and makes the book a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Great read, pages fly by.

He only writes about the things that are beautiful and important to him, without really getting into his feelings. He simply states the facts, but from the facts he chooses to reveal and thoes he doesn't, you understand his perspective. It's remarkably sparse that way. The book was published in 1926 and it does have a slightly old-fashioned style about it - the colloquialisms people use, the slower pace, the things Hemingway and his friends do for fun - but the perspective is ageless. The focus on human beings and their interactions, irrespective of social class, education, nationality, is poetic and universal.

Jake may be tacit in his narration, but the reader pieces together his frustrated feelings for Brett in a relationship that cannot be consummated, and her insatiable need to do just that by proxy with other men.In the background, the dispiritedness and displacement of Jake and his friends reflective of Americans like Hemingway who found themselves drifting in the post-war years searching for meaning in European cities (called \`The Lost Generation' by Gertrude Stein). This is a novel about love and loss, as much as it is a document of Paris in the 1920s."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I read a lot. Many of them are classics that I thoroughly enjoy. I have even read Hemingway and loved it. I couldn't finish this book.Their is more dialogue than anything else. The dialogue gets very confusing and repetitive. It seems unreal. I don't see real people talking that way. Now, that might be because I don't hang out with people who spend their lives in foreign countries and party every day and night.That's something else. All they do is drink, flirt, eat, and go to another party. They also insult each other and then are best friends. Maybe after I go through and read some analysis and commentary on it, I might enjoy it better. But I shouldn't have to do all that to enjoy a book.There are some that find this book outstanding. Great! Read on. This just wasn't for someone likes to read for enjoyment."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Rat-a-tat... Hemingway's prose comes out at a staccato pace in The Sun Also Rises. One can imagine black and white scenes of a 1930's or 1040's movies with an actors, Humphrey Bogart for instance clipped voice reading the dialogue:\\"I walked up the road and got out the two bottles of wine. They were cold. Moisture beaded on the bottles as I walked back on the trees. I spread the lunch on a newspaper, and uncorked the bottles and leaned the other against a tree. Bill came up drying his hands, his bag plump with ferns.\\"Let see that bottle,\\" he said. he pulled the cork, and tipped up the bottle and drank. \\"Whew!

I read it in the paper yesterday.\\"\\"No. Not really?\\"\\"Yes Bryan's dead.\\"\\"Gentlemen,\\" he said and unwrapped a drumstick from a piece of newspaper. \\"I reverse the order. For Bryan's sake. As a tribute to the Great commoner. First the chicken;then the egg.\\"Hemingway worked meticulously at crafting his writing, whittling it down to the bare essence and The Sun Also Rises his first novel is a perfect example of this there are no extra phrases and much is left to the readers imagination, even Jake Barnes war injury which left him impotent is rarely mentioned but always a integral part of the story. It is so stripped down that it is accessible to all with no need to get out the dictionary, although much is left for the reader to fill in.While Hemingway deftly crafts his characters, he does so with spare brush strokes, so much is left for the reader to fill in and life's experiences will shape how the reader perceives each. Essentially there are four major character Jake Barnes the impotent writer/journalist, Brett, Lady Ashley, the twice married dissolute thirty-five year old socialite, Mike Campbell, Brett's bankrupt fiance, Robert Cohn, a writer friend of Jake's, Bill Gorton another friend of Jake's who has recently arrived in Paris.Hemingway has taken a simple tale, with simple language of a journey to the running of the bulls in Pamplona and formed an intricate novel involving themes of masculinity, nature, religion and honor. Masculinity is always in the background of The Sun Also Rises. Jake and Bill rollick on the top of the bus drinking wine from bota bags held at an arms length with the Spanish laborers. Brett , the temptress, the siren plays the counterpoint to masculinity. All of the men are drawn to her even the nineteen year old Spanish bullfighter, Romero.As we learn the steers of Pamplona manage the bulls, it is the nature of things. We note the beautiful Spanish countryside, the changes that the travelers pass through on their journey south through Spain to Pamplona. We experience the cold water of the Itara river as Jake and Bill fish for trout. Nature is always an essential part of the novel and contrasted with the bars and bottegas where wine and liquor flow freely.One can't read The Sun Also Rises without some thought of anti-Semitism. Every time Robert Cohn enters the picture he is described as Jewish. The other characters constantly denigrate him, while the reader wonders what he has done to be so despised. He went off with Lady Brett on a trip previously and hopes to reenter the relationship. It seems this was badly presumptuous and in bad form.There have been numerous explanations and interpretations of this. The dismissive and portentous one, that it was commonplace of the literature of the time and so allowable. There is a biographic one, in which The Sun Also Rises is a retelling of Hemingway's own trip to Pamplona and his loss of friendship during this time with Harold Loeb and created Cohn as a way to even the score so to speak. There is the theory that of course, Hemingway was anti Semitic and there are countless others all of which quite frankly I do not understand. I do know however that when reading The Sun Also Rises the reader must come to terms with this. I'm not sure I am there yet."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"BesidesIslands in the StreamI have to say that The Sun Also Rises is my favorite Hemingway novel. Hemingway writes about love that can never be and does so with some of the best writing ever put to paper. The Story follows Jake Barnes, whose mysterious war injury has left him unable to procreate...and thus, he will never fulfill the one thing that his true love, Lady Ashley, needs.From the nighttime streets of Paris, to the noisy Fiestas of Spain, we travel with a group of rambunctious American ex-patriots across two countries. Fighting, lust, and drinking are the highlights of the novel. Hemingway's writing style is nothing short of spectacular. His words are full of imagery and life. From tales of dancing in a musty Paris nightclub to trout fishing in a crystal clear Spanish lake. Hemingway paints the settings perfectly, and the story that goes with it is heartbreaking and at the same time beautiful.5/5"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises is a book that everyone should read. In it, Hemingway focuses on the concept of love but in a very unique way. Hemingway uses his characters to portray love as a scary thing. He strongly supports his notions regarding love throughout the book.The book takes place in Paris and Spain. A group of friends travel to a small Spanish town for a fishing trip and to participate in the annual grand fiesta. The group consists of four men and one women. The women, named Brett, had some interesting ideas towards relationships. She creates conflict between the men and even between some newly found Spanish friends. It appears Brett creates conflict to avoid getting close to people. The drinking is endless, creating even more conflict between friends. Many relationships are ruined in a period of only a few days.The book is told from the first person perspective of a well off American writer named Jake, who lives and works in Paris. Hemingway uses Jake to tell the story of how some people lived during the early 1900's. I think Hemingway wrote this book to give a good, entertaining look into the lives of Europeans in the early 1900's. I also think something in his own life gave him the idea to write this book. He spent a portion of his life living in Paris; his experiences there could have contributed to the portrayal of events in The Sun Also Rises.Hemingway's style of writing through the dialogue of his characters makes this book suitable for all teens and adults. Hemingway never overstates conversation. There is a purpose in every word he writes, and it sounds like you could actually be talking to the character. Hemingway's idea of love was intriguing in that he describes it as complicated and unforgiving. In the future, this Hemingway presentation of love could change my opinions of other characters in other books.I would highly recommend this book to others for several reasons. First, I think everyone needs to read Hemingway to experience his unique writing style. It is brilliantly simple. Second, the ideas presented regarding love are intriguing. For example, Hemingway focuses on fear of love and suggests people don't always end up with their true love. Hemingway's portrayal of people's fear of relationships may help explain some reasons for divorce. For example, fi people tend to avoid the most meaningful relationships, the \\"lesser\\" relationships may be more likely to end in failure. Third, this book remains contemporary. Everyone who reads this book can find a connection to themselves or a family member. Indeed, Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises focuses on the many layered connections of his characters--I think those connections made this book easier and more fun to read.-By Hannah Hunsaker"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises is a fascinating novel. I can't believe I hadn't read it years earlier. The protagonist, Jake Barnes, is a tragic hero of sorts. He was wounded in WW1 and his injuries rendered him impotent. His injury deeply affected his psyche, and he is insecure about his masculinity as a result. The love of Jake's life is the beautiful Lady Brett Ashley, who cared for him during the war when he was wounded. She is a shallow woman, who cares for Jake, but will not commit to him because sex is very important to her. Instead Lady Brett spends her time with a variety of men. Jake, on the other hand, spends much of his time in Paris with his buddies, each drinking in cafes and wasting their lives.The activities that Jake and his buddies engaged in were really quite sad. They seemed like they never grew up, but instead their behavior was reflective of their wish to forget the horrors of the war. They wandered rather aimlessly, a highlight being the fiesta and bullfights in Pamplona where the group engages in more drinking, dancing and debauchery.This book was originally published in 1926, and its strength is definitely the style in which it was written. Hemingway's writing is sharp and insightful, and you feel every detail: the sight, sounds, the place. The characters, although flawed were sympathetic. I loved how he got into the psyche of the characters, helping the reader feel what their life was like, and why they made some of the decisions they did. I thought it was rather ironic that the title, \\"The Sun Also Rises\\", which to me symbolizes a new dawn, a new day, really had no significance for Jake and the other characters in this novel. Rather they never moved on with their lives, stuck in time, as a result of the past. Hemingway seemed to truly understand the struggles and challenges that life handed his characters, and for that matter -- each of us. Some individuals are made stronger by adversity, but others are not. In the end though, we rarely get everything we want in life -- do we?A Brilliant novel - Don't Miss It!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Understatement to declare this a classic. This work is so full of life and reflection! A great work that must be read in one's lifetime and no review can sustain more than the book provides.Seems obvious to me that Harry Crosby provided vast amounts of inspiration to the character development as well as others of the lost generation."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This was my first Hemingway and his first novel. Funny how things work out. I had just gone to Iraq for the first time when I read this, and I enjoyed it immensely. The prose literally knocked my socks off. The story is a strange one of love lost due to war-induced penile injury, but it is the writing that makes this special to me. I love this book."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"A beautiful book which I wouldn't mind reading again and again. The backdrops to this story - Paris and Spain are beautifully and evocatively described. Not that I am much of a bull-fight fan. To the contrary. But Hemingway's descriptions fit in the context, and make even someone who is against such barbaric pastimes like the book.There is a scene of Jake and his friend Bill fishing in a river in a village in Spain, leaving their bottles of wine in the cool stream for chilling. The way it's described makes me wish I was there (not fishing though!).I saw a few of the 1-star reviews here - most of them dislike the book because \\"nothing happens\\", \\"the characters lack morals and hence the book lack morals\\", \\"the characters are 2-dimensional\\" (I vehemently disagree with this last). I guess if you disagree with the moral standpoint (or lack thereof) of the book, then it's difficult to like the book.. this book is not for you if you believe in \\"one set of morals fit all\\".Yes, the book does describe a desultory lifestyle in which nothing much happens... but the poignancy of the unrequited love between Brett and Jake is palpable (I'm a sucker for love stories, though not necessarily tragic ones). He makes you like or hate the characters as he chooses - which is the whole point of a fiction writer, no?The descriptions of the bull-fights almost make you feel like you are right there watching. Don't read this book if those sort of gory details are disagreeable to you!If you are willing to suspend moral judgements, and read for the sake of immersing yourself in a different time and space, and sort of go with the flow, then this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"In \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" Ernest Hemingway tells of the experiences that Jake has with the other characters, doing things that are exciting and enjoying each other. Jake is friends with Robert Cohn, and Ernest Hemingway starts the book with a description of Robert. The book proceeds through a series of events to a pleasant resolution.The characters are developed well and characterized in various and interesting ways. The settings are described in detail that brings them vividly to the imagination. The plot keeps the reader interested with conflicts and resolutions along the way."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Surprisingly enough, I began this novel after reading Jay McInerney's Bright Lights, Big City. McInerney opens his urban odyssey with a brilliant (paraphrased) quote from The Sun Also Rises:\\"How did you go broke?\\" Bill asks.\\"Two ways,\\" Mike said. \\"Gradually and then suddenly.\\"A great read following say, a Farewell to Arms or In Our Time. The War may be over, but many personal battles are still being fought. The two main characters, I argue, are Jake Barnes, who narrates the novel and whose cynicism renders A Farewell to Arms Lt. Henry seem like Mister Rogers and Robert Cohn, whose description which screams him as a thinly veiled portrait of F. Scott Fitzgerald ushers in the opening of the novel. Why is the aforementioned Cohn such a central figure to this novel? I mean, here's a character who's generally disliked, he may be intelligent, ambitious, but his personality can best be described as cold, distant, and capricious. I believe that Hemingway is trying to come to terms with his relationship with F. Scott Fitzgerald, the other literary great, just as much as Hemingway's Jake Barnes is trying to come to terms with himself and his somewhat awkward disability.In retrospect, and after considerable reflection, I found The Sun Also Rises to be an \\"expose\\" of the duality of personality, with each character two characters in one, the outward personality we all utilize to some extent to hide the hidden psyche containing our insecurities and fears. We really cannot escape our worst enemy, ourselves, by perpetually running away, as the novel's centerpiece, The Expedition to Pamplona, is an excursion within an excursion, and even then the characters still have to face themselves and each other.Who could argue that Papa's prose is not as perfect as it could possibly be?"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is the first book I've read by Hemingway and now I can understand why this auther is nearly legendary. It was truely amazing in some subtle way that I can hardly define. Since reading this book, I've decided to read as much Hemingway as I can get my hands on and I only hope that his other works live up to this first taste I've had. Granted, the plot is quite basic, but the building tension between characters, and underlying pain of Jake pulled me in. I felt like I could relate to these people. Hell, I wanted to have a drink or two with them..."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Although some complain that the novel, &quot;The Sun Also Rises,&quot; by Ernest Hemingway is &quot;boring&quot; or has no plot, I believe that infact it's messages is somewhat elusive and takes a deep thinker to relate and understand why Hemingway wrote the way he did. Obviously his works are reflective of his life; this in itself is intereseting because it gives the reader and inside look into the life of one of the greatest writers of all time. Hemingway can be placed among the creme de la creme of &quot;Lost Generation&quot; writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and the like. The book accurately depicts life in post-World War I Paris, describing the scenery and attitudes of the expatriate writers and artists of the time. Each character has a story, which futher adds to the value of this book. The reader of this book must look deep within the words and not look for some dramatic plot or major happening to leave one breathless. But the reader should certainly appreciate this magnificent piece of prose, perhaps one of literature's greatest pieces of literature. As a High School student, I was required to read certain materials for my Advanced Placement English course, and I chose &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; to complete my requirement. And as a teenager, it can often times be quite difficult to reach young people on the level this book does, but Hemingway does it in such a powerful manner that the novel leaves the reader with a birds-eye view of the times. Kudos to Ernest Hemingway and I highly suggest this novel."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I have actually heard more than one person say that \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is their favorite book. I have no idea why they would say that. Maybe I just didn't \\"get it.\\"The novel revolves around five English-speaking expatriates who spend their time drinking and carousing their way from Paris to a festival in Pamplona. The four men in the group are all in love with the one woman to some extent. And the woman has affection of some type for each of the men.There is some humorous drunken dialogue from time to time. There are some good descriptions of bullfighting and trout fishing . Beyond that, there is not much to recommend \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\"There is very little story to be told. The book reads like the travel journal of a lovesick person that has been translated from another language into English. Perhaps it just hasn't aged as well as some of Hemingway's other work. \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" was lost on me."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"By utilizing his characters and their actions, Earnest Hemingway does an exceptional job at portraying the carefree, aimless life of the Lost Generation in The Sun Also Rises. Lady Brett Ashley represents women who are liberated, who have numerous admirers and sexual partners yet do not feel any compulsion to commit to them. Women like Brett are very independent and often utilize men to fulfill their necessities and empty, meaningless lives. Jake, Cohn, Mike, and Bill represent men of the 1920's who are psychologically and morally confused, and who drink, travel, and engage themselves in miscellaneous entertaining activities in order to escape from reality and their inner selves. None of the characters are happy with their dispositions, yet find means of suppressing and ignoring their feelings of un-fulfillment and misery exemplified very well by Jake's statement, \\"It was like certain dinners I remember from the war. There was much wine, an ignored tension, and a feeling of things coming that you could not prevent from happening. Under the wine I lost the disgusted feeling and was happy\\"(150).One prevalent theme, which intrigued me, is the power and destructiveness of sex. Due to an injury as a result of the war, Jake is left impotent and is therefore sorrowful, depressed, frustrated, and insecure. Knowing this, Brett shies away from a relationship with him, despite the fact that they mutually share strong feelings for one another. Additionally, her reckless sexuality invokes jealousy, bitter disputes, violence, and ultimately, the ruination of friendships. Ironically, I believe she is a victim herself of insatiable desire for pleasure, and by her charm and beauty. Although I cannot relate, I never failed to be captivated by her strength and the fierce drama of their senseless lives.I highly recommend this novel to those seeking to be entertained by a vividly painted and beautifully told story of a group of friends living their lives to the utmost extent in a time when it seems there are no consequences to one's actions, and where affection, purpose, and sincere happiness is almost non-existent."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"It has been said that Camus was deeply influenced by Hemingway's terse prose, which Camus employed in writing &quot;The Stranger&quot;. Having loved that novel, I was that much more impressed and satisfied when reading &quot;The Sun Also Rises.&quot;Hemingway's narrator, Jake, is less complex than the existential rebel in The Stranger. Jake simply enjoys his life, going from bar to bar, train to train, hotel to hotel. He is unattached to the moral implications of the way his friends treat Cohn, a pathetic and desperate man, who happens to be Jewish. He experiences an almost zen-like passivity in his affections for Brett, a bold and attractive woman, which only makes him more attractive and manly in the latter's eyes.Jake is somewhat of a less obvious and more appropriate existential man- because he is unattached to the idea of being detached, where as in The Stranger, Camus seems to continously make a point of his narrator's over abundance of detachment, to the point of seeming pro-active, which is a paradox.Of course, this novel is not an existential one, it is mostly a fine, beautifully written account of expatriates in France and Spain, saying things to each other without meaning that have so much meaning, classic Hemingway.Perhaps the best parts of the novel are the bullfighting scenes. For the first time, Jake narrates on moral terms, his tone changes, and all of a sudden, every little movement of the matador means so much to him. With Hemingway, less is always more, and we end up always wanting more, not because it is disappointing, but because it is so fine."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"There is a certain purity of language, a freshness of style present in The Sun Also Rises that is noticeably lacking in Hemingway's later works. As pointed out very capably by Mr. Mitchell in his earlier review, the plot of the novel itself is not likely to draw many readers, as the drunken revelry of the characters does tend to get a little old. Plus, I have my doubts that anyone can consistently consume as much booze as Jake Barnes, Lady Brett, and especially the &quot;hangers on&quot; did in this novel. Jake's fishing buddy Bill and Brett's fiance were in a state of inebriation virtually throughout the novel.Here the audio format works well, because listening to a good actor speak the words of a drunken character might be easier to endure than trying to read drunken dialogue.For me, the novel works in a number of ways. Hemingway clearly loved the subject matter, and I thought the beginning of the book, as did his later masterpiece A Moveable Feast, provided a fascinating glimpse of post-WWI Paris. Then, when Hemingway and his friend catch the train for Pamplona to go fly fishing and catch the bullfights, the book really takes off. Hem loved to fish and he loved bullfighting, and his enthusiasm for these sports clearly shines through. Every year someone gets gored in Pamplona during the running of the bulls, and until reading this book I could never discern why anyone would put themselves in that position. Jake Barnes is clearly a true fan and &quot;aficianado&quot; of bullfighting, and his narration points out the many subtle ways to distinguish between a true master, and an overrated matador trying to make it look dangerous while he remains out of harms way.All the while, Hemingway portrays a doomed romance between Jake and Brett, all the more painful for him since he has to watch one man after another follow her around and get caught in her web. The pathetic Robert Cohn is the most striking example, since the married Cohn sent his wife to England to visit &quot;friends&quot;, so that he could follow Brett around Paris and Spain like a wounded puppy after she makes the mistake of sleeping with him. Cohn is clearly an unwanted companion, and the blowups between him and Brett's fiance were memorable. I also loved the scene at a Paris cafe where Cohn's wife bitterly denounces Cohn for sending her off.In summary, this novel affords a real opportunity to see a good writer perfecting his craft. Hemingway hated phoniness in all things, bullfighting and writing among them, and for any serious student of twentieth century literature much time should be spent with this book. It is a pleasure to read (or listen to), and reveals more secrets each time you pick it up."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This was the most recent selection of my book club. I don't think I had read it before.It's a hard read. Nothing much happens, and the characters, except for Robert Cohn, are so repellant that it's hard to care about them. If you don't care about characters, you don't care what happens to them. The only character with any dimension is Robert Cohn, the idealistic outsider trying to get into the crowd and rebuffed at every turn.Hemingway's famous short choppy adjective-free style doesn't work well on dialogue because that's not how most people talk, so it's rather stilted, which contributes to the sense that you don't really know what the characters are about.However, in his defense, I must say that his narrative descriptions are superb. One would think that descriptions require adjectives, and here he does use them sparingly. So his style works beautifully as he describes the bus trip into Spain, the wonderful fishing expedition, and the bullfights. It's in those passages that the characters involved in them come to life - they are interested in something outside themselves, something other than when they can have their next drink, and it humanizes them. They aren't quite so one-dimensional in those passages.I know this was Hemingway's first big success, and probably gave an accurate portrayal of the ex-pat life of that time, but if this were all I knew of him, I would not be tempted to read others of his works. Fortunately, I have done so and enjoyed them much more."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I think I've read and reread this novel over 15 times through my own reading and teaching English. It's a key novel for any reading course because more than any other Hemingway novel, it's a book that teaches you how to read. Sure, his dialogue is inspired, his descriptions lean and elegant, but the genius of Hemingway lies in the silences and the gestures. What could say more than &quot;he looked down&quot; when Montoya realizes that Jake has betrayed him to Romero? Or when Jake squeezes Brett's hand in the car? This is the key to Hemingway's genius. In the honors 9th grade class I taught 2 years ago, 22 of my students voted it their favorite novel of the year (we read perhaps 7) by a landslide. It's not as easy a book as you would think, but it bears repeated reading and study. For my money, I think it's the greatest thing Hemingway ever wrote except perhaps some of his short stories like Indian Camp (which you should read for the great gesture of all time: he rolled over). When you read the story, you'll understand how it's the most important line, but one that's easy to miss."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"***This review may contain spoilers.***Deceptively, Hemingway's \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" (hereafter TSAR) seems like an \\"easy\\", \\"accessible\\" introduction for a literature novice. Of course, the language and dialogue are seemingly direct, plain, and unpretentious. The plot seems simple and even unsophisticated - at least five expatriates \\"live it up\\" on a languid road trip from Paris, France to Pamplona, Spain. You get a fine European country travelogue and intimate descriptions of bullfighting. You get fishing, casual love affairs, and even a clumsy fistfight. Sounds like a novel a college student could swallow in a day or two - even during Spring Break. Well, yes and no.If you are not acquainted at all with Hemingway's spare, naked prose, quite naturally TSAR seems like a pulp fiction novel about nothing. But if you are even superficially aware of the novel's milieu -post World War I Europe- you know enough to penetrate the surface of this simple story to see the sad, existential despair underneath. Each of the main characters, the first-person narrator and \\"emasculated\\" newspaperman Jake Barnes, the earnest Jewish pariah Robert Cohn, the insolvent, crude Mike Campbell, the fun lover Bill (forgot his last name), and especially the pathetic maneater \\"Lady\\" Brett Ashley ultimately lead empty, unfocused lives of both quiet and not-so-quiet desperation, and futilely try to fill that emptiness with food, sex, machismo, and especially drink (lots of drink). I think thats the predominant theme of TSAR - WWI shattered our past lofty illusions and placed us in terror of our mortality and there's nothing we can do to ensure a bright, safe future. We are doomed to oblivion, so in the meantime all we can do is \\"enjoy\\" this fleeting present as much as we can. This nihilist philosophy is strikingly similar to that of Norse mythology, except it does not spur TSAR's characters to perform heroic acts.Although of course the writing is not ornate in TSAR, it seems obsessed in describing so many things in closely-observed detail. We get specific descriptions of Parisian streets, Spanish countrysides, European cafes, the Pamplona corrals and bullfighting arenas. I think it is a deliberate distraction to underscore the inconsequentiality of Jake's and his friends' lives - just something to kill the time. Hemingway lavishes particular attention on the Pamplona fiesta, which lasts several days and is filled with noise, parades, fireworks, and of course the running of the bulls. Again, sound and fury signifying nothing. Sometimes the characters can't even enjoy the surroundings; on several occasions, for example, Jake is so hung over or tired or both, he misses some of the bull fights and has to get secondhand information from his companions (I hesitate to call them friends). The information is usually unvarying; either Mike can't pay his creditors, Robert Cohn is an unwanted pest, or Brett jilted yet another suitor. Too much information about nothing.TSAR will either inspire thoughts of empathy or schadenfreude within you. You may sympathize or even empathize with this frantically hedonistic crew, or (as I must confess I did) wax superior and relieved that my life, full of woes and cares as it is, is not that sad. Most of us may relate best with Jake, who is as dissolute as the rest but at least is aware of it. For example, he is in love with Brett but cannot consummate it because of his WWI wound. Toward the end of the novel, when Brett wires him for assistance and exclaims that they would have a grand life together if not for the wound, Jake replies \\"Isn't it pretty to think so.\\" Jake has no delusions.TSAR's overall tone is pessimistic and even bleak, but it has its sharp observations of humor, as when Mike states he has two types of bankruptcy - gradual and sudden. The characters' put downs of each other are amusing. Jake learns you have to buy friends and decides not to tip the train conductor more generously because he'll never see him again. The European descriptions are charming and may give you the urge to travel. But yet again, the point is it is all a superficial veneer. In conclusion, TSAR will be a fast but baffling read for unworldly people who will wonder what the fuss is all about, but for more mature, world-weary people, it will reveal the empty, present void beneath the busy surface."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is a response to some of the other reviews. You have to remember that there are such things as symbolism and metaphor in literature. Also, there is historical context to keep in mind when reading this novel. People who find this book boring are taking it at face value. Example, the bull fighting is not there just for entertainment, it is also a metaphor."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"For some reason Hemingway seems to be a target for cheap criticism; I guess his spare, masculine style is easy to mock. But 'The Sun Also Rises' is not only a great masterpiece by one of the 20th century's best and most innovative writers, it's also terrifically entertaining, funny, subtle and ironic. And here's a hint for those who complain that nothing happens in the book. There's this amazing thing you should find out about: it's called SUBTEXT."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest Hemingway. We've all heard about him. I never had cause to want to read any of his writing. My wife was assigned this with a college english course. I decided I'd read it. I checked out reviews here first. Most of them sounded as if they had copied and pasted a part of their own english course review here. What the instructor wanted to hear.Here's what I think. I enjoyed most of the book. The second half much better than the first. Was I blown away like I thought I would be? NO! Did I enjoy it enough to want to try some more, YES. Most of this book has the cast of characters bar hopping and talking, bad-mouthing, and generally treating each other like crap. That's the first half. The sceond half seems to slow down a little (not as much bar hoping/trash talking). More descriptive and more enjoyable, I thought. Enough to give the book a middle of the road review. I'm off now to try another Hemingway book. Probably \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\"."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Few books leave such lasting footprints on my memory. The Sun Also Rises is indeed one of those books. To some, it may seem that little really happens in the book; but it does. At the heart of the story, as someone already mentioned, Jake Barnes is impotent (castrated), yet he yearns to hook up with Brett Ashley. Of course, she knows his predicament and her ultimate decisions (and his) are based on that knowledge.Hemingway's most talked-about quality was his ability to characterize through dialogue. But some &quot;book doctors&quot; say that he uses too much of it and that his sense of balance between dialogue and narration is off-kilter. Sometimes I agree, but I'm usually so wrapped up in Hemingway's magic that I don't really notice.My favorite part of the book is the fishing trip that Barnes and Bill Gorton take prior to attending the festival in Spain. It made me want to dig out my rod and reel and take a vacation myself. The scene reminds me of Hemingway's story &quot;The Big Two-Hearted River,&quot; except that Barnes is not alone; he has Bill with him. I also enjoyed the scene in the bar when the Spaniards absorb the Americans into their group and share their wine with them. Indeed, alcohol plays an important role in The Sun Also Rises; a whole cast of down-and-out characters emerge who drift and drink through life as though nothing else matters.Hemingway is indeed my favorite writer and this book stands at the head of my list of all-time beloved novels."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Having visited Pamplona during the &quot;Running of the Bulls,&quot; this book has a little more added meaning for me. Nevertheless, the book should be enjoyed by most everyone who reads it. Don't buy it looking for action or adventure, it has very little. Knowledge of the Spanish countryside makes the book more enjoyable, but is definitely not a requirement. Anyway, it is a great story of Jake Barnes, an expatriate of the first world war, who seemingly just can't catch a break. He is injured in the war and is unable to perform sexually because of it. He is hopelessly in love with Lady Brett Ashley who is a nymphomaniac, for lack of a better term. he seems all alone because he can never have the one he loves and he struggles to find a meaning to all this nonsense happening around him. In truth he is trying to do what we all regularly do, find out what it's all about, life I mean. A superb novel. Adios mis companeros!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I originally picked the book because my father spoke highly of the novel. When I began reading it I regretted the decision. I do not recommend the book to anyone who likes action. Hemingway is very skilled in the detail area. It seems he describes the actions of each character perhaps too well. Whether they are drinking coffee to the exact words of a conversation Hemingway writes everything. The characters do however drink a lot, living in Paris and partying every night it seems that wine is the only thing they do drink. Jake Barnes the main character is in love with Brett Ashley who is a women player. She gets men to fall in love with her and then discards them only to feel miserable all the time. Well these two characters and some friends travel to Spain. It is kind of interesting to hear about their time in Spain. They are staying in Pamplona during the bull fights so the environment is romantic. Brett falls in love with a bull fighter and discards him later in the novel. But the point is that the characters, after all they have been through did not advance, or get anywhere. Where they began in the novel is where they ended up in the end. So I guess Hemingway did prove his thesis of a &quot;Lost Generation.&quot; A generation in which Brett and Jake belong to. Hemingway proves that Brett &amp; Jake do have meaningless, pointless lives all too well. But if you're into reading and some deep symbolism this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises is a time-honored story about how people might have lived in the roaring 20's in the post World War I era. The story grasped me because of its' fine details, but left me wanting to know more about the charters' exploits. The story was straight forward. I didn't have to go back to glue the story together. The author, Ernest Hemingway, developed the charters very well. What I also liked was that the author didn't over exaggerate the events or the charters. He gives plain basic detail to invoke the reader to experience it from your own imagination. The story unravels in Paris, France after the massive destruction and havoc caused by World War I. There are three main charters; Jake Barnes the American expatriate living in Paris as a newsman, Robert Cohn a Jew from New York, and the Englishwoman Lady Brett Ashley a slut whom Jake falls in love with. All three went though horrible experience during the war. They lived there life the saying, &quot;You only live once, so enjoy it while it lasts.&quot; So one day they decided to go to Spain to the Fiesta(celebation)of San Fermin, for the Running of the Bulls. The charters spend their time drinking and having sex to forget the war and to have a good time, but they never could seem to find happiness. Although the book is well written, my only complaint is that sometime you lose who said what in the dialog. So if you like to read about murder, sex, and alcoholism you'll probably like Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Okay, in terms of literature, I'm not very appreciative of the great works of English literature. I was one of those guys that hated English class, and believed Cliff Notes were a great substitute for the real deal. That's why it's out of character for me to recommend this book.If anyone has read my other reviews, I love plot, action, fluidity, and dialogue. This book is the exact opposite, but yet I loved it. It takes about 50 pages to get used to Hemingway's style (this is the first I've ever read any of his books), but once accustomed to it, the amount of detail is fantastic.This book makes reader feel like they're in Pamplona, in the bullfights, at the parties, and drinking the wines. It's amazing. Hemingway paints a picture of Spain that can not be matched. The Spanish tourism board should hand this book out instead of a standard brochure.Though the language style is a bit terse, and the plot is almost non-existent, I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This book only deals about a bunch of characters' perigrination through all the pubs of Paris then Pamplona, while the main female character, BRett, dates all the men in the plot.

If so, please tell my what chapter that is!!! I wanted to read it, and wanted to love it as a great classic...haven't been able to do that yet."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I know that I should have read this book again, before I made my final decision of 5 stars. But, Hemingway's writimg style and language are just so perfect. I love how Hemingway's writing is blunt, and so to the point. It's like he writes directly from trhe heart, without thinking too much. Like oh this sound good, or no, this sounds better. He just states his thoughts on love and on life.I remember a documentary I saw on Hemingway; about having his heart broken by a women he met during his own service during war. Don't know if a majority of readers are already aware of this. So, as I continued reading the book I kept sensing connections between Cohn and jake, to Hemingway. I think both characters contained certain traits which related to Hemingway's own personal characteristics. I think Hemingway wished he could have been more like Jake in instances of his own life. How Jake was very strong and in control of his emotions, and his resistance to falling absolutly in love with Lady Ashley. Cohn on the other hand makes a complete fool of himself by going head over heels for Lady Ashley. Love showed how weak Cohn is, and how strong, and cool Jake was. Maybe Hemingway's wished he could been more able to be like Jake, and therefore impervious to ever becoming heart-broken. Good read, there's a lot more I want to talk about, but better read it again before I start making anymore conclusions. Great read for anyone!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemingway wrote like a man that knew he was going to be big. I absolutely enjoyed this novel cover to cover. Typically, I try to avoid 20th century American Literature (I read more British literature) but I tip my hat to Mr. Hemingway after reading this novel.I have read that because this is his first novel there were multiple \\"flaws\\" throughout the novel. This may be true but in all honesty, as a struggling writer myself, I became enamored with the \\"lost generation\\" story as it unfolded. As the main synopsis indicates this is primarily a story about expatriates returned from the war and not knowing what to do with themselves. This is a story about loss. This is a story about addiction. This is a story about finding yourself in a torn apart society.There are two beautifully written scenes. The first is a scene out in nature (Spanish wilderness) with the typical Hemingway fishing scene between two men that provides the most truthful dialogue of the entire novel. Since they are away from civilization the men are also somewhat free from the boxed-in feeling they felt in society. Absolutely beautifully written. Hemingway really knows how to tap into the human psyche.The other scene takes place during the bullfighting season in Spain. Lady Ashley is like the bull with all the rest of the men around her as the steers. She becomes enamored with a spanish bullfighter and essentially leaves the other men she was somewhat dating for him. The scenes are well described and full of powerful emotions Hemingway is so good at describing.All in all, what a fantastic novel. I gave this to my army boyfriend who absolutely loved it as well. It speaks volumes about the generation we are living in right now. Is generation X/Y a lost generation as well? Are we too inundated with problems that we cannot move forward as a society? READ IT. You will love it."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I bought this book for my daughter who has evinced an interest in Hemingway. The backstory of this novel is interesting. The people in the novel, except for Jake, are all real people and friends of Hemingway. The story of the trip to the bullfights in Spain was true and one of many that Hemingway and his friends made in 1920s Spain. It takes place in a few days and this was the first big novel that made him famous. Prior to this, he was known as a short story writer. One character, Robert Cohn, was a friend who was quite angry at his role in the fictionalized version of the trip. He thought Hemingway had made him look like a fool and he threatened to kill Hemingway, a famous brawler among his friends. There was a small bar in Paris, across the street from the Cafe de la Paix, where they all used to hang out. It is no longer there but was on my first trip to Paris. Hemingway spent several days waiting for this disgruntled friend to come in the bar so he could try to defuse the anger before something serious happened. Finally, after about a week, the friend walked in and Earnest jumped up, ran over to him and shook his hand, greeting him as an old friend. The ploy worked and the feud was over. This is a classic and the first of his novels."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Written in sparse, simple language, you might be tempted to dismiss the work as banal. But Hemingway, like his friend Picasso, knows the value of pruning so that less is more.The story is set in Paris between the two great wars. There we find a group of attractive, young, well-educated ex-patriots. Our narrator, Jake, is in love with the beautiful Brett. But Jake's war wound makes him unable to satisfy Brett sexually. Their unhappy predicament spawns an unusual love affair. Jake, in effect, becomes Brett's pimp. Just as fish can be lured more successfully with artificial flies than real worms, the lovers use Brett's exotic looks to lure men for \\"artificial\\" love affairs. While never overtly stated, Jake and Brett play their game under strict rules. Brett never falls for any of her \\"lovers.\\" Jake never denies her choices. Jake is always there for her when she needs him. Like Picasso, Hemingway is a master of the double entender. At the Bullfights, we learn that steers are used to calm the wild bulls; it's a steer that leads the bulls to slaughter; bulls get slaughtered, but the steers get to live another day; a great bullfight is one where, at the climax, the bull and matador are one. At the bullfight, like two Greek gods, Brett and a handsome young matador are inevitably attracted to each other. Jake arranges a meeting and then leaves them. After a brief tryst, the young Adonis leaves Brett because Brett won't marry him. Penniless and alone, Brett calls Jake to her rescue. It's not your typical love story, but it makes a swell book."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I made the mistake of first reading this book in seventh grade, and at that time I had no idea what the hell Hemingway was talking about. It took me until my late twenties to get back to him -- and then I was sorry about all the time I'd wasted. What a blend this book is, simultaneously spare and moving, macho and sensitive, quickly-read and long to dwell in the reader. I've returned to this book since the adult re-read, and I'll be back many more times in years to come."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"For one who is living so remotely from WWI, the war that didn't end all wars, it is difficult to understand its effects on those that lived it. And, when one comes into a story that assumes you have lived it, it is difficult to fully appreciate the story. The Sun Also Rises is that kind of story.The dissolutes who wander Paris and Pamplona hardly muster sympathy from the likes of us, who know only a war fought surgically at high altitude, on television. In our times, so far anyway, the hapless grunts in harm's way are volunteers, who volunteered without conscription as the alternative. To those of WWI, it was a Hobson's choice.This story is set in the early to mid 1920's. With the glories of battle of a Beowolf now permanently erased from the imaginations of these characters, and the mindless slaughter of civlized warfare firmly implanted in its place; our heroes roam foreign lands in search of a reason to live. That debauchery is the reason should be no surprise. It was age and experience appropriate.Yet there's implied redemption. The fiesta ends in reflection, Jake doesn't return immediately to Paris, and Brett (Lady Brett) sacrifices what she, in the beginning of the story, was unlikely to sacrifice.Many of the veterans of WWII, especially of the Pacific portion, buried, for a long time, their experiences of slaughter. Hemingway was taking a different approach, revealing its toll on a generation. Which is the greater generation remains an open problem."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"In the shallow world of the characters of Ernest Hemingway, everybody seems to spend most of their time feeling sorry for themself. Going beyond the tragic hero, the charcters are perhaps best described as arrogant and self-centered. Coupled with the terse writing style of Hemingway, this makes for a quick read with a somewhat clever plot.While bull fighting actually takes place in the plot, it is also a clever metaphor used in the story. The main character Robert Cohn follows Lady Brett Ashley around like a stupid bull follows a bull fighter. It is hard to feel sorry for Cohn when everybody realizes Brett's disinterest in Cohn except Cohn. It comes to a head when Brett falls for the bull fighter and Cohn assaults his friends for viciously taunting him about Brett's disinterest.While the main theme is somewhat clever, much of the other prose seems to be self-loathing and scenary. When the characters get drunk, they pour their hearts and failures out like spilling wine. Even when Bret finds her resolution, the reader could anticipate the downfall.It is difficult to like any character in the story which may leave the reader with an awkward feeling. The characters are depraved and infantile while searching for a love that eludes them. While the search for an elusive love is one that readers can identify with, the flaws in the characters make evident why their goals elude them."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I've often wondered how I got through college as an English major without reading any Hemingway. The classics have always been my favorites, and American lit specifically. So, as an adult, I've tried to add some of those critically acclaimed books I missed in undergrad to my \\"Have Read\\" list. The first Hemingway book I read post-college was A Farewell to Arms. I liked it ... not loved, but liked it enough to read more of his work. But this one ... I struggled through it. I felt like each page was the same -- group of friends who don't all like each other and lots and lots of alcohol. I did make it to the end despite my minimal interest in the story (or lack there of) because, no matter what the story is, Ernest Hemingway's style of writing is a great example of a true gift."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"There is no question that this is Hemingway's best literary effort. Other works are more politically appealing, informative or just plain readable but this story of some of the American and Europeon denizens of the post-World War I \\"lost generation\\" their trials, tribulations and inner horrors is literature in the grand style. A sparse story line and, on a quick reading, seemingly one-dimensional characters represented a break through in modern novel writing and won Hemingway his first just acclaim as an author. A second reading gives a much better understanding of just what ails this cast of characters and either gains our sympathy for their plight especially the narrator or makes us run away in horror at the futility of their lives. As an aside- in a novel this assortment of bedeviled characters make for great reading but in real life one would not want to spend more that about seven minutes with them. Being part of the 'lost generation' did not mean that one was exempt from the laws of boredom or being boring.Okay, so much for the literary end now comes the real question. Who was better at getting to the core of post-World War I angst- Fitzgerald with his 'lost generation' in America or Hemingway with his 'lost generation' in Europe? That is a different question that the literary merits of Hemingway's work. Sorry, Ernest but Scott just had a flat out better ear for the pathos of that generation. Is there any better understanding of such tensions than The Great Gatsby? In consolation Ernest wrote better war stories. By far."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is a spectacular piece of work. Written by any other author, this would still be a great work, but Hemingway's command of language is astounding. His prose is so beautiful and bracing and elegant - it defies adequate description."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I thought the following review, written for On The Road, was exactly the way I felt and did not want anyone to miss reading it. Call me lazy but.. (all credit to uofm84 for writing it too) Enjoy...1.0 out of 5 stars a little story, May 5, 2004By \\"uofm84\\"There once was an emperor who ruled over a great kingdom. One day, two tailors/book salesmen came to visit him. They told him about this glorious new novella \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" by Hemingway. They told him it was a barometer test for whether or not a person was intelligent. Anyone who liked Sun Also Rises was a genius, and anyone who disliked it a buffoon. Eager to prove how smart he was, the emperor quickly read the novella. When he was finished, he realized he was an idiot. Rather than being brilliant, he found the book to be a collection of insane ramblings and occurances that could only be interesting to Hemingway himself. It was about a man on a search for truth and meaning in the world, but he went about this by getting drunk and pretending that he liked poor people. However, when he saw true poor people in Spain, he thought about how terrible it would be to be them. This made no sense. The philosophy for a better life was more vapid and meaningless than the life before. Rather than changing the emperor's life, it made him long to have 4 hours of his life back. However, he was afraid to look like an idiot, and told the salesmen that it was the best book he had ever read. They were delighted, and told him he qualified for a special fabric...one that was invisible to everyone except those who loved \\"Sun Also Rises\\". The emperor couldn't see the fabric, but eagerly bought it. He then arranged for a public reading of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\", and told the townspeople how only intelligent people liked the novella. The people all lined up to hear the reading. They thought the book was nonsense, but were afraid to say so. They pretended that the work was life-altering, and that their ruler was actually clothed. Finally, a brave little boy in a tree shouted \\"This makes no sense. Lets go to Spain and watch the brave bullfighters or we can read about all the bull*** in The Sun Also Rises. Basically, Sun Also Rises and On The Road follow the same formula--travelling around and getting drunk, albeit with Sun Also Rises they did it with a little more class. At least the main characters werent stealing in Sun Also Rises."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"A boring book about the empty lives of empty people. It would have been more interesting if they were contrasted with some other type. The book my be historically important for the ground it broke at the time it was written, but today your reading time is better spent elsewhere."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I think this story has a good meaning to life in it. The story talks about friendship, love, and life. Throughout the story, the characters face many problems concerning friendship, hatred, and the special ones. All the characters have different interests and some try to get their way through, and others just give. All of this could teach a reader a lesson. The next time you have a problem with your friends, you can relate to this and resolve your problem. With the difference in interest, the characters develop some hatred for each other. Although they were really good friends at the beginning of the story, they start to see each other's bad traits and start to dislike each other. There are some that can bear with each other, but most of them dislike each other.Another problem in the story was love. One of the characters liking another caused problems because of the way they act in front of one another. Another problem was other characters developing feelings for the same female. This caused problems between the two males, and between the female and both males.Reading this story lets you know the hard times of life, and it gives you advice on your problems."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Although the book starts out good, it ends awefully. I couldn't even finish the whole thing."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I had to read this book for english, and I hated it. The book has no theme, except that narcissim is okay. If you are a narcissist, and enjoy drinking, this book is for you. Otherwise, stay away from it."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest Hemingway has made alcoholism into a fine art, because that is basically what all his novels are about. This was the first piece of work I read by him and I wish it had been the last. There was no plot, no meaning, no story and, ultimately no point. The characters were bland and unlikeable. I can sum up the content of the story:drunkenness, anger, hopelessness, drunkenness, depression, and more drunkenness."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I haven't read Hemingway since a mandatory high school assignment, and now I remember why. Just read The Sun Also Rises with my book group, and every one of us was disappointed. Much is ballyhooed about Hemingway's writing, but we all found it painfully choppy and repetitive, with a tendency towards detail that does nothing to further the story. This distinctive style may appeal to some, as evidenced by many of the previous reviews, and it must have seemed avant garde in the 1920s. But uniqueness does not equal excellence.Hemingway's characters were vapid and unsympathetic--all alcoholics, all self-indulgent, all living without purpose, all socioeconomic and racial snobs. What's to like here? And each of the men is unexplainably infatuated with the same woman, whose only claim to fame is her willingness to cuckold her fiancee with anyone with an XY combination. Okay, okay...you don't always have to like the players, but you have to be able to connect with them on some level. The consensus was that we'd hate to be trapped in an elevator with any of them, and we came away from the novel feeling that we'd learned nothing about what makes people tick.We did enjoy the chapters that revolved around the bullfights themselves--some really vivid descriptive passages are the reason for my two stars. Otherwise, this was a case of the emperor's new clothes for me--I'll not likely try another Hemingway."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"It's sad really. This was my first and only Hemmingway book and, while I know that he's a great writer, I honestly didn't enjoy the read. The overall story was soothing and romantic, but it was like a steak layered in fat. You have to cut through the lard to get to the good stuff. Its plagued with names of random clubs and restaurants, I'm guessing an average of 5 names per page, which end up amounting to nothing. Usually when I'm reading a book and a proper noun is mentioned, I make the special subconscious effort to keep it in memory for later use, but EH spews them out with no regard. His characters also tend to go off on the dumbest little rants, in which a theme or subject re-occurs until you want to throw the book across the room. At one point Bill goes on a rant about stuffed animals, then Mike goes on about how Brett is &quot;A fine piece.&quot; Maybe this is Hemingway's attempt at humor, or maybe its ridiculous, or maybe its just over my head and I'm ridiculous. It's hard for me to fathom a time when everyone seems to be rich. Everyone is always eating at classy restaurants, traveling, and talking like they were born with silver spoons in their mouths. How are these people paying for all of this? Jake was a writer, and I don't think most writers these days are traveling to Vienna and Spain and Paris for fun on the weekend, and I'd put money down that most of them cook rather than eat out most of the time. Its just really hard to swallow."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"If you want to read a great book do not read The Sun Also Rises, by Ernest Hemingway. This book was on the list for students who are college bound. I decided to read this book. It was the worst book I have ever read. There is not a plot in this book. Through this book there are mainly five characters. Cohn, Brett, Mike, Bill and Jake. The book is written from Jake's point of view. Each night these five people go into town and drink wine and get drunk. Most of the book is about their conversations between each other, but all they do is argue between themselves. The whole book is about how they go out each night and drink, fight, and learn to get along for the time they are out together. They also go to bull fights. The book is about Jake's life for about six weeks.There were three \\"books\\" in this book. The first had no meaning at all and should be taken out. It is about Cohn's childhood. The middle of the book is about their night life during the Festival, and the third is after the Festival and how Brett and Jake kind of hook up. If there were a plot it would be about how Jake loves and loses Brett but then in the end he gets her back. This book was very predictable because they did the same thing every day. If you like reading about everyday life when you drink all the time and go out and don't have a job this would be a good book for you, but this book didn't keep my interest at all. I would not recommend this book. How in the world did this book make it into fifteenth place for college bound students?Nicole Stay"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I read this book for an English class, expecting it to be the masterpiece it's cracked up to be. I was unpleasantly surprised. This book is not only TERRIBLY written, it is boring beyond words. Hemingway's writing style could easily be surpassed by a seven year old. Descriptions like &quot;she was really pretty&quot; just don't cut it in the world of top writers."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"That was my second novel of Hemingway.It is very easy read and there is no question about his unique way of writing in short dialogue style that was considered at that time as a new great prose.The story itself ,I think,is boring and has no goal.It depicts the meaningless lives of different characters,especially Jake Barnes, middle aged man,impotent and alcoholic,who is in love with Brett Ashley,seductive and pretty woman.Everybody in the book is lost ,is seeking peace in alcohol and sex to the point of somebody is drinking and trying to have a \\"swell time\\" in every page of the book. Alcohol seemed like an escape from a rotten hopeless life and a cure of great depression for all characters.Jake ,through his hidden sexual inferiority complex,sounds like a real nice man who tries his best in making Brett happy. He even arranges for her date with the bull fighter,Pedro Romero,who is half her age.There is nothing in the story that you could describe as suspense,unexpected,exciting,optimistic or even natural. Everything is focused on bitter depressed melancholy that doesn't make you sympathize with anyone,including the civil and courteous Robert Cohn who sounds from another planet.This might be a book telling the real life of a lost generation,the aimless confusing state of punch of Americans who ran to Europe for better homeland and security after world war I.This short novel has many similarities to Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby\\" or \\"Babbitt\\" of Sinclair Lewis but of lower literal value."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"My opinion on this book is that it was not bad but yet not what i expected it to be at all. This movie was basically about sex, violence, drinking, and many love affairs. Personally I would say that many people can relate to this book because it is exactly most people's lives today.Hemingway is an exceptional writer. I do like some of his work. This book was based on his life. All of his love affairs, how much he loved to drink and violence that he had gone through (the wars). It is interesting how a person could just sit down and write about his life for the world to read."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is one of Hemingway's earliest novels. He follows the relationships of several American expatriates travelling through France and Spain. Hemingway's sharp, athletic prose is almost brutal. The characters are clearly defined and well-rounded. While the plot is not overwhelmingly engrossing its worth reading.

In this book, Jake, a World War I veteran now a journalist, and his acquaintances go from bistrot to bistrot in Paris, then in Spain. They drink and look at the landscapes. Then they go to bed. Then they take the train. Then the have dinner. The most action you get is when they go to fish trout in the Pyrenees; one guy catches big trouts and the other one catches smaller trouts.On an emotional level, nothing happens either. The character, i.e. Jake, Lady Ashley and a couple other guys, seem unable to meaningfully connect to each other in any way. They really just hang out, drink, date, and then break up. They have some petty conflicts with each other, but honestly, who cares. Usually if there is no action in a novel, at least there is some valuable insights into the human heart; none of that here. Just \\"I felt good\\"; \\"I felt bad\\"; \\"they had a drink\\" and then they went to bed (separately, mind you).I would pass on that."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The book was given to me by my teacher to review.

If you try this book I wish you luck."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I have never read any other Hemingway novels, but I have to say that I wasn't swept away by this one. To say that he is considered the defining novelist of the twentieth century, I find his work to be ordinary, with little to really comment on.There are moments in the novel where one is struck by the loneliness of the lead character, Jake. This is attained through the style of prose, which is hard and straightforward; dialogue and scenery-driven and lacking in inward contemplation. This does effectively create the feeling of isolation of a character who, like Hemingway himself, has experienced the first world war and is a member of the \\"Lost generation\\". Jake finds himself carried aimlessly through Europe with characters who seem to be endlessly eating and drinking to conceal inner emptiness. Rarely does Jake contribute much to the conversation of those surrounding him, and Hemingway uses mundane or blunt commentary to track the inner workings of the mind of this disillusional man.However, not much actually occurs in the book. It is difficult to press on with a book in which you realize part way through that nothing is going to happen. If you are interested in bullfighting you will find countless and detailed accounts of it; likewise if you enjoy scenic descriptions about romantic settings you will also be engaged. Those looking for a plot of some kind, or revelations explicitly written, will be disappointed. I think the power of this book does lie somewhere in what I have referred to as its faults, though, so I give it three stars and will at some point re-read it through a new lens."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is the first Hemingway book I have ever read and I honestly didn't care much for it. While Hemingway is a talented writer with wonderful prose, I just couldn't get into the story or even really care about it.

Paxton Hibben was himself a strong personality, serving as an American diplomat; due to his efforts, hundreds of children were saved from starvation during Russia's devastating 1921-1923 famine, efforts which the Russians never forgot: though Hibben died (at the age of 48) in New York, his ashes were placed in a monastic cemetary in Moscow. His biography of Beecher, an evangelist as popular in the 19th Century as Billy Graham was in the 20th, is written in a low key style, spiked with a sly sense of humor (\\"He hated {James G} Blaine as only an apostle of love knew how to hate.\\") Beecher was the son of the formidable Protestant Lyman Beecher, who set up a one-preacher campaign against the Catholics. Henry Ward himself fulminated against slavery, though he did not support Abolition, and he was what we today would call a feminist. From the pulpit of the Plymouth Church in Brooklyn, he became quite the moralist, early in his career writing a pamphlet \\"Lectures to Young Men\\", in which he warned youth against drinking hard liquor, associating with \\"the strange woman\\", and (God forbid!) going to the theater. Later he published several books, including a Life of Christ. When his older sister Harriet had a big success with \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\", Henry Ward thought he would try his hand at fiction also, the result being 1867's \\"Norwood, or Village Life in New England\\", which is not so much a novel as a series of character studies and long philosophical discussions, all associated with the eponymous town; only in the third volume, when the Civil War enters the story, does its narrative become more concrete. Because he had such an outstanding moral reputation (emphasized by his sermons as well as his writings) the events of the 1870s came as a shock to Beecher's parishoners. Beecher was accused by his one-time friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute; Theodore Tilton of seducing Tilton's wife Elizabeth. (Beecher himself was married to a rather cold complaining woman.) The accusations dragged on for years, so that the 1875 trial itself was almost anticlimatic. Beecher tearfully proclaimed his innocence, and to his congregations he was totally exonerated, a pure man enduring crucifixion. It is considered one of the oddest trials of the 19th Century, and Hibben reports it from different viewpoints. A sex scandal, of course, was living Hell for a clergyman, in the mid-19th Century as well as now, and it's interesting that it was during this period that Beecher renounced the idea of Hell itself, at least in the Dantesque sense of souls suffering eternal torment. Beecher said he hated this image \\"because I love God!\\" With the trial, his dabbling in politics, and his theatrical attitudes, Beecher was one of the most talked-about men in America by the time he died in 1887, and Paxton Hibben has described the controversial life most effectively."},{"Title":"Collusion: Memoir of a Young Girl and Her Ballet Master","review":"This is an autobiography that reads like a novel of self-revelation.

When he asked her at the outset, &quot;Do you want to be a great dancer?&quot; Her answer in all honesty should have been, &quot;Yes, if that will make you mine.&quot;Did she really have the potential to become a great dancer, a potential she squandered in her obsession with possessing &quot;F&quot;? Or was he using her, making her his pet not only to inspire her but an an object lesson to the rest of his class? In ballet there is always someone who is better than you, someone who gets more attention, more praise, more respect. Dancers fail to develop who will not strive in the face of this disappointment. &quot;F's&quot; motives in singling Evan out may have been to harden his pupils to his fact, and to goad them into working harder. Were her responses to his attentions merely the perfervid imaginations of a love-struck teenager, or was this a genuine duel of love and power between a svengali and his most promising pupil? At fourteen she already understood her powers of attraction, and in testing the limits of her power it was she who either betrayed or defeated him by simply neglecting to learn a simple stand-in role. In his humiliation and frustration he lashes himself not her, and their relationship collapses. Subsequently we learn that the highlight of her life was never dancing, but always &quot;F&quot;.

First it is perfection in ballet, perfect posture, perfect body control - pleasing herself. Then, with a strike of his cane her ballet master claims her, and so there comes a shift - he becomes the center of her universe, starting an emotional bonding which excludes the rest of the world, also her family.

It's disturbing to see a child getting an erotic thrill from being dominated, both mentally and physically, by an older man. Provided this is wholly autobiographical, I believe that the author's memory of her thoughts on the matter are accurately portrayed, but it's disturbing nonetheless. In the book, she wonders if (and hopes that) F. found their interaction to be erotic. Maybe he didn't. Maybe he was employing dominance as a tactic that he knew would motivate her to perform to the best of her ability. Maybe he had her fooled. But he created a monster - an arrogant girl who would stop at nothing to provoke him and turn his wrath/dominance upon her, at the expense of her career and relationships with others."},{"Title":"Collusion: Memoir of a Young Girl and Her Ballet Master","review":"Evan Zimroth's touching and insightful memoir left this reader stunned and enlightened. It is one of the most honest personal revelations I have read, boldly honest and unwilling to cringe under or conform to what our sexually dysfunctional society says should be the &quot;normal&quot; response to what is told of in this book. Obviously, one should not read this book if one is afraid of hearing what a real girl thought about a very unusual and intimate relationship. It is not a story of prurient events; it is about the love this girl has for the discipline of ballet and for a dynamic and compelling man who initiated her into its world. Ms. Zimroth has unsparingly chronicled her growth of character during the two years of her tale, and tells a story that is at once tense, dramatic, frightening, exciting and uplifting. Her refusal to cast a sentimental pall over her childhood and these events certainly frightens those who cannot see the individual human being that is a child for all the treacle with which we sugar-coat the concept of childhood. This book is a template by which we can judge the ability of people to truly listen to other voices instead of running in fear from differing views. Despite the lip service paid to &quot;inclusiveness&quot; in liberal circles these days, some of the responses I have seen to this memoir indicate the degree to which that concept should include the label &quot;but only to include that of which we approve.&quot; Finally, a note about hypocrisy. I couldn't help but think, while reading what is one of the most intense scenes in the book (when the young girl is punished by her mentor for smoking) that, was that punishment to be inflicted by a parent, most of us would not think twice. But from someone else? Horrors! Yet the dynamics of the event were no different than the countless physical punishments which parents inflict daily and unquestioningly (and, many times, rightly) on their own offspring. Children today exist only as slaves, owned by their parents and forced to obey the strictures of whatever -ism those around them feel they should be taught. We career from no discipline for children to subservience for them without ever thinking to teach them simple morals and ethics that respect them as individuals and take into account their need to grow through experience. (They certainly will not grow through coddling and protection from everything the world has to offer, only to thrust them out unready and frightened into harsh reality when they turn eighteen.) The horror some adults feel at the child who can think for and desire for herself is evident in the very parents who spend so much time praising children as pure, unsullied angels. Those of us who remember our childhoods well, as Ms. Zimroth does, know better. This book deserves huge success. Congratulations and thanks to Evan Zimroth for having the courage to tell us this remarkable story."},{"Title":"Collusion: Memoir of a Young Girl and Her Ballet Master","review":"Collusion was extremely well written and easy to read. It kept my interest from the first sentance to the last word.However, the content was somewhat questionable. It was a wonderful and interesting showing of the life of a serious dancer, yet seemed SO obsessed with violence, sex and eroticism.Interesting, but not really worth the time."},{"Title":"Collusion: Memoir of a Young Girl and Her Ballet Master","review":"As a former dancer, the title alone intrigued me enough to buy this book. As I finished each page I was struck by how much the words and stories mirrored my strict ballet training growing up. While I cannot identify with the eroticism she feels as a part of the relationship with her ballet master, I was eerily reminded of other feelings: control, admiration to the point of obsession with an older, authoritative male teacher, endless aspiration for perfection, and a realization that ballet is not just a part of one's life, but has become the sole purpose of one's life."},{"Title":"Collusion: Memoir of a Young Girl and Her Ballet Master","review":"This was an interesting story and it gave a good feel for the drive and obsession that is associated with being a standout ballet student and ultimately a professional dancer. This was a very subtle book, however....in some ways, it seemed that very little actually happened within its pages and that much of the activity was felt, implied, unspoken, and under the surface. I feel that the girl's teacher, F., acted very cowardly in his final act and was very much to blame in making the heroine feel that she was &quot;above the law&quot; at his ballet school....no doubt driving her over-confident behavior. Overall, an interesting read for anyone interested in the day-to-day lifestyle and requirements of a ballet dancer in-the-making!"},{"Title":"Collusion: Memoir of a Young Girl and Her Ballet Master","review":"As a former dancer I was intrigued by reviews of this book. It turned out to be a complete waste of my time. The writing was dull and thoroughly uncaptivating.

I'd reccommend skipping this one."},{"Title":"Collusion: Memoir of a Young Girl and Her Ballet Master","review":"I'm sorry. I tried to read this book but couldn't. I was so disgusted.

Perhaps a glimpse inside the world of a dancer that has not been whitewashed? An honest account of how a dancer's life is as painful as it can be magical? Well whatever I hoped for, this book did not provide it. Written in a style that I found aggravating ( I wish I could explain WHY but words fail me), I finished it only because I had spent my money on it, not because I was intrigued or drawn in. I've read other customer reviews about this book and it seems you either love it or hate it. Many objected to the &quot;glorification of violence&quot; (or something along those lines). I didn't. I wanted the truth- honesty. The manner of how many young dancers are trained is in the Eastern Bloc style, where hitting and yelling are par for the course. But the auther descibes this all in a rather dreamy style as if it's a pretentious novel rather than a non fictional account of her experience. So at the end I never came to understand why she felt so attached to her teacher, abusive or not. Nor did I come to understand the sexual chemistry that exsists between a dancer and his/her instructor (or choreographer).

The grammar review is 60 solid pages, and so it takes some time to get through it and learn it, even if you are a good Spanish student. I studied this book for months before taking the test. Be warned that this book will not help you get a great score unless you put a lot of time in studying it (or you already know the material). However, it really does have everything you need to score well.I think the practice tests were slightly harder than the real thing, but they were fairly close. Just a week before the actual test I got a 670 on a practice test. Then, on the actual test, I got a 710. This really isn't much of a difference when you take into account the range of SAT II scores that accompany any score.Rather than including an exact scoring guide after every practice test (which would have been nice, but unrealistic), the book has directions on calculating your raw score and then one chart which gives a range of scores to match the range your raw score fell into. (The only soure of SAT IIs that have actually been given in previous years is, of course, &quot;Real SAT IIs,&quot; published by the College Board.)There were some typos in the book. I found a few in the grammar review and one or two in practice test answer keys. None of them were terrible, but if you think that the book is incorrect about something it may very well be. Overall, I good book to study, especially if you have a lot of time before the test."},{"Title":"Barron's How to Prepare for Sat II: Spanish (Barron's How to Prepare for the Sat II Spanish)","review":"I bought this book about one month before my SAT II: Spanish test. The main reason that I bought it was for the practice tests; I've found that being acquainted with the format calms my nerves and (hopefully!) allows me to concentrate more on the content than the format. The book has ten practice exams that are fairly comparable in difficulty to the actual test. I took four of the practice exams and received about a 78-80 raw score on all of them, which translates into the 750-800 range as the scaled score. On the real SAT II, I scored a 760, which I expected due to my scores on the practice exams. I glanced through the grammar review and vocabulary, and it seems to be well laid out and informative. I tended not to dwell on it because, being in AP Spanish Language, I hoped that I knew enough of the information to spare myself of the extra studying. Overall, I thought the book truly helped me score better and it was a great predictor of my score - which is helpful if you're debating whether to take the actual exam or not because you are afraid of what your score might be. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone considering taking the SAT II: Spanish test."},{"Title":"Barron's How to Prepare for Sat II: Spanish (Barron's How to Prepare for the Sat II Spanish)","review":"As a Spanish tutor, I have to say that this book's best feature is its Listening Comprehension CD. I have used this book to help prepare students of all levels to better understand the Spanish language. The listening comprehension guides are perfect for anyone--from an advanced student to a beginner.. In addition, the practice tests are amazing for their quantity, not necessarily their quality. The downside to this book is that there are several typos and errors that a novice student wouldn't catch. Overall, it is a good book to use, but use it with the supervision of a Spanish teacher or tutor as you may not be able to notice some of the errors."},{"Title":"Barron's How to Prepare for Sat II: Spanish (Barron's How to Prepare for the Sat II Spanish)","review":"This book provides a well-rounded review of grammar and reading comp for the SAT II Spanish Test.

He also wrote books such asThe History of the Synoptic Tradition,Jesus and the Word,Presence of Eternity, etc.His 1941 essay \\"New Testament and Mythology\\" famously begins, \\"The cosmology of the New Testament is essentially mythical in character. The world is viewed as a three-storied structure, with the earth in the centre, the heaven above, and the underworld beneath. Heaven is the abode of God and celestial beings--the angels. The underworld is hell, the place of torment. Even the earth is more than the scene of natural, everyday events ... It is the scene of the supernatural activity of God and his angels on the one hand, and of Satan and his demons on the other. These supernatural forces intervene in the course of nature and in all that men think and will and do. Miracles are by no means rare... (The) end will come very soon, and will take the form of a cosmic catastrophe. It will be inaugurated by the \`woes' of the last time. Then the Judge will come from heaven, the dead will rise, the last judgment will take place, and men will enter into eternal salvation or damnation.\\"He then asks, \\"Can Christian preaching expect modern man to accept the mythical view of the world as true? To do so would be both senseless and impossible. It would be senseless, because there is nothing specifically Christian in the mythical view of the world as such. It is simply the cosmology of a pre-scientific age.\\" He argues that \\"An Existentialist interpretation is the only solution,\\" and outlines a program for \\"demythologizing the New Testament.\\"His essay has five critical appraisals (including one by Helmut Thielicke), followed by responses by Bultmann. In the essay, \\"Bultmann replies to his critics,\\" he states, \\"The Bible not only shows me, like other historical documents, a possible way of understanding my own existence, a way which I am free to accept or reject: more than that, it assumes the shape of a word which addresses me personally.\\" He adds, \\"Our radical attempt to demythologize the New Testament is in fact a perfect parallel to St. Paul's and Luther's doctrine of justification by faith alone apart from the works of the Law.\\""},{"Title":"Just a Dream","review":"This is my FAVORITE children's environmental book. Chris Van Allsburg's illustrations are fabulous, as always, and greatly add to the drama of the story. I am an environmental educator and read this book to students (5th-6th grade) at the end of every week at outdoor school. This is a great book to read aloud, especially because of the way the illustrations are separate from the text. What I love about this book is that it is in the end very hopeful. Walter's first dreams of the future show a world of great environmental problems, based on his actions of not caring in the present; but when he changes his ways, the future changes also. I like to emphasize this when reading it to students: The future is not written yet, but we are creating it every day with the choices we make. This is definitely a children's environmental literature classic, along with Dr. Seuss' &quot;The Lorax&quot; and Lynne Cherry's &quot;The Great Kapok Tree,&quot; but is even better for older children."},{"Title":"Just a Dream","review":"AT EIGHTEEN THIS IS STILL AT THE TOP OF MY &quot;YOU MUST OWN THIS BOOK&quot; LIST.

This works as a great frame for the finale to the story and will get readers of all ages rejoicing along with the boy, who by the book's end has undergone a complete character transformation.The wonderful thing about Van Allsburg's picture books is the fact that they make for great educational tools - the books can be used to teach inferencing skills, as well as launching pads for discussions on the environment, responsible behavior, etc."},{"Title":"Just a Dream","review":"Great book to promote environmental awareness.

Sadly, for me, neither the story nor the illustrations were quite as captivating.The story is about a young boy who doesn't care at all about the environment (he litters, doesn't see the beauty of trees). He thinks it would be cool to live in the future and fly spacecrafts and have robots and stuff, but then he falls asleep and dreams about a very different future.The future he dreams about illustrate a future where trees are being cut-down, smog is blocking the view of the Grand Canyon, and there's lots of traffic and people on cell phones (now, rather sadly, this sounds a lot like \\"the present\\" instead of the future to me...) but, some of the dream sequences are more \\"futuristic\\": a world with few fish left in the sea, no ponds for ducks to land in, etc. So, the question is, will the young dreamer see the world in a different light when he wakes up? Will he finally sort his recyclables and trash into separate bins?Now, don't get me wrong, I'm all for cleaning up the environment! I love nature, I love clean air, and I think something needs to be done to start making the world healthier. But this book just struck me the wrong way from the get-go. It feels way too dogmatic and blatant. And what annoyed me was that it was so trivial in a way. The issues the world faces are big problems. So, to trivialize them by saying the trees are being cut down \\"for toothpicks\\" or that the smog is being created by a processing plant that produces medicine to help you fight the effects of smog, just seem to make the issues way to \\"easy.\\"SPOILER ALERTAnd as far as the end, I'm not sure how I feel about the \\"solution\\" being, basically, to go back 60 years and live how we did in the 1950s. Are there things we could learn from the past? Definitely! But I suppose, personally, I'd rather envision a future where we learn from the past but keep progressing by making things better, rather than reverting to what we've already come from.END SPOILERSome of the full page illustrations are pretty and pleasant to look at - and, of course, I love the addition of the cat!

Parapraxis is a term which could be translated into faulty acts, which are, for instance, \\"slips of the tongue\\", \\"slips of the pen\\", misreadings, mislayings of objects, undeliberate forgetness of sentences, names and places, etc ...The book is written in a very casual style and one is again admired how could such a genius as Freud convey his ideas in such an easy style.Why no 4 stars?

Now I only dip into a few of his books periodically because his thought process is so fascinating. His book The Psychopathology of Everyday Life is more interesting and accessable than many of his writings, though his style does not make for an easy read. It is in this book that Freud takes up the issue of all the little things that go wrong which we have tended to think of as accidents and mistakes. To Freud, most, if not all incidents of things forgotten, lost, dropped etc are examples of hidden dynamics of the psyche playing out in the real world. His arguments can be very strained and he extrapolates very broadly from a few anecdotes and case histories. This isn't scientific thought, but it is very interesting nonetheless. If you took him at face value, you would have to conclude that we all need an analyst - which is exactly what he thought."},{"Title":"Psychopathology of everyday life,","review":"The huge amount of research over the past 50 years is enough to convince even Freud's most loyal votaries that his science amounted to little more than--wish fulfillment!But so what? Does anyone read Freud for science anymore? I hope not, but he's still an absolutely essential author.The Freudian system of the unconscious was used by scored of brilliant artists in the 20th century. If we want to understand Faulkner, Anderson, Larsen, Dali, or Picasso, we'll need to read at least two books by Mr Freud: this one and The Interpretation of Dreams (only James Strachey's translation!).Are they good science? Few believe that anymore. Insteadm they serve as excellent and useful metaphors for better understanding art and literature. What you do from there is up to you: you could just as easily use Freud's \\"nonsense\\" to call the art \\"nonsense,\\" or you could marvel at the meaning inhered in the metaphor as used by the author. The situation and philosophical background would of course determine the matter.Anyhow, you can't go wrong with this one here. It's a quick read; it's full of great stories; it's full of wonderful nonsense; and it's so, so very useful for literature without being offensive. Moreover, this book is easily Freud's most innocent.Bad science. Bad philosophy. Bad theology. Useful artistic metaphor. Necessary material.

I actually misplaced this book, apparently so I wouldn't have to read it), I don't see how all such acts can be classified as neurotic efforts at repression. Is Freud saying that a fully conscious person would never make a mistake?Freud shatters all scientific crediblity by admitting near the end of the book that, of couse, we can't recognize or assertain the meaining behind every dream, mistake, or superstition, (like psychoanalysis). Freud writes,&quot;To substantiate the general validity of the theory, it is enough if one can penetrate only a certain distance into the hidden associations.&quot; pg. 161This is kind of like substantiating the theory of relativity by saying it's enough to know that two plus two equals four.Freud was an egotistical person, who spewed venom towards critics, and apostates to his theory, (look at what he has to say about Adler in a letter to Jung). Much of that ego plays forth here, when he speaks of psychoanalysis as a proven fact, rather than something to be seriously questioned and studied.My misplacing of this book was less an unconscious act than a conscious one, I really found the reading dry at times and some of the examples pulled out of thin air, (if you keep free associating long enough, you can make anything in the universe connect to anything else, don't believe me?

I started the book as bed-time reading, but found (to my wife's disgust) that it was keeping me awake at night. In the end, I had to devote a Saturday morning to finishing the book for domestic harmony.If your idea of a good read is a slam-bang space opera with cardboard characters, this is not the book for you. But if you like your books to be thoughtful and thought-provoking, with excellent characterization, then this is the one.Bova's strength is his ability to really make the characters in his books come to life. The scientists in the novel were just like some of my friends, struggling with the issue of how do you get someone to pay for your hobby and indignant that someone might actually want to make a profit from it. The mystery and tension built throughout the novel, making it harder and harder to put down. It was great.I am looking forward to reading Bova's next novel."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"In Bova's original &quot;Mars&quot;, the first human explorers escape the red planet after they had discovered life upon it - a mindless green lichen that hints at the possibilities of colonization. The team's unofficial leader, native american Jamie Waterman made what promises to be a major discovery of his own - steps apparently cut into the side of a martian cliff. Now returning on an expedition financed by a sinister billionaire with his own plans for Mars, Waterman looks to follow-up his last discovery. Now the team leader (due to his experience on the other trip) Waterman commands a crew that will search for patterns among the martian lichen, further map mars and climb Olympus, the highest mountain in the solar system.Unable to walk the cliff-steps himself in &quot;Mars&quot;, Waterman waits years to return to Mars and make that ascent into the cliff wall and history. In doing so, he stands not only to discover intelligent life but perhaps add substance to an ancient tribal legend that the dead red world and the blue on which they were born are actually brothers of a sort. What lies at the top of the stairs adds tension to the story, one not spoiled when Waterman - pressure suit and all - takes that giant step.Although Jamie's thoughts of the martians - which soon rise to the point of mystical visions - are evocative and would have made for a great novel, their dragged down by other elements brought in by Ben Bova, whether to shore up a better novel Bova thought beyond him, or simply to push some agenda. Here, the greatest enemy is not some evil martian, or the natural dangers of an alien world, but Trumball, the expedition's bankroller, who threatens (gasp!!) to bring tourism to Mars (which is unlikely, since most on Earth can follow the expedition with their VR glasses and without subjecting themselves to the dangers of the trip) and spoil...whatever tourists spoil. Bova pretty much downgrades all those back on Earth as uneducated boobs who don't know anything they don't see on VR. He piously leads the fight against increased exploration to Mars, even though that would improve the chances of discovering more martian cities or other signs of their civilization. Though Trumball is on Earth, his son fights for him on Mars, rivaling Waterman at every turn (including love, with Waterman's prospective conquests falling to the brat's boyish charm before they even reach Mars). Dex Trumball, as a typical Bova charachter, gets little in the development treatment (his turnabout at the book's end isn't so much a charachter development as it is simply the author's changing his mind for him), and his early martian plans are an obvious clue that his mercenary plans for Mars are modeled on Cortes. (Setting out for the landing sites of 1997's Martian Pathfinder, Trumball announces his intention to salvage it for the cash). Realizing that the War against Tourism isn't enough for a story, Bova tosses in another element - the Coyote: the spirit of malice that will seek to undermine the mission and perhaps kill its members off. In short, somebody on the team isn't what he seems. Small accidents are followed by larger ones, clueing Waterman in that they've got a sabouteur on Mars. But even this idea seems like filler, and the resolution is pretty pat for the tension that Bova wants to generate. By the end of the book, the only enduring thing about it is the strikingly patronizing tone it saves for those back on their easy chairs on Earth - a tone reminescent of that used against religious-minded (but actually hypocritical) zealots in Bova's &quot;Moonrise&quot; series. Bova isn't so much concerned about discovering anything new on Mars as he is putting a wide moral chasm between his heroes and those who are simply greedy, ignorant or mindlessly zealous. This could have been a much better book, but Bova's tortuous morality grounds it."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"I feel compelled to write a review of this book because I wrote such a negative review about Bova's earlier book, MARS. RETURN TO MARS is much better. It is a better story with more realistic characters, and there is more action. Unlike the first book, I felt like they really did something on Mars, and what they discover is credible. There were less of the racist overtones and more the incorporation of heritage and the value of diversity. Now I understand why people like Bova. This was a good book, well-paced, not too psychological, not too sci-tech, just right. I was sorry to see it end. (And I did not miss the characters from the earlier book that were left out. I only wondered about them for the first 50 pages, then the new story took hold. Fewer is better in this case.)"},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"Navajo geologist-astronaut, Jamie Waterman, blasts off to the red planet for a second time as the leader of a privately funded follow up expedition to the earth's first foray to Mars which ended on a literal cliff-hanger. the discovery of pueblo-like cliff dwellings that seemed to indicate Mars had been inhabited in the past by intelligent life.The crew, an eclectic blend of nationalities and experts in a variety of scientific and technical fields of endeavour, direct their efforts to the completion of three distinct projects - the examination of the lichen type biology and the geology of the caldera of Olympus Mons, a volcano and the highest mountain in the solar system; the recovery of a priceless artifact from the much earlier Mars Pathfinder expeditions; and the detailed investigation of Jamie's pueblo dwellings with a view to proving once and for all whether Mars had ever been home to an intelligent species of life.Aside from the hard sci-fi themes of the Martian environment, the research, the overwhelming dangers and difficulties of extraterrestrial exploration in a fundamentally hostile environment, \\"Return to Mars\\" also examines two other central themes - first, the almost insurmountable difficulties of the costs of big budget science and the conflicts that inevitably arise when capitalism attempts to force fundamental research into profit-oriented motives; and, second, the inherent dangers of contaminating a pristine environment such as Mars with untrammeled, loosely controlled exploration, travel, business and (gasp!) even colonization or, worse yet, tourism!Certainly, Bova was not shy about using \\"Return to Mars\\" as a forum for espousing his own political views on the matter and, for some readers, the strength of the expression of these opinions was seen as a shortcoming in the novel. But, I felt that using Jamie, in particular, a highly educated scientist with an underlying aboriginal Navajo cultural mindset, as the fundamental mouthpiece for these opinions, the left-leaning political statements seemed to come across as heartfelt and completely natural. While some readers might disagree with some of what Jamie had to say, it seemed completely reasonable to hear him and the other scientists express these views. Their disgust and complete antipathy to the notion of tourism directed at the Martian cliff-dwellings was particularly understandable in the context in which it was presented.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"Following the generally disappointing Moonrise and Moonwar, which amounted to little more than Dallas or Dynasty in space, Bova has finally given the readers what they want. Even the most mediocre of sci-fi authors can usually at least maintain the reader's interest with any tale set against the beautiful and mysterious backdrop of everyone's favourite planet. Bova is a better than average author and, when he doesn't get too embroiled in politics and political correctness, can produce some immensely exciting material. Thankfully, Return to Mars is pretty well solid adventure from cover to cover. Sure there is a smattering of politicising over the financial interests surrounding the potential commercialisation of Mars and Bova's usual tendency towards &quot;affirmative action&quot; manifests itself through the rather contrived melting pot of a crew and the occasional piece of stilted dialogue. Here though, these features seem less of a distraction than in Bova's previous novels and we can surely forgive Bova his agenda when he gives us such riveting adventure as this. Descriptions of the practicalities of setting up the habitation modules and all the ancillary equipment has a gritty air of authenticity about it. The excursions to Mt. Olympus and the Grand Canyon, where most of the story unfolds, are depicted in superb and convincing detail and should satisfy the most technically demanding of readers. Bova has skillfully trod the very fine line between what we know about Mars and speculating on what surprises we may yet find. Furthermore, the characterisation, although never the main feature of a Bova novel, is more 3-dimensional and satisfying than usual. WARNING SLIGHT SPOILER AHEAD; The only feature which quite irritated me was the unnecessary, predictable and contrived whodunnit sub-plot. Having read other Bova novels and being aware of his tendency towards anglophobia, you'll all surely guess whodunnit the moment the main players are introduced! END OF SPOILER. That just took the edge off my enjoyment a little. I would still thoroughly recommend Return to Mars to all sci-fi fans. For my money, this is easily Bova's best novel and is the nearest we'll ever get to walking the Red Planet!"},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"Jamie Waterman gets a chance to go back to the planet that gave him fame &amp; happiness.

A great read! .........."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"Part two in Bova's series about Jamie Waterman, the Navajo Geologist, and his exploits on Mars. In some ways this was better than the first as there was more of a sense of this being a complete novel as the ending here is much more satisfying. A lot of gimmicks take up a lot of time (such as the hunt for a possible saboteur) but overall it was a fun read. The charactors are more fleshed out and develop visibly over the course of the book and Bova makes an effort to make them less shallow, succeeding in several instances. The book almost has a soap-opera feel to it as most of the explorers have sex fairly frequently with several partners along the way. This is used predominately as a tension-creating device and it works well in the context of a small group of people far from home. Not a waste of your time but only read it if you enjoyed the first volume in the series."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"And thank god for small mercies. Though this sequel is far better than the first book in the series it is not without its problems. Bova is proving a master at evoking mood and atmosphere, placing the reader right smack in the middle of whatever setting the story is taking place in - the terrifying danger of Mars with its harsh environment - low air pressure, lack of O2, etc - are brought home in startling reality.It's in character and plotting where Bova gets into trouble. As in the first book Bova's characters are very superficial and one dimensional - all. The lack of professionalism and leadership on these missions just does not ring true with all the petty bickering, racism and manipulation going on between the crew. Who chooses these people? Don't they undergo extensive psychological testing? Don't they work and train together for extended periods of time to weed out problems and conflicts? This is a big problem with these books and at times they ruin the reading experience.The characters all act of complete selfishness and immaturity then Bova attempts to 'add depth' by providing excuses for their behaviors and attitudes ie)Jamie facing racism all his life drives him to prove himself; Dex Trumball's abandonment and neglect by his father drives him to prove himself; Vijay's treatment at the hands of men leads to her to manipulate them for sex and her own means, male chauvinism drives her to prove herself, and on and on. The heavy handed moralizing (ie) the worthiness of science vs money and tourism, and the prejudiced stubbornness of even Jamie gets tiresome and downright frustrating.As well Bova's story plotting could stand some scrutiny - there are great items like the exploration of Olympus Mons, the volcano, providing some real suspense and moments of terror - but the story is tripped up when the subplot of the possible saboteur takes the book in a wildly divergent direction and creates a tedious and false sense of suspense.The last third of the book, however, does redeem Bova's story in the way we see the characters grow and learn (albiet a bit quickly) and the various threads come together. This book is plotted and paced tighter than the first, avoiding the too long flashbacks to Earth.All in all a good story that sets the groundwork for a third book. We can only hope Bova reaches a little deeper in terms of character and brings their level of realism to the same level as his storytelling and ability to draw the reader into the story."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"Dr. Jamie Waterman returns to Mars--this time for an ambitious 18-month stay upon the Red Planet. He and his expedition must live off the land--regardless of how hostile that Martian land may seem--they must glean their food, water and oxygen from the frigid red sands.This expedition's mission objectives include a harrowing descent into the caldera of Olympus Mons--the solar system's tallest volcano--and of course broadening the search for life--most controversially, Jamie's allegations of &quot;cliff dwellings&quot; hidden within the cliff face of Tithonium Chasma (Mars' Grand Canyon, which dwarfs our own).The extended length of this mission takes away from the imperativeness of the first expedition--it's a bit lazier--and also quite frightening--you've got 18 full months of the Martian elements staring you in the face.And yes, Jamie is afforded sufficient time to investigate what he thought he saw on the first expedition years ago. And he is determined to prove his allegations.This is a good sequel, but I'm afraid it has a few shortcomings. I was disappointed at the lack of returning characters. I was disappointed in how Jamie's relationship with Joanna Brumado was handled. I was disappointed in how Jamie's relationship with his grandfather was handled. I was disappointed in how Jamie's relationship with his parents was handled. And I was a tad irked that once again the expedition's physician plays a pivotal role. A good doctor should be like a good lawyer--you don't even know he's there till you need him.Another aspect of this book I found troubling was the characters' constant ethnic slurs to Jamie's Native American background. I found it very unrealistic. I think scientists would behave differently--and I think a handful of people on another planet wouldn't give two hoots what your ethnic background is; if you're human, then you're a friend.And then there's Mr. Bova's tentative grasp of romance. He tries to push the envelope with this one, but there's still some key element missing. I think it's passion, a true passion for another, a passion which can enslave and yet free you at the same time. Mr. Bova feels a passion for Mars--which is palpably evident--but his passion for man-woman relationships is luke-warm.Nonetheless, Mr. Bova's heart is in the right place, and the book's ending is a happy one--on all fronts [wink]. If you've read the first book, then you owe it to yourself to read the sequel. And we can only hope the author writes a third installment. Until then, &quot;Ya'aa'tey.&quot;"},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"It was with great anticipation that I plopped on the couch to read the sequel to MARS and found myself disappointed from the start because many of the characters from the first book were not along for the second voyage. Still, the story was compelling enough that I found it hard to put the book down.As with the previous story, Bova populates the second book with a multicultural crew, some of whom are odds with each other and helps to create some tension. Another vehicle Bova uses to add to the suspense is to start off some of the chapters with unsigned diary entries by a troubled and disturbed crew member. I have to admit that I was not able to figure out which crew member it was.Again, Bova handles the science part of the story well, especially the exploration and theories behind Jamie's cliff dwellings. It is a relief that they were not advanced aliens with laser guns and stuff like that, but rather a primitive culture snuffed out by a celestial event like the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs. All in all, RETURN TO MARS is a good read, and if you liked the first book, then I recommend this one as well.If Hollywood decides to make a movie based upon the books, I think it would be better to condense both books into one movie with a single voyage. My cast choice for Jamie Waterman would be Benjamin Bratt and Rachel Leigh Cook would be perfect as Joanne Brumado. Courtney Vance could be Connors. I haven't thought of the others yet."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"This book ( along with it's prequal- MARS ) was so vivid and real that I felt like I standing on the cold Martian surface.

I do not pay retail for many books- but I got this one as soon as it hit. They should make this into a movie."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"The book was fasinating.

When his sequel arrived I was highly curious, but somewhat skeptical. How could he possibly match his first great adventure? Well, he has done it! I just lost two working days while being absolutely and helplessly drugged by the book. Again, Mr. Bova stays close to the facts (connecting with Zubrin's How-to-get-to-Mars-concepts), and not forgetting the awesome Pathfinder of 1997. His ability is his strong self-discipline. He keeps the story close to ground, and even if the book holds great surprises for the reader, he confines himself cleverly to a very credible story-level, not exagerating his line. No green bug-eyed monsters hiding in the Martian caves there, but...Don't pick up the book, if you got work to do. If you do pick it up, seal your life off from the outer world and let your mind travel back to Mars to refind the captive footprints of the first expedition with Jamie Waterman."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"Ok so the characters are a little sterotypical.

The prequel to this book had all these elements but they superseded by the scientific elements.

Or, for that matter, \\"Gopher\\" or \\"Bobcat\\" or any other colorful animal name. Nor have I ever heard any Texan refer to a scientific expedition, or anything else -- except a rodeo -- as a \\"rodeo\\".So this might give you an idea of the shallowness and stereotyping of Bova's characters.Having got that off my chest, I did enjoy the story enough to finish it. If you've read the predecessor story \\"Mars\\", most things in this book will be predictable. But I like my science fiction with a healthy dose of science, and this story satisfied that requirement and was interesting enough."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"I bought this book at 9.30pm, started reading it at 10.00pm and didn't put it down till I had finished it at 3.00am in the morning. The next day I started to read it again. When is the sequel comming out. I want to know what happens to Jamie and VJ in the 4 months on Mars, will they stay or go back to earth (hope they stay). Mr. Bova it is time for another book, make it snappy."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"&quot;Red Perspective&quot; meaning from that of one who belives that Mars should be kept in it's pristine condition, untouched by man(except for a select few scientists) for all time to protect whatever life mayor may not be there.However, although I personally disagree with that perspective, I found this to be a riviting book which I couldn't put down. Yet another mission to mars, and Jamie finally gets to see if his cliff dwelling is just a figment of his imagination, or ruins left by ancient martians, long dead. This mission is also fraught with accidents, which one of the crew belives is a sabouteur. Almost unthinkable in the close-knit group of scientists.Mars is the next frontier to be explored, mapped, and colonised(I hope) in this century. Until we get there, reading an excellent account such as this, and others give food for thought of what to do once we get there."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"This one was better and faster than the first! With less detail from EARTH. The book keeps you wanting more details from MARS, but it droped off soon after the discovery of intelligent life. Over all a great book."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"This is the sequel to Bova's \\"Mars\\" novel, which was a more-than-tolerable read. This novel was barely worth finishing. Essentially, Bova is plumping against the notion that those awful Earth capitalists might exploit Mars by wanting to go there. The politics in the first novel were asinine, in this one just plain wierd. Somehow Bova has an American Indian tribe claiming the rights to most of Mars, thereby keeping the great unwashed capitalist masses away from Mars. Yeah, like that's going to happen.Bova's Left-wing political slant is worse in this novel than it was in \\"Mars.\\" It gets worse, by the way, in \\"Venus\\" which I was unable to finish, and therefore have not reviewed.I gave this book 2 stars because I was able to finish it. Not recommended though. RJB."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"This was an awesome book from start to finish, with little or no let downs along the way. I found it more interesting than its predecessor Mars, and much more readable. Seeing as a lot of the questions that exsisted about Mars were known and there was many more daring ventures to be had on the second expedidtion. Bova writes with clarity and makes all the scientific and technical information easily readable. With unexplained accidents, amazing ventures, conflicts with mission funders, and lust, this book lacks nothing, A MUST READ!!"},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"This is the sequel to MARS, a fine novel about the first expedition to Mars I read a few years ago. RETURN TO MARS chronicles the second expedition to Mars, funded by private sources, with lots of human relations conflict mixed in, Bova is excellent with this. He also is good at little details, and descriptions of scenery and technology. There is great plot and character developement, all hallmarks of novels by Ben Bova, what you expect from him as one of the top hard science fiction writers.RETURN TO MARS has an ending that obviously leaves room for another sequel, if so I look forward to it. In the real world of space exploration it seems to me that the next major international space project may very well be human exploration of the red planet. As hard science fiction, RETURN TO MARS makes one feel like you have already been there. This book was a joy to read and hard to put down at times."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"I feel like I've spent the summer on Mars! I started with Mars and just finished with Return to Mars.Ben Bova's writing is so descriptive I was able to imagine being there. I really enjoyed the musings of Jamie Waterman on his &quot;gentle Mars&quot;.Mr. Bova has vision.We will be there someday. I wonder what we will find?Now it's on to Venus!"},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"Bova's sequel is, in some ways, better than the original. His characters are real and multi-dimensional, and the attention to scientific detail is fascinating. The book strikes the perfect balance between science and fiction. My only significant complaint would be the depiction of the lesser characters; e.g., the Texan with a pronounced drawl was not exactly a unique creation. However, the story itself is definitely worth your time. If you enjoyed MARS, this book will not disappoint. Try reading S. Baxter's TITAN if you enjoy this type of science fiction."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"Lately, I've read a few of Bova's continuing works (Voyagers, Mars, Moon), and I've enjoyed all of them. I've just ordered _Venus_, which I expect to enjoy similarly.My only disappointment is that they don't tie together; while Mars and Moon take place during the same time period, I recall only small mentions of each other. Given the events on Mars and Luna, I would expect more contact between them, eventually leading up to an alliance.The first Mars book, aptly titled _Mars_ is a more enjoyable read, but _Return to Mars_ is a worthy follow-up. Clearly, if you enjoyed the first, you'll enjoy the second (and hopefully the third...)."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"I've been reading for so long that I can remember when a novel just ENDED. Ben Bova is an author that I enjoy, so I can't complain.I read 'Mars' also. If there should be a third novel in this series, I'll read it.If only to see if all things are resolved in that book."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"This book is a superstar effort for Bova.

It will leave you with a sense of awe."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"Well I first read Mars about two years ago, and when a few weeks ago I came across the sequel....well I had to find out what happened to Jamie. This is a great sequel to an book that re-invented the Mars sci-fi fascination. I don't really expect another sequel to this book although if it did come out it would be very interesting to find out what happens to Jamie and the sultress VJ!"},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"I quite enjoyed Mars except for only a few shaky moments. In 'Return' he once again uses 'flash-backs' to explain how his characters - the crew - gain the much-vied-for spots on the second Mars expedition. Once again, Bova shows that characterization is extremely important to him and he is the best sci-fi writer in that respect. Some reviewers have said they found MORE politics in this second installment but I found the reverse to be true - at least in the amount of print devoted to Earth. This is far more 'Mars' than Mars was in that respect.Two excellent points to make about the novel. The first was the suspense of the Olympus Mons mission. The delicate, tenuous descent into the caldera and the perils that almost cost the two astronauts their lives were excellently written. I won't give anymore details but suffice it to say that you yourself are clinging to the dark, sloping wall perched on the edge of an unimaginable abyss. I was gripping the edges of the book. The second point is Bova's under-pinning scientific premise - that Mars suffered the same meteor shower that Earth did 65 million years ago and that since that time it has been slowly dying. For his story, it is the perfect premise and also extremely intriguing scientifically. Again, I won't give any more details but I beleive that it works well.Lastly, Bova inserts a kind of 'whodunnit' mystery into the novel by bringing forth the possibility of a saboteur - and then giving the reader a real twist as to who it finally turns out to be. The story will touch you on some levels that the first one didn't."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"Ben Bova has done it again. He has written a novel that is believable, exciting, and with uses technology that is not too far removed from where we are now. Return to Mars is a great mix of science, politics, and the ambition of man. You care about the characters, you believe the technology. It reminds me of the film 2001, I can see Mars and Return to Mars being made as movies."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"(I listened to this book over the span of several weeks, during commuting.)Great book. Dick Hill does a great job narrating. He gives voice characterizations, via tone and accent, that clearly distinguish characters (essential), and includes the proper emotion, all without sounding hackneyed or forced. I can listen to the story without being distracted by the narrator -- the best compliment I can give him. I had heard one of his narrated audiobooks before (possibly one of Terry Goodkind series... the story of which I didn't care for at all, in fact). Seeing that he was the narrator of this book was a plus when I considered buying it.Unlike some of the previous reviewers, I thought the characterization by Ben Bova was fine. None of the characters were 100% good (Jamie makes you want to slap him upside the head sometimes -- &quot;don't you realize your sanctimonious attitude bugs people you're trying to convince?&quot;), and none of the characters were 100% bad (I respected old man Trumbull -- he merely followed his own agenda, faithfully).Some of the plot devices were a little heavy-handed or contrived or not integrated well, but overall the writing was solid. I never got tired of listening to the story, and enjoyed my commute (!).Also, Ben Bova perfectly handled one of my pet peeves with many authors -- he made this book work well both as part of a series and as a stand-alone novel. I had read the previous book a few years ago but didn't remember it well. I think an ideal series book stands fine by itself, and on its own merits makes you want to read the other books in the series.I would buy the third book if it's written -- hopefully seeing Father Denardo (?) and Jamie back together on Mars?"},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"As a science fiction novel I found this to be very interesting and compelling and well thought out. The science was deeper than I expected, and nicely done. IMHO there are three major problems with the book. 1) the sabotage plot seems forced and ultimately unsatisfying. 2) the characters develop just exactly as you think they would, which is just a bit boring. 3) the anti-indian racism was like something out of a 50's movie. Does anyone still talk that way? And who was the evil genius who put these mostly incompatible people together for a years long trip? Anyway, a fun read, but none too deep."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"This book may be disapointing for one searching for non-stop action, however for the ones who enjoy sci-fi at its realistic best, this is the book to read. When and if we ever do explore mars, this may just be the way it happens. Excellent reading and even has the feel-good ending that we all need sometimes. Great book in my opinion."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"I read the first book on my vacation. I got really hungry. I was thrilled about the possibilities the ancient willage could offer. All the time I read this second book, I waited for what Jamie and the others would find once the cliff dwellings were explored. It left me a litttle short. I am no autor, but it would have been extremly exiting if the book had had an ending that had pointed to a third book in the series. One illogical detail was the easiness with which Dex and Possum found the mars path finder. On their way there their rower was almost covered with dust after a single dust storm, but the pathfinder itself - after all these years -was not covered with any dust at all. Nevertheless I had a few very exiting moments reading the book. And I really hope that Mr Bova comes out with a third book where there would be a link of somekind between our sivilization and that of Mars. Any commnts gladly taken! karilatvala@hotmail.com."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"I really liked the novel and it was difficult for me to put down. The technology is not so advance from what we have today so the story seems all the more believable. It is easy to really get into the story and sort of feel how it would be to be there on Mars in the not too distant future.I very much very much recommend this book."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"Another good one by Bova, this is about the second human expedition to Mars, with the Jaime Waterman character returning, this time as Mission Director. Bova continues his theme of life being ubiquitous. He has Waterman discovering the remains of a pueblo-type building built some 65 MYA by intelligent Martians whose civilization apparently was destroyed in the same cataclysmic meteor or comet shower that resulted in the K-T extinction on Earth. He also weaves in a clear message against tourism on Mars (a problem, even a debate, that we won't have to deal with for quite some time yet). A good read."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"In RETURN TO MARS, Anglo-Navajo geologist Jamie Waterman leads the second expedition to the Red Planet. Riding a privately funded, cheaper spacecraft with a smaller crew, the eight multinational explorers set up a habitat, plant a garden, and set out on several missions by land and by what passes for air. One such expedition is into a caldera on Olympus Mons, the highest mountain in the solar system. Another ventures to the Mars Pathfinder landing site to reclaim the 40-year-old hardware as a priceless museum piece. Waterman leads a trek to Ares Vallis, where on the first expedition he saw what he thought was an ancient cliff dwelling. Throughout all this activity, things start going wrong, and a crew member becomes paranoid about real or imagined sabotage. Other crew members fall in love, or lust, and yet others become occupied with the future exploitation of Mars as a tourist trap.Bova keeps the action going; the plot seems a little more polished than that of the first book. He also wisely avoids medical detail, his Achilles heel in MARS and in other books. He continues to handle the politics of space travel deftly, and his grip on the physics is also sound. The characters are one-and-a-half dimensional, and the mystery aspect of the novel does not compare with the quality of non-sf mystery novels. Still, the end is satisfying and uplifting.In this unabridged audio version, the very competent Dick Hill returns as reader. A master of international accents, Hill meets this polyglot challenge nicely. However, I thought that his work here was not quite the tour de force of the first book. A couple of characterizations are so off-target they are somewhat funny. Latino astronaut Tomas Rodriguez sounds like the Taco Bell chihuahua, and African American astronaut Pete Connors comes across like James Earl Jones doing Darth Vader."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"Mars was an entertaining story and Bova did a good job of describing the technology needed for a first expedition to Mars. In Return to Mars Bova provides a sequel featuring the hero of the first novel, Jamie Waterman, in charge of the second expedition. The story is familiar and there aren't any significant developments in the technology to justify a second novel. Return to Mars is entertaining if familiar.Like Mars crew tensions are a greater danger than an alien planet. Waterman faces his leadership being undermined and there may be a saboteur in the ranks. With 5 men and 3 women there is also some sexual tension. This is extremely familiar ground and Bova doesn't bring anything new to it to justify a novel.Bova does write a good, workmanlike if formulaic novel. He is at his best describing Martian sandstorms and trips across the Martian surface. The Olympus Mons trip is memorable, as are the images of people dangling over huge Martian cliffs. Mars concluded with the possibility that Martian ruins might exist. The possibility is further explored in Return to Mars. Bova does a good job establishing a mystery. Who is losing it and whom will they kill or injure along the way? It's Agatha Christie's \\"Ten Little Indians\\" on Mars.Bova generally does a good job with the technology although I had some problems. For instance, the plastic greenhouse that's described doesn't meet the level of technology that's currently available let alone what we might have 40 years hence. An important plot element involves the single sheet of plastic that's used to cover the greenhouse. Current greenhouses use a double layer of plastic with the space between the two layers pressurized providing much greater insulation value.Also, there are loose ends. For instance, the group's repairman has trouble repairing a piece of equipment and the reader expects a revelation but it never comes. The reader is left to wonder what he eventually found wrong.The novel is also politically correct. It has some dubious science like the alpha male concept which is a great idea for wolves. Ultimately it's quite predictable although there are a couple of nice twists. It's entertaining enough and a much easier read than Red Mars but it is an unnecessary sequel."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"I enjoyed Mars by ben Bova and was eager to read the sequel to learn the secrets that planet Mars has to offer humanity. I was disappointed to find that this book is merely a repeat of Mars with a different cast of characters.Jamie Waterman, the geologist from the first mission to Mars, heads up the second team to see if Mars can be lucrative for business. As in the previous novel, Jamie has problems with male team members and hits the sack with a female team member. It seems tha Mr. Bova hit on a good thing and simply stuck with it.The highlight of this book was discovering that the cliff dwellings that Jamie thought he saw in the first book were real. The decsriptions of the cliff dwellings were wonderful and make you imagine that there was life on Mars at one time in history. What a scary concept."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"Having read and enjoyed &quot;Mars&quot; on it's release, I picked up a copy of &quot;Return To Mars&quot; hoping the sequel could sustain the quality of the original. A chapter into the book I knew that Ben had done it again and I was once again immersed in a martian landscape so beautifully described that you will believe humans have walked on it's surface. It could be read as a stand alone novel but,to gain the most from this marvellously entertaining read, you should read &quot;Mars&quot; first. Let's hope Dr Bova has another Mars novel on the way, his work is always worth reading."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"Mr. Ben Bova needs to learn how to hide his atheistic socialist doctrine a little better while writing. I have no problem with his agenda except that, it cluters the book with non-sensical reverse racism. The base line of the story is intense and incredible but, he smacks capitalism at every chance he gets. His books sell because of capitalism. I find the reverse racist innuendo's quite boring. Mr. Bova's science is dead on, it generates good movement until he stumbles upon affirmative action in space. Kim Stanley Robinson has done a much better job, considering they both hold the same agenda. RED MARS, GREEN MARS and BLUE MARS are worth the time involved. Mr. Bova should consider writing socialist doctrine if he feels so strongly about it. Drop the backwater agenda and it's a decent read."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"Heck, it wasn't until page 291 that they, Jamie and Dex, finally checked out the ruins, which is what I was waiting for! What a boring boring book. My first Ben Bova, my LAST. The reviewer from Atlanta, GA has it right &quot; melange of superficiality and blandness&quot;."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"In the tradition of Western writers Zane Gray and Louis L'Amour, science fiction author Ben Bova knows how to put you into a setting and make it real. One dimensional characters are the rule with all three writers, but with the Western guys that was OK because the setting WAS the story.Not so with Mr. Bova. His often and loudly trumpeted agenda gets in the way. It goes something like this: Archaeology is OK. Tourism is not OK. The only way science can get the money to explore is to participate in the destruction of that which they are exploring in order to get more money to continue to explore, etc. etc. We MUST explore Mars, but we can't make it worth our while economically since this would feed the pockets of the evil Capitalist swine back on Earth who fund the program which is the only way we can continue to explore mars, and we MUST explore mars, and so on ad nauseum. It is up to Jamie Waterman, 1/2 Navaho, to try to keep the funding for Mars explorations while (despite the efforts of the evil Capitalist Dex who evidently wants to turn the entire planet into a huge McDonald's) save the land for the exclusive use of the long dead spirits of his ancestral cliff-dwellers. Huh? Gimme a break.The \\"message\\" part of this book reads as if it were written by a high school kid who is newly ablaze with mysticism and desire to save the ecology. It's like Al Gore meets Arthur C. Clark. Strange bedfellows. What's next, Mr. Spock meets Hillary Clinton for the cosmic clash: \\"Live long and prosper despite having to pay for Universal Galactic Health Care\\"?Also, doesn't Bova have an editor? Why tell us about that newfangled fuel cell twice? Why use the term \\"There is that\\" fifteen times? What is this word \\"dint\\" for \\"didn't\\"?Anyway, Bova has a knack for putting you there in an alien environment, but after you look around in wonder for a few minutes, you wonder if you want to stay. With Waterman, Dex and Ben Bova's other characters I dint enjoy my Return to Mars."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"Return to Mars is a tale of interplanetary exploration which is flawed by stereotypical charectors (the evil businessman, the \\"spiritual\\" American Indian, the man-child who hates his father) and a politicaly correct message. The message, which Bova beats the reader over the head with the subtalty of a sledgehammer, interfeers with what otherwise is an exciting story of exploration rich with scientific and technical detail. Those space enthusiasts who dream of Mars as a new home for human kind will likely take exception to Bova's anticapitalist, antihuman tone and the message that Mars must become a science reserve, closed to human settlement and development. Because of this controversial view, Return to Mars if nothing else might stirr heated debate on what shape space exploration should take in the coming century.--Mark R.

I am still reading this one, but it has taken up the primary position in my bedside Kindle."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"I did not realize that some ebooks had the text reading diabled if I had know this and was at a computer at the time I would have returned both the books."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"As a disclaimer for my review, I'll mention that I'm trying to read all of the Grand Tour (17ish) books in their chronological order - which is not the order they were written in. Return to Mars is (arguably) the sixth book in the chronological order.Return to Mars finds Jamie Waterman, protagonist of Mars, leading the 2nd expedition to our red neighbor along with a group of seven other scientists and astronauts. Unlike Mars, where the team only had a month to explore, in Return to Mars the research team is coming in for an extended 18 month stay. After the discovery of life on Mars in the previous book, the group will continue their search for new small-scale life, explore more of the surface, including a trip into Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in our solar system, and a return to Mars' \\"Grand Canyon\\" where the first martian life was found, and where Jamie thought he had spotted a cliff dwelling indicating that intelligent life may once have lived on Mars. In addition to confronting the harsh environment of Mars, they will have to deal with personality conflicts among the team, play politics with the man responsible for bankrolling the expedition and face the fact that they have a saboteur among them.As with all of the Grand Tour books so far, Return to Mars is narrated by several of the main characters and includes small bits of back story on a few of them. High points of Return to Mars include Bova's ability to immerse the reader in being there on Mars. The descriptions of Mars and its environment feel very real and are well done. The pacing and sense of adventure is also good and there was no point in the story where it felt bogged down. While Return to Mars doesn't contain a lot of action, there's plenty of adventure and discovery. Introduced as diary entries every couple of chapters the saboteur plot element is also well done. We can see the saboteur slowly become more unhinged and unstable as their attempts to force the team to leave Mars become more and more dangerous. This really was a good mystery and at certain times I though the person responsible for the increasing level of sabotage could have been almost anyone on the team exculding Jamie and Dex.The biggest drawback to me in Return to Mars (and what prevented me from giving it five stars) were the extreme points of view of Bova's characters. One of the conflicts faced throughout most of the book is what to do with Mars. Jamie wants to keep Mars pure and safe for future research while his chief rival on the team, Dex Trumball (one of the geologists on the team) and his Dex's father (who bankrolled this 2nd expedition) want to open Mars up for tourism, sell its relics (some of the previous landers) to the highest bidder and basically turn Mars into an amusement park. The problem is that both characters pursue their side of the argument to such an unbending level that they both become caricatures for their cause. Their inability to reach a compromise or even see the other's point of view borders on ridiculous (until the end of the book when Dex has a change of heart). Is it so impossible to think that we couldn't have some level of tourism on Mars without contaminating the whole planet? That's what we're supposed to believe.Like many Bova books, there's too much high-school sexual angst among the characters. Jamie and Dex battle for the love of the mandatory hot, female scientist. We're also privy to every other character's sexual activity, leading to most of the crew being very one-note. They're either doing some science related thing, or they're hooking up, trying to hook up, or talking about other team members hooking up. With one exception (\\"Possum\\" Craig), these two things are the only interest the other team members have. It's very overdone and quickly falls into a pattern of smart, successful scientists acting like love-lorn 15 year olds.In summary, Return to Mars, despite sometimes being held back by repetitive and often wooden \\"romance\\" and the extreme nature of the characters is a good adventure. Had it focused less on \\"who's doing it\\" and more on the adventure and discovery, it might have elevated to being great."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"Jamie Waterman is back and this time he is leading the second expedition to Mars. In the first book, Waterman, a geologist and half-Navajo Indian, glimpsed something that looked like artificial construction near the end of the first manned expedition to the Red Planet. Now he and a new team of astronauts and scientists are set to return to Mars to look for answers to many of the questions that remain from the first mission. The strength of this novel lies in Dr. Bova's description of the expedition, what it would take to get to and survive on Mars, what are some of the perils and challenges, and what might we find when we get there. You'll learn a little bit about the geology of Mars, how it is different than Earth, and how difficult it would be to perform even the simplest task on the surface of Mars. This might make it sounds as if this novel is a textbook - it is not. Bova mixes the background and detail smoothly with the dialogue making for an easy and enjoyable read. The primary thread of the novel, the confirmation of the purported ruins seen by Jamie in the first novel is particularly well done and compelling. Are the ruins real or where they a figment of Jamie's imagination - read the novel and find out! Some of the secondary threads are less interesting (hence the rating of only 4 stars). The primary drawback to this novel is that it is too much like 'Days of our Lives' on Mars. Too much space in the novel is wasted (in my opinion) on who has the hots for who. The petty personal and sexual intrigues are just that, petty, and not very interesting. Bova is trying to make believable, three dimensional characters, but they come across as juvenile, not complex. For any Trekkies who are reading this review, some of the dialogue in this novel reminded me of the TNG story Casino Royale! Bottom line is that this is a good, but not uniquely outstanding, sci-fi story, and if you liked 'Mars' or Bova in general, you'll like this novel. It isn't something you'll be returning to again and again though. There are also several open plot threads that presumably have been addressed in the third novel (Mars Life). Finally, in spite of what Dr. Bova says on his webpage that the Grand Tour novels can be read in any order, I'd definitely read 'Mars' before this one."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"With the Martian rovers Spirit and Opportunity driving around Mars and sending us back some thousands of pictures you have to ask yourself if a book on the first manned trips to mars makes sense. Strangely enough, even though this book is now 10 years old, the answer is yes.To be sure there are some problems with the book that has made it outdated. But it is a lot more current than the first book in the series called simply Mars.But all in all, I found this book to be better than the first. There aren't as many characters and thus the story is somewhat tighter with more time available to define their personalities.These are just a couple of the interesting points about the book. Forget the forbidding, desolate pictures from Spirit and Opportunity and have a good time with this book.This is the second book in the Mars series recorded by Stefan Rudnicki.

Now, he's going back again, this time as mission commander in Ben Bova's great follow-up novel.In this installment, Jamie has been installed as mission commander. He hopes to be able to further explore the rock formation he discovered in the Tithonium Chasma on the first expedition. He's in charge of seven other members in this expedition. Included in the mission are Stacy Dezhurova, Dex Trumball, Possum Craig, Trudy Hall, Vijay Shektar, Mitsuo Fuchida, and Tomas Rodriguez. After a five-month flight from earth, the crew had finally reached their destination. Dex is the son of Darryl C. Trumball, an American billionaire who has put up most of the funding for the mission. He had hoped that his son would be named mission commander and only reluctantly accepted Jamie as commander. Dex and his father hoped to exploit possible commercial and tourist activities on Mars, while Jamie hoped to keep the planet pristine and explore its vast amounts of uncharted wilderness.Almost immediately, tensions begin to flare between Jamie and Dex. To make matters worse, Dex and Jamie both seem romantically interested in Vijay. Despite their rivalry, Dex and Jamie begin to work together and, as the book goes on, even develop a strong friendship. Dex begins to have serious doubts about his father's grand scheme of making Mars into a tourist destination. As time goes on, he reveals more and more of his true feelings to Jamie. Jamie wants Mars preserved as is and slowly, Dex begins to believe that Jamie's course of action is best. Vijay's and Jamie's relationship deepens as well.Studies are carried out at the Tithonium Chasma and it is discovered that Jamie's rock dwelling is indeed the remnants of an ancient civilization of Martians. Upon analysis of rock samples taken from the site, it is determined that the structure is approximately 65 million years old; the same age as the earth was when the dinosaurs were wiped out. This discovery leads the expedition members to believe that life on Mars ended at about the same time.Problems have arisen for the expedition as well. Fuchida believes that there is a saboteur among the group. Several strange occurances have happened that cannot be explained as simple coincidence. Now, the group must watch out for further acts of sabotage. Unfortunately, another takes place, this time with devastating consequences.Dex's father is still determined to see his dream of having Mars as a tourist destination fulfilled. So, he gets a seat on a re-supply ship destined for Mars. Mr. Trumball hopes to \\"claim\\" the part of Mars being researched as his own. That way, he can proceed with his vision. However, Jamie, with Dex's help, has decided to stake a claim for the Navajo nation in hopes of leaving Mars as is. Jamie also learns that he must remain behind after the others leave in order to enforce his claim. So, after the final act of sabotage forces the rest of the group to leave for Earth early, Jamie has decided to remain until the re-supply ship arrives to stake the claim for the Navajo nation. But, he's not alone; Vijay has decided to stay as well.This is an excellent book. The story is well-conceived, and the development of the characters is first-rate. I've read several of Bova's books, and I've enjoyed \\"Mars\\" and \\"Return to Mars\\" the most. I hope that there will be a third installment to finish the story. This book and its predecessor are must reads for sci-fi fans."},{"Title":"Return to Mars","review":"Perhaps that was a spoiler. Other reviewers have already mentioned that the protagonist of this novel was a Navaho Indian. I think that gives a unique slant to what could have been another \\"hardware opera\\". (For the record, I don't usually read realistic novels about space exploration because I'm not that interested in descriptions of rovers, landers etc.)For me, what made this novel unique was that for once, the money-hungry developers DIDN'T get their way. Another unique touch was Jamie's real love for the planet Mars. Can any of us imagine WANTING to live on Mars? I can't. Jamie's protectiveness and reverence for the Red Planet are unusual in space fiction. Some reviewers are calling this \\"leftist\\" but I think this sort of consciousness is parallel to an increased respect for Earth as a living organism (Gaia). Call me mystical but I wonder whether all planetary bodies have some sort of integrity which ought not to be violated by money-hungry developers.But what I enjoyed most was the portrayal of the discovery of the Martian village. We see a lot of ET's and aliens in space opera fiction, but it is another thing to imagine actually discovering intelligent life, or its remains. Bova handled this glorious moment wonderfully."},{"Title":"Fact, Value, and God","review":"[...]In his preface to Fact, Value, and God (Eerdmans 1997), Arthur Holmes describes his primary objective in writing this book:\\"This book began as an attempt to explore historical ways of grounding moral values objectively in the nature of reality. Unconvinced that we live in a value-free universe, that fact and value are ultimately unrelated, or that we have to create all our own values rather than discovering the good, I wanted to explore the fact-value connection in the larger context of metaphysical and theological views.\\" (vii)Based on the findings of his study, Holmes concludes, \\"What emerged is a more pervasive linkage than I had anticipated between religious and moral beliefs. ...[T]he claim that values are somehow objective, \`out there,' is the legacy on which we still need to draw\\" (vii). What follows, then, is the unfolding of Holmes's case for the historical relationship between religious and ethical views, a link that Holmes believes should be continued (or revived) in contemporary ethical discussion. As Holmes argues, \\"The relationship of theological facts to moral values is inescapable, unless the existence of theological facts is denied\\" (viii).The bulk of Fact, Value, and God is thus descriptive, leading the reader through the long history of ethical theorizing from the pre-Socratics all the way to Nietzsche. In chapter 1, \\"Cosmic Justice and the Pre-Socratics,\\" Holmes describes how the pre-Socratics began to question the Homeric view of an impersonal cosmic Fate (Moira) and subsequently developed \\"the idea of a law-governed universe\\" (2). Though the pre-Socratics were not uniform in this regard, and some even rejected it outright, this development nonetheless paved the way for Plato's theory of universals or forms as the basis of morality, which Holmes's describes in chapter 2, \\"Plato and the Improvement of the Soul.\\" Holmes discusses how Plato grounds morality in the form of the Good, which in the Timaeus is connected to Plato's conception of God. Then in chapter 3, \\"Aristotle and Nature's Teleology,\\" Holmes argues that despite Aristotle's many divergences from Plato's thought, he nevertheless likewise stressed the importance of God in his account of morality. For Aristotle God is the \\"measure of all things, for only God is perfectly good. In reality, the human telos, our highest end, is God\\" (30).In the next three chapters, Holmes discusses how the views of Plato and Aristotle find their fullest expression in early Christian thought, most notably in Augustine's integration of Plato's philosophy and Aquinas's integration of Aristotle's. Goodness is wedded to various degrees of being, and God as the pinnacle of Being is thus the standard of goodness. For the early Christian tradition, then, goodness is grounded in the being of God, while the law is grounded in the very order of the universe, as designed by the divine Logos. Morality is grounded in reality. Holmes labels this view--that the \\"entire cosmic order is intrinsically teleological\\"--the \\"maximalist position\\" (173). In later chapters he also finds this maximalist position worked out differently through the moral philosophies of the Cambridge Platonists (ch. 9), Kant (ch. 10) and Hegel (ch. 11).However, in chapter 7, \\"Scotus, Ockham, and the Reformers: What God Commands,\\" Holmes describes the gradual shift away from this maximalist position to the more nominalist idea that values are not inherent to reality, but are entirely contingent on God's commands, governance, and human rationality. Labeling this the \\"minimalist position\\" (174), Holmes argues that\\"The outcome of all this is the rejection of a metaphysically grounded natural law ethic and of the idea of a moral universe. The intrinsic union of fact and value is no longer accepted. Instead, we rely on God-given reason to prudently order our present world. The theist may well find this initially acceptable. But when the underlying theology gets discarded and replaced by mechanistic empirical science, then a relativistic and consequentialist ethics is likely to prevail.\\" (77)Indeed, this outcome is precisely what Holmes finds historically, as the minimalist position is eventually advocated in the humanistic forms of the likes of Hobbes and Mill.Between these two extremes, Holmes locates a \\"mediating position,\\" which \\"limits itself to moral psychology\\" (173). According to this view, which Holmes finds in the moral systems of Descartes, Hume, and Reid, God's purposes provide the \\"psychological foundations of morals,\\" though the natural world is still viewed mechanistically rather than teleologically.Finally, Holmes offers a fourth position, represented by Nietzsche (ch. 13), in which God is removed completely from the equation and morals are seen as purely human conventions in the never ending struggle for power. Homes aptly calls this the \\"moral skeptics' position\\" (174). Holmes argues that while Nietzsche's perspectivalism offers a much needed critique to an overconfident foundationalist view, his argument is primarily epistemological rather than ontological. Thus, it does not address the metaphysical question of the relation of fact and value. Holmes thus argues in his concluding chapter that in the wake of Nietzsche's criticisms and the stranglehold they have had on ethical theory in the past century, it is time to \\"reopen the fact-value question\\" (174). Holmes concludes with four issues that need to be brought to bear on this discussion: (1) the historical \\"appeal of philosophers, even in the minimalist position, to the will of God in regard to ethics\\" (174); (2) the \\"need to reopen the discussion of teleology that was aborted by the rise of mechanistic science\\" (176); (3) the importance of \\"the Logos doctrine [as] the theological basis for a developing theory of universals; and finally, (4) the need to remember the \\"holistic nature of worldviews\\" when addressing particular metaphysical, theological, or ethical questions (179).The first thing that should be noted about Holmes's argument is that it is rather difficult to follow. I think this is due to a few related factors. First, Holmes does not clearly distinguish between his two closely related but nonetheless separate theses: (1) that there is a strong historical connection between (theological) facts and (moral) values and (2) that there is an actual metaphysical connection between facts and values. Holmes thus walks a fine line between intellectual historian and meta-ethicist, and it is sometimes unclear which hat he is wearing at any given time. Secondly, the bulk of his discussion is arranged chronologically, while the primary associations he draws among the various philosophers for his argument have less to do with chronological relationships than with formal similarities among the various philosophers' positions. Certainly Holmes finds general historical trends, but his final categorizations between the maximalist, mediating, minimalist, and skeptic's positions in many instances have little to do with historical arrangement. These ahistorical associations were thus rather unclear throughout the bulk of the reading. Finally, and perhaps more significantly, Holmes waits until the last chapter to lay out his argument in any detail. While he does offer a couple pointers toward the direction he will be taken in his preface, he saves the primary presentation of his argument until the conclusion of the book. Perhaps this was for rhetorical effect, but I found it a bit disorienting throughout the bulk of the book. If I were to recommend this book, I would thus suggest reading the final chapter first, and then going back through the book from the beginning. Otherwise it may be easy to get stuck in tangential historical discussions that may or may not be directly relevant to Holmes's primary argument.Regarding the substance of his argument, I have stated that Holmes actually proposes two distinct though related theses: (1) that there is a strong historical connection between (theological) facts and (moral) values and (2) that there is an actual metaphysical connection between facts and values. As one not as well read in historical philosophy as I should be, I am in no position to assess the first of Holmes's theses. All I can say is that if Holmes's presentation of these historical views has any degree of accuracy, then it seems that the first of his theses stands. While I am a bit dubious about some of the connections Holmes draws--for example, it seems rather odd that Calvin and Hobbes wind up in the same category (comics notwithstanding)--on the whole it appears that Holmes has been careful with the evidence.Holmes's second (and perhaps primary) thesis is significantly more interesting, but it also may require a bit more defending. Here he moves from mere historical description to an actual philosophical thesis. In order to prove this thesis--that fact and value are somehow related metaphysically--he needs to offer more than a historical survey. For it seems that based on the historical evidence presented here, one could justifiably conclude: Yes, I know for most of intellectual history, fact and value were indeed associated, but I just happen to think that Nietzsche got it right! To respond to this assertion using philosophical tradition alone would be like using Patristic texts to argue against open theism or anthropological materialism. The proponents of these views are aware of these authoritative writings; they just reject them in light of other reasons or evidence.So what reasons or evidence (other than the historical tradition) does Holmes employ? None that I can find. However, if we look more closely at his argument, we will see why he does not offer any evidence for the fact-value relationship. Even though he clearly believes that there is such a relationship, his second argument is not for this relationship per se but is rather simply for the need to reopen the fact-value question. As support for this thesis, Holmes believes that philosophical history does serve as evidence. He states that the fact-value relationship's \\"long influence in several strands of philosophy, its ongoing fruitfulness, and its agility in the fact of objections, all argue for its continued viability\\" (174). Holmes thus seems aware that the historical evidence is not enough to establish the metaphysical fact-value connection. But despite appearances to the contrary, he is not out to establish that metaphysical connection after all. Rather he is simply attempting to lay the groundwork for future discussion on this question, which he believes will be able to finally make the connection clear. Instead of concluding with arguments, then, Holmes contents himself with establishing four key issues for future discussion (described above).Perhaps I am simply a bit dense and was thus unable to initially pick up on the nuance of Holmes's theses and the self-imposed limitation of scope of his argument. After all, it is a rather tall order to defend a historical thesis and a philosophical one in a single 180 page book. However, I think Holmes would have done well to make his purposes a bit more explicit from the outset. Like philosophical works of old, it would have helped for Holmes to add a simple subtitle along the lines of, Prolegomena to any Future Ethical Theory or Groundwork for Rethinking the Fact-Value Question. All that notwithstanding, I think Holmes has raised an important question in this book, which does need to be followed up by future philosophical work. But to steal Holmes's conclusion, I will simply confess that that is beyond the scope of this review."},{"Title":"Fact, Value, and God","review":"In a very brief work , the author lays down an account of the ontological cause of liberal evasion so often evident in current western thought,political institutions and actions.

In other words, Mary gave birth without the destruction of the physical signs of virginity possessed by one who is virgin in conception, and without labor pains and other infirmities (e.g., rupturing, bleeding, etc.) involved in childbearing after the fall. It was, in reality, a 'miraculous birth,' which relates more to her role in the new creation---and thus her Immaculate Conception and Assumption---rather than her virginity before and after.\\" (Pg. 109)\\"In fact, further examination of the texts alone reveals that at least some of these purported 'brothers' were NOT the children of Mary. Indeed, nowhere in Scripture is the Blessed Virgin Mary ever identified as the mother of anyone other than Jesus.\\" (Pg. 113-114)\\"I continued to struggle with the repetitive nature of the Rosary (didn't Jesus condemn repetitive prayer as vain?) until I read an introduction to the Rosary by a nun. She asked the question, 'How many times a day might a young child run to you and say, 'Mommy, I love you!'?\\" (Pg. 143)\\"According to the popes, the Rosary is the most highly recommended prayer in the Catholic Church, second only to the liturgy.

Because it only covers three days in the war, this gripping story is compact, very detailed and to the point. It covers all factors that made this war so different from any others the US has fought--the young age of the soldiers and leaders, the politics, and the differing opinions among the soldiers, some commanders, the press, the politicans, and the government. I can relate to some of the reactions of people to this war because (but for the grace of God) I was sent to Korea to serve instead of Vietnam at this time. It certainly was a different kind of war, fought in a very unusual environment, with little support from home, and it was going on while the US was going through social and political upheaval.

But now I think I do understand, because of the characters in this book. They were young and didn't want to be in Vietnam, giving their best under the circumstances, but all they wanted was to get back home. Reading, I found myself holding my breath hoping that they would. I found the book easy to read. There are glossaries for military and Vietnamese terms, which were helpful.

Almost every \\"chapter\\" is only two pages long and provides a concise, to the point, impactful, and convicting discussion of that relative topic. Tozer exemplifies the directive that we (Christians) should spur each other onward and help eachother to live a Spirit lead and Spirit filled life.

Get this book and get ready to go deeper with God! Only one drawback...and this is something I've noticed with other Tozer reprints as well...the book itself is fairly poorly edited and contains some grammatical errors, incomplete sentences and wrongly used words. For example in one of his books (can't remember if it was this one) they use \\"feeling\\" instead of \\"filling\\" and there are other various mistakes where the word used does not make sense contextually and another word was meant. I would recommend getting an original edition if you can find it. It does not make sense to me how there can be so many mistakes in these reprints...the only thing I can think of is the printer used some kind of word/text recognition software when scanning the original books and then assumed that was good enough.

Once again she has brought her research skills, integrity, knowledge and compassion to the story of the life of an American musical genius. She presents a straightforward and unblinking account of a composer whose works are classics, whose productivity was astounding, and whose sadness as a person belied the upbeat and joyous tunes he bequeathed to us. I grew up with Rodgers' songs and have enjoyed many of his musicals over the years, on stage as well as in the movies. I feel grateful for the beauty he brought - and brings - into my life. I wish he had had a happier life. Secrest does a superb job in bringing the complexity of this man to the reader. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Somewhere For Me A Biography Of Richard Rogers","review":"Meryle Secrest has written what was hoped to be the definitive bio of Richard Rodgers. Her research and her interviews with Rodgers' daughters, Mary Rodgers Guettel and Linda Rodgers Emery, should have produced a great book, but such is, regrettably, not the case.Secrest is long on information and very short indeed on conclusions, a serious shortcoming in a book dealing with the impact of supressed emotions, alcoholism, infidelity, and displaced anger on the lives of Richard Rodgers and his wife, Dorothy . The author relates anecdotes, lists achievements, and tells tales, but then makes very little effort to weave her material into anything that might help us understand this complicated man and his even more complicated wife. We are told that Rodgers was remarkably unfaithful to his wife for nearly half a century, and we are told that she had her disagreeable side, but what effect, if any, did the unfaithfulness have on the disagreeableness? Secrest doesn't go there; what few conclusions that are drawn about the Rodgerses' behaviour are in the interview material.Early in the book, Secrest promises to say as much about Dorothy Rodgers as her husband. Not only does that not happen, the references to Mrs. Rodgers are largely negative. She is painted as insecure, greedy, addicted to Demerol, and with shallow interests in decorating and design. The author trivialises the famed Rodgers art collection as canned 'Christmas gifts' that the husband and wife could exchange; she failed to discover, or perhaps merely to relate, that major pieces from the collection (particularly the Toulouse-Lautrec gouache of Mme. Natanson) delight thousands of visitors to the Metropolitan Museum, to whom they were willed. Not only is Dorothy Rodgers' incredible eye for art thus diminished by Secrest, Mrs. Rodgers' philanthropic and charitable efforts also get short shrift. Worst of all, Secrest tells us that Mrs. Rodgers' father committed suicide, and then does nothing to relate that to the pain of her husband's serial infidelities. Might not a woman who has lost one significant male in her life need stability from the remaining one? Might not every infidelity feel like a fresh loss to someone thus wounded?There is also a bothersome error when the author describes the couple's summer house in Fairfield (the famous &quot;House In My Head&quot; of Dorothy Rodgers' book of the same name) as &quot;completely walled in glass&quot;. The barest look at the illustrations in Mrs. Rodgers' book shows clearly that the house was glass-walled on only one elevation, with large windows elsewhere. Such an easily avoided error casts doubt on other assertions.The wealth of information presented in this work could have made a wonderful book that spoke volumes about the pain of depression and addiction, the trauma of living in a hollow marriage, and the futility of trying to keep family secrets. And surely, something could have been made of the tendency of both husband and wife to create beauty professionally, when they had very little in their emotional lives. Instead, Secrest chooses much the same road the Rodgerses did: Entertain without going down messy psychic paths. Perhaps biographers who do not learn from the mistakes of their subjects are doomed to repeat them."},{"Title":"Somewhere For Me A Biography Of Richard Rogers","review":"We can be grateful to Secrest for toiling on Rodgers with her usual thorougness and objectivity, and for doing so when many of Rodgers's friends and colleagues, not to mention his thoughtful daughters, are still here to contribute. If the result is not quite as good a read as her works on Bernstein and Sondheim, we have to blame the subject, not the author. Rodgers was not an easy man to get to know, and while his music was often original and sophisticated, his life was marked by a dull and distant anger. A lesser biographer might have added a larger dose of amateur psychoanalysis and squeezed more dramatic juice out of alcohol and infidelity, but Secrest knows that her job is to depict a life, not to make a sport of it. Given the scope of Rodgers's influence on 20th century culture, Secrest's book will no doubt be invaluable when this fascinating musical era is approached by future writers."},{"Title":"Somewhere For Me A Biography Of Richard Rogers","review":"Meryrle Secrest's previous book, &quot;Stephen Sondheim: A Life&quot; was fantastic; every word was perfectly placed, every nuance was properly shaded (much like Sondheim himself). Unfortunately, this biography of one of the most complex and dissonant men to come out of the American Musical Theatre, Richard Rodgers, loses steam almost halfway through the narrative. It's as if the author lost interest in her subject between &quot;Carousel&quot; and &quot;The King and I.&quot;To give Secrest proper credit, her chapters concerning Rodgers' collaboration with the tempestuous Larry Hart are truly engrossing and very lively. However, the Hammerstein and Post-Hammerstein years seem to be written in haste, or with no care at all.This book should be read by all devotees of the stage musical, just for its chapters on Rodgers and Hart. Otherwise, I strongly encourage that you read Ethan Mordden's book &quot;Rodgers and Hammerstein&quot; for a better view of the latter collaboration."},{"Title":"Somewhere For Me A Biography Of Richard Rogers","review":"Richard Rogers is a hard nut to crack. Author Secrest does a workmanlike job of peeling back the layers, but can't quite reach the inner core that made Rogers the composer-genius he was. Rogers was urbane, witty, hypochondriacal, magnetizing, petty, alcoholic, competitive, gloomy, secretive, philandering and funny. How do all of these traits combine to bring about some of the most beautiful songs of the 20th century? Reading about Richard Rogers and then hearing -- say \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" from \\"Carousel\\" makes you exclaim (like Oprah), \\"How'd he DO that?\\"Richard Rogers was born to a moderately wealthy Jewish family in New York City. He was composing music for the stage by the time he was seventeen. He had his first Broadway hit by the time he was 24, and after he partnered with Lorenz Hart produced one hit after another. In the meantime, he married the fragile beauty Dorothy, had two daughters and became increasingly wealthy. Sounds like a trip to the pinnacle, a stairway to the stars, doesn't it? Well, not exactly. Rogers and Hart broke up mainly because of Hart's alcoholism and mental fragility. But Rogers got the rap for \\"deserting\\" him and banning him from the theatre. This wasn't quite fair to Rogers, but it wasn't untrue either. Rogers' storybook marriage was complex also. Dorothy was a perfectionist and emotionally needy. Rogers' response was a parade of infidelity. And yet. I believe Rogers loved her all his life as much as he was able to love anyone, and she fulfilled some deep-seated need in him. As parents, they both were failures. The daughters were marginally fonder of Richard who they considered distant and savagely critical. Dorothy was seen as a selfish tyrant. The daughters' recollections are not kind. His last years were a combination of poor health, increasing alcoholism, and being out of touch with modern day musicals. Yet honors were heaped upon him and the money kept pouring in.Ms. Secrest did a mountain of research, and it shows. She not only had the full cooperation of his daughters; they commissioned her to do the work. The book is well notated and indexed, and has a bibliography. She gives a fair and balanced accounting of a many-sided man. There are not many lighthearted moments, but Richard Rogers was not a lighthearted man.-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Somewhere For Me A Biography Of Richard Rogers","review":"&quot;Somewhere For Me&quot; is one of the better biographies of Richard Rodgers, focusing heavily on the personal life of the composer. It's all here, warts and all. From his battles with the bottle, to his roving eye, his depression, hypochondria, and so on. The book does focus heavily on his relationship with Dorothy Rodgers, but doesn't really attempt to explain why he strayed in their marriage. Also, the book at times does focus a little bit too much on Dorothy, and Lorenz Hart, but Oscar Hammerstein, with whom Rodgers did his most significant writing, is almost pushed to the background. For example, the famous rift between the two after Hammerstein strived for some time to write &quot;Hello, Young Lovers,&quot; only for Rodgers to call the song &quot;adequate,&quot; is not even mentioned except in passing. And Hammerstein's ire over it is never mentioned. As another reviewer writes, the film versions of the major Rodgers and Hammerstein films &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; were ones in which Rodgers was heavily involved. The author also erronously states that the film of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; was viewed as unsuccessful in its initial release; and the immensely popular and heavily panned film of &quot;South Pacific&quot; only gets minimal mention. Both deserve more attention in any Rodgers biography, because the films of these plays (and &quot;The King and I&quot; and, of course &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;) are probably the most accessible Rodgers works available to the reader. Nonetheless, this book does shed more light on Richard Rodgers the person than any volume I've read on him. For as lengthy a book it is, you'd like to think the above areas received more attention. Still, even though his works may not get quite as much attention, you'll learn more about Richard Rodgers the man in this book. Perhaps a good complement to it would be Rodgers' biography &quot;Musical Stages&quot; and Hugh Fordin's biography of Oscar Hammerstein, &quot;Getting to Know Him.&quot;"},{"Title":"Somewhere For Me A Biography Of Richard Rogers","review":"My knowledge of Richard Rodgers was limited to the fact that he wrote the music and Lorenz Hart wrote the words to a favorite song of mine entitled Manhattan. I wanted to learn more about the partnership of Rodgers and Hart and found them to be an odd couple of sorts. Hart was a genius in writing lyrics, but was a difficult man to work with due to his problem with alcohol. Rodgers finally had to find a new partner when Hart's health failed him and he could no longer be depended upon. Rodgers then hooked up with Oscar Hammerstein and the two of them gave the world Oklahoma, South Pacific, The King and I, The Sound of Music, and other treasured musicals. Rodgers also had an alcohol problem at this time when drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes was common in society. I suppose it still is. Rodgers and his lifelong wife, Dorothy, did not have a very happy marriage although they did their best to keep their marital problems hidden from the public. One of their children, a daughter Mary, was often ridiculed by her father for being what he considered to be fat. Retirement was not something Richard Rodgers would consider for himself. He always wanted to write the next musical. Irving Berlin lived in fear that he would never be able to write another hit song. Rodgers lived in fear of not be able to come up with another musical. Both showed their insecurities in their line of work. I feel the author does an excellent job in researching her subject. I rate the book four stars, not because I feel the book is lacking in any respect, but because it is a subject I had no knowledge of and my interest was held to about a four star level."},{"Title":"Somewhere For Me A Biography Of Richard Rogers","review":"An oddly cold biography. The author apparently has no particular love for her subject, his music, or for the musical theatre. She describes all three dispassionately, most likely getting her facts right and offering us occasional quotes from people who knew Rodgers. But the book itself never catches fire. I stayed with it to the end because I'm interested in the subject and not horrified by the fact that he may have been rather cold. But the book itself left me cold, which was a disappointment."},{"Title":"Somewhere For Me A Biography Of Richard Rogers","review":"A complicated man with a prodigious talent.

It's full of familiar stories and no new insights. The character of Rodgers himself never once comes alive; he remains a cypher. If you know anything at all about the history of musical theater, this is all very familier. Even the title is dull, drawn from Rodgers own clumsy lyrics for \\"No Strings\\". I could very easily put this book down, and in fact I did and never picked it up again."},{"Title":"Somewhere For Me A Biography Of Richard Rogers","review":"Secrest, a fine biographer (I enjoyed her book on Stephen Sondheim), now tackles Richard Rodgers, one of the greatest American composers ever and certainly a musical genius. The book is quite informative and paints vivid portraits of the dark, often cruel and (although stable) often drunk Rodgers, his homophobic and cruel horror of a wife Dorothy, his troubled early lyricist and friend Larry Hart, his second lyricist, the warm and wise Oscar Hammerstein (\\"Ockie\\" as friends and family called him), his two confused and rather neglected children, Mary and Linda, who simply wanted his love and attention and the other lyricists he worked less successfuly with- Martin Charnin, Sheldon Harnick and Stephen Sondheim.Rodgers was a deeply complex man and is thoroughly analyzed in this book. Despite his rather strange and dark personality, he did indeed give much joy to the world with his superb music. Secrest certainly makes note of this as wlel. Worth reading for music fans, theatre fans and anyone intersted in a fascinating story!"},{"Title":"Somewhere For Me A Biography Of Richard Rogers","review":"Book was quite in-depth, maybe too much so. The author hits you over the head time and time again about Rodgers' infidelities, his alcoholism, his aloofness. And it is a boring book for the most part. Relatively little on the collaborative part of writing for the theater, little on what went on creating many of the shows.Rodgers' wife is seen as a shrew and the less about her, the better.This rating would have been just one-star except for the huge amount of pictures all throughout the book. That aspect was quite well done."},{"Title":"Somewhere For Me A Biography Of Richard Rogers","review":"This is a thorough and detailed biography of one of the three or four greatest composers of popular music of the 20th century. We will not see his like again.Of course, one can not expect a book to capture a life. Especially a life as complex as was Richard Rodgers. But this book comes closest to lifting up the \\"curtain\\" and seeing behind the scenes. It obviously will not please everyone. But since it is a life of a particular person (not merely a composer) the focus is where it should be, on the man first and the music second. In his autobiography Mr. Rodgers explains that he can not account for his musical talents. But just a few pages earlier he describes how his older brother was closer to his father and that at the age of four he climbed up on the piano bench to try to please his operetta-loving mother. No wonder he wrote such beautiful waltzes. This book shines an unbiased light on Rodgers complexities and captures many of them."},{"Title":"Somewhere For Me A Biography Of Richard Rogers","review":"I'm in a good mood today, and feeling generous -- hence the two stars. Secrest learned that Rodgers could be a rotten person, that he drank and was a womanizer. She then proceeds to beat us over the head with it at great length. I didn't count the words, but it seemed like she spent more time on that then she did on Rodgers and Hammerstein -- not to mention the post-Hammerstein years. We learn nothing about how these shows came about and what happened to them beyond the most cursory; it's if her research there was limited to the notes on the cast albums. I've kept most of my theater books, except for this one. It went to the used book store."},{"Title":"Somewhere For Me A Biography Of Richard Rogers","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed in this book, which I found to be a dull recitation of facts.

I excelled at \\"calculating\\" stuff by simply plugging in numbers into some sort of equation our high school teachers would spoil us with, but when I got to college, I had to start thinking abstractly- and it bothered me a lot, because I had no idea how to test or prove the logic of some statement. I was doing very poorly in linear algebra and desperately needed help- lo and behold, my professors weren't helpful (at all). Someone recommended this proof writing book to me, and I am VERY grateful for that referral.The book takes the average student (it's shocking with how little math background one needs) and introduces him to basic boolean logic. You know, material like \\"If A is true, and B is false, then A implies B is false.\\" In a discrete mathematics course, one would call this \\"truth tables.\\" From there, the author takes the reader into set theory, basic proofs, group theory, etc- and into more advanced topics, like the Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein theorem, countability, etc. So what makes this book stand out?(1) Readability. Many math professors stop just short of taking pride in how confusing, abstract, or daunting their lectures can be. Velleman, however, goes the extra mile in the text to see that the reader UNDERSTANDS the logical buildup and concepts of mathematical proofs. Sure, set theory can be confusing- but after reading several other texts in discrete math, including \\"Discrete Math and its Applications\\" by Kenneth Rosen (if you're reading this, no offense) I've found that Velleman by far writes the most comprehensive and cohesive explanations for understanding set theory. Making the material accessible is the mark of a real \\"teacher,\\" and if you read through this book yourself, I believe you'd agree that Velleman is a pretty legit teacher.(2) Examples. There are plenty- plenty that Velleman works out himself. Reading the examples alone- and actually taking the time to understand them- is a task that's up to the reader, obviously, but they do show results almost immediately in understanding discrete math.(3) Problems (exercises). There's never a shortage of exercises, I found, as I tried to work through the problem set. There are plenty. Fortunately, there are some answers in the back, but just enough so that you can verify to see if you're understanding the material, and not enough so that you find yourself copying every answer in the back (even the best students get tempted to do that). Velleman gives the proper amount of answers in the back and a ton of exercises to do. If you complete them all properly, you'd be far ahead of the curve amongst math majors.I know my review may have been too wordy, or too optimistic. However, my feelings are very honest and not exaggerated: this book is written so one can learn discrete mathematics, and really helps the reader understand what higher math is all about- and how mathematicians think, write, and communicate. This book deserves an A+, and I've only given that score out to a handful of books."},{"Title":"How to Prove It: A Structured Approach","review":"All math teachers at the college level are familiar with students hitting the \\"struggling with proofs\\" wall. Students take calculus and do fairly well using the algorithms to differentiate and integrate functions and this continues into the first part of linear algebra. However, when it is time to understand and execute the proofs they experience a great deal of difficulty that many simply cannot overcome.This book is designed to present a set of techniques used in mathematical proofs and that aspect is well done. Yet, this book is also just as valuable for the thorough treatment of many of the foundational structures of mathematics. Those topics are:*) The logic of propositions and predicates*) Set theory*) Relations and functions*) Mathematical induction and recursion*) Infinite setsThe combination of a thorough introduction to these topics as well as demonstrating proof techniques applied to these objects is an excellent way to learn about them, so this book would be a valuable text in the foundations of mathematics.The more complex or difficult proofs are also presented in a very stepwise deconstruction, begun using a technique called scratch wok, where even the most insignificant details are included. Once the preliminary scratch work is completed, the formal proof is given. While experienced readers will find this tedious, beginners will find the clarity a relief. A large number of exercises are given at the ends of sections and chapters and solutions to many are included in an appendix.If you have a course in the foundations of mathematics for the early math major, this is a book that would be an excellent text. It would also be valuable as a supplemental reference text for all students taking a math course where understanding of proofs is required. Think of it as a boost over the wall."},{"Title":"How to Prove It: A Structured Approach","review":"Now I understand how proofs are being constructed. I can read and write them the right way! After reading this book I went back to my Calculus textbook and started looking at the proofs. I was amazed at how differently I perceived them. I actually enjoyed reading them and understood why they were written that way.A little info about the book. Basically, it teaches you the same material that you learn in a Discrete Mathematics course - Propositional logic, Sets and Proofs, Relations, Functions, and Mathematical Induction. However, it looks at those subjects from a completely different perspective. There's absolutely no practical information - all you do is prove stuff.I strongly advise to learn Discrete Math before reading this book, because getting straight to the proofs of the material, that you just have learned and have no previous experience with, can get very tough.The first two chapters were a bit boring and too easy - but only because I have already learned that stuff. Chapter 3 is where you start to do your own proofs and is where it gets fun.The exercises are not hard, and shouldn't present any trouble for the reader. However, I did find the exercises in the last 3 chapters to be more challenging. There were some problems on which I was simply staring for an hour, literally, trying to figure out the way to prove it. The theorem made sense to me, but I couldn't find a way to put into strict mathematical proof!

It is THE book to study when learning to prove propositions in mathematics.2. The book is very rigorous in its proofs, yet elementary enough that every student of mathematics can read it.3. Every student in mathematics--graduate or undergraduate--should read this book a few times in their life in order to write better proofs.4. The book contains solutions to many of its exercises.5. I have yet to read a book on mathematical proofs similar to the approach taken by this one in its chapter 3.6. The book contains an entire chapter on proofs, an entire chapter on relations, and an entire chapter on functions. Most (if not all) books on mathematical proofs devote much less time to such topics."},{"Title":"How to Prove It: A Structured Approach","review":"I would've rated this a 4 star or even a 5 if it had more than a few selected exercises answered in the back. Relatively easy to understand book but as far as self studying ... meh! Kind of an annoyance not having feedback that you REALLY understand the content. The kind of feedback you get from doing exercises and verifying your answers are right WITH AN ANSWERKEY! A FULL ANSWERKEY! Otherwise I'll just have to assume I'm right in all my answers and I know that can't be. Upside to this book (there are many) is that you will think you're the smartest person alive. But seriously if you don't want to passively learn math proofs I would go for a book that at least gives answers somewhere to assure you actually understand what you're reading. I say \\"passively learn\\" because while it does have the right amount of exercises, you could be getting them all wrong."},{"Title":"How to Prove It: A Structured Approach","review":"I've worked my way to mid chapter three, and so far I think it's a great book for self study thanks to pedagogical effort. This book really tries to *teach* the concepts and techniques, not just show them. Proofs are explained in detail and there are a lot of good examples. The structured approach is very rewarding and makes the proofs less complex, and the inclusion of logic and set theory makes it accessible also to those with little background in mathematics.A lot of the proofs though requires some pretty nifty algebra on the real numbers, so if your math is rusty throughout, be prepared to detour to an accompanying resource to refresh this (such as Khan Academy).It's not perfect though, and in his pedagogical effort the author sometimes turns to verbosity, which makes working through a bit tedious at times. The text could be more succinct and the bigger batches of exercises could have been categorized (for example on level of difficulty) for more sense of progress, and indication on which ones could be skipped for later.Introduction chapter is quite advanced and although it's clearly stated that the proofs are expected to seem mysterious and will be explained later, the exercises could have been saved until chapter three where the proofs are explained in detail, and the reader better equipped to solve them."},{"Title":"How to Prove It: A Structured Approach","review":"Proof's and induction books are readily available, as well as fairly good coverage in several finite math books.This book rises above the rest because the author clearly understands the students viewpoint in learning the material.Velleman presents the material as a lecture, and he throws out exactly the right examples and instruction to bring the student along with him.Velleman also assumes that you are not in your gradute studies of math and the preliminaries even a high school student would need are provided.His set theory presentation is concise and approachable by anyone.At the end of the ride you will have a solid set of skills and techniques which will enable you to understand and create proofs.I will make the asumption from the writing, that Velleman is an excellet professor, who knows how to connect with the students."},{"Title":"How to Prove It: A Structured Approach","review":"My introductory proofs class usedMathematical Proofs: A Transition to Advanced Mathematics (2nd Edition), and I later bought this book as a reference. It turned out to be a lot better comparatively - all the information taught in Mathematical Proofs is taught in this book plus some extra. The only thing I don't like about How To Prove It is that the text can sometimes be cramped. It's not as pretty, but the content is at least just as good, and it's about 1/5th of the price."},{"Title":"How to Prove It: A Structured Approach","review":"This was the textbook for my class on proof techniques, but I've seen other books on this subject.

The proofs are clear and easy to understand, and the exercises are challenging and stimulating."},{"Title":"How to Prove It: A Structured Approach","review":"Velleman presents a really basic yet thorough treatment of the various structure for proof-writing. It's important to understand quantifier negation and existence proofs, and most books gloss over those structures to focus on just quantifiers generally, set formation, and induction. It's an excellent book for people of all math backgrounds (computer science, physics, etc), although it requires a bit of maturity for a high school student to patiently reread and digest the proofs, it doesn't require advanced math in the sense of having taken lots of classes. I recommended this book to some friends in the economics PhD programs and got positive feedback.He really breaks down the structure and intuition of both simple and famous proofs. The book reads more like a logic or puzzle book, since he isn't intending to present a structured study of proofs applied to one area of math. Also, he translates plain English sentences that lack the normal \\"if...then\\" structure into mathematical statements with the quantifiers.The answers included are great for hints and extra exercises. It gives a good basis for relations, partial orders, equivalence classes, functions, cardinality, although perhaps too heavy on the partial and total orders than is necessary for analysis or linear algebra courses.If you buy this book, use the techniques to dissect other proofs in other courses and to have an understanding of set theoretic definitions of concepts you will use in advanced courses. The idea is to gain an intuition when reading proofs."},{"Title":"How to Prove It: A Structured Approach","review":"This is an incredible book -- one of the best mathematics books I have ever read.

Quite frankly, I can't see why they bothered. It's not like the methods of mathematical proofs change that much over time. We're not talking about some 1400 page shovelware book on being a MCSE/CCNA/etc. where the qualifications change every six months. There are only three basic changes to this book in its second edition:1. More exercises that are not that different from the original exercises and not any more helpful.2. Solutions to those exercises. This is the only real improvement to the first edition. It is good to finally have solutions to exercises.3. An appendix on Proof Designer, which is a Java applet that writes outlines of proofs in elementary set theory, under the guidance of the user. It is designed to help students learn to write proofs, and it has a whole website devoted to its understanding, so I don't see that this appendix adds that much to the conversation.The content of this book, first and second editions being essentially the same, is excellent. I highly recommend it for any mathematics or computer science student who is enrolled in a class where the correct method of performing a mathematical proof is the primary focus. It is very readable and suitable for self-teaching of the subject. I guess the good news is that now that the second edition is out, students can get the almost identical first edition used and even cheaper than before."},{"Title":"How to Prove It: A Structured Approach","review":"If you want to lear to prove mathematical theorems and propositions, this is a most.

I took an advanced calculus course in college and was lost half the time because it was based off proofs and no one bothered to give a proper explanation of what they are or how to do them. I didn't learn much and came out of the course confused and frustrated. Enter this book. It's amazing what a good explanation can do. Within a couple of months of focused but rewarding work in this book for about an hour a day, the proofs from my previous class seem simple. Also some people complained about the lack of a complete answer key, but if you learn the chapter thoroughly and do the answered problems, you can make it through the rest of the problem set.

Photos from the 1850's even up to the early 1960s (in the case of Diamond Heights) are shown along with photos of what a particular area of SF looks like today. While this book is a testament to how much the city has grown and changed over the last 150 years, it also shows how resilient it was after the earthquake and fire in 1906 that virtually leveled it.It also makes the reader ponder a little about what life must have been like in San Francisco around the turn of the 20th century. Among the areas shown? The Marina district, Pacific Heights, Market St and the ferry building, several panoramas of the city, the Golden Gate bridge (during contruction and how it appears today), and Nob Hill.Not only are the photos spectacular, but it also offers some history about &quot;the city by the bay&quot; and how some parts of it have changed dramatically and others might still be recognizable to those who visited 50 years ago. An excellent pictorial coffee table book about the city I'm lucky enough to live near."},{"Title":"San Francisco Then & Now (Then & Now Series)","review":"Unlike many San Francisco photo essays, this book gives a nice perspective on the history of the city beyond the frequently photographed northeast quarter. It is interesting to see the surprising changes of even &quot;contemporary&quot; history such as a 1963 and 1998 perspective of Diamond Heights. Though it lacks any indepth narrative, the brief descriptions of the photos provide some useful tidbits. And it does provide some amazing comparative visuals of the city.The books is quite reasonably priced for a fairly extensive visual presentation."},{"Title":"San Francisco Then & Now (Then & Now Series)","review":"What makes this book special for me is the &quot;now&quot; photographs. The book's editor/photographer has made a sincere attempt to reshoot the photos, physically, from as nearly as possible from the original, without changing the photographic perspective. This allows the books' reader to view and compare the photos and know that streets, buildings, and other landmarks give an accurate view of how the city looked at a certain time. Accurate directions and locations listed in both historical and contemporary photos greatly enchances the value and arm chair travelers' enjoyment of the book.

But a \\"now\\" picture of the Safeway Shopping Center and Old Navy outlet that are on that corner now might have appeared too drab or too forlorn by comparison.Otherwise, Yenne's color photographs of the present are quite beautiful, but equally impressive are the black-and-white photographs of the past taken by largely unknown photographers. A remarkable amount of detail is preserved in those old grainy-black-and-whites.Yenne gives us a few briefly-worded captions for the purpose of pointing out some specific similarity or difference between two or more photos in a given set, but as a good human camera should, he wisely refrains from any further comment.Included in this essay is an \\"old\\" view (circa 1935) looking east from the top of Nob Hill between Sacramento and California Streets. The Russ Building, San Francisco's tallest skyscraper (31 stories or about 400 feet high) is visible in this shot, but also clearly visible is the San Francisco Bay, including the suspension cables on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, now in the middle of construction.When Yenne shoots his contemporary photo from the same angle, the Russ Building is now dwarfed by a number of newer structures, including the 853-foot Transamerica Pyramid and the 779-foot black granite Bank of America headquarters, and the bay is hardly visible at all. Other skyscrapers have joined the collage, and now, incredibly enough, no portion of the Bay Bridge can be seen.Moreover, in other old pictures facing the same direction, the waterfront is, as Yenne says, \\"alive with tugs, ferries, and other vessels\\". But in contemporary photos, \\"the waterfront (is) now much quieter\\".There are still, thank heavens, some fishing boats in Fisherman's Wharf in which commercial fisherman seek their catch with the same dogged patience that the DiMaggio family did almost 100 years ago. Moreover, Alioto's, Fisherman's Grotto, and Tarantino's restaurants adjoin the wharf in both the black-and-white \\"then\\" and the color \\"now\\" photos. But otherwise, the tugs, ferries and other vessels, sailing toward or away from the various piers have been largely replaced by pleasure craft. Gentrification anyone?The photos also tell a story of the disappearance of most of the cable car traffic that once traversed the City, and of course, everyone knows that the remaining cable car lines are kept only for the benefit of the tourists. The City's haughtiness towards outsiders doesn't entail an aversion toward tourist dollars, after all.But no self-respecting chablis-drinking San Franciscan would be caught dead in one of those contraptions today. The late Herb Caen or whoever has since replaced Caen as the dean of Bay Area boorishness would laugh out of town any San Francisco native uncool enough to ride one of those things.It's hard to imagine San Francisco's \\"in\\" crowd today enjoying anything as bourgeois and middle-American as an amusement park either, but Yenne is able to locate some old photos of a Coney Island-like amusement park called Playland-At-The-Beach that once adorned Fulton and Balboa Streets during a less pretentious San Francisco era.Maybe time, population growth, economic growth, and recovery from two major earthquakes made some change inevitable. But the old and new photographs largely tell a story of a city striving maniacally to grow faster than anyone else, often at the expense of much of the beauty and charm that it once possessed. A city whose denizens claim to be unlike anywhere else ultimately aped New York City and other metropolitan areas in the frenzy of its development and in much of its resulting physical appearance. Does San Francisco's arrogant provincialism mask a latent inferiority complex?Maybe the most illustrative set of \\"then and now\\" photos are the two views looking west from California and Kearney Streets. In 1880, next to Old St. Mary's Cathedral on the north side of the street is a combination apartment complex/restaurant called the California House, and Yenne explains that it was one of the City's favorite eateries, noted for \\"fresh oysters in every style\\".Old St. Mary's still rests on the north side of California Street in Yenne's contemporary color photograph, but upon the site of the California House now rests the 33-story Hartford Insurance Building.St. Francis wept."},{"Title":"San Francisco Then & Now (Then & Now Series)","review":"This is for anyone who has ever fallen in love with this wonderful city, that is any who has ever, however briefly, been there.The format is, as it is for all the \\"Then and Now\\" series to show vintage photographs paired with modern shots of the same view.

Anyone who has ever spent any time in the city will recognize some of the modern views and will probably find themselves interested in the vintage shots giving the history of the scene.

Everybody knows that John McCain has less than a snowball's chance in Gomorrah of winning in SF. I using the term conservative in its root meaning, something like \\"saving what was valued in the past.\\" Preservation and conservation have the same Latin root. San Francisco has conserved more of its past than any western American city, and I could make a case, I think, for its preservation of more old-fashioned city life even than Boston or Savannah.Except for the tiny downtown financial district, San Francisco \\"looks\\" old. The vast majority of houses, churches, and schools were built in late Victorian styles and have been lovingly restored in the same styles. Even the relatively \\"new\\" streets of the Sunset are old-fashioned now, predominantly in modest Art Deco style of the 30s and 40s. And it should be no surprise that ATT baseball park is a booking success, since it's strikingly old-style brick in construction, with a street car stop at the front gate.San Francisco is a bastion of old-fashioned independent mom 'n pop businesses. There are thriving corner groceries and open-air once-a-week markets: independent restaurants ranging from very cheap to ultra expensive, but hardly any chain restaurants in the neighborhoods. The big chain grocery stores like Albertson's struggle to stay open in competition with locally owned stores like Andronico's, which has six stores around the whole Bay Area. There are more independent fitness centers and gyms in the neighborhoods; 24-hour fat farms are not the norm in SF. There are no malls that would be recognizable to most Americans in downtown or neighborhood San Francisco. The only malls - and very small they are by US norms - are on the suburban fringes.Even Boston is cut up by freeways today, though the traffic is no better managed than when I lived there in the early '60s. Seattle is sliced in half by its ineeffective central freeway. San Francisco is the place that blocked freeway construction in the late '60s. Several freeways have been demolished in SF in the last ten years! Streets in SF are narrow and parking is tough, but a measure to build more parking lots was recently defeated at the polls, and any attempt to chop wider streets through SF would meet with armed resistance.Baseball is the number one sport in SF. The fans of the football team pour in from the 'burbs to the hideous modernistic but crumbling stadium just at the edge of the city. The basketball team plays in Oakland. Any town where baseball rules has got to be considered conservative!People in SF are conservative dressers, especially by California standards. I know women who live in LA, who carry clothes they consider drab to SF when they visit, so that they will not stick out like the inflamed rear view of a peacock's tail. One never sees \\"his and hers\\" outfits on the streets, especially not pastels. Men wear less bling per capita in SF than in Omaha. A neck chain and an open shirt would get you sneered out of polite society in SF.Sweet old-fashioned window boxes are everywhere in SF. Street tree plantings are lovingly maintained. Open space is all-important to San Franciscans, and it's by stubborn resistance to development than SF has preserved more open space (finangling the take-over of decommissioned army, coast guard, and navy bases) than any comparably populated region of the USA. Nature is inherently conservative.The half-mile strip of upper Haight Street, which gets the attention of the \\"screaming heads\\" on TV and radio, is not populated by San Franciscans. It's the runaway and stumble-away refuge of the discontented - the \\"poor abused confused missused\\" - of all the dysfunctional \\"conservative\\" families and communities from Modesto to Miami. They come to SF to enjoy the true conservative values of privacy, tolerance, and neighborhood friendliness."},{"Title":"San Francisco Then & Now (Then & Now Series)","review":"It is a Good Book about San Francisco and I have given it to several friends in Minnesota and this one is for a friend, who is going to have her 50th Birthday next year."},{"Title":"San Francisco Then & Now (Then & Now Series)","review":"This was exactly what I was looking for and for anyone who is interested in San Francisco, or cities in general, then and now.

I doubt that those who haven't read the first book will be able to keep interested. And whereas the first book made settling in the west of Ireland sound romantic, Niall Williams seems to be discouraging people from doing what he and Chris.That said, I am glad I read it and loved hearing about young Joseph and his sister Deirdre."},{"Title":"The Luck of the Irish: Our Life in County Clare","review":"I just reread all 4 Kiltumber books by Niall and Chris and I must say I enjoyed them more now in 2005 than I did 9 years ago. To experience the trials and tribulations of this family in Kilmihil makes me wonder how many people followed their path and relocated to Ireland.Now, 20 years after the 1st book the children are grown,Niall is a world class and best selling novelist and Chris about to publish again soon in 2005.Read all 4 books in order and I promise you'll be tempted to move to County Clare."},{"Title":"The Luck of the Irish: Our Life in County Clare","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed this fourth installment in the saga of Niall &amp; Christine, and Deirdre and Joseph (the first chapter tells of their adoption of Joseph.) This book is very contemplative in nature, and focuses on what it is to belong to a community, a society, a nation. What does it mean to be Irish? to be American? And how are these things changing? Change is the other theme that is present throughout the book. There have been many changes in the West since Niall &amp; Christine first moved there: some good, some bad, but most not so easily classified as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. This book is very thought provoking, and a very enjoyable read. Thank you Niall and Christine for continuing to share your lives with us."},{"Title":"The Luck of the Irish: Our Life in County Clare","review":"Weak. The writing is simple and insights into life in Ireland are superficial. No great insights here and everything is centered around a very personal perspective with no real feel for the heart of the community or the nation. A mildly pleasant read that can be accomplished in a night or so. Not nearly the \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" Irish equivalent as a friend had suggested to me. I just felt like I'd learned less than if I'd watched a PBS special on Ireland. The writing was really weak and I can't believe the author is actually a playwright. Very superficial. Frank McCourts books are better if you want a feel of Ireland, albeit from an earlier time."},{"Title":"Understanding computers and cognition: A new foundation for design","review":"A few years ago Byte Magazine named this one of the 10 most important books in the history of the computer industry. Flores was asked to keynote the 50th anniversary meeting of the ACM on the strength of the work he has done, some of which is shown here.I am a little surprised not to find a review here that shows awareness of what this book is and was intended to do -- to turn those concerned with the design of the role of computers in society into a new direction. The book offers a fundamental enrichment and extension to the traditional engineering-based foundations that are used for designing computer systems that is drawn from philosophy and biology. It opens the development of a rigorous new design milleau to the reader. This is NOT yet another multi-disciplinary rumination.I would say this is not a &quot;helpful&quot; book, and it was never intended as an easy read. It is a book to turn to when one has learned enough about what is really at issue in putting computers to work in human life to discover that the likes of input, process, output, &quot;friendly&quot; interfaces, attractive graphical presentations, and logical flow charts are vastly insufficient distinctions for doing work that really makes a contribution to your clients and colleagues. The book challenges the reader strongly, and is not simple to read. I guess that the best way to read it is with someone else, having discussions as you go along.This is a book to engage and grow with -- a must-read for those serious about designing and building systems that will affect the lives of those who engage with them."},{"Title":"Understanding computers and cognition: A new foundation for design","review":"A remarkable work that delves into the field of human cognition and emerges with a fresh, intelligent perspective of how computers can and cannot support human cognitive efforts. Anyone interested in artificial intelligence and/or workflow will find this book an informative read"},{"Title":"Understanding computers and cognition: A new foundation for design","review":"I read this book when it was first published in the mid 1980's. At the time I was studying artificial intelligence as part of a graduate program in computer science. I have not looked at this book in a long time (\\"my bad\\") but I remember it was ground-breaking in at least several ways - at least for me personally!1. It opened my eyes to the limitations of the then-current approaches being attempted to recreate (via computer) human intelligence and/or human speech understanding and production. The approaches dominant at the time were logic-based algorithms based on frames, and neural-inspired algorithms.2. It opened my eyes to the notion that recreating human intelligence or human language via computer was NOT nearly as important as many of us thought it was. Rather, more important was (and is) to understand human-computer interaction and provide machines that complement and extend our skills and strengths (which I now view as an extension of the thinking of Douglas Englebart). And....3. Communication and meaning are necessarily embedded in our physical being and our physical situation.As I recall, the authors drew from a variety of thinkers and disciplines. Frankly, I have a hard time remembering right now to what extents my insights were due to Winograd/Flores work versus how they may have simply altered my direction of exploration (e.g. to study George Lakoff's work on the remarkable role of metaphor in language).This is the first time I've ever written a book review on Amazon that is essentially a description of the book's impact on my life and thinking rather than the book itself. I don't remember the details of the book! But I clearly remember that it changed my life.I am thrilled to read in the other comments that Byte Magazine recognized the landmark contribution of this effort.My hearty - and belated - thanks to the authors.Artps: Why am I writing this review now? This afternoon I stumbled into an old textbook from the mid-1980's on computerizing natural language, and it got me thinking....."},{"Title":"Understanding computers and cognition: A new foundation for design","review":"This is an excellent text which describes an approach to using computers to perform an enabling role within corporate enterprises by using their ability to allow clearer understanding between participants in the workplace. The other aspect of this book looks at current methods of creating AI systems and their fundamental weaknesses. Having read this as part of my MSc. in Information Technology I have re-read it several times and I would recommend it to all those involved in complex system design, implementation and support. In addition a book such as Checklands Soft Systems Methodolgy will give a good introduction to how the systems described in Understanding Computers and Cognition can be designed to meet the demands of &quot;real world&quot; environments."},{"Title":"Understanding computers and cognition: A new foundation for design","review":"Winograd and Flores' \`Understanding Computers and Cognition' proposes that the rationalist tradition in AI must be replaced by a hermeneutic approach. Associating the rationalist tradition with the goal of building a human mind, the authors propose that a hermeneutic approach must adopt the goal of constructing prostheses which magnify the human mind. This paper argues that what AI needs is not so much a hermeneutic approach as a better appreciation of biology and psychology. Understanding Computers and Cognition is a groundbreaking book that presents an important new approach to understanding what computers do and how their functioning is related to human language, thought and action. Byte Magazine has recognized Understanding Computers and Cognition as one of the all-time 20 most influential books on information technology.Thank you!"},{"Title":"Understanding computers and cognition: A new foundation for design","review":"In completely enjoyed this book. For starters it takes a lot of Heidegger's work and makes it completely accessible. The book laid out well where AI can and cannot go based on these Heidegarian (sp?) principals. My experience of the book is that it provide practical application for normally difficult content. I referenced this book in one of my blogs:[...]"},{"Title":"Understanding computers and cognition: A new foundation for design","review":"Imagine designing software for how people and computers really interact - not how we rationally think we should act. I came across this book for the first time a couple of months ago - and wished I had read it twenty years ago. The second half of the book is interesting in helping to identify appropriate niches for artificial intelligence and expert systems. However, I found the first half of the book the most value in that it helps define a perspective that challenges our naive view that we can see things as they really are and acknowledges that we are normally \`thrown' into life in a way that has us automatically and effortlessly interpreting and re-interpreting our environment according to our previous experience.Perhaps if it were written today Winograd would be extolling us to consider our reflexive thinking as well as our reflective thinking (using Matthew Lieberman's terminology) or consider our System 1 thinking not just our System 2 thinking (using Daniel Kahneman's preferred descriptions). I don't believe Winograd and Flores are suggesting we throw out rational design but, because we live most of our lives within the 'thrownness' of reflexive, system 1 thinking, it makes sense that we also adopt the interpretative and constructionist perspective put forward by Winograd and Flores.What does this mean? It means read the book, put on the new spectacles Winograd provides you with, ...and design by looking at the world through those lenses. Don't just simulate a naive implementation of the real world but design for the people that are the key part of the broader system that your software will be used in. In other words, design not just for the objects being manipulated in your computer simulation but design as a dialogue between yourself and your user. The computer is just the medium for your 'programmed' conversation with this user.A really enjoyable book, a challenging book, and a must read!"},{"Title":"Understanding computers and cognition: A new foundation for design","review":"This is probably the 7th or 8th copy of this book, I've purchased. My original? I have no idea where it is. But it is such an important book that I keep buying them and giving them away. I'm not a computer geek by any measure so what I find useful to share with my non-technical friends are the constructs provided on conversational technology that are at the foundation of this book. I'm an executive coach and have had the pleasure of working with Fernando Flores. I cannot overstate how important his contribution is to moving people and organizations forward in producing the results they want. It is well worth the time and energy and thinking you spend."},{"Title":"Understanding computers and cognition: A new foundation for design","review":"Understanding Computers and Cognition is an excellent book giving the right background and walks you nicely to understand all the notion of Speech act, Intention driven comversations and how these can be translated to a computer software. The book is not easy to read though (this is the only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5).But, those who are interested in this domain and are looking to better understand the academic theory behind it would find the book extremely helpful."},{"Title":"Understanding computers and cognition: A new foundation for design","review":"The authors' theme is that we each react to and are changed by our environment which in turn reacts to and is changed by each of us. In the end, one can design computers only within a particular consensual domain that entails at least some commonly understood rules and concepts. The authors rely heavily on the philosophical works of Maturana and Heidegger. Difficult to read as some word meanings are developed through usage and demonstration (e.g., &quot;throwness&quot;). Also, quotes from references are used endlessly to substantiate their theme. This is nice but I wonder after all is done, what contributions the authors' have made and how much is simply a rehash."},{"Title":"Understanding computers and cognition: A new foundation for design","review":"I read the 1986 or 87 version of this book and am of a software/AI background. I didn't follow the biological material that well - either I was being dense or it just wasn't clearly written. I thought the book was repetitious (my chief complaint). Some of the concepts discussed include: &quot;breakdown&quot; (humans become aware of thing X only when something goes awry in which the X is involved), &quot;thrownness&quot; (humans don't rationally consider all possibilities and make perfect decisions because situations they are put in don't permit such cognition and/or we simply we aren't capable of it), &quot;blindness&quot; (we are always somewhat blind to the prejudicies/assumptions that guide our thinking...and we can't totally escape this predicament. Also discusses the co-routine effect (per the software world) of human affects environment and environment affects world circularity."},{"Title":"Understanding Pride and Prejudice: A Student Casebook to Issues, Sources, and Historical Documents (The Greenwood Press \\"Literature in Context\\" Series)","review":"I did not use this book in the manner intended, i.e., as a textbook for literary studies, but I found it very valuable for my own personal instruction. Unlike Cliff Notes and some other literary studies, it focuses on understanding the context of the novel, not in-depth exploration of its themes, writing style, etc. I learned things that I had not known from the previous twenty or so books that I had read on the era and on Jane Austen. Given the debates over JA's \\"failure\\" to discuss contemporary politics, it was quite interesting to read that literature was heavily censored at athe time, and she would not have been able to comment freely, even if she had wanted to. The book's intended audience of young adults has resulted in its being clearly, but not simplistically written.The book should be very helpful for anyone intending to do serious research on the issues that are covered (see table of contents). There is an at least one-page bibliography on every topic covered, which should provide a jump-start into the literature.Teachman begins with a brief but excellent literary analysis of Pride & Prejudice. I particularly enjoyed her comments on Mr. Bennet. Although JA delineated his failings as a parent, I think that readers (and perhaps his creator) tend to be so taken with his wit and charm as to gloss over them. If Mrs. Bennet wasn't naturally fretful, living with such an unsupportive, indeed quietly hostile spouse, facing widowhood on her dowry with no provision for her five daughters would fray stronger nerves than hers.The main body of the book is composed of excerpts from various writings contemporary with Jane Austen. Teachman first gives a general overview of the subject of the chapter, then an introduction to each author, followed by the excerpts of their writing. There is a brief summation at the end of the chapter. These are fascinating as first hand experiences of both thought and writing style. There are a few that I would like to read in full. The chapter includes a list of suggested questions and projects. I hated these things as a student, and as an adult, I enjoyed skipping them.The last chapter \\"Pride & Prejudice: Issues in the 1980s & 1990s\\" considers our continued fascination with Jane Austen's work and the issues that are still current today. I was very impressed with this chapter. Teachman was able to calmly and nonjudgementally discuss marriage, romance, sex and celibacy, subjects that are so emotional fraught that most people cannot mention them without ranting.The book includes both a detailed table of contents and index for ease of access. There are three illustrations: one from an illustrated edition of P&P;, one of a portrait of Jane Austen based on CAssandra's drawing, and a picture of Chawton Cottage.I will certainly look for Teachman's general companion to Jane Austen and keep this series in mind for other favorite works."},{"Title":"The Choates in America. 1643-1896: John Choate and his descendants..

Shorris draws widely on sociology, philosophy, history and political science (among others) to peel back the thick, protective veneer that hides the &quot;real&quot; workings of corporate America in the last 3o yearsof the century. It is not a pretty picture but one filled with hope and optimism because of the indefatigable nature of the human spirit.

I used it as part of my daily devotional time and it always seemed to speak to what I needed that day. This particular complation of Tozer seems to have the best of his poignant thoughts on Scripture and walking with Christ. I think that the idea of a little bit of Tozer every day is a good one, because his thoughts are so deep, they require you to ponder them over and over. You can't read one of his books overnight and get the full benefit. Tozer on the Holy Spirit chooses the best of Tozer and gives you a digestible portion every day."},{"Title":"Benjamin and William Franklin: Father and Son, Patriot and Loyalist (Bedford Series in History & Culture)","review":"Benjamin and William Franklin, Father and Son, Patriot and Loyalist is a very informative book. This book shows how a father and son can go from loving one another to hating each other. This book goes threw the steps that Ben and Will took throughout their lives to make them become who they were. The author, Sheila L. Skemp, breaks down both individuals life to show you how they could have been in the opposite shoes in the out come.The author starts out with a lot of facts about both men in their younger years. Showing how they grew up and became adults with really very different upbringings. Then she tells how the two men worked together throughout most of their lives up until the Revolutionary War. She shows how the held similar government jobs and liked similar past times. She then goes on to sum up the choices they made and how this persuaded each one to become either a patriot or a loyalist. Sheila L. Skemp uses many facts to back her writing decisions. She also includes a complete thirty-one pages of documents. These documents are anything from letters, to speeches, to articles from newspapers. She also tells, throughout the book, when to refer to these documents to be able to keep in mind what the actual reason for different events were. She also placed a time line in the back to allow you to keep the time of the events strait.Although this is a very decent book about history, there were a few items I did not like about it. In some parts throughout the book telling which Franklin the author was talking about was difficult. The wording used in many places was confusing in telling the difference. This making the time spent reading a bit lengthy because of the time spent back reading to find out which Franklin she was talking about. Also due to all the facts some parts were a bit boring, but for the person who likes to read about history the facts are essential.For the person liking history and wanting to understand the Revolutionary War a little better this is a must read. This gives a great example of the splitting between families when we cut our ties to England. This books shows how two different people lived in these times. It shows how life back then was not that easy and how these two important people in our history did what they needed to better themselves.This was an interesting book, even for me, and I do not even like to read about history. It was very educational and helpful."},{"Title":"Benjamin and William Franklin: Father and Son, Patriot and Loyalist (Bedford Series in History & Culture)","review":"Although laced with facts it posed no new ideas and a majority of the reading was difficult due to confusion on which Franklin was being refered to. the Inclusion of the letters and speaches in the back was very informitive but if you are truly interested go to the library and just look up the such for yourself. All in all i found it to just be a sophisticated report and not anything particularly new or interesting, if you are interested in this subject get the Autobiographies."},{"Title":"Playboy Adult Magazine: November 1991 (La Toya Jackson)","review":"Playboy Adult Magazine: January 1996 is 202 pages long.

Did you guess Robert Louis Stevenson? Poetry is not my favorite form of literature. However, Stevenson is one of my best-loved authors, and I have always liked his poetry because, unlike some other poetry that I have read, it makes sense to me. One of my favorites is \\"The Swing\\":How do you like to go up in a swing,Up in the air so blue?Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thingEver a child can do!Of course, one would buy this edition of A Child's Garden of Verses not only for Stevenson's poetry (this is not a complete version but a newly revised selection) but also for Brian Wildsmith's gorgeous, whimsical illustrations. Wildsmith, born in 1931 at the mining village of Penistone in Yorkshire, England, has been called one of the greatest living children's book illustrators. Stevenson's poems perfectly capture the make-believe imagination of childhood. What child has not pretended at one time or another that his bed is a ship sailing the wide seas? And Wildsmith's stunning, colorful paintings perfectly capture the joyful childhood innocence of Stevenson's poetry. While the language may be upper class Victorian England, the appeal is universal. This would make a wonderful book for a parent to read aloud while the child gazes at the pictures."},{"Title":"A Child's Garden of Verses","review":"I had a book of A Child's Garden of Verses when I was a young girl.

All the classic Stevenson pieces are here: \\"The Swing,\\" \\"The Land of Counterpane,\\" the terrific poem about a child's shadow. Tudor depicts only children and animals herein--as it should be--without the presence of shadow of adults anywhere. Both Stevenson and Tudor understand in their bones that no matter what grown-ups may think, children inhabit a world of their own. That world is mostly beautiful, but sometimes fraught with danger or questions.

One of the poems that I will always remember deals with how difficult it is to go to bed when you are told in the summer when the days are long and the sun is still out. who doesn't remember this?The illustrations in this particular edition, by Tasha Tudor, capture perfectly the childhood world of the poetry--the imagination in play is wonderfully portrayed. Remember when the space under the table became a cave, or a castle, or a spaceship?

I was more interested in the writing and would have prefered all of the text from the original."},{"Title":"A Child's Garden of Verses","review":"When she was a little girl in Cincinnati, my Mother had a beloved copy of Robert Louis Stevenson's, 'A CHILD'S GARDEN OF VERSES.' Many decades later, she shared her love of this poetry with me and my siblings by reading it to us often when we were little. The poem that I most vividly recall her reciting is 'TIME TO RISE' :A BIRDIE WITH A YELLOW BILLHOPPED UPON MY WINDOW-SILL,COCKED HIS SHINING EYE AND SAID:\\"AIN'T YOU 'SHAMED, YOU SLEEPY-HEAD?\\"Most of 'A CHILD'S GARDEN OF VERSES' is a delight sure to please very young children and adults who have an appreciation for wordplay and rhyme. Stevenson was a master wordsmith whose integration of imagination and verbal rhythms produced verse that sticks in the mind like styrofoam packing-peanuts stick to a wool shirt. But whereas the packing-peanuts are insanely aggravating, the verse is simply charming. Stevenson was not a Dr. Seuss, but neither was he a quack.I have an out-of-print copy of 'A CHILD'S GARDEN OF VERSES', illustrated with nineteenth century woodblock engravings. I have no doubt that the illustrations by Tasha Tudor in this volume are very nice, but truth be told, the illustrations in ANY volume are next to superfluous since Stevenson is so adept at painting word-pictures in the mind of the reader.'A CHILD'S GARDEN OF VERSES' will transport you back to a time when a bedsheet and a few dining room chairs was all the boat you needed to have rollicking adventures on the high seas! This poetry touches on all of the things so enthralling to little boys and girls. Pirates and sailing ships, the seaside, distant stars, toy soldiers, galloping horses, howling dogs, imaginary playmates, the moon, explorers, Indians, swings, fairies and Gameboys are all childhood fascinations that find their way into Stevenson's verse. Well, OK, I lied about the \\"Gameboys\\" (just to see if you were paying attention), but that brings up another point. This poetry was composed in 1885, which means that the occasional archaic word or mossy British phrase rears its mysterious head from time to time. I like that; it adds a touch of antique elegance to the garden. But if you're going to be reading this aloud to a kiddie, be prepared to explain lamplighters, grenadiers, balusters, gabies and bogies.Back in 2002, my Mom suffered a small stroke, and consequently it was decided that she should move into the house that my Brother and I shared. At nearly 74 years old, she tends to tire easily. Some days she remains in bed and lets a good part of the morning slip away. When that happens, I'll knock softly at her bedroom door and enquire, \\"AIN'T YOU 'SHAMED, YOU SLEEPY-HEAD?\\" That always gets her up to start the day. Aren't the Tides Of Life a wonder?"},{"Title":"A Child's Garden of Verses","review":"This is a beautiful book with gorgeous pictures.

This book is great for snuggling up and sharing special moments with your child.

And the poems are about the adventures of a little boy. My boys each have their favorite poems and request having those read to them like little presents. At night, the older one has heard the poems so often, it's like sleep therapy...half way through \\"we built a ship upon the stairs all built of back bedroom chairs...\\" and he's out like a light. But, please for everyone's sake, get the Tasha Tudor version, it really is superior."},{"Title":"A Child's Garden of Verses","review":"My children and I make a habit to read poetry several times a week. I thought the old fashioned wording of these poems would have distracted them to disinterest but that in not the case. They LOVE this book.

We live on opposite ends of the country, so I don't see him often, but I am amazed at his interest in having me read this book to him. The pictures have incredible detail, which definitely is part of the appeal. But he seems to really enjoy listening to the poems, which contain lovely but archaic language. The last time I read it, on each page I gave him the option of listening to the poem on the left or on the right, and without exception he chose both. Mind you, father and grandfather were bored beyond belief listing to me read. But not my grandson. In fact, one day my daughter asked him what book he wanted to hear, and he chose \\"the book about Grandma\\" - he had to show us what he meant, and it was this book.I plan to get him another Tasha Tudor illustrated book for our next visit.One note, when reading aloud I substitute \\"mama\\" for \\"nurse\\" - what relevance does the concept of a nurse/caretaker have in 21st century United States?"},{"Title":"A Child's Garden of Verses","review":"I ordered Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"A Child's Garden of Verses\\" for 3 of our grandchildren, ages 2 - 5, remembering my pleasure reading it as a beginning reader some seven decades ago.

'Sylvester (in Journeys through Bookland) writes: \\"Robert Louis 'Stevenson . . . was born in Edinburgh. He was an only son, and most of 'the poems which he wrote for children show that, while his childhood 'was happy, it was perhaps a little lonesome; that is, most of his poems 'are about one child. . . . He knew all the time that he liked to write 'better than to do anything else . . . Some of his stories, Treasure 'Island, Kidnapped and others, are exciting tales of adventure, which 'any boy might like to read, while his . . .

The \\"Travel\\" poem, for example, contains lines that reveal the old un-informed view of Africa from early Americans who did not have the benefit of travel to the beautiful African continent:-Full of apes and cocoa-nuts-And the negro hunters' hutsI'm not sure I want my five year old using the word \\"negro\\" at all outside of the context of a discussion of old racial terms which are no longer (or never were) appropriate, so I skipped sharing this poem with him all together. Indian (NOT Native-American) and Chinese families may find similar intrusions on their dignity in some of these poems.The strength of this collection of poetry is its usability as a means to expose American children to old English speaking patterns for the first time. Consider these lines from \\"Winter-Time\\":-Late lies the wintry sun a-bed,-A frosty, fiery sleepy-head;-Blinks but an hour or two; and then,-A blood-red orange sets again.When is the last time your kindergartner or first grader heard speech like that? :)\\"A Child's Garden of Verses\\" is a staple of the Catholic homeschool curriculum entitled \\"Mother of Divine Grace.\\" Accordingly, a few of the poems address the topic of prayer (at bedtime and mealtime) in a respectful and childlike way.Enjoy this historical book, but use caution when you choose which pieces to share with your child."},{"Title":"A Child's Garden of Verses","review":"I was looking for the book Now We Are Six by A.A.

You get a good amount of facts &amp; figures, a lot of photographs and other illustrations.There is actually too much for one book. I found myself wanting more information on the 1874 model Sharps (the type used in the movie Quigley Down Under)and while there is a great deal it managed to not cover everything I wanted. This is most likely because in his preface Mr. Sellers writes that he originally came up with a 1500 page manuscript that had everything in it. Obviously to get it down to a publishable 358 pages a lot had to be cut out but you will get information on design, development, models, types &amp; variations. There is also a lot of stuff on accessories, even the types of finishes that the rifles and other guns could be purchased with.Anyone who owns or wants to own a Sharps should have this book as should anyone interested in the history of American firearms.Although listed as out of print I have a copy that came out in 2003, it might not look as nice as some of the earlier editions but has the same information.

What's missing, and very important to me, are the records of those guns which were cartouched by Federal inspectors during the Civil War years. Some were and some weren't and it would be nice to know why the disparity. I can't recall even seeing one photo of the left side of the \\"War Years\\" Sharps where a cartouche would be seen. Also, some of the early model 1859 Sharps carbines were issued with brass furniture. It would be nice to know just how many were sold as such before the changeover to iron furniture. Rumor has it that about 2000 of these with brass furniture were sold with 1600 going to the state of Georgia. Others says that Virginia bought about half of them. I'm fortunate in that I own one of these rarities and was disappointed that Mr. Sellers could not shed any more light on their history and fate.

The Editor is Bob Garratt, who runs a global strategy consultancy.Out of the many chapters, I enjoyed reading chapter 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 14. From a strategy formulation standpoints, the specific articles (chapters) are superb stuff with immediate application pliancy.Chapter 2 explains why it is imperative for board-level professionals to embrace strategic thinking.Chapter 5 is a real gem. It illustrates strategic thinking as visioning (or seeing) from multiple perspectives. A masterpiece by Henry Minzberg.Chapter 6 covers mindsets - the stumbling blocks to strategic thinking. Very well written/presented by the author.Chapter 7 is also a real gem. It introduces one enlightening perspective on strategic thinking processes. Although it gives a relatively broad brush, readers are recommended to pursue the contributing author (Jerry Rhodes)'s other books on the subject (specifically, The Colours of Your Mind & Conceptual Toolmaking).Chapter 10 is an eye opener on exploring various strategic options, using a multitude of practical tools (as outlined in the resources)introduced by the author. The author is the late Phil Hanford. For beginners & veterans, his one article/essay alone is worth more than the price of the book. My only 'complaint' is that Bob Garratt did not name the above contributing author's book on strategic management, where most of the concepts & technqiues mentioned in the article were originally developed.

My heart was with Wynn and Elizabeth, I ached to know how things turned out And after begging my husband, he finally went and got it. I started to feast, aching to know if they would ever have a child.What other adventures were in store?I flounderd toward the middle of this book. Having to re read and back track a little, but it was no use... It did not even seem to be the same Wynn and Elizabeth. They did not seem to speak the same, care the same. They lacked...themselves. I put it down, stopping there and just sat...not completing it at all."},{"Title":"When Hope Springs New (Canadian West #4)","review":"This was a lovely continuation of Oke's Canadian West series. It starts perhaps a few days/weeks off from the last book.Elizabeth and Wynn are traveling even further North to a more remote village. When they reach there Elizabeth is dismayed to find that no one will talk to her and hardly look at her. Despite her best efforts to find friends, she cannot. The house they live in is also little more than a shack.She spends the first Autumn, Winter, and most of Spring by herself. Then, one day while Wynn is away a fire sweeps through the village. It is up to Elizabeth to organize something as everyone else is in a panic.After the devastating fire, Wynn receives orders that they can no longer stay there. They are instead moved to the town of Athabasca Landing. This place is modern and after years of living in the wilderness, Elizabeth is amazed at all the amenities. She soon finds herself being a part of the church and people, and she and Wynn even take in a troubled boy named Henry. Her adventures have been toned down until Wynn receives his next assignment.Since Oke's is a Christian writer I\\"ll touch a bit on the religious element of this book. There isn't too much. While she makes mention here and there of asking for help from God or guidance, most of the time she shows the Christian attitude through action.Like most of her writings, there is nothing offensive to be found in this book. No strong language or harsh descriptions. We see the year through Elizabeth's eyes and since she is a calm character, the book is serene. The characters are all believable as Oke takes the time to go into their thoughts and actions. We can see that the Native Americans have spiritual beliefs and we can see Elizabeth's impatience. This makes them more real to me. Nobody is perfect or complete, they all have human qualities.This novel moved quite a bit faster than the other ones did. While it only covered a year, it seemed that the story went by extremely quickly. The time spent in the village was not as much as I thought it would be until they moved on to the next town.This is a good book to read anytime. I actually read it while waking up from anesthesia so it isn't too hard to understand! The storyline is simple and just brings a nice addition to the rest of the Delaney's story.When Hope Springs NewCopyright 1986308 pages (Large Print Book)"},{"Title":"When Hope Springs New (Canadian West #4)","review":"I am very pleased with this book, like all of Janette Oke's books it was a very good read.

The hallmark of these books was the tender way in which Elizabeth and Wynn loved and cared for each other. There were also interesting story lines about Wynn's work and living in the north. All of that was missing from this book. The dialogue was stiff and the story line changed from adventure to evangalism, making Elizabeth and Wynn into missionaries. I am a Christian and even I began to be bored with these characters. I also do not agree with the author's passion of wrenching children from Elizabeth and Wynn. So, in my mind their story ends differently. When they live in Athabasca, and Wynn has a regular work schedule, they will indeed have children of their own as well as the two they adopt. Into each life God also wants a little SUNSHINE to fall! The author seemed to rush this to press (both the third and fourth book were published in the same year) without giving it the same attention she obviously gave the first three books."},{"Title":"When Hope Springs New (Canadian West #4)","review":"I enjoy the love of the characters and their Christian values.

Between classical models of film interpretation and analysis (auteurist, structuralist, psychosemiotic) and the current plethora of contending paradigms (cognitivist, Deleuzian,post-feminists, deconstructivist and hypertextual) it treads adelicate, but determined path. The authors accept that film analysis is a matter of being wise after the fact, and being aware of open or hidden agendas. In order to be clear and consistent, you don't have to be dogmatic; being able to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of certain critical positions doesn't mean that 'everything goes'. Although centered on close analysis of nine mainstream movies, this is not just another collection of essays on the authors' favorite films. The distinction classical and post-classical narrative, the Hollywood/Europe divide, the co-existence of linear narrative and videogame logic, and the differences between ontological realism and digital realism are all lucidly laid out and practically demonstrated. Highlights - to this reader at least - are the chapters on Die Hard, Lost Highway, The Fifth Element and Silence of the Lambs. The general movie buff may think the bullet points and numbered sub-headings rather too prescriptive; however, the authors tone is for the most part refreshingly dead-pan and descriptive, and students may be grateful for the many useful hints of how to ask the right questions and structure their papers accordingly. This is a guide in the best tradition of 'Teach Yourself Film Studies', of which 'Studying Contemporary American Film' could be seen as a welcome sequel."},{"Title":"The stricken land,: The story of Puerto Rico,","review":"Important documentation of Gov.

Perhaps for this reason the personalities of the major players are drawn vividly: characters like Balfour, Asquith, Joe Chamberlain who played a major part in the convoluted politics of the nineties and Edwardian era.It seems to me this was a period of incredibly complex change: the end of the mid-Victorian sobriety, the end of Britain as an agricultural nation, the end of the hegemony of devout Christianity, the frenzied pace of reform and the development of infrastructure, and the increasingly claustrophobic atmosphere of European politics as the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the rise of German nationalism threatened the status quo.Ensor is very fair to everyone, perhaps with a slight liberal bias, but strong Tory characters like Disraeli come out well, though he's not a massive fan of Salisbury, whose diplomatic skills are perhaps underrated.Ensor's greatest strength though is his absolute mastery of the detail of parliamentary activity and legislative change, where his approach is encyclopaedic.I agree with the other reviewer (on Amazon.co.uk), Ensor is a pleasure to read, his attention to his material is unfailing."},{"Title":"THE TINSMITH'S HELPER AND PATTERN BOOK: WITH USEFUL RULES, DIAGRAMS AND TABLES.","review":"I was looking for tinwork ideas and patterns I could trace, cut out and punch.

It explained and described so well the movements of the soul that those who search for God experience. He describes with examples and stories the various stages along the way of the Christian's journey: from original conversion and growth, to the &quot;dark night of the soul&quot; all the way to the practice of the presence of God, to life itself becoming a prayer. I found this book to be enlightening as well as enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"From Image to Likeness: The Christian Journey into God","review":"In this book, Simpson tries to guide the reader along the journey to God. His route includes conversion, purgation, illumination, the dark night, and divine union. He includes many personal and historical examples, as well as his own philosophical insights. It is in the midst of all these words that the journey is lost. Perhaps his experience of the journey is different form mine. (Simpson is a married man, with a PhD in Greek philosophy, and a member of the Episcopal Church.) There were moments when the book was clear, unfortunatley these are few. Perhaps the analogy is to take advantage of these moments. In life, we may only get moments when we get small glimpses of the divine nature of God."},{"Title":"Slave and Citizen: The Classic Comparative Study of Race Relations in the Americas","review":"In my own writings, I have been of the opinion that the \\"Rosetta Stone\\" of American racism and its subsequent race problems, lies very much in the way its slave system was constructed, and then in the cataclysmic way in which it was dismantled - meaning as a result of the Civil War. Always, to my mind, what seemed missing was a sufficiently robust \\"control case\\" against which to actually measure the depth of the actual cruelty and lingering effects of the American version of slavery. In this book, first published in 1948, I think I have finally found the perfect \\"control case.\\"Since slavery in Brazil came about in pretty much the same way, at the same time, and lasted for roughly the same length, as that in the U.S, the differences between the two can serve as an appropriate backdrop to study each in the reflected light of the other. And it is here that Professor Tannenbaum has made my work easier as he has done most of it for me. What he has done basically is end the sterile U.S. debate over whether the slave was Just a \\"contented child\\" forever grateful to his masters for having saved him from Africa and condemnation to moral and cultural oblivion, or was indeed the victim of an inhumane system unique in the annals of human history in its utter and thorough brutality.With this work as backdrop, it is clear enough to see that it was indeed the latter. Among many other questions, Professor Tannenbaum's book answers directly the question: Why, since slavery was introduced in both countries at the same time and lasted for roughly the same period, are there only a few racial problems in Brazil and so many in the U.S.?His answer gets directly to the heart of the matter: that the Spanish and Portuguese versions of slavery, even though also oppressive, through the Catholic Justinian Code, granted the slave a moral life and personality, while the U.S. version through America's many Black Codes, did not. In Brazil, however tenuously, the slave was granted his humanity and moral equality to the slave owner. In the U.S. there was nothing corresponding to the Justinian Code, and Christianity, as practiced by Americans, along with the many U.S. \\"Black Codes,\\" were used to further justify the brutality of slavery and to further dehumanize the slave rather than to grant him moral equality. Forced to choose between seeing the slave as a human being or as property, the imperatives of economics buttressed by a perverse brand of Christianity, the American Christian nation chose the latter: that is, to define the slave as property rather than as a moral human being. (As late as 1978, the Mormon Church had maintained this rather archaic view as part of its theological orthodoxy.)Granting the slave moral equality was an inalienable right according to Brazil's Catholic Justinian Code; while making him forever a heathen under the American version of the Christian doctrine and through a patchwork of \\"Black Codes,\\" ensured that his soul would be forever consigned to the outskirts of normal morality and humanity. The Brazilian slave thus entered the slave contract on a different level of humanity than did the American slave. In the case of the Brazilian slave, freedom was an inevitable and automatic end state; for the American slave, slavery and inhumanity were designed to exist in perpetuity.As a footnote to Tannebaum's magisterial work, there was so much intermarriage between slaves and non-slaves in Brazil that the kind of rigid segregation of the races that was brutally enforced in the U.S. for over a century would have been all but impossible in Brazil. And in this regard, it it is instructive to note that even though fully 25% of whites in America possess some black blood and nearly 75% of blacks possess some white blood, still even today, intermarriage in the U.S. between the races is stuck at round 2-7%, while in Brazil as well as in the U.K. it is well over 50%. Thus it is clear from Professor Tannenbaum's work, that Blacks in American still suffer under the weight of the original Christian's moral assignment of Blacks to a lower category of humanity.This is a well-argued and eye-opening piece of scholarship. Now on to Carl N. Delger's \\"Neither Black nor White.\\" Five Stars"},{"Title":"Origins: Today's science, tomorrow's myth : an objective study of creationism, evolution, and catastrophism","review":"The enigmatic title of this book, *Origins: Today's Science, Tomorrow's Myth* reflects what Thomas Kuhn describes in *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions* as a case in which &quot;...the initially anomalous has become the anticipated&quot; and a new paradigm emerges. What we consider &quot;givens&quot; today may appear puerile and outmoded in the scientific thought of tomorrow.Strickling charges that Darwinism, as originally promulgated and currently perceived, is the Great Lie, &quot;...and it engulfs us&quot; whereas Creationist interpretation is the &quot;Great Mistake.&quot; We would appear, therefore, to be between a rock and a hard place because, as the author declares, &quot;...[I]t is dogma in both religion and science that appears to be at the very heart of the ongoing controversy surrounding our origins.&quot;I hesitate to go too deeply into Strickling's unique resolution of this dilemma. It would be like revealing who did it in a &quot;who done it&quot;, but the author begins with the uniformitarianism vs. catastrophism controversy. In our present-day emerging scientific paradigm, uniformitarianism - the assertion that nothing has happened in the earth's past that is not happening now, is increasingly being beaten out by Catastrophism - the idea that in times past the earth has suffered numerous disruptions from the nearby presence of other planet-sized bodies. &quot;Such disturbances,&quot; says Strickling, &quot;would impact not only the earth itself, but all the life-forms residing on it. Evidence of these disturbances abounds.&quot;Strickling cites the work of Immanuel Velikovsky whose research &quot;cuts across the fields of physics, astronomy, geology, archeology, paleontology, history and mythology&quot; to assert that the universe is electrical in nature and that &quot;the structure of the solar system has changed in historical times.&quot; Velikovsky made numerous successful predictions (such as the radio noise emanating from Jupiter) but he was so thoroughly and unfairly maligned by the scientific establishment that few of those predictions are remembered and credited to him. (Einstein, who initially discountenanced his findings, changed his mind and began a dialogue with Velikovsky just before his [Einstein's] death.)Strickling also cites the work of major Catastrophist authors David Talbott and Dwardu Cardona to suggest that the planetary arrangement the ancients saw was quite different from what we now see in the sky and that creation myths described not creation, but the new order observed by humans when the planetary arrangement changed.Perhaps the author's most tantalizing speculations are about the role of Extremely Low Frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF's) in the ancient world and their importance in such stories as the Tower of Babel (that the interruption of the understanding of language may have been electromagnetic in nature), the Ark of the Covenant (an electrical capacitor - all that copper, gold and silver) halos (coronas - discharges resulting from the ionization of atoms in an electric field) and other electrical phenomena that would have seemed miraculous to ancient man.In any case, as Dwardu Cardona has stated in his Foreword to the first edition of this book, &quot;...the best weapon against biblical fundamentalists is the Bible itself. But by the same token, science remains the best weapon against scientific uniformitarians.&quot;This is an exciting book in that the questions it poses are as intriguing as its conclusions and for the sheer intellectual delight in trying new ideas on for size. I highly recommend it.pamhan99@aol.com"},{"Title":"The Wreckage of Agathon","review":"This very modern novel of a down and out pre-Socratic philosopher, self-exiled from Athens to Sparta, has stayed vivid in my memory for 35 years and more. It combines razor sharp satire, low comedy, a philosphical playfulness that reminds you of Borges, and an aching, bittersweet recollection of a life firecely lived. I can't think of a more continuously entertaining book. What is amazing is that it also draws the reader into a deep and uncompromising confrontation with the most serious questions of loyalty and love."},{"Title":"The Wreckage of Agathon","review":"John Gardner gives us the view of the power of one man's life on those that he loves and those that he is employed to serve. Once a revered and respected &quot;Seer&quot;, Agathon in his later years has been relagated to a decrepid one man sideshow of mystery and absurdity. As he took his fall from grace and stature, his personal life paralleled that fall. Through the choices he made in his life, he was forced to endure the consequences of his actions. For better or worse, he gained his wisdom and accepted dwelling in his fetid existence.The two strands of the story--the life and times of a &quot;wise man&quot;, and the rise and fall of political and social ideologies--demonstrate the degree with which these two human conditions are historically linked. As a result, it is often too late in the game that truths are revealed and roles are understood.At the end of the book, Agathon achieves a certain level of freedom from who he is, in death, while hopefully revealing truths early enough to the &quot;Peeker&quot;, who was his pupil.&quot;The Wreckage of Agathon&quot; appears to be a metaphor for the life that he left in ruin and for the impact he had on a political system by virtue of the fact that he had existed and lived."},{"Title":"The Wreckage of Agathon","review":"An incredible tale told alternating between Agathon, an old Seer, and Peeker, the apprentice.

For the person who thinks dating in today's world is as difficult as reading hieroglyphics, this book will help you get you over the hump.As a dating expert who has spent my career as a matchmaker and singles coach, there are a few idiosyncrasies that remind you that Dr. Joy Browne is indeed a psychologist first and foremost. For example, she urges you not to date for an entire year after your divorce (to make sure you're emotionally whole) and not to wear perfume or cologne on a date (after all, you wouldn't want to offend your date or set off an allergic reaction).Bottom Line - This is a great basic introduction to dating. If you're new to the dating scene (or if you haven't had a date in a decade), then this book will help you get started."},{"Title":"Dating for Dummies","review":"Amazon.com Review for Dating for Dummies(...)This review was completed by a group of five college seniors from Villanova University. We spent a semester researching and reviewing best-selling self-help books on the subject of romantic relationships. We evaluated five texts after reviewing academic literature specifically on the topics of commitment, trust, conflict, verbal communication, and intimacy. In order to make you a more informed consumer, we hope to provide you with a review of Dating for Dummies.The author's intent is to provide information on and fundamental ideas about dating so that everyday individuals are able to learn more about themselves. Then, the author helps one find a date, and provides helpful tips and insight in order to make the dating experience more enjoyable, less stressful, and a complete success.This book is written individually for both men and women of any age group. Whether an individual is 15 years old and going on his or her first date, or 90 years old and rejoining the dating scene with grandchildren, this book provides information on the dating game. The only other prerequisites for reading this book are that individuals be heterosexual and dating in America. Also, Browne specifically notes that this book is designed to be in use from the time that one decides he or she wants to begin dating up until six to nine months after the first date. This book stops when couplehood begins.Dating for Dummies reads similarly to a manual that is written in a casual, humorous style. In order to grow towards a relationship, Browne works to direct an individual into helping his or her self so that he or she can be a good date. The book provides useful advice and does so in a way that incorporates practical, everyday situations. It is user friendly and is designed to make an individual the best that they can be without being somebody else.We evaluated how the following five topics were approached in the book:Commitment- Commitment was in fact addressed in Dating for Dummies. However, it was addressed indirectly in a whole chapter as it is defined in terms of casual, serious, and heavy dating relationships. Dating for Dummies was very practical in its discussion of commitment, but not very thorough. It outlined what level of commitment should be inherent in a relationship, which depends on whether the relationship is casual, serious, or exclusive, etc.Trust- Trust was found in the index, which indicated discussion on developing trust through self-disclosure, trust as a factor in breaking up, and being able to trust someone enough in a relationship to know that one is safe. Specifically, the book was very detailed on developing trust through self-disclosure and provided examples and tips for making that happen more effectively.Conflict- Dating for Dummies did address the topic of conflict. While there were no sections mentioned in the index, there were four brief paragraphs that addressed conflict from a very common sense approach. With only four paragraphs to discuss conflict, there were not many examples or exercises for acceptable behavior in dealing with conflict.Verbal Communication- Dating for Dummies discussed verbal communication skills by providing guidelines on how to communicate when out on a date. It limited itself to providing examples of lines and ideas of what to and what not to talk about. Also, it gave a lot of useful tips for conversations to have when one first meets someone of interest. It definitely targeted the general public with real examples that can one help truly understand and relate to the book.Intimacy- Intimacy was addressed throughout Dating for Dummies in the context of self disclosure, expression of thought and emotion, listening, and making positive verbal statements. As such, this book provided specific examples of things to tell immediately, a list of things to tell eventually, things to tell before sex, and things to tell if asked or pushed. Also, the book provided rules on sharing feelings, including an example for each rule. Finally, the book provided specific topics that should not be disclosed such as sexual stories, previous love affairs, and flings with the boss, just to name a few. Also, in the case of positive regard, the book provided specific body parts to compliment and specific compliments to give about those body parts.This book is best for the subject of intimacy.(...)"},{"Title":"Dating for Dummies","review":"This book is a good guide to dating for everyone....it has useful information on manners and ettiquette. Perhaps one of its best strengths is to give more specific direction on when to do certain things, such as kissing on the first date, sex, good first date spots, how much to spend, etc. The major drawback to it is that it seems to give fairly rigid advice as absolute rules, when in many cases the individual situation would call for a different action. There is also some contradictory advice from one chapter to another, but they are minor contradictions."},{"Title":"Dating for Dummies","review":"This book includes a lot of common sense and good humor. It was a bit too basic for me but would be good for young people. I personally found \\"4 Steps to Bring the Right Person into Your Life\\" by Philippa Courtney to be the most helpful to me because I am more interested in finding the right person than I am in the art of dating."},{"Title":"Dating for Dummies","review":"In ordering this book, I was hoping to get some insight, some understanding of how women think, how to achieve social success, how to deal with rejection. I certainly didn't need someone to tell me to brush my teeth and iron my clothes before going on a date! While the book is cleverly written, and amusing at times, it really didn't offer much to me in terms of information."},{"Title":"Dating for Dummies","review":"This was somewhat helpful, though I was not motivated to follow any advice; in fact, the moment I put the book down I had no desire to keep reading or come back to re-read.Also some advice is too much on the surface, this book did not explore the feelings that are present when dating. Now you can see why I'm back on Amazon.com looking for a better book on dating.I did like the organization and ease of reading though, even if it was a bit too on-the-surface and simplistic."},{"Title":"Dating for Dummies","review":"Dr. Joy Browne is very entertaining and humorous, and I got lot's of laughing out loud done reading her book. But for content, she doesn't deliver. I recommend purchasing the book &quot;How To Win The Love You Want&quot; by Thomas W. McKnight and Robert H. Phillips (ISBN 1-57866-018-1) instead. It's a much better buy than Dr. Browne's book. Everything up to Chapter 12 does a mediocre job in supplying information that is superbly done by the above mentioned book. Everything from there is downhill. Good attempt Dr. Browne but please, spare the public."},{"Title":"Dating for Dummies","review":"Granted I've labeled myself amongst the &quot;dating impaired&quot; for awhile before I picked up this book. I decided to review this book about 6 months after I've been through it and see where my life is. As far as dating goes, I'll say it has improved. I'm not sure whether it is the content of this book Or just my life in general.Anyways, the book is neat and filled with good stuff for those who aren't too sure about dating. However only you can decide how the advice in the book will be used. Some of the information in this book you'll look at and say &quot;duh&quot; and some you'll say &quot;will have to remember.&quot; Do with this book what you will.

This method works fine if you are discussing a business deal, but it has it's shortcomings when applied to dating."},{"Title":"Dating for Dummies","review":"I bought this book because I was a late bloomer. The book offered good advice and did the legwork of a few Google searches, but overall, the content is not rocket science - it's common sense.My advice would be the following:1. Do a complete self-scan, and make improvements that make you feel good about yourself.2. Go to places that you're comfortable (no, this is not your home, it's places with other people with SIMILAR interests).3. Talk to people. It's amazing what a simple conversation can lead to4. DO NOT, under any circumstances, think about being rejected. If there's a fear of rejection, which we all have, thinking about it will provoke the stressful feelings that come with it. My advice would be to accept rejection as a part of life and an element that makes us stronger.Anyway, that's my review. I felt like that before buying the book and it didn't change me."},{"Title":"Dating for Dummies","review":"If you are a guy this book will not tell you anything that will give you an edge over other guys.

Ya gotta learn what women want to understand dating, fellow dudes."},{"Title":"Dating for Dummies","review":"With all due respect to Dr. Joy, this book is of limited use to men. Many of the reviews have observed this book to represent a female perpective. I am a middle-aged man, and in my experience, there really is no such thing as THE female perspective. In fact, there are three: the perspective of an attractive woman, that of an average woman, and that of an unattractive woman. Trust me, these are three distinctly different perspectives, and one approach does NOT fit all.An attractive woman is in demand and is approached all the time. She lives in a reality in which she has many options, often more than she can handle. She can therefore afford to be selective to an extent that less attractive women would consider impractical. Such a woman could not care less whether a man is on his best behavior, or if he has taken the time to plan out a date, brush his teeth, or other such mundane and pedestrian considerations. She brings high romantic and erotic expectations into relationships, which is why she would never develop such an interest in a man who is merely a friend. She settles only for a guy who has Brad Pitt's looks or Donald Trump's success or uncommon inner masculine qualities of supreme confidence - bordering on arrogance, dominance, boldness, adventurousness, etc. In short, she demands and gets what other women only fantasize about.Unattractive women have no options. Many of them live in denial until reality catches up with them, typically in their 30s. They eventually learn that being selective is not something that was meant for them. As such, they consider themselves lucky to get any expression of interest, and the rules of the game articulated in Dr. Joy's book do not apply to them. With them, no rule is needed.The only women to whom this book applies are the average ones -- those who are neither attractive nor repulsive. These are the women who have adjusted their expectations so they can be selective within their own compromised realms. Rules and expectations give them a sense of control and sovereignty which becomes an acceptable substitute for facing the reality that they will never have what they truly desire. Dr. Joy herself is likely one such woman, and she has been gracious enough to share her perspective in great detail in her book. However, my advice to any man considering reading the book is this: If you are interested in dating average women, this book should be your bible. If not, save your time and money."},{"Title":"Dating for Dummies","review":"I listen to Dr Joy and most of the time, I agree with her.

Probably the best tip was to at least send a polite 'No thanks' email if you didn't like the look of someone interested in you. It's tough, but courteous, and the right thing to do.A very useful book."},{"Title":"Dating for Dummies","review":"I can see by some of the reviews on this site (yes you SS) why some of the people who read this work are still single and bitter. I'm not even going to try to address reality- some people need to go of feelngs, get to mindfulness and then enjoy what they truly value in the moment.THey need to find friends and learn to feel comfortable going out- work on themselves- lose weight, get into shape and so on. Then date. Don't worry I am in the same boat when I write this the reason why these books don't tell you word for word what to do to date is because that is you are missing the important step. It's not about step by step and staying at home figuring it all out. You need that period if you are backwards. But not forever while you drink soda and eat crap watching TV. Ultimately it is about just getting out and enjoying what you value while learning to be relaxed like Dean Martin around people and giving to them so you can joke and be fun and games with them until you can do this freely and until you have a friend who you can do this with. How do you relax you say. Spend everyday learning the relax techniques that work, listening to the subliminal tapes and so on until you get there. The most amazing performance I ever saw in my life was Othello by the top actor in London for the part at the time at a University in my city. The troupe says the way they are able to increase the drama like that, the way they are able to have seizures and fights and fits and so much more like that- and the critic said best performance he can remember seeing- the reason why he got the standing O that brought him to waving with tears is because they use the advanced relaxation techniques the right way and that is how you do it in life. It's not that you can't do it or the other person is not interested- it is as the scientific studies constantly show your thoughts are fooling you and the faulty thinking keeps you down and creates negativity and the rest- the anxiety. Then you are in the place where you can really find the right person and have a strong marriage. You may have to work on other things first of course. Yes it will be very uncomfortable at first to get to this place and yes you will want to blow it off and yes you will feel great pity for yourself in the process. Of course. Of course times ten. And you will want to give up and if you do you will be like the so many people i know who blame it on luck and why didn't I have the sister do it for me, the father getting me the high paying career and so on. And while I'm the opposite of one of those guys I do know a fair number of them. And yes in some ways that get easy happiness and feel great but I can swear they have never really worked on themselves and under that they have never learnt to address their messed-up side and just for starters one is married to the classy attractive girl and in the father's business and I imagine SS would love to be with this woman the pretty one who has grace and manners and so on. Not the attitude of his definition of \\"Hot\\" women. But still the guy is depressed and barely able to talk to others and over drinks has a pot belly, starts to exercise and gives up the first day. The wife doesn't go with him to the bar at the club, and she kicks him out while she has \\"lonely heart\\" sessions with other girls. He laughs but from a good guy user friendly way at me being where I am and him having the girl in the city that is often #1 worst in Houston for White males to date and now in the top ten. But think of it this way if you do things right you can get in good shape, get to what you value, represent the real and best you and also learn to stay in the moment doing what you value and do spontaneous things so you keep having fun with life. Then it won't matter if you date and marry. And that's just the time when the ladies start to notice you. Just sayin'-If you are still negative and think this is crap for you then you have bad cognitives. Fortunately the brain is maluable throughout life and you can change these thoughts overtime with a pro or the right cognitive exercises and by accepting your fear and negativity by getting off your ass and taking actioin, doing something very different that gets you to what you value and out of the house and then from there. If you just keep doing what you love and try to talk to strangers, others then yes you will eventually push the negativity back. It won't go away but you won't notice it so much as the fun and doing what you value keeps you enjoying the moment."},{"Title":"Dating for Dummies","review":"As a single, 23 year old girl pursuing her career, I am constantly networking and trying to make good first impressions.

The mystery centers around the disappearance of so many ex-wartime Liberty freighters in mid-ocean. Most of them were in ballast when they vanished, and it was assumed but never proven that shifting ballast caused the freighters to turn turtle and sink so rapidly that no message could be transmitted on the \`how' or \`why' of their plight.\`Leicester' was an ex-Liberty freighter fitted out in peace-time rig, newly under the command of Captain Hamish Lawson. He met his ship for the first time while she was taking ballast---\\"a sludge of sand and gravel dredged from the bottom of the [Thames]\\"---in preparation for a voyage to New York. Lawson had originally been scheduled to take command of another ex-Liberty freighter (called Sam-ships by the sailors, because they were built for the wartime Lend Lease program by \`Uncle Sam'), but the \`Samkey' had disappeared on route to Cuba. \\"'Leicester' was the twin sister to \`Samkey'; built in the same yards, to the identical design. The only difference was that she was younger by a year...\\"Captain Lawson's freighter was halfway between Ireland and Nova Scotia on the Great Circle route to New York when the first storm struck. \`Leicester' rolled more than her Master liked, but she weathered the gale easily enough. His main worry was the ship's malfunctioning radio, without which he couldn't receive weather reports or transmit his own position. The Atlantic was not a good place to be in the middle of the hurricane season, without a radio.Sure enough on the morning of September 14th, the crew of the \`Leicester' found themselves sailing under another threatening sky:\\"Lawson watched the ominous black arch [of the hurricane bar] for a quarter of an hour, and even during this short interval it seemed to grow, humping up from the horizon, spreading east and west. Above it, and around the hemisphere of sky, the high clouds were thickening, growing more opaque. A light, aimless breeze that seemed to come erratically from every point of the compass had begun to play about the ship. Lawson noticed that there were no gulls or other seabirds anywhere in sight.\\"The Sam-ship tried to dodge the hurricane, but it was much too late for such maneuvers. Within the hour, \`Leicester' found herself enmeshed in the roaring hell of \\"The Serpent's Coil.\\"Mowat certainly knows how to tell a suspenseful sea story! The rest of his book describes the travails of \`Leicester' as she founders but does not sink amidst the coils of the first hurricane. Her adventures afterward are entwined with those of the salvage and rescue tugs, \`Foundation Lillian' and \`Foundation Josephine,' plus another, even more savage hurricane that struck while the Sam-ship lay helplessly at what was supposed to be a safe mooring.\\"The Serpent's Coil\\" and its even more exciting companion, \\"Grey Seas Under\\" are gripping testaments to the daring and skill of Canada's master seamen. Even the sections of these books that were strictly concerned with salvage operations kept me reading ahead at full steam."},{"Title":"Serpent's Coil","review":"Farley Mowat ,The Dean of the Canadian outdoor Writers, at the top of his form. If you've ever wondered what it was like to work on an Ocean going Tug Boat this is the book for you.

The ads on the back state this to be the predecessor of the Perfect Storm. I don't think that is the case but the story is great. The Leicester leaves London, and rides out two hurricanes.

The ship then travels on a southerly direction until spotted by a salvage tug. This and another salvage tug take Leicester to Bermuda where she endures another hurricane and is beached with the salvage tug. The last chapter details the salvage of both the ship and tug.

It never gets old.It is the kind of macro/micro writing that I think Mowat does spectacularly well, now focused on the story of three ships -- two deep-sea rescue tugs and one Lend-Lease surplus freighter.A far-from-comprehensive list of things I learned from this book:* What the legs on oil-drilling platforms are called.* What kind of ballast you get from the Thames.* The effect fog used to have on radios.* What a Carley float is.* Why you can't just tie up to the ship you're towing.* How much list 60 degrees is.* How some hurricanes start.* What happens when your boiler explodes.* How big a pump you can move in a dory.* What it's like to fly a plane into a hurricane.* How much weather satellites have changes the world.* What the Great Circle Track is.* What the Beaufort scale is.And so much more. I can't get over how meticulous the research on this book is. The bit with the meterologists in Africa. The book that Sparky sets his soldering iron on. The thing is that Sparky (on the Leicester) died in the storm, so someone must have seen his cabin or inventoried his stuff? But it gives the whole book so much texture.And it's not just the battle to save one ship. I still laugh at the stories of the crewmen, the guy from Come-By-Chance who was planning to take back blackstrap rum and retire forever, or the crew getting \\"pirate fever\\" and flitting all over their salvaged boat.I think the reason this book and its companion are so repeatable for me is that I get dropped into a whole different world, and that world is as richly constructed as any of the most intricate science fiction books I read. It just happens to be history instead of make-believe.Read if: You enjoy a good story. You love books about boats. You have liked other Mowat. You love seamless learning.Skip if: You think non-fiction books should be dry.

In the tradition of Wolves of the Sea, White Wolf has really done their homework on this one. Not only does it contain much relevant information about historically existing knightly orders (such as the Knights Templar), it also contains information about how kindred manipulate and even become them. Most importantly, the Order of the Bitter Ashes is detailed. The Order has a duty to destroy infidels, protect the holy, redeem the wicked, and capture the holy relics of old for...posterity. The memebers, due to a unique embrace involving the Holy Grail, also have several new powers, among them being a limited ability to regenerate blood without feeding, and some resistance to fire and sunlight. Though they might be the most noble of the Kindred, there are still many moral dilemmas to play out with them. I get a real Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade feeling from this book. If you enjoy this sort of mood mixed with the gothic horror of Vampire: Dark Ages, this is a must have for you. My only complaint is that there is not a single mention of the one clan that most fits the knightly stereotype: the Salubri. Maybe I am just partial to the Salubri, but I think that they should not have been overlooked here. Still, the book is marvelous."},{"Title":"The Ashen Knight: A Sourcebook for Vampire, The Dark Ages","review":"The first impresion i had upon this book was: &quot;why bother with something so simple&quot;.

I also played for six years Truncheons and Flagons so the fantasy setting is no strange to me, whoever when you review the possilities to play a vampire knight the ideas arise (bad pun sorry). They explain in chapter one the whole concept of chivalry in medieval Europe, but the best chapter is the second where they explain how to do it and the fifth where players get their chances at playing one. New merits and flaws (i really liked the &quot;woman in disguise&quot; flaw, a lot of opportunities there). They also give you a brief history of a fictional vampiric knight order for those who like ready to play NPC. Overall a good read, on the gaming side a good sourcebook with good information for both storytellers and players."},{"Title":"The Ashen Knight: A Sourcebook for Vampire, The Dark Ages","review":"This Dark Age Supplement for Vampire is one great read. What I liked about this book is that it gave historical view of the codes and conducts of chivalry, and the sociteies of the canite knighthoods. Whitewolf's eyecatching artwork in its shades of black white, catch the feel of the Dark Ages and creates a good atmosphere for the book. For those who play Vampire: TDA, this books holds are real treat as it details the &quot;Grail Knights&quot; briefly mentioned in previous books. They are something more than you typical Cainite Knight. Also featured in this book are some New Traits and Merits &amp; Flaws for your character. This is one book I feel I will have plenty of use for in my library."},{"Title":"The Ashen Knight: A Sourcebook for Vampire, The Dark Ages","review":"This book is just packed full of information. It is one of those books that drew me to Vampire to begin with. Great detail about the period, how vampires fit into it. How to play a vampire knight. Religion and how both vampiric knight and also mortal ones view it.The book itself is a fun read, not just filled with rules but flavour to make the game better. Some of the concepts could be used in any game that uses knights.Well worth the money. My only complaint is the art needed to be a bit better."},{"Title":"The Ashen Knight: A Sourcebook for Vampire, The Dark Ages","review":"This is one great book, but you need the good players too. Think of a vampire walking under the sun and not getting aggravated damage, just lethal. A vampire with increased power and disciplines as well as being only lethally damaged by fire, not aggravated. However, it is compensated by the vampire duties and by those above them in the knighthood order. And yet, it is not only about the order of the bitter ashes, but about everything on chivalry. If you like the via equitus... this book is for you."},{"Title":"Early Life (A Series of books in biology)","review":"I wish this book were available as a normal paperback. I really like nearly everything about it. Understanding Margulis on the origin of Meiosis is so much easier with line drawings! If you are interested in Margulis's ideas about the serial endosymbiont theory and how the eukaryotic cell arose, it's hard to do better than \\"Early Life.\\" The clarity of this book is wonderful. Why a \\"missed opportunity\\"? Despite the fact that this is a new edition with Michael F. Dolan, the science appears not to have been updated. For example, Margulis thought an \\"aggressive\\" bacterium such as Bdellovibrio might have invaded cells to form mitochondria. Genomic research has shown that mitochondria came from a Rickettsia species. In illustrations, Bdellovibrio is still shown and the Rickettsia connection is not mentioned. Does Margulis completely reject evidence from nucleic acid sequencing?Evidently -- because the biggest \\"hole\\" in this book is a complete lack of recognition that the Archaea are something completely different from Bacteria. Margulis makes a friendly mention of Carl Woese in the introduction of the new edition, as if his research were the only stone in the massive structure that shows Archaea are a separate domain of life. It is not just the rRNA's that are different (as Woese showed) -- the membrane lipids are different, the Archaea have histones (like eukaryotes) and some have multiple chromosomes (like eukaryotes). Lumping them with other \\"prokaryotes\\" in spite of the current state of science is nothing less than a willful act of ignorance, and it's too bad that this book is damaged by her prejudices. I hope some day that a third edition will include modern scientific discoveries. And I hope that some day her \\"Five Kingdoms\\" will be updated to \\"Six.\\" But somehow I doubt it will happen."},{"Title":"Early Life (A Series of books in biology)","review":"This book follows the Margulis tradition of clarity. Margulis, ably co-authored by Dolan begins in the Archean Eon, 3.9 billion years ago and explains how first, bacteria and then, nucleated cells evolved into the multitude of complex plants and animals that first appear in the Cambrian period and whose descendants continue to today. The evolution process from simple bacterial prokaryotic (no nucleus) cell to complex eukaryotic (with a nucleus) cell is explained mainly by symbiogenesis and less so by spontaneous mutations and the Darwinian \\"survival of the fittest\\"--a theory Margulis has championed for years and which I fervently believe is correct, but which is still disputed by many orthodox biologists. The text and diagrams are clear but this book is definitely college level.Barry D. Brown"},{"Title":"Early Life (A Series of books in biology)","review":"I wanted to give 4.5 since it becomes too technical here and there. But otherthan that full points to Lynn.Hinting that mitochondria was a prokaryote, and that symbiosis resulted in its incorporation is provocative idea, backed by the evidence of its inactivity in presence of bacteria-killing antibiotics.The turning point in life, switching from anerobic to aerobic metbolism is neatly explained. Sure its a turning point, there is 18 times more energy(ATP) in aerobic metabolism!.The evolution of eukaryotes, and the evolution of sex are nicely presented.Anyway, to find more of such interesting things better to read the book."},{"Title":"Early Life (A Series of books in biology)","review":"Many years ago I was assigned one chapter in this book for a microbiology course.

That said, the reader should be aware the book is written in the famous Landau style: derivations are carried out based on strong physical intuition and with minimum mathematical detailing and little rigour; much is expected from the reader. The rewards are high for those who (can) pursue the thing: you will be able to muse your collaborators by deriving all those nonlinear PDEs and at the same time to stand for or against recent experimental data by handwaving arguments (that depends a little bit on your brainware, too...).

He tell us to &quot;supplant destructive thoughts with good ones, diseased thoughts with healthy ones&quot; (p. 32).Another one of his themes that he includes in this book has to do with the power of the mind to create. &quot;There is a deep tendency in human nature to become like that which you image yourself to be&quot; he quotes a psychologist as saying (p. 47).Faith, confident assurance in God, releases powerful help on your behalf.We're reminded of the power of the unseen in his description on page 82, &quot;your life, or mine, is not determined by outward circumstances, but by the thoughts that habitually engage the mind.&quot; As a man thinks so he becomes.He has such a powerful way of expressing truth. Consider the statement he makes on page 84, &quot;A thought, properly employed, possesses a healing property.&quot;If a person wants his life to be different, he should think different thoughts.In a couple of places in the book he reminds us that Jesus Christ taught us to humble ourselves as children.Toward the end of the book, a frank discussion of death is given.

While these things are incredibly very, very much relevant, the elements of love and joy and peace and clarity of mind that can be applied to every person who is a believer are also very prevelant in the Bible, and they are there for all to consume and become. In the past, preachers and teachers of God's word omitted these things, but Peale brought them forth in his ministry and started a revolution of sorts. This revolution tells humanity that while they must examine their life in the areas of sin and get their lives right with God through Jesus Christ and repentance, that there is a fulfilling, joyful life that is also in the Bible and prominant and attainable for the believer.

Drummond actually has a hidden agenda involving claiming his legacy from the brutally vicious Patrick Stewart, the Earl of Ornkey and Laird of the Shetland Isles.Widow Gemma Sinclair, companion to Patrick's wife, has the uncanny ability to talk with her horse Ting. When Drummond arrives, Gemma offers to escort him around the isle though she does not trust the handsome outsider. He reciprocates her feeling of mistrust. As they become acquainted an attraction erupts between them that neither wants. However, when he saves her life, Drummond handfasts with Gemma because he loves her and wants to share the truth with her even as he knows her loyalty must be to his enemy who holds her uncle hostage.The late sixteenth century tour of the Shetland Isles is beautifully rendered providing a vivid anchor to the story line. The lead couple is a delight as individuals, but somehow never spark as a couple. The side tales starring the ponies are quite charming though one must ponder the horse logic that filters the narratives. Janet Lynnford furbishes a picaresque historical romance with the emphasis on the intrigue and life of the bygone era, which turns the love story into more of a subplot.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Motivate Healthy Habits: Stepping Stones to Lasting Change","review":"Dr. Rick Botelho has written an easy to read, very authoritative book on what really works to motivate oneself and deal with the emotional/motivational obstacles to getting and staying healthy.

That book was called SECRET CLASSROOMS, written by Geoffrey Elliott and Harold Shukman, two other distinguished alumni of that so-called \\"school for spies.\\" I found that book especially fascinating and an excellent primer on the JSSL. Woodhead's book, MY LIFE AS A SPY, was a much more personal kind of record, a story of a young British lad and how he became a man. Although Woodhead is several years my senior, the experiences all rang so very true, from his early years in which his parents' music shop sparked his interest in music, particularly American west coast jazz. But there's a bit of everything here - the early days of TV, the birth of rock and roll, the austerity of post-war England, and, of course, that dreaded rite of male passage - National Service. After enduring the initial terrors of basic training with its screaming in-your-face drill sergeants and other odd characters you meet in that oh-so leveling experience of military service (and, being an introspective only child, basic was probably a bit more of a shock to young Leslie than it might have been to someone from a large family - like me, for instance), our hero got lucky. He was picked for JSSL. Although Woodhead did reasonably well in his Russian studies at Crail, on a remote Scottish coast, he was restless and impatient with it all. He already had a place waiting at Cambridge, and he wanted his service time to be over. Later, he was often bored and unhappy in his \\"spy\\" work at RAF Gatow in Berlin, copying mostly routine and formulaic air-to-ground traffic. He tells of his first cautious trips into the intrigue-ridden divided city, including a depressing bus tour into the eastern Communist sector. Then, gradually gaining confidence, he ventures further and deeper into the city - often to music venues, to hear artists like the Modern Jazz Quartet or the Jazz West Coast Show. Even so, Woodhead chafes at what seems an endless chain of boring days, and jumps at the chance to finally take leave with a friend to Berchtesgaden and Salzburg where, \\"for a few days, the Cold War faded.\\" But finally his \\"sentence\\" is completed. Back in England he is discharged -\\"I knew with a rush that I had never been as happy in my life. I had the summer ahead of me, I was going to Cambridge, I would learn to drive, I would sleep late, I would see how things stood with the girlfriend ... I was free.\\"All those same feelings came rushing back to me when I read those words and recalled my own release from the army, back in the summer of '65. Woodhead's descriptions of military life are spot on. Equally intriguing is the last third of his book, when, nearly fifty years later, he retraces his path in many of those same places and reflects on his life and his time there and learns a bit more of \\"the big picture\\" of intelligence that was denied to him so many years ago. If you did your time in the service, particularly in military intelligence, then you will find much to relate to here. This is simply one heck of a good story from a JSSL graduate who went on to become a much acclaimed and award-winning documentary film-maker. Thanks, Leslie. - Tim Bazzett, author of Soldier Boy: At Play in the ASA"},{"Title":"My Life As a Spy","review":"Written by RAF veteran and former Cold War-era spy Leslie Woodhead, My Life as a Spy is a life story of the author's coming of age in trying times. Summoned to serve Her Majesty at the tender age of eighteen, Woodhead was trained in the Joint Services School for Linguistics on the East coast of Scotland, taught a course of total immersion in Russian, and posted to an ex-Luftwaffe base in Berlin, which still bore the marks of World War II. Serving as a clandestine informer amid the ruins of a city immersed in paranoia, Woodhead's true story tells of darkness, deception, imprisonment, brutal interrogation, and the harsh reality of daily life as a spy that was nothing like the fantasies of his boyhood.

It is more a series of one-chapter stories and anecdotes about how Christ has changed the hearts and lives of Korean believers than an integrated story.My only two complaints are that it could use a little more connectedness between incidents, and it could provide a little more biographical information about the author, since he is a participant in several of the events. Otherwise, it is a fine book.The book includes episodes from the period of Japanese occupation through the end of the Korean War. It includes many accounts of pastors who were imprisoned for their faith, martyrs, and others who suffered at the hands of the Japanese and North Korean armies.Readers should understand that the picture of Korea and of the Korean church which Campbell describes in the book is drastically different from the Korea and the Korean church of today. The society and the church have both gone through extensive changes in the last half-century, some positive, some not.Nevertheless, the book provides many inspiring tales of transformed lives which are lived solely for God's glory. It provides plenty of opportunity for the reader to do some soul-searching. And may it inspire other generations of Christians--in both the East and the West--to live for God in such a totally dedicated way.(Note: I used to have this review posted here anonymously, but I recently pulled it and re-posted it as a signed review.)"},{"Title":"Daddy's Gone A-Hunting (Wesley Farrell Novels)","review":"In 1938 New Orleans, Creole Wesley Farrell continues to pass himself off as a white. However, his attitude comes into question when he meets black nightclub owner Carol Donovan. Finding himself very attracted to Carol, Wesley empathically listens to her plea that hired muscle Archie Badeaux is putting pressure on her.At about the same time, just released from prison after spending the last decade behind bars, Ernie LeDoux plans to locate and spend his share of the money he stole from a Brinks truck. As Wesley looks into Carol's complaint, black businessmen are suddenly being killed. All of the deceased are linked to a worthless piece of property. Wes is unaware that the three distinct scenarios tie together with him being caught in the middle.DADDY'S GONE A-HUNTING, the third Wes Farrell historical mystery, is a wonderful period piece that will exhilarate fans of the sub-genre. Wes remains a fabulous character and the support cast provides needed authenticity and propellant to keep the story line moving forward. Wesley seems a bit out of characters, especially for readers of the first two novels.

What more can you say about a woman who, &quot; . . . was enough to make a Baptist minister drink swamp water, crawl inside a hollow log, and bay at the moon.&quot;?DADDY'S GONE A-HUNTING is a well crafted crime novel.

Leonard lands in Nowe Miasto Lubawskie, the town near where his grandmother is born, and quickly makes a network of local friends: Adam, a local entrepreneur and his new landlord, the elegant and sensual Pani Wituchowska, with her memories of grandeur before the war, local journalists Ryszard and Grazyna, the mayor, and innumerable relatives that he discovers on his quest to trace his grandmother's roots in Sugajno. The touching narrative is filled with bittersweet images of modern Poland, of its Communist legacy and strong will to survive, fervent Catholicism, and the legacy of Jewish indifference: a good part of the novel traces the author's struggle to divine what happened to the headstones in the local Jewish cemeteries, and he is shocked by how the Polish Jewish history seems to have evaporated into thin air. Most importantly, he reconnects with his Polish roots in a visceral way, embracing Polish cuisine (hunting for wild mushrooms in forests with Adam's mother), culture, and storytelling. A wonderful tale of family, friendship, being a stranger in a strange land, and rediscovering the important things in life. Dziekuje bardzo!"},{"Title":"A Polish Son in the Motherland: An American's Journey Home","review":"When does a personal journey make for beautiful reading? When it tells a remarkable story in language that stimulates the very feelings that moved the author. Kniffel's journal is such a book, a model for any similar attempt. The story, though it happens to be about a modern Polish-American seeking lost family connections in Poland, is the universal one of a stranger's quest in a strange land. Its language is deftly lyrical, never too much for the situation, almost always on target, so that the \\"strangeness\\" is allowed to speak for itself. And to an American reader the particulars are wonderfully strange -from the coughing, stalling Maluch automobile the author uses in pursuit of back-country relatives, to the phallus-shaped mushrooms eagerly gathered to feed the American guest (the feeding is hilariously incessant). Kniffel's discovery of lost family is touching and remarkable in itself; but even more impressive is how, as a child in Michigan, he remembered almost every word about the old country spoken to him by his beloved mother and grandmother. Those words became keys with which Kniffel unlocked his lost world, and, it turns out, a missing part of himself."},{"Title":"A Polish Son in the Motherland: An American's Journey Home","review":"I loved this book which was given to me as a gift. I've visited Poland nine times since 1972. Leonard Kniffel captures the communist and post-communist Poland very accurately.

But there are some grandchildren and great grandchildren who are fascinated with the lands of their immigrant forbears. Author Leonard Kniffel takes us along on his personal journey back to the land of his ancestors; Poland. This isn't some travelogue with stops at all the popular tourist traps. No, Kniffel invites us to share personal moments with his family and newly made friends. The reader will become acquainted with the Polish people, with their hopes and fears as they emerge from the stiffling shadow of Soviet domination. This is a lovely and poignant conclusion to the saga of the hundreds of thousands of Poles who immigrated to the U.S. in search of better lives for themselves and their families. A couple of years after reading this book I was able to take a trip to Poland, myself. There is nothing in this world like going \\"home.\\""},{"Title":"A Polish Son in the Motherland: An American's Journey Home","review":"This is a sensational book.

I have enjoyed all four, but this one brings Alex's character into fuller relief than before. Her friend Harvey is in a bind, and his no-good wife has come back into his life. I found myself enjoying watching Alex deal with the complicated nature of Harvey and his love for Rachel while a taut, runaway story involving the Russian mafia and a terrorist safe house was unfolding. Lynne Heitman has done a masterful job, writing a book I could not stop reading with a story and characters that were each compelling in their own right."},{"Title":"The Pandora Key (Alex Shanahan)","review":"The Pandora Key is the second Lynne Heitman book that I've read and I highly recommend it.Alex Shanahan is a tough, compassionate,and smart PI who, through no fault of her own ends up facing off against the FBI, the Russian Mafia, and a quasi military organization associated with the CIA. The various parties are chasing each other and a computer that holds the key to a billion dollars hidden in various secret accounts and Alex has to find the computer first in order to save her life, the life of her partner and her partner's ex-wife"},{"Title":"The Pandora Key (Alex Shanahan)","review":"Private investigator Alex Shanahan is in partnership with Harvey who is slowly wasting away from multiple sclerosis. One day Alex goes over to Harvey's house and sees his beloved ex wife Rachel there; the woman who cut and run when her husband was diagnosed with MS. Rachel wants Alex to go to her old apartment and pick up some things for her as she fears her abusive husband is there. When Alex goes to the apartment she finds that Rachel cleared out the place many days ago.When she returns to Harvey's apartment she finds him and Rachel gone. Rachel got her out of the way so she could get Harvey to someone who wants to speak to him, a very dangerous head of the Russian Mafiya. They free him but the Mafia king wants Harvey to tell him where, Roger Fratello, the man he believes killed his brother, hides. Harvey is visited by the FBI who wants to know why his fingerprints along with Frank's are on packets of money that were found in a terrorist hideout in Afghanistan along with the belongings of the dead hostages of an airline hijacked by Muslim fundamentalists. There are so many players in this game with different objectives that it will be a miracle if Alex can keep everyone alive by playing one against each other.Lynne Heitman has written a tense thriller taken out of the pages of today's headlines. The timelines of the story enable readers to relate to the characters as well as defining the plot. The heroine doesn't care what politicians or other government agendas; she just wants to keep Harvey alive at long as possible. Ms. Heitman weaves a political message that if gone unchecked, will lead to dangerous repercussions.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Pandora Key (Alex Shanahan)","review":"I have not read The Pandora Key, due to the fact that as I turn each page it falls out.

This book does a much better job of explaining the science behind it. If you're trying to understand the latest hype about \\"low carbs,\\" and to separate out inaccuracies from facts, then you need to read this book. Ravage explains in clear, accessible prose, how high glycemic foods affect weight gain, why the hype about a \\"low carb\\" diet is misleading & potentially unhealthy (there are lots of good & necessary carbs), why \\"diets\\" don't work, and how you can really change your eating habits to lose weight and improve your health. It has great advice and tips for healthy and delicious meals and snacks. And, best of all, there's an exhaustive list in the back of the book that rates every food that has been tested for its GI index and tells you whether that food is high (bad), medium (OK), or low (great!) on the GI index. Makes food shopping and menu planning so much easier. I highly recommend this book to people who are thinking about changing the way they eat."},{"Title":"The G.I.

Handbook: How the Glycemic Index Works","review":"I bought this book a year or two ago along with another GI book and read them both. It was easy to incorporate the plan into my nutritional activities, even though I did so half-heartedly. Within the past six months, people have been asking me if I was on a diet or if I had lost weight. I personally did not notice; the change of seasons and wardrobe switch precluded my observation from looser fitting clothes. After weighing myself, the scale showed that I lost 13 pounds by simply combining my foods properly and reducing the glycemic index. Unsolicited weight-loss made me feel uneasy, so for one month, I intentially ate high GI foods. This resulted in weight gain of approximately a pound a week; and this calmed my fears regarding a potentially pathologic cause of unsolicted weight loss. My daughter has been diagnosed with PCOS and needs to jump on board a full-blown GI guided nutritional plan. I will join her and it won't be difficult because the concept is simple. The only disadvantage could possibly finding the GI of foods. Huge databases of GI ratings are not yet available since the interest is relatively new. I have been told that the University of Sydney is performing ongoing GI testing of foods, and the database is available to online viewers. I have not tried it yet, but this is what I've been told.

He was a struggling pitcher who was trying to use his knuckler to come back; but in reality, he was an aspiring writer waiting to tell the insider stories of his teammates.His book was thought of as a Judas, a traitor initially. In fact, there was quite a bit of hatred and anger over the revealing of Mickey Mantle's alcohol problem. Adultery, playing with hangovers, drugs, and heated altercations are seemingly every day experiences of a professional baseball player.I'll never forget one of the classic lines of the book, a line that showed true insight:MY NAME IS TED F*$#ING WILLIAMS AND I'M THE GREATEST HITTER IN BASEBALL!\\"In light of the recent whistle-blowing of Jose Canseco, I'm struck by how difficult writing this book must have been for Bouton. In a culture and society that has changed drastically since the sixties and seventies, the risk he took is almost unfathomable to anyone today. Publishing the book guaranteed alienation and black-balling from those in baseball with power.It's a must-have for any sports fan who loves to read. It's a classic that captured an era of baseball - the days before agents, greedy players, steroids, ridiculous commercialization, and a watered down league - for which many reminisce."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Although Ball Four was published more than thirty years ago, it remains as true a book now as it was then. Mr. Bouton leaves no subject untouched. Whether writing about the frustration of pitching behind an inferior teammate, \\"activities\\" that go on behind the backs of wives and girlfriends, or dealing with the egos of major league star players and managers, Bouton brings the bigger-than-life world of professional baseball down to earth in a funny and sometimes hilarious way."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Ball Four, Jim Bouton's fine diary about life with the Seattle Pilots and Houston Astros in the year 1969 (the same year man landed on the Moon), has been hailed as a groundbreaking, revolutionary book about baseball, sports, and life in general. Most people are correct when they say it was the first truely successful &quot;tell-all&quot; book, pointing out the human fallacies of such superstars as Mickey Mantle, Elston Howard, and Alvin Dark, as well as the dubious effectiveness of executives in general and managers in particular. Most critics are also correct when they say that this book violated the sanctity of the locker-room by showing a professional sports team as a profane, prank-filled, rather juvenile bunch of guys rather than as cardboard heroes. Still, many people who write about Ball Four miss it's most significant contribution, one voiced by Bouton himself: He told the American public how much (and, more importantly), how little professional athletes really made at the time. According to Jim, most people read the headlines and knew that Mickey Mantle made $100,000 a year or so in the mid-1960's. But they didn't realize that Yankee rookies (the team Bouton started his career with) only made $7000 a year, and that Jim himself only made a salary in the low 20's even after three years of experience, twenty wins a season, and two World Series wins as a pitcher! In other words, most people felt that if Mantle made 100K, then Elston Howard, Tom Tresh, Jim Bouton, and other Yankees of the day must have made about 40-60K each season. The fact that Bouton broke the most sacred code of all and TOLD HOW MUCH MONEY PLAYERS EARNED (or not, as the case may be) made him a pariah to the baseball establishment and forced his exclusion from Yankee's Old Timer games for the next quarter century. Still, you may ask, why would I want to read this 30-year old book? The funny stories, the rude and crude language, the camaraderie among a group which binds them together despite significant differences? Yes, and something much more fundamental. Jim Bouton is the champion of the outsider, the knucklehead, the rebel in all of us who feels, right or wrong, that no matter how good he gets, he will never truly fit in. His daily diary entries prove that all of us, even professional athletes, suffer from what actor Roy Schieder called &quot;flop sweat,&quot; i.e., fear of failure. This quality, along with all the wild, zany, and utimately touching stories, makes Ball Four such an excellent read after all these years. Pick up Ball Four today. You'll find that no matter how much you sometimes feel a misfit, you'll always have a champion in Jim!"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I read this book when it first came out. It was quite an eye-opener although it may seem tame by today's standards. There was, we were told, an unwritten (and in some cases WRITTEN) rule that what happens in the club house stays in the club house. Jim Bouton certainly trashed that maxim as well as a lot of other sacred icons in &quot;Ball Four&quot;. In the process he became more famous for his writing than he ever was for his pitching.This book is actually a diary of a pitcher's season. Bouton was a flame-throwing pitcher for the Yankees but he blew out his arm when he was still relatively young. He attempted to come back as a knuckle ball pitcher with the Seattle Pilots (remember them?). Pitching on an expansion team in its' first year gave Bouton an interesting perspective. Afterall, his previous service in the majors involved pitching in the World Series for the almighty Yankees. He went from a great team to a lousy team; from being a very good pitcher to a slightly below mediocre pitcher. With this background, the author shares what it was like to be at the top and what it is like to be at the bottom. We go day to day through the season. Bouton critiques his various pitching performances as well as the rest of the expansion team. Much of the book is hilarious, especially the parts about his manager, Joe Schultz. It is, however, Bouton's comments about his former Yankee teammates that have ruffled so many feathers. For example, he ponders how many more home runs Mickey Mantle would have gotten if he hadn't come to so many games hungover. Well, so much for Bouton being invited to Old-timer's games at Yankee Stadium. Yet his book is tame compared to today's slash and burn sports reporters. Mickey actually comes across as a loveable hero rather than the tragic figure many later portayed him as.Many people have tried to portray the life of a major league athlete. Most have made it too complicated or glamorous. Bouton's version still stands out as the best. He makes it sound like fun. You'll have fun, too, if you read &quot;Ball Four&quot;."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Jim Bouton is not a name that comes up when discussing the all time greats of baseball. However, when discussing the all time greatest baseball novels, his name should come up every time. Ball Four is a fantastic day-in-the-life recounting of a single player's (Bouton's) Major League season - more specifically, the season being 1969, and his playing days that year split between the upstart franchise Seattle Pilots, and the beleagured, relatively new Houston Astros. What sets the novel apart is it's absolutely brutal, truthful (but very taboo) telling of the player's and coach's personalities and lifestyles. Not a single vulgarity or shocking sequence is missed in Bouton's daily log he kept which eventually became this famous non-fiction piece. It also created more enemies in the game than he could've imagined. He only played one and a half more seasons after it's publication, and is a testament to a very intelligent, and brave athlete who wrote with a beautifully relaxing, very funny, and down-to-earth tone. A great read for true baseball fans."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"It's easy to see why this extraordinary book created such a sensation when it first came out in 1970. Bouton, a sporadically successful pitcher nearing the end of his career, airs ALL of Major League baseball's dirty laundry--all those long and carefully concealed nasties and naughties, from relatively minor stuff such as the pervasive use of profanity to more serious issues like habitual drug use, heavy drinking and rampant womanizing. He also documents anti-intellectualism, lingering racial bigotry, homophobia and the casual cruelty of established stars towards rookies and fans. I kept wondering, as I read, to what extent Bouton himself participated in the activities he describes. He admits to drinking and popping the occasional &quot;greenie&quot; (speed, I assume), but never directly owns up to any marital infidelities.He also exposed the dirtiest baseball secret of all, which wasn't sex, but salaries. It may come as a shock to present-day readers, accustomed to multi-millionaire baseball stars, to learn that players 30+ years ago earned barely subsistence wages and were totally at the mercy of club owners. I was flabbergasted to learn that Bouton, with a wife and three kids, earned LESS than my own extremely modest salary at that time as a (single) university Instructor!But this book isn't a heavy-handed, moralistic indictment of Major League baseball. Instead, it's gloriously goofy and hilariously funny! As a writer, Bouton has a genuine, unique &quot;voice,&quot; which I suspect owes very little to his editor. Someone could hand me a copy of any paragraph from _Ball Four_ and I'd recognize it instantly as Bouton. How many authors can you say that about?To me, the funniest anecdote in a book full of marvelous stories is Bouton's report that the Seattle Pilots' manager fined players for appearing at the clubhouse post-game buffet--as Bouton delicately puts it--&quot;with Charlie uncovered.&quot; In itself, this is a funny, somewhat crude anecdote; it's Bouton's additional comment that raises it to the level of high comedy art. He notes that if the Yankees had instituted the same rule they'd have made a fortune in fines, since Elston Howard and Yogi Berra both were &quot;famous for dragging Charlie through the cold cuts.&quot; That line alone is worth the price of the book!"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I really had a good time reading Ball Four. Over the last thirty years, the things that Bouton &quot;reveals&quot; about ballplayers are well-known in the year 2000 (such as the fact that baseball players are not demig-ds, and ocasionally have affairs outside of marriage or like to drink alcohol). History has shown that Bouton was right and Bowie Kuhn was wrong -- this book didn't destroy anything or anybody. Instead, what actually struck closer to home was Bouton's talk about how the advice he got from managers and coaches was usually run-of-the-mill tripe (&quot;Keep the ball down! Keep the ball up!&quot;). I've always thought so as well. This is a must-read for anybody who enjoys the game of baseball and its history."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Ball Four is one of the most important, and enjoyable, baseball books ever written. Jim Bouton gives you an inside view of what actually goes on in the Major Leagues. Through him you get to see what all of the players you watch or listen to play are actually like. He doesn't leave anything out in order to avoid upsetting people. He touches upon everything that happened during the season and the result is a wonderfully insightful and funny book. If you're a fan of baseball, you must read this book."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Ball four was a great book because it brought to light a side of baseball that had never been seen or even imagined for that matter. Bouton's anecdotal prose illuminates not only his struggle to hang on but also illustrates heroes throughout the game. This is a must read and I rank it very high on my lsit of all time favorite books."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"My prospective 12th grade English teacher wasn't too impressed with my choice of an \\"all-time favorite book\\", but in 1971, \\"Ball Four\\" by Jim Bouton was it. Growing up in central New York state, I'd been a Yankee fan for my entire childhood, and remembered Bouton pitching for the Yanks in the World Series in the early '60s. In \\"Ball Four\\", Bouton touches on those days, in the process demythologizing some of my heroes--Mickey Mantle and Whitey Ford in particular--but I wasn't bitter; I was fascinated with the stories of how my athletic heroes behaved as human beings.Even better were Bouton's diary accounts of his days as a reliever with the Seattle Pilots, a one-year team that quickly moved to Milwaukee and exists today as the Brewers, and with the Houston Astros (featuring future Hall of Famer Joe Morgan and managed by Harry \\"The Hat\\" Walker\\". How else would I remember that the manager of that team was Joe Schulz, a crusty old baseball lifer whose two favorite \\"words\\" would be sure to get this review removed from view (the first started with F and ended with T, the second started with S and ended with K). As an ex-Cardinal, Schulz exhorted his players to \\"get the win and go in to \\"pound that B...weiser\\". As a 16-year old I also viewed with great hilarity the crude humor of ballplayers on the road--a phrase I still use today came from a ballplayer told that a game would start at 9:30 a.m, \\"Nine thirty? H..l, I'm not done throwing up by that time of day!\\" After a bumpy bus ride, another player offers to buy the bus. I'll leave it to you to guess why. In response to Walker's niggling managerial style, the Astros composed their own theme song \\"It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be an Astro\\" (\\"if we win our game each day, what the f... can Harry say/it makes a fellow proud to be an Astro!\\")Bouton also takes us through his pitching season--outing by outing--you get a feel of how seriously ballplayers evaluate each game (at least Bouton did), and at Bouton's level of \\"last man in the bullpen\\", how tenuous their hold on a major league position is. Maybe there was more to this now famous book than Ms. Trapnell gave it credit for in 1971."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"In 1970, baseball was hit with two ground-breaking events that shook it from its complacent stance left over from the days of FDR. First, Curt Flood began his challenge to the time-honored reserve clause when he tried to block his trade to Philadelphia. And second, the publication of a relief pitcher's season diary with the Seattle Pilots and Houston Astros, a book that challenged the image of ballplayers forever.That book was \\"Ball Four\\", and it was the view of a memorable 1969 season for Jim Bouton, the author and a former star pitcher with the Yankees. Now down on his luck and struggling to remain on a major-league roster, Bouton decided to document his trek from the dungeons of the minor leagues to the full-fledged ecstasy of pitching a major league game successfully.It's the stories along the way, however, that made baseball squirm...Seen through the light of post-Watergate \\"destroying the heroes\\" (and through the troubling trend of post-9/11 to build them back up), \\"Ball Four\\" seems on some levels like \\"been there, done that\\". But seen through the context of the time it came out, it shook the foundations of the game and caused a major scandel for Bouton and kept him from being invited to Old Timers' Day in New York.Bouton was a former phenom whose fastball secured him a spot on the Yankees roster in the early Sixties, but by the time of the 1969 season he was struggling to find a new pitch to accomadate the sore arm that he acquired in place of that fastball. Here documented is his struggle with mastering the knuckleball, easily the most difficult pitch to control. Also, Bouton has money problems that his bosses aren't eager to resolve. Before Curt Flood's post-season trade disputes began, Bouton is seen fighting tooth-and-nail for a measly $1000 at a time, and his trade from Seattle could very well have had something to do with that (or his insistance on investing in a new product on the market, something called \\"Gatorade\\" which was supposedly better than soda for ballplayers).Bouton also discusses the times he's living in, and how baseball chooses to ignore them. Race relations, the civil rights movement, the war in Vietnam, and all the issues that defined the Sixties never seemed to touch baseball, but Bouton gets under the skin of his teammates and his coachs by embracing some of the youth culture around him. Some of the funniest passages describe his reactions to the constant stream of country-and-western music at the back of the team bus, where he tries to \\"fit in\\" with the guys.Bouton is remarkably honest for a ballplayer, spicing his diary with revealing passages about himself, his past, and the pasts of those around him. That's what brought him before the auspices of comissioner Bowie Kuhn to \\"deny\\" what he wrote as being true. His discussions about Mickey Mantle (whose alcoholism eventually killed him) was seen as a Benedict Arnold-esque turn in 1970, but now we all know Bouton was telling the truth.Bouton's struggles with control both on the field and against his bosses make \\"Ball Four\\" a revelation, as it shows old-time baseball as the antiquated institution it is. He also revels in the fact that he's not a typical jock, and many of the teammates around him who may have been angered by tales about their own faults actually emerge as more sympathetic figures than they would have in the typical hagiograpchic sports screeds. Here they're real human beings, not the God-like figures of yore.Jim Bouton went from being a good pitcher with arm problems to a truth-telling Judas who wrote himself out of the game. But when the book you pen is \\"Ball Four\\", it might very well be worth it. Bouton will be remembered for his masterpiece of sports literature far longer than the critics who took him to task for that. You couldn't ask for a better won-loss record."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"After Thirty years I reread this book and it is not the book I remembered. It's better. It was then, it is now, simply the best Baseball Book ever.But it is now more than that. It's history.When the Original edition of Ball Four came out it was considered scandalous and an unflattering expose on Baseball. Now it's history. American history. And the continuing autobiography of a man who is so much more than just a ballplayer.Jim Bouton reveals what baseball was like in the 1960's: Players getting less than $10,000 a year in salary, General Managers lying to players and tricking them into low salaries. It is just hard to believe all that was baseball then.Ball Four is famous, or infamous for giving great insight into several players. Yet in retrospect, not much is really told about the individual players. Mickey Mantle drank a lot and didn't sigh autographs; Roger Maris didn't always hustle. This is small stuff compared with what is told today. Still this is the stuff that started it all.But the best part are the epilogues, written in 1980, 1990 and 2000, because they add a new perspective to the book. The author points out that maybe if more time was spent dealing with Mantle's drinking problem and less time spent hiding it and blasting Bouton maybe the Mick would be here today.The book is fascinating and funny. And Real. I began t o understand what it most be like to be on the road, bored, for so many months a year. I began to understand why they did what they did.Mr. Bouton deflates the image of the baseball player: They drank, took greenies (speed) and looked at girls in the stands. Shocking news! But he also deflates the images of coaches and managers. A player that floats in and out of the book is a rookie to the new Seattle Pilots. He talent is not overlooked by the players but it is overlooked by management is sent down to the minors and then traded to Kansas City. His name is Lou Pinella. A similar story is told about Mike Marshall.Jim Bouton discusses his return to Yankee Stadium for old-timers day and the events surrounding it. In the end, that is what affected me the most. Having read the book thirty years ago, I thought it would be interesting to read the epilogues first. Their you learn the heart-breaking news that the Boutons lost their daughter, Laurie, in an accident in 1997. It changed everything, even the original Ball Four section. Mr. Bouton was devoted to Baseball, but he was devoted to family. In Ball Four we are introduced to Laurie at age three when she comes to a doubleheader with Mrs. Bouton and their two other children. Then, she is ironically nicknamed &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown.&quot; Yet it is her spirit that gets Bouton invited back to the Old Timers Day at Shea. Mel Stottlemyre is mentioned in the original 1969 part of the book. Yet it is his conversation with Bouton, about losing his son in 1981, that will remain with me. You can't read it without tearing up.I guess we like to think that baseball is everything to those who play it. Ball Four was the first to show what it was really like to get go through a season. In his Final Pitch Mr. Bouton shows what it takes to get through life. I hope he has a few more chapters in him. I'm sure Laurie would hope so too."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I first read this book when I was about fifteen or so - way back in the 70's. That tattered paperback copy is one of the few books from my teenage years that I still own, having hauled it and a few other beloved reads in moves from Pennsylvania to Arizona to Colorado. I loved the book then and reread it every couple of years. Bouton's sense of humor pervades the book, and still keeps me laughing.Aside from a fascinating insight into the sport of baseball, it was also a terrific insight into the male mind. The day -to -day accounts of the activities of the exclusively male environment of a sports team was quite engrossing to a girl living with a single mother and two sisters. (Someday, somehow, I am going to play that baby powder/hair dryer prank on someone!)The book also offers a look into America's past that even in the mid-70's was no more. I can recall my shock and disbelief at Bouton's description of the restaurants in the South that would not serve the black ball players inside - forcing those players to take their food outside to eat on the team bus. Nothing like that existed in my Pennsylvania town; it was hard for me to believe such things occurred in my own lifetime. (And to this day, I am indignant that the ball clubs would patronize such restaurants, and the fellow players would accept this situation.)I heard of the book from Mad Magazine, and read it in order to understand the joke in the magazine --something about you know you are Republican if you think Jim Bouton is a traitor -- (and yes, I was the kind of kid who would read a book in order to udnerstand a joke!). I had not been a baseball fan before reading Ball Four, but I've been a fan ever since. (And a lifelong democrat &lt;g&gt;)"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I'm one of the many whose lives were enriched by Ball Four and who gained personal inspiration from it. In addition to all else that the book is, it is the story of someone who at the moment was an underdog, in a difficult and sometimes hostile setting, seeking to bring himself back to a better place, little by little -- AND HE MAKES IT! I'm sure that wasn't a part of the original intent of the book, but it's there, and it's very moving. That moment when Bouton runs into the Astro manager and coaches in the hotel lobby while they're talking about maybe giving him a start, is a great literary moment, and there are many others like it -- simple moments that rise surprisingly to the level of drama because of the book's fine pacing and the humanness of the narrative. Each next edition of the book -- \\"Ball Five,\\" \\"Ball Six,\\" \\"Ball Seven\\" -- has added significant new chapters. Ball Four is very much a book of that moment in which it originated, but its humanity, wit, and, yes, drama will keep it alive for a very, very long time."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"What can I say about this book? I used to read it every summer. I read it by date (June 9, I read June 9 entry) tracked the stats etc. I first read this book in eighth grade. It didn't shatter the myth of Mickey Mantle, other ballplayers or the state of the sacred game, in general. I was a METS FAN anyway. What it did do is make light that ballplayers aren't unconditional heroes. They are human beings and rather tame compared to some of today's criminals. (I mean athletes). First time through I laughed at loud and each successive time I fondly remembered scenes painted so vividly by Bouton. For me it was like re-watching a favorite movie such as Say Anything, The Graduate or When Harry Met Sally. Ballplayers are traveling for months at a time and the same issues written here are also found in &quot;reality shows&quot;. Ball Four was ahead of its time for this reason but also for the fact that no one was writting an insider book like this back in 1970. My generation of sports fans can quote from this book, still today."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"This is one of the greatest baseball books ever written--a funny, irreverent, truthful account of a veteran pitcher's attempt to come back from injury as a knuckleballer with the short-lived expansion Seattle Pilots. Bouton tells his story with remarkable humor and insight, and in its day the book was a real shocker. (Mickey Mantle drinks and chases girls!!??! No way!) Real baseball fans will want to reflect on the rest of the story, which unfolded further only this year: how Bouton, after the tragic death of his daughter Laurie in an auto accident last year, was finally invited back to Old-Timer's Day at Yankee Stadium.Welcome back, Jim and Ball Four. We missed you both!"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"The original text of Ball Four is not as funny or as original as I remember from reading it years ago (1974?), but maybe I've become jaded over the decades. Still, Bouton's diary is hilarious in places, and it gives an inside look at the game any baseball fan has to love. The real bonus is in the appendices Bouton has added to subsequent editions, all of which are included in the \\"Final Pitch.\\" They are excellent. The section on meeting with former MLB commissioner Bowie Kuhn over Kuhn's demand that Bouton sign a statement admitting Ball Four is erroneous and largely a fabrication is as hilarious as it is chilling. Bouton's takes on the owners' interference in the game, the commercialization of the \\"product\\" via television, and the corruption of the reportage of all sports that occurs when media forces own teams or control the broadcast of games are spot-on. Twenty years ago Bouton knew exactly what was wrong with baseball, and the corruption and venality of baseball's owners has done nothing to obviate his complaints or apply his remedies in all this time.Bouton would have been a baseball iconoclast even if he had never played the game. His insights are too piercing for the tender skin of the sport that his diary exposes as parochial, insular, and inbred. Clearly, Bouton loves the game of baseball -- he played at one level or another from age seven to 57 - and it is his love of the game that is at the root of his writing. Bouton wasn't out to destroy baseball, he gave it a loving nudge in the ribs and said,... That was evidently too strong a medicine for the Lords of Baseball to bear. If baseball's ownership had any guts or an appreciation of the game as anything but a profit center, Jim Bouton would be commissioner of baseball today, instead of some owners' puppet like Bud \\"Lite\\" Selig. P.S. My copy came signed by the author."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Books about sports stars can be dated in two ways. BBF (Before Ball Four) and ABF (After Ball Four). Before this book came out, sports stars were mythologized in print and the books had a cardboard-style sameness to them. According to the BBF books baseball stars such as Mickey Mantle, Babe Ruth and Ted Williams did nothing but pull for their team and engage in some occasional boyish antics. In other words, heroes through and through.The reality was quite different, Babe Ruth was an incorrigible woman chaser, heavy drinker and was verbally cruel to people. There is the classic story of a group of baseball writers playing a game of cards on a train taking the Yankees on a road trip. A naked woman followed by an equally naked Ruth ran past them. One writer remarked, \\"It is a good thing I didn't see that because otherwise I would have to write about it.\\" Mickey Mantle was a heavy drinker; he often played so heavily hung over that he had trouble keeping his eyes open. Williams was not a team player, he was at times an indifferent fielder and he refused to enlarge the strike zone by even an inch in order to drive in a run that would tie or win a game. There is a classic story that he once hit a home run that got his team back in the game. However, rather than accepting the accolades of his teammates, he sat in the dugout cussing himself for swinging at a pitch that was a ball.Bouton's book changed all that. He described the players as human, with all their faults. In the early sixties Bouton had one of the best fastballs in the game, his pitching helped propel the Yankees to the American league pennant and some argued that in 1964, he was the best pitcher in baseball. However, in 1965 he hurt his arm and could no longer throw the heat. In 1969, he made a semi-comeback throwing the knuckleball for the expansion Seattle Pilots. Even on a marginal team he was at best a marginal player. This book is a combination of his actions with the Pilots as well as a reflection of his time with the Yankees. Therefore, it is easy to detect a strain of bitterness at the loss of the glory days of the 1964 Yankees. Nevertheless, while many people have decried the book, no one has ever come forward to disprove his statements about the escapades of the players. Many drank heavily and took drugs, most were sexually promiscuous, and at times they were contemptuous of the fans.Since \\"Ball Four\\" came out, the books about sports stars have been more honest. This, in my opinion, is good for the fans, the games and even the players. The nation has become much more knowledgeable and realistic in how it views heroes.

In Ball Four, Bouton goes from the minors to the Seattle Pilots, then to Houston, over the course of the 1969 season. The book really captures a bygone era of baseball. Salaries were low, bus rides were long, and a lot of big names were still in the game.The book has a reputation for being funny, and it is. Bouton has a wry sense of humor and a keen eye for human foibles.A few subjects felt burned, but in this day of athletes accused of drug abuse and criminal behavior, some of the antics that Bouton writes about seem very tame, almost quaint. It's a little hard to see what the fuss was about if you're planted firmly in 2005.Bouton's observations are fascinating, capturing an era in baseball (and more broadly, in our nation) that has all but disappeared. These were the days before million-dollar contracts and when the length of their hair and sideburns sometimes held the key to a player's future.Bouton brings the moments alive, so the reader can feel the nerves of a pitcher blowing a game, the joy of running across a big-league field, the frustration of trying to get Gatorade, the speechlessness of finding one's shoes nailed to the clubhouse floor.Readers should be grateful that someone with a clear, ironic eye had the foresight to take notes and write this book. As Bouton himself says, so many of the funny details would have been lost forever.For baseball fans, young and old, put this at the top of your summer reading list."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Jim Bouton a former twenty game winner was the first player to brake baseballs unwritten code of Omerta.

But, it certainly opened up my eyes to the &quot;real world&quot;, not only of baseball, but the rest of it. Now, 30 years later, I count myself an avid baseball fan, and I have Jim Bouton to thank for that. Bouton's humor, humanity and sheer but simple love of the game come shining through in 'Ball Four', and the fact that it created such a &quot;tizzy&quot; in the baseball establishment, still today, is proof of the book's value and importance. To those of us who have read 'Ball Four'and continue to pull it off the shelf every March when spring training kicks in, it is a dear, old friend coming for a welcome visit--and, in many ways, those of us &quot;in the know&quot; about Bouton and his book consider the knowledge of it admission into a secret society--the wonderful thing about that, is that we welcome everyone! Come join!

I mean, haven't you ever wondered what they REALLY talk about when the manager goes out to talk to the pitcher!?

Oh, no doubt, it's entertaining...and Bouton IS a good writer (or Schecter a great editor). And let's never forget that WITHOUT it, we should never have had the pleasure of Dennis Rodman's name on a bestseller.But the book is hardly shocking anymore, and I doubt the high school toughs of today have even heard of it, much less decided to read it (now, if MICHAEL JORDAN decided to write a tell-all....)However, the diminished shock value makes BALL FOUR'S merits stand out more clearly than perhaps they could when it was new. Though I wasn't shocked by it, I often found myself laughing; Bouton has a way of sketching characters and dialogue quite entertainingly. Too, being a bit of an outsider myself, I could certainly relate to his one-rational-voice-crying-out-in-the-wilderness persona. And the 1990 edition of the book has value in that Bouton is able to look back and see the results of the changes in baseball he and others worked toward.So, perhaps, the reader's enjoyment of BALL FOUR is in the approach. Don't expect to be shocked or enraged; that time is past.

I just read Ball Four, and next spring, I am giving a copy to every kid on my Little League team, of which I am the head coach. Well, not every player, just the pitching staff. I'm sure that the league offices up in Williamsport, Pennsylvania will reimburse me, because this is one book that no ten year old aspiring ballplayer, particularly pitchers, should be without. Within the book, Jim Bouton tells about the fundamentals of baseball in a way that I could never communicate. It covers everything, from what to do and what not to do in preparation for a pitching start to how to how to throw the knuckleball to how pitching can take a toll on your arm if you don't use the proper fundamentals (like Steve Barber, or Jim Bouton, for that matter). I only wish that this book was around when I was a youngster; I would have been a much better player. Jim Bouton has written a fine book about the ins and outs of baseball, and I'm sure that every parent of every kid on my team, as well as the team's sponsor (John Birch Society, Orangeburg Chapter), will be happy that the kids are taking home this educational and informative reading material."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"This book is a great journal of a marginal player for an expansion baseball team. It has got great stories, great gossip, emotional ups and downs, and is an insightful read.I, being so young (meaning desensitized by today's culture), I found nothing truly shocking. Though it must have been pretty ground shaking in 1970, it's tamer than I thought it would be.It's a good book and granted it was the start of the trend that exposes athletes and heroes and mere humans, but if it was released today, most people would not have given it a second thought."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"In all my time of being involved with baseball, playing baseball, and coaching baseball on both the little league and the high school levels, never have I read a book that is this informative. I reccomend this book to any little leaguer trying to get the fundamentals of baseball down pat. Whether it be something as complex as teaching the proper execution of the drag bunt, or something as simple and elementary as good sportsmanship, this book covers it all. It is a wholesome book, and wholesome, clean entertainment is so hard to find these days. As official scorer, I score this one a hit!!!"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"He told it like it is with some ego mixed in. He is obviously intelligent, not the usual sports jock."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Even without personally meeting Jim Bouton I can say for certain that he his my friend. We share the same cranky attitudes, the same disrespect for authority ( I sometimes wear my \\"Question Authority\\" t-shirt to work) and his insistency on telling the truth. No matter what. I work as a Registered Nurse at a long term mental health care facility and could probably go mano-a-mano with Jim about the utter incompetence of \\"the general manger\\" or \\"the manager.\\" Jim is a man of great courage and has the luxury of having a hottie wife who is also as smart and as skillful as a later day Anne Bancroft. Buy this book or forever live in purgatory. Ken"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Simply one of the best books around. Great for a fan of baseball and great for a fan of life's stories."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I am a 23 year old sports administration student with a journalism degree. I picked this book up only three days ago and since then have used every spare minute reading from its pages. It is a nice blend of team comradery and look into a man who wanted no more than to play ball! I have travelled with teams and over heard the conversations they have, and witnessed the hijinxs. There is no difference from todays players to that &quot;great&quot; Pilots team. I love the game of baseball, and all its tradition, even being a Canadian kid with Hockey embeded into my upbringing.I have already started to let others in on the book and they are anxious to read it as well."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"He writes honestly about what it is like to be the outsider. Which is why this book created such an uproar in 1970. Marginal relief pitchers can not give the public the low down on Mickey Mantle, or give the bird to Commissioner Kuhn.Baseball needs someone today to give us the real story. I still come back to this book after 10 years. It is refreshing in its innocence. Would Sammy Sosa pop a greenie? Do the Montreal Expos go &quot;beaver shooting&quot; while in Toronto? Certainly there must be a manager today who tells his team to &quot;Pound back the ol'Budweiser like Joe Schultz. Say that its so.This book will be read by baseball fans in 2075--as much as Fred Talbot must hate to hear it."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I was glad this anniversary edition was released! I had &quot;loaned&quot; my first copy of &quot;Ball Four&quot; to my cousin back in the '70s and never got it back!I got to be a teamate of Jim a few years back with Little Ferry in the Metropolitan Baseball League in NJ. Jim's a great guy and when I told him so, he agreed with me! &lt;g&gt;The Book is a &quot;must read&quot; for baseball fans.The only baseball book better than this is Leo Durocher's &quot;Nice Guys Finish Last!&quot;When you read Durocher's book, you will realize the greatest character in baseball history was probably Dizzy Dean!Read both! (They never get old!)"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I enjoyed reading Ball Four so much that I contacted Jim Bouton and conducted an interview with him. Take a look at my website."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I discovered this book when I was 13 and must have read it fifty times. It revealed baseball players to be more than tarted-up faux heros but human beings. Bouton's approach to the story was to capture the humor and the pain of an actual season. I really believe this book would not have been complete without his stint in the minors. It just all came together. Now when I watch a game, I watch more than just the stars. I watch the bench-riders, the coaches, the fans, and all the other HUMANS that play the game."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"This book is still selling almost thirty years after it was originally published. That ought to tell you something.I first read it in 1975 as a rebellious teenager. I found, and continue to find, Bouton's independent streak and courage to be admirable. He refused to play along with the Neanderthals; he mouthed off to bosses; he loved the game and wanted to win and play well. The type of person who could hold the above against him is the sort that is currently being parodied in _Dilbert_ books.One thing about this book is that it is hilariously funny. His account of his time with the old Portland Mavericks is as funny as his accounts of bullpen and locker-room humour. His style is highly readable and never boring.And goddess, how he loves the game of baseball. And if you do, as well, and haven't read this book, you have a real treat ahead of you."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"It's hard to imagine an odder pitch than a knuckleball, or a better metaphor for the Jim Bouton \\"comeback\\" season he chronicles in Ball Four.Once a back to back twenty game winner for the Yankess with a blistering fastball, Bouton is now so injured he can barely hold a fork. He decides to re-learn how to throw a knuckleball, and manages to do it well enough to latch on to the Seattle Pilots. This also gives Bouton the vehicle to write a behind the scenes tell all book about baseball- the first of about thirty billion to come but one of the best in all sports, not just baseball, and remaining so to this day.As other reviewers have pointed out, it is a bit tame by today's standards, and even for it's day it relied more on good writing and storytelling than on shock value, but it is still real enough that the reader comes away with a pretty good sense of what the locker room must've been like.Bouton's non-baseball worldview in Ball Four is all too familiar, but at the time he was also ground-breaking in his cynical disparagement of American values. He left Mom and apple pie alone, but he decided to unmask baseball the way American Beauty went after the family.Still, for all his ahead of his time pc cynicism he was still pretty funny, and he's not a hard guy to cheer for. Kind of a likeable Keith Olbermann, if there is such a thing. And the book isn't as political as I'm making it sound, it's just that it has a kind of undercurrent that at once reflected the counter-culture of the 60s/70s but also was a forerunner to much of today's sports writing. About as important a book about a game as you are likely to run across, and it still makes me root for a knuckleball pitcher to this day."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Ball Four takes me back to a time when heroes were icons.This is the first Kiss and Tell novel on baseball, and it was the best of all of them. Bouton may have been the most hated man in baseball for a long time. Unlike a Pedro Martinez, a low life Red Sox headhunter, It was not for his play that he was despised.Bouton was hated for the best real reason: He told the truth. None of the stories that he told were ever discounted that I have heard. He ripped the label of honor off of the old ball game and many will never forgive him.The book is funny, and hip for its time."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"The amazing thing about reading Ball Four now, almost 30 years after it was first published, is how the game of baseball has changed. Bouton's book is almost a time capsule, illustrating what it was like when players didn't control the game and political correctness wasn't even a term. We need another Jim Bouton to describe life in baseball today. Do the Yankees still shoot beaver? Do players even worry anymore about getting back $600 apartment deposits if they're traded? Have greenies given way to andro? Even if a new Bouton surfaced, he couldn't be any funnier than the original. The image that never fails to crack me up is the one of Joe Pepitone giving a guy a hotfoot while being the victim of a hotfoot himself. Has Ken Griffey Jr. ever given anyone a hot foot? Does he even know what it is?"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"&quot;Ball Four&quot; remains, over 20 years after I read it the first time, one of my all time favorites. I have read it in its entirety probably ten times and picked it up to read two to three page sections probably hundreds of times to get a quick laugh. And I never get bored with it. This book was written in an age where the mediocre players (like Bouton at that time) had to fight for every dollar and the owners were in control. There weren't the prima donnas of today, expecting to be worshipped like a deity despite a .225 batting average. And Bouton lays it all out; the clubhouse gags, the use of &quot;greenies&quot; (Pep Pills), &quot;Baseball Annies&quot; (Groupies) and the fights of salary negotiation when you're an end-of-the-road pitcher who once was great (Bouton). You'll be shocked at the annual salaries that are fought over in this book! His admission of Mickey Mantle's love of alcohol got him chastised and ostracized, but Mickey's health problems at the end of the life showed Bouton wasn't lying. A great book for sports fans everywhere. I only wish they would reissue this book with Bouton's follow-up &quot;I'm Glad You Didn't Take It Personally&quot; included, which describes Bouton's trials and tribulations after &quot;Ball Four&quot; was released."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"This was a provocative book when it was first published. Jim Bouton, who had been a star pitcher for the New York Yankees, was trying to mount a comeback by working on a knuckleball in the bullpen of the expansion team Seattle Pilots less than five years later. He was a world away from pitching in two World Series in two successive seasons with players like Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris as team mates.His fastball could no longer shatter a pane of glass, but his astute observations about professional sports broke many barriers that had existed between the owners, players and the fans. Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn publicly condemned the book.Bouton was traded to Houston before the season ended. The last place Seattle Pilots faded and died. The team was sold and transferred to Milwaukee after only one year. As such, it is something of a historic artifact of the failed Pilots team as well as a humorous look at the National Pastime."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"This insider's account of playing in the big leagues is side-splitting entertainment. Bouton concentrates on the fun, the funny, and the amusingly odd aspects of what so many call \\"adults playing a boys' game.\\" In his well-travelled career, Bouton played for the Yankees, Braves, Astros, and even the late, not-so-great Seattle Pilots. His personal contacts and anecdotes with many well-known baseball personalities (many still active as commentators, managers, and broadcasters) reminds us all that life, as well as sports, should be fun and we should keep an eye open for the humor in mundane siutations. Anyone with an interest in baseball will truly get more than a few chuckles from this well written book."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Jim Bouton's Ball Four has rightly been called the best sports book of all times by publications that actually matter, but I figure I'll throw my two cents in, too. In a day before an ol' ballplayer could hire a ghost and slap together some fond memories or pathetic pleas for forgiveness (hiya, Pete Rose), Bouton, making a comeback as a knuckleballer with the expansion Seattle Pilots, toted a tape recorder with him for an entire year in order to write this day-by-day account of life in the bigs.The humor is at once anecdotal and observational, and, most importantly, consistent. The Seattle Pilots were rather like the Cleveland Indians in the film Major League - a haphazard collection of rookies and cast-offs trying to make it. Of course, Major League had to have the whole underdog thing going on.The issues that face baseball today - drugs, salaries, lack of interest by hometown fans, the Yankees being the source of all evil - are all present in Ball Four. The only part of the book that hasn't aged perfectly is the scale of the salaries - Bouton and his teammates hold out for an increase of a few thousand dollars, instead of the millions today's players make.In summation, there is no baseball book you should read before this one, and there are precious few books you should read, period, before this one. Ball Four is in every right an American masterpiece."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I remember reading this book when it first came out and the stir it caused. It was the first time an athlete pulled no punches and described what goes on in the locker room and off the field. Bouton took a lot of heat and was blacklisted by many within MLB for his comments.The book is actually a diary of Bouton's comback season with the Seattle Pilots (they are now the Milwaukee Brewers). They were an expansion team with a few big name washed-up stars. Bouton, once a fireballer for the New York Yankees, hurt his arm and developed a knuckleball pitch to try to make it back to the bigs. Throughout the book he talks about his outings (mostly in mop-up and other non-critical moments) and you feel his frustration at not being noticed for sometimes excellent pitching.Not having seen many Pilot games in 1969, I am not sure whether Bouton was fantasizing his greatness with the knuckleball or he actually was the second coming of Hoyt Wilhelm.Bouton's teammates are quite lovable and memorable, reminding me a lot of the characters from the movie Major Leagues. There have been many books that came out since but this was the first of its type, and in my opinion the best!"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Who would have thought that when Jim Bouton agreed to keep a diary during the 1969 baseball season, that &quot;Ball Four: My Life and Hard Times Throwing the Knuckle-ball in the Big Leagues&quot; would end up being listed as one of the Books of the Century by the New York Public Library. But there it is, nestled in between Truman Capote's &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; and Stephen King's &quot;Carrie&quot; under the category of Popular Culture &amp; Mass Entertainment. The book is cited as being &quot;the first ripple of a tidal wave of 'tell-all' books that have become commonplace not only in sports, but also in politics, entertainment, and other realms of contemporary public life.&quot; But more importantly &quot;Ball Four&quot; totally changed the relationship between baseball players and their fans.Bouton had achieved early success as a hard throwing right-handed pitcher for the New York Yankees. But by 1969 the Yankee dynasty was officially over, Mickey Mantle had retired, and Bouton was trying to return to the majors by throwing the infamous knuckle-ball. Signed by the expansion team Seattle Pilots, in their only season of existence before moving to Milwaukee, Bouton had his ups and downs as a relief pitcher, but was successful enough to be traded to the Houston Astros who were in the middle of a pennant race. However, little of that mattered once Bouton started talking about what happened in the lockeroom.&quot;Ball Four&quot; was considered scandalous because Bouton frankly talked about baseball players having affairs, popping greenies (suddenly in the news again because of the current steroid controversy), and playing wickedly funny practical jokes on each other (Jesus Alou is the greatest victim of all time). The book's impact can be summed up in one particular story, when Bouton relates how Mantle once hit a home run when he still could not see straight because of a hard night of drinking. Once baseball's golden boy was tarnished in this manner, nobody else in the game had a chance. Bouton kicked down the door to the locker room big time.The book was considered irreverent and was denounced by the baseball establishment when it was published in 1970. But the problem was that it was (a) very truthful and (b) even funnier than it was truthful. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn called Bouton in on the carpet, but it turns out the truth is indeed a defense. The legacy of &quot;Ball Four&quot; today is seen not so much in similar books but in baseball films, where movies from &quot;Bull Durham&quot; to &quot;Major Leagues&quot; have captured the wonderful and wacky environment of a baseball locker room. For more about the book's reaction read Bouton's sequel, &quot;I'm Glad You Didn't Take It Personally.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I've been a baseball fan all my life, and I heard of this book during an appearance that Jim Bouton did on a radio show. I decided to get a copy, and once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. This book brings out a side of baseball that most people don't realize is there. It is required reading for ANY baseball fan."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"While the baseball world seems to abhor him for being honest, I thought Bouton's book was open and relatively fair. Whenever he had something negative to say (always documented by a detailed story), he mentioned the positives about the people involved too. Mantle and Joe Schultz are good examples. A prececessor to the &quot;tell all&quot; biographies of today that seem to be written for shock value and one upsmanship."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Even though this book is 40 years old now it's still very relevant. Ball four is so different from any other baseball book of it's time. Bouton exposes baseball for what it was back in the 60's and 70's. For those older baseball fans you will remember a lot of the players Bouton talks about. Ball four serves as a time capsule. A time when owners had complete ownership of the game and the players. A time when race was still an issue in baseball. A time when baseball did everything it could to cover up it's seamy side. Ball four was written at a time when if you talked bad about baseball or when against the institution of baseball you could be banished from it (Witness Curt Flood). Bouton uncovers some things about baseball that seem fairly tame now but was big news back then.Written when Bouton was in the minor league triple A team of the fledgling Seattle Pilots Bouton talks about the struggles of players trying to make it to the show, making the minimum wage of 10,000 a year. Hoping against hope to get the call up to the big club. Hope for one mare chance to prove themselves.Over the years Bouton has added several addendum's to the to the book. The version I read was from 1990 but included ball five (added to the 1980 edition), he talks about his life after baseball and his short stint with the Atlanta Braves and how the financial structure of contracts changed. Ball six (written for this edition) Bouton talks about his various business adventures and inventions.This is an easy and enjoyable read. Very insightful especially if you were a baseball fan in the 60's. The writing style is a bit dated now but would have been appropriate for the time. Still a great read. The editing of the original book is outstanding. Boutons biting criticisms of baseball back then were valid. I still think that Ball four is the bench mark for all books written about life spent in organized baseball."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Ball Four represented a profound change in my life's direction. When it came out, I was in Junior High and had little interest in sports. I don't even know why I started reading it, but I laughed all the way through it (even though I didn't \\"get\\" everything.\\"). I came away with a totally different view regarding athletics, and the camaraderie that it can generate among its participants. I started playing sports in high school and college, and later got a teaching credential and began coaching high school sports. Thirty plus years later, I've retired from teaching but continue to coach. Ball Four literally defined my future at a young age, and a good future it has been. God Bless you, Jim Bouton. You had a greater positive impact on people than Bowie Kuhn ever did! Thank you again."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I know nothing about Baseball, mainly because I am English, and I still know nothing about Baseball but this is one of the best sports books I have ever read. Funny, moving, clever but mainly funny it is about a man struggling to get buy watching and involved with a load of others guys struggling to get by, they are allegedly on the same team - but it is hard to tell. I came to this book because of an English Soccer book 'Only a Game' written by Emanon Dunphy. Dunphy based his diary on \`Ball Four' and I liked 'Only a Game' so much I bought the original. I recommend heartily 'Only a Game' it has the same crazy, abrupt and crazily sporting relations that make \`Ball Four' so revealing and funny - but the original is still the best. One of the few books I've read where all I want to do is sit and read and the rest of the world can go hang."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Even if you are not a baseball fan you can appreciate this wonderful book. Although it is centerd around the game of baseball, this is essentially a tale about young men in general. I found it hilarious and i reccomend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I was a young kid when this book caused quite a stir among baseball players and fans. That was reason enough to buy it and read it. It was good, but only verified what many assumed went on behind the scenes, nothing I found totally shocking, I found a near mint copy of the original in a used book store today so I bought it and will sit down to read it again almost 30 years later, it is one of those instantly recognizable books that jogs your memory the minute you see it on a shelf.

This book never fails to make me laugh, no matter how many times I read it."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I have probably read this book cover to cover 20 times, and leafed through it to read passages another 50 more. Jim Bouton blew the lid off baseball with this truly inside view of baseball's salary negotions, horny players, &quot;annies&quot;, etc. His timing was socially relevent as well, as this was written during the infancy of the black power movement, the players union and free angency. No other baseball book has ever approached this one in terms of inside poop on stars, political insight, out and out laughs, and historical perspective. This book has given more references to myself and my friends' lexicons than any other."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I picked up this book because it's a &#34;classic&#34; baseball book. But here's the thing, at age 30 I just don't know who these players in the book are unless it's Mickey Mantle or other big stars. The author does a good job writing about everyones backstory, but without the familiarity of some of these names I just can't keep interest. Sure there are parts about the big stars and Mickey Mantle, but there is a lot of the book that documents the other parts of his career and I just can't relate as well."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I have been reading up on Mickey Mantle since seeing the movie 61*, about the Mantle/Maris race to beat Babe Ruth's single season home run record. I checked this book out of the library to see why there was so much hostility towards Jim Bouton, and why he was never invited to NY Yankee Old Timer's Days after writing this book. He always thought it was Mickey Mantle who was keeping him from attending. After Mantle died in 1995, he still didn't get invited - so that shoots that one down. Bouton learned a lesson. People actually LIKED Mickey Mantle and felt offended by what Bouton said about him in \\"Ball Four.\\"He starts out talking about how nice Mickey was to him, different things he did that were touching, kind. But then he proceeds to tell us how he had mixed feelings for Mickey because he saw Mickey shut a bus window on a group of kids wanting autographs. And he refused to sign balls in the clubhouse one time. Jim Bouton was never Mickey Mantle, and its too bad he never knew what it was to be hounded day and night and never have a minute of privacy. So Mantle shut a bus window on some kids once. Knowing what I do about the fame Mantle created and endured during his ball playing days, I can't understand why Bouton even found that important enough to write about.Oh, that's right. Money. He made alot of money writing this book to trash his fellow baseball players. Otherwise, would any of us remember Jim Bouton for anything else?"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Image accompanying book is misleading.

It is hard to see now how all of this could have been controversial, but easy to see how Billy Beane's approach was inevitable and desperately needed.The other day I was watching a game on TV and the pitcher gave up a critical hit.

The real payoff comes in the added chapters. You will certainly be intrigued by Ball Five (Ten Years After).

Bouton's love of the game and its players (many of whom shunned him after the book was published) shines through on every page.I did not know about his daughter's passing away in an auto accident, and that section, together with his long overdue return to the old timer's game at Yankee Stadium, brought me close to tears.

My thought was, \\"This is the real thing.\\" That was the thought of millions of other readers, too, and still is today. In a sport which has tried for well over a century to paint itself as above reproach -- a sport whose owners have never accepted responsibility for being the ones who banned African-Americans from baseball, for example -- Bouton cut through the lies and told things as they were. He shows what the players think and do on the field, in the locker room, and in the rest of their lives. Bouton's love of the game is palpable: it does grip him, just as his story grips the reader. A Must Read."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I could write forever about this book. I first read it when it came out in 1970 and I've gone through two or three copies by now. At one point I came across a copy Bouton had pre-autographed, and someone stole it a party. I wish I had it today. I have read this book so many times I have lost count, and it cracks me up every time. &quot;Hiya blondie, how's the old tomato?&quot; has got to be one of the best throwaway lines I've ever heard. Not to be missed though are the numerous human interest stories in the book, the ones that really made the book what it is. Bouton has a very keen power of observation and an unparalled knack for storytelling. I'm sure Leonard Schechter fit in the equation somewhere, but since Bouton has experienced the thrills of winning in the World Series to pitching for the now lost in time Seattle Pilots, no one is more uniquely qualified to comment like he does. Like another reviewer said, I've read this book so many times over the years I feel l! ike I know Bouton well, but I'd bet there's still more to him than we know. It would be great fun to kill a few beers with him, order take out from the bullpen phone and shoot some beaver. &quot;Hey Gelnar, c'mere a minute. Up there near the Section 23 sign. Check the rack on that broad.&quot; &quot;Yeah, surrrrrre.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"All I can say is that Jim Bouton should keep us updated periodically: about his life, and about what is happening in baseball and culture generally. I say that because this edition, with its new epilogue, is excellent reading.What shines through is an intelligent, funny, very likeable, and exceedingly sane -- partially by virtue of his craziness -- person. I think we should be hearing and seeing much more of him than we do: just providing a reasonable voice and open, honest critique of current events. Bouton's voice gives hope somehow.Keep on keeping on, Mr. Bouton!"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"This books is one of the bests of its kind. It's also one of the first. The tell-all. Jim Bouton takes you on a tour of his 1969 baseball season, most of which was spent with the expansion Seattle Pilots. And this team was so bad that it makes the Tampa Bay Devil Rays look like a World Series contender. But what makes the book work is that Bouton spills it all: boozing in the bullpen, illicit affairs, arguments with the manager. And what sets it over the others of this type of book that followed is that Bouton is intelligent. You actually get an understanding of what makes him tick as a ballplayer. A great read."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"This book is the greatest baseball book ever, bar none! I make it a point to read this book every five years or so, to renew my warmth for the game. Since I read this book, I've begun collecting Seattle Pilots memorabilia, including a replica Bouton #56 and a pilots cap. I rate this and Connie Hawkins' &quot;Foul!&quot; as the two greatest sports books ever."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I enjoyed the read, and it was worth the time (which flew by, truly), but unless you are a pretty big baseball fan this isn't going to do it for you. At times very funny and insightful (and even sad), it's not necessarily what I would call well-written: it's in diary format and conversational in tone, so a bit limited in dramatic effect. Still, if you want to know what it's like to ride the pines in the big leagues hoping to make the team, this will tell you what it was like in 1969 when there wasn't a millionth as much media coverage of every detail of every player's life."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Jim Bouton's book Ball Four is one of the best sports books of all time! It is a must for any one who loves the game of baseball. A must read."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"While most reviews here highlight the baseball in Jim Bouton's classic, Ball Four is also an amazing look at life, the psychology of the human condition and the way people think. Bouton took a simple concept -- record the 1969 season and write about it in diary form -- and created a brilliant self study. It is undoubtedly a classic, perhaps the best sports book ever written and a pattern for all other \\"tell-all\\" books that followed.By today's standards, the tales in Ball Four may be tame. Bouton reveals the hijinx players sought while on the road with beaver shooting, pranks, drinking, taking \\"greenies,\\" etc. Now, athlete/writers feel a desire to top that with more outrageousness. (see David Wells' book, for example). Bouton's book broke away the facade that baseball players were one-dimensional All-American boys, and rather than be aghast, I think readers were pleased to see they were the same as us.I first read this book when I was 9 years old. Heady stuff for a kid. I remember showing friends the curse words in the book and giggling back then. But I also remember it being the first book that made me think and look at people differently. It gave me insight into why people did what they did. Maybe it enhanced a budding paranoia in me, but I credit Ball Four for being a huge influence on the way I turned out, now 42 years later.I read it each year and enjoy it every time. I find myself quoting phrases from the book and applying its lessons to every day life. It is a timeless classic and the book is as vibrant today as it was when published in 1970.On one level, it's a great book about the 1969 expansion Seattle Pilots. Baseball fans will love it merely for that, what with the mention of Mickey Mantle, Lou Pinella and Harmon Killebrew to name a few stars, but also others such as manager Joe Schultz and players Gene Brabender, Wayne Comer and Bob \\"Snot\\" Locker. But it is also a fantastic study of the culture and social norms of the 1960s, the double standards we all face daily, the ponderances of why people do what they do and the assurance it's okay to stand out and be different."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"This my favorite book about baseball, and I have read quite a few. I've seen reviewers who didn't like the book because they felt Bouton trashed some people, especially Mickey Mantle. Having read this at 13, I have to say I really didn't feel much different about Mantle after I read it. I did have a lot more respect for what managers put up with and what its like to live on the edge (lets face it, most players don't live where Mantle lived.) The only thing this book does is show you that these guys are human and multi-dimensional. Of course, players don't know what its like today to try to get $28,000 instead of $26,500 or $22,500 like Bouton had to do. This book has a lot of fun in it, its not just gossip and slamming of heroes. Bouton has a good eye for talent too, spotting Mike Marshall and Lou Pinella as coming stars earlier their careers. For those of you who didn't like it, I was just say look up Joe Schultz favorite multi-syllable one word comment and try it out in all of its variations."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I recall reading Jim Bouton's revealing expose when it was first released, at the conclusion of the 1969 season. By today's standards, it seems somewhat innocuous; certainly, Bouton revealed that baseball players are human beings who are not only skilled at their craft, but flawed as well. The performance enhancing drugs of the day were \\"greenies\\", although it's clear, the performance was enhanced only in the minds of the players popping those pills. The players themselves were depicted as womanizers, or at least, voyeuers, and some of the frank observations Bouton made probably didn't set too well with the soon to be ex-Mrs Bouton.Clearly, Bouton is a very bright guy, playing a game where being an intellectual was considered somewhat detrimental to the \\"team\\" aspect of the game; it's no wonder he was considered to be somewhat of an oddball; but he also comes across as being more than just a little self-absorbed. There's no doubt he's got the gift of gab, and his commentary on some of the pettiness he encountered, especially with the front office, coaches and managers, is quite compelling; although perhaps more than a bit self-serving. He seems way more concerned with his individual success than the overall success of his team, and his flagrant bias against his original team, the New York Yankees, seems motivated by revenge, more than anything else. While insightful, he comes across as equally petty as any of the \\"villains\\" he writes about.Still, his writing was irreverent, at times hilarious, and always very fascinating. Even 40 years after the fact, it's a story filled with candor and remarkable insight into the previously private world of MLB. The game has never been the same since; the iconoclastic perspective was unleashed with all its fury, and certainly, it's still a most compelling tale four decades later."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"even now, the contents of \\"ball four\\" are as equally as contrary to what you think about the order of things as say the first time you hear that hawaiians aren't happy about being american. what this book has to say about institutions make it as valuable an american document as \\"on the road\\".the only real debate i think that could be made over this assertion is who took more speed; kerouac or bouton?the answer is kerouac.leaving only one other question:who took more speed; kerouac or doc ellis?i can't answer that question but i can say that beaning batters successively until you get thrown out of a major league baseball game is much cooler than anything kerouac ever did."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"&quot;Ball Four&quot; is a diary that covers the year of a baseball player, in this case Jim Bouton, who spent the 1969 season with the expansion Seattle Pilots and then the Houston Astros. Entertaining on many levels, &quot;Ball Four&quot; also serves as a mirror of the times -- in the late 1960s, many established concepts and ideas, in politics, music, mass media, and sports, were being shattered. Baseball, always about five years behind the curve, was always thought of as a game that was played by wholesome, All-American men. They were our heroes. Ball Four, however, sheds new light and revealed, for the first time, that baseball players, even some of the game's superstars, are human.Bouton tells all, in, by today's standards, a tame fashion. We read about everything -- ballplayers cheating on their wives, playing with hangovers, racial problems between teammates, players taking uppers before a game, etc. Bouton is a very insightful writer and presents the material in a humorous manner, the humor, or barbs, is directed at his teammates, managers, coaches, and, in many instances, at himself.Baseball was outraged when the book first came out in 1970. Many players and baseball executives considered Bouton a turncoat. But the years have shown that Ball Four was a groundbreaking book, one that set the standard for tell-all books to come. These other books, however, have never reached the level of excellence of Bouton's &quot;Ball Four.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"As far as I'm concerned, Ball Four is easily the best baseball book out there. I've read about 45 baseball books and nothing compares to Bouton's masterpiece. I've read this book four times and it still hasn't gotten old yet. I'm sure I'll read it at least ten more times and I doubt that I will ever get tired of it.What makes Ball Four better than any other baseball book is that it allows its readers to see the game from a player's perspective. Never has a book given such an up-close, in-the-locker-room look at baseball. Of course, Bouton himself is brilliant. I love his sarcasm and his biting wit. Ball Four might have been a pretty good book even if it had been written by a poor writer; Bouton, though, is an excellent storyteller and his attitude is what shapes the book. If you consider yourself a fan of the game, you will buy Ball Four immediately. It has given me great joy time and time again."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Jim Bouton is a very bright man who probably could have been a scientist if he didn't go into baseball. In the 1960s when he played nobody wrote colorful exposes of the behind the scenes and road trip life of major league ball players. Bouton was the first with this book. It ended many friendships with teammates and probably broke up his marriage. The book might seem tame by todays standard. Alcohol was the players drug in those days and no one was shooting up steroids back then. But the book was racy, groundbreaking and controversial in its time much like Canseco's books are today.You will also see that it led to several other books by Jim Bouton and even one by his ex wife (another analogy to Canseco whose ex wife also wrote a book). Bouton was a great pitcher but alas for only the period from 1961-1964. 1963 was his best season but even though he pitched well in that world series the Yankees got steamrolled by the Dodger staff with Drysdale and Koufax leading the way. After retirementhe came back to pitch for the Seattle Pilots expansion team in their first year. He had developed a knuckle ball and that allowed him some limited success. Bulldog Jim wrote a book about that experience too. He had a trick when he pitched for the Yankees. He wouldd deliberately wear a very loose fitting cap that would usually fall off his head as he delivered the pitch. This was distracting for the hitters. But in his day Bouton had a good fastball and a deceptive changeup and he was part of a great pitching rotation in 1963 that included Ford, Downing and Terry."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Jim Bouton's &quot;Ball Four&quot; is, without a doubt, the best book ever written by a professional athlete and is arguably the greatest baseball book of all-time. Dozens of kiss-n-tell sports novels have dotted the bestseller lists since &quot;Ball Four's&quot; publication in 1970, but none are as funny or revealing as Bouton's expose. All however, owe their very existence to &quot;Ball Four&quot; which shook the moral foundation of our national pastime upon its release. Bouton forever stripped away the All-American image of the professional sports hero with his humorous -- and sometimes X-rated -- locker room tales. Many, including then Commisioner Bowie Kuhn, felt that Bouton had forever tarnished baseball's image with his less than flattering portrayals of some of the game's biggest stars.(Namely Bouton's former Yankee teammate Mickey Mantle). Jim Bouton, in 1970, was Public Enemy #1 in the eyes of the baseball establishment. Truth be told, Bouton merely humanized the professional athlete. Many players--especially Bouton himself --are portrayed as being uncertain of their abilities and fearful of losing their jobs in the highly competitive world of major league baseball.(Such insecurity is best exemplified when Bouton is traded in mid-season from Seattle to Houston and lives to tell us about it!) Overall, &quot;Ball Four&quot; is one heckuva book. Bouton's sense of humor is absolutely side-splitting and his sensitivity, at times, is downright moving. This is a fantastic, groundbreaking novel which no sports fan should be without. Six Stars!!"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"When &quot;Ball Four&quot; was published in 1970, Jim Bouton was attacked by players, sportswriters, and the owners for revealing the secret, sordid underbelly of professional baseball. Which should be enough right there to get you to read this thing. But in &quot;Ball Four,&quot; Bouton also reveals the humanity of baseball, the fear, the hate, and the fun, which makes it one of the classics of baseball literature and a must read.Basically, &quot;Ball Four&quot; is a diary of the 1968 season written by a journeyman middle-relief knuckleballer. Before injuring his arm, and turning to the knuckleball, Bouton was a fireball pitcher for the New York Yankees. In his rookie season in 1962, Bouton won two games for the Yanks in the World Series. He played with Mantle and Ford. Then his arm went dead, and he found himself back in the minors, where he taught himself to throw the knuckler. The Yanks didn't think much of him anymore and traded him to the expansion Seattle Pilots (which left Seattle after a single year for...get this...Milwaukee), where he earned a spot as a spot starter and mopup long relief man.The book reveals the personalities of the players and managers and owners. It tells what the players do on the road, in the bullpen, in the minors. It reveals the petty nature of the coaching staff, who are usually all old-time baseball men, not very clever, not prone to trying new ways. It talks about the dicey contract negotiations by players in the days of the reserve clause, when average players made an average wage.Bouton travels in the world of boys. The players are mostly kids in their 20s, not educated, and spent their formative years in baseball. They like pranks. They like women, but they don't know either how to talk about them, or how to talk with them. Most of the time, they just try to look up their skirts. They drink. They sneak in past curfew.But Bouton also works in a competitive business market. Pitchers hide their arm injuries for fear of being sent down. Players fume over bench time. Coaches think small, because to be creative and new means being out of a job. And baseball is all these guys have. They have nothing else to turn to.Certainly in light of recent ballplayer behavior - think of the Pittsburgh cocaine scandals, Strawberry and Gooden, and the thuggish, drug-addled violence associated with football and basketball - &quot;Ball Four&quot; depicts a harmless and almost nostalgic view of baseball. But it still stands as a baseball classic for its honesty, its authenticity, and you wonder how much has changed since 1968.In the end, the players, owners, and writers should have celebrated the publication of &quot;Ball Four.&quot; Sure, it did spawn a string of subsequent tell-alls, and it did forever swing aside the curtain shielding the ballplayer from public scrutiny, but this is a modern age, and we want heroes with all their flaws. Who is it more fun to root for on the field, a straw dummy propped up by a marketing machine, or a man?"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Ball Four is a good and important book to own. If one mark of a good book is its ability to provoke reactions, and often contradictory reactions, then Ball Four is a fine book.What really makes the book a worthwhile read is the way that it reflects a time of momentous change in baseball. I'm not sure if younger fans can truly appreciate how rapidly things were changing in baseball back then. America experienced a broader social revolution throughout 1967 and 1968, but it really took until 1969 for it to work fully its way into baseball. If you look at the baseball cards from 1967 and 1968, they're bland grey items whereupon the players all look like crew-cutted astronauts. Come 1970, 1971, and beyond, everything is different: sideburns, Afros, wild psychadelic colors. Ball Four came out at the leading edge of these changes, and it captured festering tensions between baseball's old guard and a skeptical generation of young players.Ball Four is widely hailed as a great classic. It's not quite as pathbreaking as its reputation, however. For one thing, it had a predecessor earlier in the decade, The Long Season, by Jim Brosnan, another \\"kiss and tell\\" book written by an active player. Brosnan's previous book is better written and more insightful. Ball Four created more of a sensation, but mostly because it was slummier -- it revels a bit more in the drinking and carousing than does the previous book. Because of this, Ball Four upset the baseball establishment a bit more, and it titillated young readers a bit more. Other aspects of the book were equally shocking (back then, anyway): for example, the portrayal of many authority figures -- coaches, managers, and baseball executives -- as dunderheads. This was an anti-establishment book in many respects.Baseball was changing on all fronts, and these changes are well reflected in this book. Bouton pitches for the Seattle Pilots, in their first and last year of their existence, and the first season of the newly created league divisions. You also read of the attempts of baseball players to create a union, and the divisions among players this caused. You've also got the new turf parks, such as the Houston Astrodome where Bouton finishes up his season. And there are all of the social changes: the sexual revolution, the hashing out of racial issues, and perhaps first and foremost, the generation gap.Bouton captures all this and more. Having said all that, my enjoyment of this book is limited by the fact that Bouton's own perspective is often arrogant and intolerant, in much the same way that he derides the older coaches and managers as being. You get the clear sense while reading him that the 1960s generational wars were caused not only by an older generation stuck in its ways, but equally by a younger generation that assumed it was automatically right and that they had nothing to learn from anybody. For example, Bouton persistently quotes his managers and coaches only to show how stupid they are. Now, there is such a thing as stupidity among the old, but all rebellious kids usually think that the older generation has missed a beat. Sometimes they're right, and sometimes not. Bouton's always convinced he's right, but there's little reason to believe he always is.A typical battle between Bouton and his pitching coach Sal Maglie concerns Bouton's attempt to survive on the knuckleball. Sal Maglie gets on his case about it, and discourages him from throwing the knuckler exclusively. Bouton is convinced that his other stuff is basically gone, and the only way he's going to hang on is if he relies on the knuckler, and he wants to be left alone to concentrate on that pitch.Let's just examine this from both sides for a moment to get a sense of whether Bouton's contempt for Maglie is justified.When Bouton came up, he was a very successful pitcher with the New York Yankees. But although he had a reputation for having a young, live arm, the stats show that he was never really an overpowering pitcher. In 1964, he struck out only 120 men in 271 innings, while winning 18 games. Historically, pitchers don't get by on finesse like that for very long. It's not at all surprising that a few years later, Bouton no longer had hard enough stuff to get major league hitters out. Bouton's self-assessment in Ball Four seems to be justified: he probably doesn't have a good enough fastball or slider by 1969 to make it as a major league pitcher, and unless he gets the knuckler to work, that's it for him.Now let's look on the other side. If there were ever a guy who knew something about such a situation, it was Sal Maglie. Maglie's emergence as a good major league pitcher was delayed by his \\"outlaw\\" years in the Mexican league. Like Bouton, Maglie wasn't overpowering -- in his finest year he struck out only 146 in 298 innings. But unlike Bouton, Maglie was very successful in his 30s. When Maglie tells Bouton that a key ingredient for success of an older pitcher is not walking too many hitters, he's onto something. Bouton gave up 12 gopher balls in only 92 innings with Seattle in 1969, and if you're that vulnerable to the gopher, you've got to keep the walks down. Most importantly, Maglie had accomplished what Bouton was trying to do -- not with overpowering physical gifts, but by assessing his own situation accurately; there was something to learn there.The point is not that Bouton is right or Maglie is right, but that there are two good perspectives here, and if Bouton weren't so full of himself, he might be able to pick up what good things Maglie had to offer him, combining them with his own valid insights. Instead, Bouton spends the whole book making fun of Maglie and anyone else in a position of authority, refusing to learn anything from anyone older.Bouton is a hero to everyone who has ever been fed up with their teachers, their boss, or \\"the establishment\\" at large, because many readers find it cathartic to read someone's rantings against stodgy authority figures. But in the final analysis, Bouton isn't necessarily all that brighter or more insightful than those he critiques: he's just as closed-minded, he just has a different opinion. He's not Galileo; he's not even Bill James. He's just a guy speaking his mind, always candidly, often rudely, and only sometimes with a valid point.Ball Four is a worthy read because there's no other book quite like it; Bouton is always brutally honest about his feelings, and he conveys the full flavor of a turbulent era in baseball history. The book was considered sensational at the time, but it's not such a prurient interest anymore: now it's useful mostly to convey what all the fussing and fighting was about back then. But in the end it's a fallible set of perspectives by a very fallible individual."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Bouton wrote a revealing, funny, and socially conscious diary from his days with the expansion 1969 Seattle Pilots (today's Milwaukee Brewers). The author exposes ballplayers as fallibly human rather than as the falsely promoted role models, and discusses such once concealed issues as salary fights, pep pills and groupies. Bouton also confesses his own insecurities as a washed up pitcher hanging on via the knuckleball. This book dates from the era before free agency, when established players had to fight to get paid incredibly modest salaries. \\"Ball Four\\" also reminds us that long hair, civil rights, and Vietnam were controversial in 1969. Unfortunately, Bouton's &quot;kiss-n-tell&quot; insensitivity towards certain teammates (some of whom disliked him) detracts a bit from his writing.This book annoyed the baseball establishment when published in 1970. Bouton (and editor Leonard Schecter) exceeded \\"The Long Season,\\" a mildly irreverent 1959 diary by pitcher Jim Brosnan that also upset the baseball lords. \\"Ball Four: The Final Pitch,\\" contains successive ten-year updates that each add a nice perspective. The last update also contains very emotional reading concerning a tragic death in Bouton's family. This is a very funny and thought-provoking read."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"When my house cleaner threw my coverless, dogeared copy of Ball Four in the trash, I promptly fished it out. It's anyone's guess why a 41-year-old God-fearing female and lifelong Yankee fan would rank that book as a must-save, but I do. The book that &quot;tore the cover off the biggest names in baseball&quot; didn't make me think any less of my heroesit simply made all of them-Mantle, Maris, Tresh, et. al.-a little more human. Beyond that, it's a very funny book. The quality of &quot;earthiness ... and non-sequitor&quot; that Jim Bouton claims he's trying to capture is all there.The older I get, the more I read Ball Four not only as a book about baseball, but as a book about our times similar to (would'd have thought it) Samuel Pepys diary. Bouton freely discusses race, religion, and sex, but not to the point that the reader gets bored with any of them.Beyond everything else, it is a picture of Jim Bouton. It's all there, his insecurities, his faults, his self-serving attitude as well as his honesty, intelligence, and humor. I've heard very little about Bouton since 1970 when my brother and I read Ball Four and thought it necessary to keep it from our parents. But I feel as though I know Jim. And I feel nothing but kindness toward him."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Unlike most sports-themed book, written by the athletes who seem to always be willing to glad-hand themselves, this terrific account into the year in the life of a ballplayer is irreverent and uncompromising. As a former ballplayer, Jim Bouton played hard but always lived by a higher code. Never willing to place himself in a compromising situation, he nonetheless becomes a somewhat outspoken critic of what baseball had become (remember, this book was written during the 1969 season, well before free-agency and the Enron-esque manner by which MLB seems to handle itself as an organization these days). Yes, he does seem harsh on some teammates, past and present, and doesn't fail to criticize himself on many occasions either. But he ultimately reveals himself to be a fan of the game, warts and all. It's easy to understand why this book generated so much controversy. It still manages to convey an important message that athletes and their sport are, at the end of the day, completely fallible. Despite the somewhat shallow character baseball players and managers reveal throughout &quot;Ball Four&quot;, you still get the sense from Bouton that you wouldn't trade the experience for anything in the world. And, more than anything, it destroys the myth that the game was so much better back in the &quot;good old days.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I just finished reading this book for the third time, and it honestly never loses any of its superiority. Hands down, there has never been a better book written by an professional athlete.I remember reading this book in high school, thinking that it was truly amazing. Now, having read the book in it's 31st year of print, it is still truly amazing. The best thing about the book is that it gives you an honest perspective of the game from the player's point-of-view. And Jim Bouton holds nothing back. He is very straightforward and candid as he pulls no punches and just tells it like it is.In today's day and age, anybody can, if not already has, written a tell-all book, and this truly wouldn't have been entirely possible if not for Bouton's ground-breaking Ball Four. Written in a diary-style, Bouton tells of his adventures with two Major League Baseball teams, the expansion Seattle Pilots, now the Milwaukee Brewers, and the Houston Astros. He cronicles his wild year, experimenting with his &quot;Superknuck&quot; knuckleball and more importantly, just trying to be one of the guys.Ball Four is well-written, not to mention, quite funny. Bouton is a very intelligent man, and he clearly shines in this book, and comes across very well. This is not your typical tell-all book, but more of a book loaded with wonderful behind-the-scenes stories, that really need to be told to really appreciate the game of baseball today. The section added to the end of the book dealing with the aftermath of the publishing is priceless, and a super addition. This is one complete book and a teriffic read. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"This is BY FAR the best baseball book I have ever read. But in addition to that, it's one of the best books of any genre that I've ever read.Funny, provocative, insightful, and unique are just a few of the words I'd use to describe Ball Four.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes baseball, and even to those who don't, because they may become fans after reading it."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Still Hilarious the second time around. I've always been a baseball fan, coached by Dad and a family tradition. The humanizing of the players made me love it more. Never did understand the controversy, telling the truth about greedy, exploitive owners maybe? But that's true of all big business from ENRON on down the ladder (that was never a secret). Steroids? In this one it's greenies (uppers) pitchers use them in this iteration and made their sore arms and tired muscles disappear. The disappointing thing is no one seems concerned about the health issues. Sports and business all have a history of taking any advantage, cheating is in the eye of the beholder. Heck with records, throw them all out. Baseball is about fun, and parents interacting and enjoying their children."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Jim Boutin was a very successful pitcher with the New York Yankees before injuring himself and having to become a knuckleball pitcher for the expansion Seattle Pilots. He wrote a diary of his comeback and it is nothing short of hilarious. The picture he paints of major leaguers is that of young boys who play pranks on one another and get their feelings hurt very easily. The only difference is these kids drive sports cars and pick up women during games. One scene in particular where they put talcum powder in another player's blow dryer makes me laugh every time I think of it. What makes the book so good is Bouton's natural way of writing so that the diary entires are not disjointed like Jim Brosnan's \\"The Long Season\\", but they have a flow to them. Even though I did not know many of the players he referenced in the book because it was before my time, it still remains a timeless classic."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"This book had me laughing out loud several times. Even though it was written about 30 years ago, the baseball experiences still ring true. Bouton has a great sense of humor, and the anecdotes about both stars and players you never heard of are a treat. I used this book to get me through the last off-season, and it was a lot of fun to read."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"While many of the &quot;kiss and tell&quot; books that followed &quot;Ball Four&quot; failed to age well, and were much more graphic and revealing, &quot;Ball Four&quot; has become a classic. The story is told honestly and simply. Bouton doesn't hold back his own views, thoughts and beliefs in the tale. He does not try to aggrandize himself, but gives truthful and humorous views of the life as a washed-up, knuckleball pitcher trying to play another year in the Bigs.The humor and stories, at one time were considered bawdy, now it appears very innocent and tame. Not in a naive or rose-colored way, but the stories are of guys being guys, playing a game. It makes you smile and wistful. Wishing you could have been a part of it, or wishing you were still a part of it.Reading it gives greater insight into why players hang on in any sport as long as they do, beyond simply the money to be made."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"This was the most contreversial book of it's time. Jim Bouton used this book to poke holes in America's game baseball. This novel earned Bouton the status of public enemy number one in all of the world of baseball. He gave wild insights into playing for the most prestigious baseball team in the world,the New York Yankees. Bouton also gave away guarded secrets into some of America's most respected heros(Mickey Mantle).This publication by Bouton does not miss a lick. Nothing is sacred in this book. This book was also a bestseller during it's time. Buy this book and read it. You will agree that it is a masterpeice."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I picked this book up in 1972 when I was 12...and I haven't put it down since. Much more than a \\"baseball book,\\" Ball Four is an expose of the changing attitudes in post-war America. Myth-shattering, yet inspiring, Ball Four is one of the most important books of the last 50 years."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"In this age of mega free agents with quarter of a million dollar contracts, its easy to hate all players who switch teams like we switch socks. However, Jim tells of a time before free agency and shows us how back then the shoe was on the other foot. I think now more than ever people should read this book to understand how far salaries have come and actually see how free agency might have helped the game.Like many of you, I hate the Ramirez and AROD deals, but this book talks about what the players had to deal with back then. It shows when salaries were in the other extreme; maybe giving hope that someday we will meet in the middle.Besides this, this book is a MUST read for all baseball fans. It tells great stories of players some of us where too young to see play, but always hear about. Tells of a time when sports starts greatest sins were adultery and the occasional ball scuff. Not to say adultery is nothing, but it sure beats the coke rush of the 80's.Simply put, this book will make you laugh so hard at times, at other times it will make you teary eyed with the yearning to have lived in that era if you are too young. Bye this book flat out, I promise you will read it more than once, and will pass it down to your children."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"This is a great book to read, even if you're not a big baseball fan. Jim Bouton just has a knack for telling a great story. From reading the book, he must have been the life of the party with the team members but a pain in the butt to the team management with his opinionated views. He really gives some insight to the up-until-then unpublicized life of a major league player from the pressurized meetings with the general manager to the dugout and locker room antics. There are some funny stories but sometimes he goes off on a tangent about political views on Vietnam or racism. But overall it's a great baseball book and you'll have a hard time putting it down once you buy it."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I just finished Ball Four for the 25th time. I read it every year because it reminds me of why I love sports. Not for the superhumans, but for the humans who play them. There is more insight into pro sports, as well as American society, in this book than any I've ever read. It is especially poignant this year which saw Mr. Bouton finally invited to Old Timers' Day at Yankee stadium in response to his son Mike's op-ed piece in the New York Times. Jim's daughter Laurie was recently killed in an automobile accident, and I was saddened that I didn't know about it early enough to send him my condolences. Mike wrote in the Times that this year, his dad really needed this. Amazingly, the Yankees responded.They only let him pitch to one batter, (perhaps Sal Maglie convinced then he was throwing too damn much), but he wore 56, and Bulldog once again took the mound. And to celebrate I re-read the book that was my personal passage to adulthood. Jim Bouton is a true outsider, a revolutionary, and this book is a work of art and history."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I have read this book so many times I have lost count. Hilarious, but not for the younger generation. Love it!"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"best baseball novel ever written. down to earth and realistic and written with style. a true classic read for anybody."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Read about this book online, and I am excited to jump into it. Bouton has got the word on the slander."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"If you never knew who he was; he establishes himself as just another relief pitcher trying to sustain a career in the major leagues. But in this journey; using his witt and humor you cant help but to cheer for him. Just another relief pitcher with not so common story telling abilities as Jim pulls you right into his waves of emotional ups and downs. This book will forever be a must read for all generations of baseball fans. So do yourself the favor if you haven't done so already!"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"One of many excellent baseball books I have read. Jim Bouton's personality had you rooting for him all along. In a world that sometimes takes it's sports to seriously, a determined Jim Bouton was able to make it fun while he was living his dream."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I originally hesitated buying the book because I'm basically a Yankee fan and I knew this was written after he left the Yankees. But then I read an LA Times review of the updated versions, saying it was the greatest baseball book ever written. I see some complaints on here about it being choppy, but it never pretended to be anything else -- we shared his year with him on a daily basis, good, bad, and terrible. He was so honest, about himself as well as others, and I felt I lived that year with him. He doesn't put himself above the other guys, doesn't spare himself anywhere, sharing his grief as well as his joy. And he has a great style, good sense of humor. Was pleasantly surprised. Mine was the Kindle edition and there was nothing wrong with it."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"This book is a trip through the year in the life of a ballplayer. Written in a journal-like style, with several abrupt slices of life from the bullpen, the manager, and the road. It's a great read, with a lot of humor. I struggled to keep a straight face while reading it in the office at work. Great book, and to anyone thinking about buying it - go ahead and get it! You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Great book about the way it used to be in baseball when it was still just a game. A must read."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Bouton's powers of observation and a timely sense of humor convert a baseball story into a human interest one ofgreat proportion"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I purchsed this book for christmas present. My husband read it as a kid and lovesss this book.So im sure he is going to be very happy to read it again.The Amazon process was farily easy although i had problems using a visa\\"gift\\" card! I had to borrow a \\"real\\"card to complete the purchase.The shape of book was good,would use this service again."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"\\"Ball Four\\" broke new ground in sports books. Jim Bouton was knuckleball pitcher who kept a diary of his 1969 season, revealing insights on and off the field that the baseball establishment wanted kept under wraps. Bouton had a great sense of humor, but people forget that despite his rather shocking revelations (at least for the times), he was also a ballplayer who loved the game and was desperately trying to hold on to a career that was slipping away."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Ball Four made Jim Bouton quite infamous. The tell-all has become much more commonplace in today's world of sports. Bouton and Ball Four were well before my time, but it is a good read nonetheless. I would imagine Ball Four was as controversial in its time as Juiced was a few years ago. I would strongly suggest any fan of baseball read Ball Four, if for no other reason than for its historical significance."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Well written book and expose about the baseball industry. Anyone who enjoys baseball will enjoy this book. Don't be discouraged by the book length. It's an easy read, you can skip around and read just about any place in the book without ruining the story."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Ball Four is a journal of Jim Bouton's days in baseball. It is light hearted and pokes fun at himself and tells it like it was in the 1960's. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the behind the scenes and what happens in the locker room."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Hubby had knee surgery and was laid up for 3 months.. did alot of reading when he wasn't in physical therapy.... GREAT BOOK"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"My teacher for my History of Sports class recommended this book and I bought it. He told us that is was a very controversial book at the time because it spoke of things that were better left unspoken. That is the best recommendation you can get!It is a very funny book, sometimes Bouton describes things that could be in a movie about baseball, a National Lampoon version that is. There is drinking gambling and looking at girls from all angles. But didn't we all expect them to this anyway?He was ostracized by baseball but it is really harmless fun, the new sections in this edition also talk about what happened after the first edition came out. Get it"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Ball Four is a must read for all sports fans. The first of it's kind, Bouton takes readers on the wild ride of a baseball pitcher that has played with the greats (Yankees) and the not so greats (Pilots). Ball Four is a book that reaches all generations and should be on every book shelf."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"\\"BALL FOUR\\" by Jim Bouton (1970)The truth about athlete as role models occurred with the bombshell publication of Jim Bouton's \\"Ball Four\\" in 1970. The result was a diary of the 1969 season, in which the former star pitcher talked about drinking, drugs, sex and RACE, all subjects the liberal \\"clubhouse lawyer\\" had an axe to grind on. \\"Ball Four\\" had more edge than a Doors concert, breaking new ground long before Watergate, the Internet and Monica Lewinsky. The old protocols had protected J.F.K.'s sex life, but Bouton, who probably idolized Daniel Ellsberg, felt the clubhouse adage \\"What you do here, what you say here, what you see here, let it stay here,\\" did not apply.Bouton pissed off Commissioner Bowie Kuhn with his expose of players' common habit of popping amphetamines. He pissed off a lot of wives by revealing a peculiar member of the female species known as \\"Baseball Annies,\\" attractive young women who enjoy sleeping with ballplayers. He pissed off his old Yankee teammates by putting the myth to Mickey Mantle's legend, paying homage to The Mick's Olympian abilities, but talking about Mantle's equally prodigious drinking habit.Bouton describes \\"beaver hunting,\\" a popular player pastime in which they drilled holes in the dugout in order to look up the dresses of girls in the front row. Gives a whole new meaning to the term \\"box seat,\\" doesn't it?Bouton comes from the \\"white man is to blame for all the black man's problems\\" ideology, and he put the lie to baseball's claim of being color blind, with enlightening racial statistics that revealed that many of the game's stars were black, but few journeymen were.Many of his conservative teammates felt he was a bit of a Communist. It has been said that Stalin would have had a job in baseball if he brought the high heat, which Bouton could do, but the Yankees dropped him like a bad habit as soon as he hurt his arm.\\"Ball Four\\" made Bouton rich and famous, holds up well today, and is a gem of humor, irony and inside baseball."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Even aside from its baseball aspects, Ball Four probably deserves recognition as the funniest string of anecdotes ever put on paper. There really isn't much that can be said about this book that isn't positive; hilarious, a quick-moving style of writing, interesting stories, and a great picture of what life in a clubhouse is really like. Bouton's limited observations on politics and individuality on a team are interesting, even if they're dated by now. The only drawback to this book is that it won't impact a reader today as it would someone who read it at its publication. For someone like me who has grown up with public salary negotiations and open discussion of the private lives of athletes, there's no shock value or revelation to be had. Nevertheless, even if it's no longer groundbreaking, it's still more than a worthwhile read for anyone."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"In all my time of being involved with baseball, playing baseball, and coaching baseball on both the little league and the high school levels, never have I read a book that is this informative. I reccomend this book to any little leaguer trying to get the fundamentals of baseball down pat. Whether it be something as complex as teaching the proper execution of the drag bunt, or something as simple and elementary as good sportsmanship, this book covers it all. It is a wholesome book, and wholesome, clean entertainment is so hard to find these days. As official scorer, I score this one a hit!!!"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"not a great bookthought i would like it afteer listedning to the author on the eradio, but i was wrong"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"With all the uproar this book caused in 1970 when it came out, I expected more. More controversy. More about Mickey Mantle. More about loose morals on the road. Jim Bouton is a funny guy, there's little question of that. From the book, I get the tone that he's quite an egotist as well. He has many self-depricating remarks in the book, but after a while, I came to believe he thinks too highly about himself. There are some great stories about &quot;beaver shooting&quot; and other games that ballplayers play that I thought were hilarious. As well, seeing behind the scenes of a baseball season was neat. But I wanted more of the scandalous stuff."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Story line is all over the place. Doesn't hold my interest. Sorry I bought the book and would return it if I could."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I am normally a fan of baseball books, and was looking forward to reading this book. I was severely disappointed, and ended up abandoning the book about 25% of the way through it-something I rarely do. After seeing all the other positive reviews, I am honestly not sure I was reading the same book everyone else was-my review is based on the Kindle version.It starts with a forward written years after the book, telling the reader how important this work was, and how groundbreaking it was in its day. No doubt it was, but it sort of ruins the \\"surprise\\" of the book, and quite frankly come across as overly self-serving.The remainder of the book seems to be constructed of day-by-day notes of what Jim Bouton was thinking. He covers all topics, from voyeurism from hotel rooftops to his battles with pitching coaches over knuckleballs.The problem is that his thoughts are about one paragraph long. Some stretch to two paragraphs, and there is maybe one or two that take up a whole page-but the vast majority of them are two sentence blurbs about some topic that immediately transition into a totally different topic, only marginally related. The first quarter of the book is nothing but these short little blurbs. It is like reading a essay written by someone with ADHD- or spending an afternoon with a senile uncle.I couldn't get through it, and gave up.Some of the material was interesting, although quite a bit of it was somewhat mundane and boring. No doubt back when the book was written people were shocked to find that major league owners would try to skimp on salaries by a few thousand, and that minor league facilities were shoddy-but much of the material does not stand the test of time. Bouton's condescending attitude and smugness didn't do anything to help."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I thought this was actually boring. I bought it thinking I would learn something new about baseball, but he comes across as a whiner and complainer."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"Unorganized mishmash. Hard to follow unless you are a knowledgeable, die-hard fan. Mostly, the players sound like a bunch of overgrown kids, which some of them are, but some are in their late 20's and early 30's...time to grow up. Some interesting tidbits, but not worth the money. Needlessly crude in some places."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"If I remember correctly, this book was supposed to be used, in 'like new' shape. It came to me yellowed (yes I know, 40+ years old), but also dirty and worn. I would have judged it as fair condition only."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I purchased this book thinking it would be interesting to read what it's like to be a baseball player. I read maybe only 1/4 of the ball four section of the book, & was so incredibly disgusted, & appalled!! What a horrible dirty way to live, & I understand he was wanting the reader to know how their life really was, but Bouton thinks the disgusting lifestyle is funny, & obviously enjoys telling about it. The language is so incredibly vulgar & filthy page after page, that I quit reading it because I felt so filthy. It could be that they talked that way, but why would you want to continually repeat that kind of language! I read parts from Ball 5 to the end of the book, & Bouton definately cleaned up the language & the vulgar way of living on this section, but then to continue with Ball 6, & onward? Bouton is definately someone who can't let go with that time of his life. This was definately not worth the .99 I paid for it!"},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"I thought it was very funny when I first read it, but the attitude that he can trash so many other people is a little hard to take. He apparently made no attempt to understand Mickey Mantle but felt okay about slamming him for drinking too much and yet wanted to make sure everyone knew he (Bouton) was a great guy for supporting civil rights and adopting a kid. The book was an attempt to copy &quot;Instant Replay&quot;, but somehow Bouton and his editor thought it was okay to put in many negative comments about people who can't respond. It's no wonder so many people in baseball hated him after this. He seemed to think he was &quot;telling it like it was&quot; but to dump on teamates who can't respond is pretty low. With friends like Bouton you don't need enemies. I think he could have been just as funny without going out of his way to try to hurt people."},{"Title":"Ball Four","review":"The so-called sports diary book is usually simplistic and misleading. Author clutches tape and begins, &quot;Dear Diary and Friend.&quot; I could be wrong, by profession I am a podiatrist, but I think this book was researched by Bouton and written by Schecter, a good but unhappy fellow with very poor and painful feet. Schecter didn't like many players and this work reflects his slant more than Bouton's slant, when Bouton grew up enough to have any slant at all. Bouton was a marginal college student, who never tired talking of an evening with a beautiful classmate, -- no names here -- later a smash hit star in Hollywood,and whose arrogance and self-promoting puffery Mantle and Maris could not stand. Bad feet can make strong men cry. Schecter wept in my office. But this kind of generalized anger -having Bouton say all ball players but I myself, Saint James of Hoboken, are klutzes -- makes for a work that while entertainig is no more than that. Dangerous, really. Frankly, it makes my feet hurt. Roger Angell, Robert Lypsite, who live on the hypothesis that they are smarter and more sensitive than ball players, love this book. Less neurotic people don't agree. Entertaining, but like yesterday's lobster tails, sheer garbage."},{"Title":"Romantic Correspondence: Women, Politics and the Fiction of Letters (Cambridge Studies in Romanticism)","review":"One of the most excellent books I have read till date. Very insightful information; I never realized the significance of correspondence by women in the Romantic era till I read this book. Must read for every student of Romanticism."},{"Title":"Leni Riefenstahl-Five Lives: A Biography in Pictures (German Edition)","review":"The striking front cover on this book is publicity still as Junta, in the movie \\"The Blue Light\\" 1932. As impressive as the cover is, it gets better when you open it to reveal hundreds of artistically shot photos. Dr. Ruth says bigger is not necessarily better. However in this case it is; something about the size of the photographs add to their striking appearance. Most are in grainy black and white with some color sections. This book is just a wee to large to fit in my oversized bookshelf. So I am making a larger shelf to display the books front view.Just as you assume that this is a great coffee table book you will find that there is more too it. Luckily the pictures are not cluttered or distracted by alpha pneumonics. All the descriptions are in a separate section.
