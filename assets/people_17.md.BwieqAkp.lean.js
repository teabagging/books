Dr. Nicolosi does NOT assert that recovery from homosexuality is impossible, but that one should go through therapy anyway, as another reviewer asserts. Even a reading of the book's title should have made this obvious(!). This flagrant misrepresentation of Dr. Nicolosi's work should serve as a caution to those trying to find information on this sensative subject. Emotions run so high that one hardly dares trust any of the reviews --SO-- get the book and read it for yourself. If you've come this far seeking answers, you owe it to yourself not to be detered by the venomous rhetoric of those so uncomfortable with their own sexuality that that they cannot stand the existence of differing points of view, particularly when backed by science, experience, and success, as are Dr. Nicolosi's."},{"Title":"Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach","review":"Finally someone has come forth with the truth about homosexuality. The premise of this book is that homosexuality is a psycho-sexual disorder that can (not necessarily in all cases) be overcome later in life. The homosexual behavior is an attempt for the person to meet legitimate same-sex emotional needs which have become sexualized during the upbringing of the person. Many believe incorrectly that they were born this way, that this is their &quot;true&quot; nature. Yet Nicolosi is calling peole on to discovering their TRUE nature and sexual identity. He contends that one's upbringing matters more than we realize. Lack of a father/father-figure makes a significant different and can wound a person for life!Could it be that Nicolosi is correct and the gay lobby is simply trying to shout down and drown out the voice of reason? Could it be that the truth about homosexuality hurts too much and that's why many regard Nicolosi's ideas as &quot;homophobic&quot; and &quot;hateful?&quot; Could it be that we do not give enough attention to our environment and upbringing in this messed-up world?This book (and its sequel) changed my life and helped me to take charge of my life which was spiraling downwards into the darkness of homosexuality. I found that the gay lifestyle sucks you in and doesn't let go. It is an EXTREMELY unhealthy way to live. I hope others can speak out about this sorrowful state of living (not BEING). This is not a religious issue but a moral and anthropological one."},{"Title":"The Key West Diet: A Self-Help, Weight-Control Strategy","review":"For a diet book this one was very friendly.

The classic &quot;Lolita&quot; is paired with its own screenplay adaptation, and the comic &quot;Pnin&quot; and witty &quot;Pale Fire.&quot;&quot;Lolita&quot; is the tale for which Nabokov is best known. The redundantly-named, middle-aged (dirty old man) Humbert Humbert is haunted by some teenage love he had long ago, and which he thinks he has refound in the prepubescent Delores Haze (called &quot;Lolita&quot; by Humbert). He sets out to seduce the unsuspecting girl, but her mom is standing in the way...&quot;Pnin&quot; is a gently comic tale about Timofey Pnin, a timid, moderately neurotic Russian professor who now lives in the United States. He's amazed by technology, fussy, a bit weird about his health, and has problems with American train schedules. The unfortunate Pnin stumbles from one problem to another, trying to keep everything under control in uncontrollable circumstances.&quot;Pale Fire&quot; is perhaps the best literary satire out there. Poet John Shade wrote the sprawling 999-line poem &quot;Pale Fire,&quot; shortly before being murdered. After his death, the poem is being painstakingly dissected and annotated by his neighbor, Charles Kinbote. Except Kinbote is a nutjob, who interprets &quot;Pale Fire&quot; as being all about him, and will come up with weird symbolism to justify his belief.&quot;Lolita: A Screenplay&quot; is almost a different version of &quot;Lolita.&quot; Here Nabokov recounted the same events of the novel, but from an ominiscent perspective -- that of the person who would be watching the movie. Very rich, very well-adapted, very evocative for a screenplay, this is almost as good as a book in itself.Nabokov could handle just about any kind of writing, this collection shows us. From the opulent poetry of &quot;Pale Fire&quot; to the solid screenplay, from the erotic drama of &quot;Lolita&quot; to the chuckling comedy of &quot;Pnin,&quot; he handles it all. His writing is detailed and lush, rich almost to the point of choking. He shifts perspectives, tells a story through annotation, sees through the eyes of a pedophile, and does it all with a certain winking flair.Nabokov's writing is a combination of believable characterizations and rich language. Humbert Humbert, for example, is a horrendously believable person, especially since he makes constant excuses for his pedaphilic behavior -- the characterization is so good, in fact, that newcomers might even think (incorrectly) that Nabokov sympathized with the creep. At the same time, he creates the rather pitiful, absentminded Pnin, the self-serving nutcase Kinbote -- and they're all delightfully three-dimensional. You could bump into people like these on the bus at any time, and they would be just as he describes them.Comedy, drama, satire and screenwriting are collected in the second Library of America collection of Nabokov's novels. Sexy, funny, brilliant and exquisitely written, these are among the best of Vladimir Nabokov's works."},{"Title":"Nabokov: Novels 1955-1962: Lolita / Pnin / Pale Fire (Library of America)","review":"This is a compact, sturdy and high quality edition of the first novels Nabokov wrote entirely in English. It's the central volume in a three-volume set of Nabokov's autobiography and English fiction (excluding the short stories), including his finest achievements -- Lolita, Pnin and Pale Fire. The two versions of Lolita (as novel and screen adaptation) are illuminating to read together: the novel is created within Humbert's subjective and self-serving memory, while in the screenplay Nabokov reimagines the story as objective action. I was also intrigued to find that some obvious departures from the novel in Kubrick's film -- such as the opening scene of Humbert shooting Quilty, or the high school prom scene -- are ideas taken from the Nabokov screenplay (in turn fragments of the novel excised in the final version). Brian Boyd offers an impeccable text, much improved over the paperback editions, with a chronology of the author's life. This is the volume to choose if you u! nravel Nabokov's narrative patterns with your own marginal notes and comments, and want a volume that won't disintegrate in a nymphet's span of years."},{"Title":"Nabokov: Novels 1955-1962: Lolita / Pnin / Pale Fire (Library of America)","review":"Picture Vladimir Nabokov. In the hall of mirrors that is popular culture, he is the dirty man who wrote the dirty book &quot;Lolita,&quot; about a 12-year-old &quot;nymphet&quot; -- he invented the term, by the way -- and her affair with an older man.Angle the mirror another way, and he is one of the founders of the modernist novel, which to some people -- myself included -- that's a damning phrase. &quot;Modernist&quot; and &quot;post-modernist&quot; literature seems a) self-referencing to the point of egotism; b) dedicated to the advancement of decedent themes, and to score big points as a writer, pile it on, brother; and c) obsessed with the discovery that the &quot;arts&quot; -- whether books, pictures or movies -- are artificial, and that we use them to create, well, books, pictures and movies.Unless you think I am making it up, here's an example drawn from real life: a few years back, a Charlotte museum mounted an exhibition of a painter's work, one of which was a canvas whose front side was turned toward the wall, exposing a paint-stained frame. A newspaper reviewer breathlessly informed the reading public that the artist did this &quot;to inform the viewer that most paintings are recetangular.&quot;Now, a reasonably intelligent person could probably reach that conclusion without much effort, but discoveries like these seem to drive those who tread into the &quot;modern&quot; era of art.So Vlaidmir Nabokov's reputation is caught between two very opposing poles. He either panders to the worst tastes of man, or the worst tastes of art.Fortunately, he is neither, and the Library of America agrees. The non-profit publisher throws its reputation behind Nabokov as a writer worth reading by publishing all of his English-language novels in three volumes. The first volume covers his work from 1941 to 1951: &quot;The Real Life of Sebastian Knight,&quot; &quot;Bend Sinister,&quot; and his memoir, &quot;Speak, Memory.&quot; The middle work contains the notorious &quot;Lolita,&quot; &quot;Pale Fire,&quot; &quot;Pnin,&quot; and the &quot;Lolita&quot; screenplay Nabokov wrote for Stanley Kubrick. The concluding volume contains &quot;Ada,&quot; &quot;Transparent Things,&quot; and &quot;Look at the Harlequins!&quot;But of these works, only &quot;Lolita&quot; stands alone. It is not a dirty book, and one should pity those American and British tourists who, in the mid-1950s, bought the pale olive-green two-volume paperbacks published in Paris by the notorious Olympia Press. Those expecting frankly pornographic stories like &quot;The Story of O&quot; and &quot;How to Do It&quot; would have been sorely disappointed in Humbert Humbert's self-confessed defense of his rape (not &quot;seduction,&quot; which implies a willingness to be seduced) and exploitation of Delores Haze, &quot;Lolita, light of my life,fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.&quot;Even Olympia's publisher was taken in, telling a mutual friend that he though Nabokov was Humbert, and that he was attempting to popularize nymphet love.What does become apparent after reading through the volumes (and aided by an excellent two-volume biography by Brian Boyd) is that there is much more to Nabokov than meets the eye. Delving deeper in his works reveals a funhouse hall of mirrors that can lead to a definitive end, and there's not much in modernist fiction that could substantiate that claim.What sets Nabokov off from other writers is his use of the language. Raised in Tsarist Russia, Nabokov was a child prodigy who was taught Russian, French and English at an early age. His prose is elegent, his command of English astounding. It's close to the prose of Henry James, but except for the foreign phrases, which the Library editions provide translations and explanations, far more understandable.Descriptions pulled at random from &quot;Lolita&quot; ring as if English was a newly minted language, capable of expressing humor (&quot;The bed was a frightful mess with overtones of potato chips&quot;) and snobbish anger (&quot;Lo had grabbed some comics from the back seat and, mobile white-bloused, one brown elbow out of the window, was deep in the current adventure of some clout or clown&quot;).Even, when Humbert meets his Lolita long after she escaped his clutches, when he believes that he still loves her, heart-rending: &quot;In her washed-out grey eyes, strangely spectacled, our poor romance was for a moment reflected, pondered upon, and dismissed like a dull party, like a rainy picnic to which only the dullest bores had come, like a humdrum exercise, like a bit of dry mud caking her childhood.&quot;This is not casual reading, but neither is it reading-as-masochistic exercise, with furrowed brows and an exasperated flipping of once-read pages. There is a surface meaning that is easily accessible, but there are deeper meanings, in-jokes, ironies and moral questions worthy of consideration.The best volume of the three is the second, which contains &quot;Lolita,&quot; the screenplay he wrote for Stanley Kubrick (which was not used), the comic novel (for Nabokov at least) &quot;Pnin&quot; and &quot;Pale Fire.&quot;But good works can be found in the other volumes as well. &quot;The Real Life of Sebastian Knight,&quot; in the first volume, is the author's account of his biographical research on his half-brother, the brilliant writer Sebastian Knight, who had died recently of a heart condition after writing a half-dozen novels. It bears all the hallmarks of the post-modernist novel replete with a self-absorption with writers, spurious biography, an unreliable narrator and ironical references. &quot;Speak, Memory,&quot; also in the first volume, is Nabokov's memoirs about growing up in Russia.Indeed, the only disadvantage to reading Nabokov is that it may cause a nagging niggling in the back of your head, while reading novels in the future, that they just cannot compare to those composed by the American from Russia."},{"Title":"Nabokov: Novels 1955-1962: Lolita / Pnin / Pale Fire (Library of America)","review":"Listening to Jeremy Irons' perfect audiobook rendering of the perfect novel \\"Lolita\\" recently reminded me of the original work, so I went back to it and I welcomed the screenplay paired here for pleasure; I also re-read \\"Pnin\\" and \\"Pale Fire,\\" which overlap obliquely. It'd been thirty years since I enjoyed those three novels, and like Humbert Humbert, Charles Kinbote, and Pnin himself, I'm about the same age-bracket as their creator was when he conjured up these erudite, erratic, and eccentric characters who in turn, of course, play off of himself, however much he may have denied it from his own niche in East Coast academia in postwar America.\\"Lolita\\" as a novel I found rare: it needed not a word replaced; every adjective was necessary, each verb crafted, every sentence chiseled. My comments would be superfluous, but in the Library of America edition, Brian Boyd's notes pale before those in the annotated edition by Alfred Appel, whose version I recommend. If you lack not only fluent French but Russian, not to mention reams of insight into the worlds of art, butterflies, popular culture of the time, and wordplay that anyone less brilliant than Nabokov would not catch, Appel's edition supplants Boyd. Boyd drew upon Appel's notes and as his biographer, Boyd adds a few tidbits among those Appel did not in his reticence to expose certain facts gleaned from interviews with Nabokov a few decades ago. However, as with the rest of this handsome to hold LofA edition, Boyd's notes tend, as in many LofA commentaries, to skimp, perhaps due to pressure to keep the books easy to hold.The sadness of \\"Lolita\\" lingers, with its beauty. The screenplay Nabokov first wrote for Stanley Kubrick was seven hours long, but from the shorter, if never produced conflation of two versions here, I would have liked to read whatever Nabokov created as he sought to transfer the gist of the novel into an entertaining, deft story for the screen. It's a great counterpart to the novel, best read after the printed text, naturally.Pnin, who finds himself trying to get by at a college after the war, joins other Russian expatriates at a summer gathering. He laments a \\"'typical American college student' who does not know geography, is immune to noise, and thinks education is but a means to get a remunerative job.\\" (387) Some things never change.Later at that gathering, Pnin learns of the death in the Nazi camps of a woman he had loved, and he goes out to walk \\"under the solemn pines. The sky was dying. He did not believe in an autocratic God. He did believe, dimly, in a democracy of ghosts. The souls of the dead, perhaps, formed committees, and these, in quick succession, attended to the destinies of the quick.\\" (395) But this reverie's snapped by the mosquitoes. Nabokov in these tales does not allow his haunted, thoughtful fellows to wander in the ether long.A professor chats with another; they look up at the stars. \\"I suspect it is really a fluorescent corpse, and we are inside it.\\" (417) Metaphorical images arrest one's attention in these often everyday tales, as characters jolt themselves out of themselves to look at a world that does not synchronize with their internal (dis)orientation.Two academics dominate \\"Pale Fire\\"; Pnin gets a mention from one professor who mistakes Kinbote for him. Kinbote's commentary satirizes scholarly obsession, as this titular poem by John Shade gets wrenched by Kinbote, an emigre from Zembla with a complicated past, into Kinbote's own tale, even as he notes that he has \\"no desire to twist and batter an unambiguous 'apparatus criticus' into the monstrous semblance of a novel.\\" (495)The odd delight of this challenging story lies in watching Kinbote's obsession take over his task. He does not appear to realize how far Shade's content lies from Kinbote's imagined reality, so details pile up. \\"But a commentator's obligations cannot be shirked, however dull the information he must collect and convey.\\" (556) He loses his grip on what he set out to do: \\"Anybody having access to a good library could, no doubt, easily trace that story to its source and find the name of the lady; but such humdrum potterings are beneath true scholarship.\\" (624)Kinbote leaps into raptures, deriding Shade's seemingly secularized temperament. Nature herself is rightfully chided as \\"the grand cheat,\\" who \\"puts into us\\" lust \\"to inveigle us into propagation.\\" (621) Kinbote praises the \\"Divine Embrace,\\" and \\"the warm bath of physical dissolution, the universal unknown engulfing the miniscule unknown that had been the only real part of one's temporary personality.\\" (599) Even if Nabokov satirizes such faith, this is a marvelously written passage. Man's life, as Kinbote sensibly for once notes, may be that \\"human life is but a series of footnotes to a vast obscure unfinished masterpiece.\\" (636)These works show Nabokov at his best. I cited a few more off-beat sections to show the sometimes overlooked two works that nestle next to \\"Lolita,\\" and often get overlooked. The four inclusions are highly recommended, and one only wonders, as Nabokov disingenuously confesses, how his English-language efforts compare to his native Russian ones, for he learned English as a baby, and he appears far more fluent than Pnin! As often in these works, the teller of a tale cannot always be trusted, or does not share omniscience."},{"Title":"Nabokov: Novels 1955-1962: Lolita / Pnin / Pale Fire (Library of America)","review":"\\"Pnin\\" isn't that great, in my opinion. On the other hand, \\"Lolita\\" and \\"Pale Fire\\" are hilarious send ups of intellectuals (which Nabokov obviously was, too). That's right: \\"Lolita\\" isn't mainly about pedophilia--it's about the equally perverse desire to mold youth to fit one's own wishes."},{"Title":"Nabokov: Novels 1955-1962: Lolita / Pnin / Pale Fire (Library of America)","review":"Any Nabokov novel is far above even the best work of most other authors, and the three novels here, in my opinion, are his three best. I know a lot of people do not consider Pnin to be one of Nabokov's better novels, but I strongly disagree.Lolita: What is there to say? The debate of Nabokov's masterpiece seems to be between Lolita and Pale Fire. I vote for Lolita. In my opinion, it's not only Nabokov's best, but possibly the best novel of the 20th century. The plot line on the surface is actually very easy to follow: everyone knows it's about a pedophile named Humbert Humbert who travels around the states with Dolores Haze, \\"Lolita\\" to him, and that he is in love with her. However, simply focusing on the basic plot line does this novel an injustice. As another reviewer pointed out regarding another Nabokov connection, you get out of his novels exactly what you put into them. You can read it simply as a story, and not bother with the French or looking up the references. I recommend reading it as it is on the first run, and then getting an annotated edition. You'll be amazed how much you missed. The ending scene with quality may be my favorite scene in any novel. Highly recommended.Pnin: Graham Greene, in his six word review, describes this novel better than I ever could: \\"Hilariously funny and of a sadness.\\" Timofey Pnin is a brilliant man that you will at first laugh at, but in a pitying sort of way. As a character he is slightly pathetic, but you will feel sorry for him. I think this may be Nabokov's funniest novel, and is one of my favorites.Pale Fire: This novel is set up in a very clever way. We are introduced, by Charles Kinbote, to a poem called Pale Fire, which was written by his friend John Shade soon before his death. We then get to read the thirty or forty page poem, and following this is Kinbote's interpretation of the poem. It soon becomes apparent, however, that Kinbote has no idea what he's talking about. Pale Fire is a funny and devilishly clever novel.Lolita Screenplay: Not quite essential, but it's interesting to see how Nabokov translates his novel into film. It's also worth noting that Kubrick, the director of the film, hardly followed it at all.If you have even the slightest interest in Nabokov, you owe it to yourself to get this collection."},{"Title":"Nabokov: Novels 1955-1962: Lolita / Pnin / Pale Fire (Library of America)","review":"One must celebrate those plural minds who decided that a Russian exile and cosmopolitan writer could have a home among American classics.

It?s no surprise to read that Latino youth drop out of high school at very high percentage rates. In some neighborhoods 40 percent never finish high school. That is an unconscionable waste of human talent.Many Latinos are therefore doomed to substandard employment all the days of their lives. Such a reality is fertile ground for frustration, drugs, excessive drinking, unwanted pregnancies and other realities that hinder productive lives. Those grim realities litter the mediocre existence of many. The main reason being that society failed to provide them one of the most basic necessities: a solid education.It is not as if this continuing social problem has not been explored. It has been ad infinitum. Thousands, well hundreds, of reports have been written.Many good recommendations have been made over the years. Some have actually been adopted and matters improved. But those are the exceptions. The underlying problems remain in state after state. There is a need for an effective national commitment to address the unique needs of the underserved in our society.In this well-researched and lucidly written book the Portales, Rita and Marco, address the issue forthrightly and with a degree of confidence that is refreshing. More importantly the Portales developed and present a sensible work plan.They point out that the present generation continues to be poorly served. They will never reach their full potential. Inadvertently therein are the seeds for a similar dismal existence for their children.Many Hispanics drop out of school because they find them irrelevant, hostile and boring. There are also financial necessities, but many just feel they are wasting their time. Some really aren?t but if they feel that way; they are likely to drop out.The first part of the book details the invariably dismal situation most Latino students face in their schools. It is surprising that so many remain in school for as long as they do. The disconnect between their schools and real education is monumental.The chapter on why students drop out is pointed and precise. It is worth reading to be reminded what many of our college students have overcome.Although the Portales are very diplomatic and careful not to blame teachers or administrators or school boards, they are very clear to point out that our educational system is simply broken and thus dysfunctional.Their honesty has led some to claim they are ?too negative? even ?un-American.? Anyone who reads this book will discover just the opposite. They care deeply about this country and therefore are concerned about its future.Logic indicates that the nation will fail to meet its potential if our broken schools are not repaired.The Portales are also, thank goodness, optimistic that the task can be accomplished. A major goal is to have students, not just Latinos, fully understand and master the print and oral skills they need to reach their highest potential. They wisely point out that real education will take hold when students have been taught to be accepting and sensitive to the similarities and differences of others, when teachers are determined to build a personal relationship with each student, and when educational systems succeed in delivering what has to be conveyed to have students succeed.That seems simple enough. But the devil is in the details. They can best be seen in the nation?s commitment or lack of it.The authors suggestions are precise and sweeping. They urge that a team approach be established \\"to repair?\\" our schools.They have a basic working principle.?When the Classroom Teacher and Student Relationship is the central concern of a school district education system, educators better understand their different team roles, making student learning more effective, producing quality education.?The book details how this goal can be reached. This book is not a theoretical tome. It is pragmatic, layered with sensible steps to be taken.Most of us have seen more ?reform? movements than we can remember. Every administration has their plan, every governor wants to bring forth reform. Presidential candidates say they want to be remembered as an \\"educational president.Many well-meaning persons have tried and some have even succeeded in fostering many significant contributions. But too many Latinos -- and other underserved students -- still can't stay on the educational ladder to success. Not just material success but personal fulfillment as well.This book provides a sensible working plan, one that will require a different way of teaching and administering. To succeed it must be embraced by leaders at all levels of our society. This thoughtful book is worthy of being studied and its principles adopted.\\"************Dr. Gustavo A.

Sylvia McNair provides a more thorough look at \\"Arkansas\\" for the America the Beautiful, Second Series.Chapter One, \\"Welcome to Arkansas,\\" starts off by dealing with the most important question regarding the state, which is how you pronounce the name. The state legislature says AR-kan-SAW, but the people who live there are usually called Ar-KAN-sans. The history of the state is covered in the next three chapters. Chapter Two, \\"The Arkansas Territory,\\" starts as many of these volumes about the Southern states do with the Mound Builders before moving on to the French explorers and the U.S. acquiring the territory as part of the Louisiana Purchase. Chapter Three, \\"The Young State,\\" looks at slavery, the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the Progressive Era that ended with World War I. \\"The Modernization of Arkansas\\" is covered in Chapter Four, which begins with the Great Depression and World War II, and ends with the crisis in Little Rock over desegregating Central High School in 1957 and the election of a Republican governor in 1967.\\"The Natural State\\" of Arkansas is developed in Chapter Five, which divides the topography into the Ozarks, the Arkansas River Valley, the Ouachitas, the West Gulf Coastal Plain, and the Delta. Chapter Six, \\"Here and There in Arkansas\\" is where McNair looks at what life is like in the different areas of the state. Chapter Seven, \\"Running the Government,\\" is all about politics in Arkansas, paying special attention to the Constitution of 1874 and all of the state symbols, where young readers will learn that the South Arkansas vine-ripe pink tomato is the state fruit AND vegetable, while the state has two official state songs, \\"Arkansas (You Run Deep in Me)\\" and \\"Oh, Arkansas.\\" We also learn that Arkansas was the 49th state to pass a civil rights bill (in 1993).The economics of the state are the province of Chapter Eight, \\"Making a Living,\\" where agriculture, mining, and Sam Walton have made impacts. \\"The Arkansans\\" (see pronunciation guide above) are examined in Chapter Nine, which also looks at religion and education. Chapter Ten\\" is all about \\"Enjoying Leisure Time\\" in Arkansas. This is where readers find out about Razorback basketball, Dizzy Dean, and Johnny Cash. By the time you finish this book, like a character in \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" you will \\"know Arkansaw.\\"The book is filled with color photographs and original maps. There are also dozens of informative sidebars that flesh out all sorts of interesting people (William Jefferson Clinton and Scottie Pippen), places (Crowleys Ridge and Hot Springs National Park), and things (\\"Jim Crow\\" Laws and the New Madrid Earthquake). The recipe in this volume is for Sweet Potato Pie, which is the first one I have encountered in these volumes that I will not try because I do not like Sweet Potatoes (to wit, I do not like yams, Sam I Am). You will also find a detailed Timeline contrasting U.S. and Arkansas state history, several pages of Fast Facts containing all sorts of statistics, and a list of places you can go To Find Out More."},{"Title":"African American Literature: Voices in a Tradition","review":"Let me just tell you this book kept 8th graders loving literature like no other literature could.

Many are illustrated with simple pen and ink drawings. Some of the poems take a stand against war, but most are fairly whimsical.One of my favorites is about a romantic meeting between Snowman Frost and Lady Thaw.

The best part is his utter dismantling of Summer of 1949, David Halberstam's bestseller. James points out at least 7 separate foolish statements or flat-out untruths halberstam makes. James also reviews all the players in the league and makes his normal excellent analysis. He has a great essay on the failures of psychology in the Gary Sheffield analysis.

Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Terror in the Skies: Why 9/11 Could Happen Again","review":"Does the accumulation of four years without further terrorist attacks make you feel safer when you fly? It shouldn't. The Bureaucratic Bunglers are out in full force and with them in charge you don't have a prayer. Or rather, all you do have is prayer.According to Annie Jacobsen, we'd better do our homework on this one because there is no one watching out for us. Back in April,Gates of Vienna posted on Ms. Jacobsen's tenacity and her willingness to follow this story wherever it led. That post, \\"Silence of the Sheep,\\" proved that the author is a sheepdog indeed. Her interviews with other passengers, with government agencies, with the House Judiciary Committee, with airline personnel, and with individual people who bear the day-to-day hazard of working in this field, have made her case. The tale of her experiences is documented well in \\"Terror in the Skies\\".This is a top-down problem. The guys in harm's way - the pilots and flight attendants - know the problems but they have no more power to address them than you do. Less than two percent of pilots are armed. Want to know why? Because in order to actually carry a firearm on board, the firearms training must be done on the pilot's own time and it has to be done in a place far from home, squeezed into his holiday time or vacation.And flight attendants? Again, they have to arrange self-defense training on their own time, at their own expense and without the cooperation of the airlines themselves. Think of it this way: what if Brink's hired drivers and gave them no training in handling attempted robberies? What if they expected their employees to get training - if any - on their own time and their own dime? How long do you think Brink's would be in business?That's the situation we have in the friendly skies of America. When you add to that the cruel joke of the Federal Air Marshals, the lackadaisical behavior of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the farce we all know as the Department of Homeland Insecurity, it's enough to make you want to stay home and do your business by long-distance and email.Let's take just one: FAMS. This is bureaucratese for the Federal Air Marshal program. You know the old joke that goes \\"you're ugly and your mother dresses you funny\\"? Well, for this program, the first part may or may not be the case, but for the second premise - being dressed funny - you can count on FAMS. Due to the boneheaded policies of those in charge, Federal Air Marshals are required to wear sport coats and collared shirts. Yes, that's right: they must look like Federal Air Marshals at all times because they are a reflection of FAMS and dressing in a slovenly disguise would somehow bring disgrace to the organization. Comments about being a lovely corpse would be appropriate here.Then there's what they do after they're up and dressed. Remember, they're carrying guns, right? So obviously they can't go through security. However, there's a second obvious thing they can do - they can fight the current and walk through the exit lanes for deplaning passengers. How's that for subterfuge?Let's see, what other behaviors might they carry out to make themselves more obvious? Pre-boarding is one trick they have down well. So is always riding in first class.And there you have the FAMS spotter information: check out the guys in first class in the sports coats who got on the plane before you. But don't worry. Any terrorists on board sussed to their tricks a long time ago. They know exactly who they have to take out first, provided that any \\"taking out\\" is even necessary. If you're going to detonate in the restroom, what do you care where the Federal Marshals are? They're coming with you anyway.Annie Jacobsen makes a good case for the fact that her flight, 327 on Northwest Airlines, was a \\"probe,\\" a dry run practice. And she backs up her contention with:* eyewitnesses who were on the plane with her,*a four hour FBI interrogation in which they admitted her intuition was correct,* contact from other passengers on other planes who decry the lack of security and the lack of follow-up in their cases, and* communications from frustrated and fearful pilots, flight attendants, and others in the business who know the skies are anything but safe, that they are being probed all the time, and that it is only a matter of time before planes fall from the sky.Near the end of the book Ms. Jacobsen recounts a conversation with an air marshal. She asked him to explain what he meant when he said \\"it was all for show.\\" Here' what he told her:\\"You know how youd go to the airport, before 9/11, and an agent there, somebody who worked for the airlines would say to you, 'Did you pack your own bags?' Well, it was all for show. Those agents weren't trained in detecting whether or not someone was lying. The procedure was there to make the flying public feel good. That's what happened with 327. They all came running like in the movies, but it was all for show. Who interviewed the men? FAMS. We're not trained in interviewing terror suspects. We don't know what to look for. And the FBI at the airport? I won't go there. Who really should have been there? ICE. Period. ICE. But they weren't. Why? Because management says probes aren't happening on airplanes. The guys were there to make the passengers feet good, nothing more, nothing less.Two years ago, I had a probing incident. It may have been one of the first. After it happened, no one knew what to do, there was no protocol. The guys involved in the incident sailed off into the crowd. What was I going to do? Run up, tap the guy on the shoulder and say, 'I almost shot you, now I'd like to interview you?'Instead, I filed a report about my probing incident. Basically I was told 'it didn't happen.' Well, it did happen. Probes have been happening ever since. I doubt anybody ever even remotely considered you'd attract the kind of press you did. But you did. That's a good thing.\\"Now you know. Annie Jacobsen's intuitions about Flight 327 were correct. But you know even more: the official response to 9/11 is all for show - boondoggle and brouhaha and folderol and CYA.Perhaps we should fly the friendly skies of El Al. They know security; they take it in with their mothers' milk.__________________DISCLOSURE: Spence Publishing sent me this book for review purposes. This post, which I will also place in Amazon, serves as my part of the original agreement made with them that were I sent a copy, I would review Ms. Jacobsen's book. I recommend it highly. There is an excellent bibliography, a glossary of federal acronyms, and extensive notes and back-up for her assertions. The only flaw is the lack of an index. This can be annoying if you're looking for specifics -- e.g., her description of El Al's rigorous security for all its flights.By the way Kevin Jacobsen, her husband, was initially so put off by the behavior of the fifteen Arab \\"musicians\\" on board the flight that he seriously contemplated faking a heart attack in order to get out of the plane before takeoff. Lacking the audacity to carry that out (a courage he no doubt has acquired by now)Mr. Jacobsen sat frozen through the flight, pen in hand, ready to fend off the terrorists. It may seem a futile gesture here on the ground, but it is speaks to the level of his fear for himself and his family.Me, I'm going to do that old Red Foxx imitation. You know, the one where he clutches his chest and looks heavenward and says piteously \\"I'm comin' Lisabeth, I'm comin'...\\" Even now I am practicing the necessary histrionics in case I'm ever stupid enough to get on a plane other than El Al."},{"Title":"Terror in the Skies: Why 9/11 Could Happen Again","review":"I was informed of this book by a recent article in the Washington Times. Fascinating read! I remember the bizarre story of Northwest flight 327 and the 14 Syrian suspects and I was surprised to learn that for nearly two years now (from the Washington Times) the Department of Homeland Security has been \\"secretly\\" working on a report on the controversial flight. I do remember something way back when from the government to the affect of \\"nothing happened\\" on the flight. Something about the Syrians being part of a band. Well, well, surprise surprise. Now the DHS report has come out and it's been classified. Fortunately, Ms. Jacobsen's investigative work has not been classified. In this book, she shows us what Homeland Security doesn't want us to know: that 14 Syrian men can fly around the country on expired visas, terrorizing passengers and conducting test runs for hijacking and no one says boo. Buy a ticket to United 93, read this book and say a prayer. When you're done praying, get real and call your Congressman. If not, the news of your death will not be an exaggeration."},{"Title":"Terror in the Skies: Why 9/11 Could Happen Again","review":"Everyone who flies often, or has loved ones who fly often, should read this book. It's one way to become a better informed consumer of airline travel. You'll learn that the government, which is supposed to protect you, is much more interested in covering up their mistakes, pointing fingers, using diversionary tactics and expending effort in obfuscating the truth.While, this book reads like a fiction political thriller, it's real life. It was too much to hope for that the government would be proactive in protecting us from terrorists who would turn our airliners into weapons against us. Instead they wait until something happens - Richard Reid tries to blow up a plane with a bomb in his shoe, and now 86-year old grandmothers have to take off their shoes. One hand doesn't know what the other hand is doing: The CIA knew the 9/11 bombers were in the country, but didn't bother to tell the FBI. Once the FBI knew, they couldn't find them - even though some of them were actually listed in the phone book.It's hard to read this book and keep on flying on commercial aircraft. But if anything, I have a whole lot more respect for the airline crews. I would say I have less confidence in our government, but I'm not sure confidence can be measured in the negative."},{"Title":"Terror in the Skies: Why 9/11 Could Happen Again","review":"Layers upon layers of half truths and misleading information have always been apart of the information highway. After 9/11 i figured we would get to the bottom of some of the major issues facing National Security and airline safety, at the very least. To discover that even today, after all that has occurred we, as a nation of people, are still held under the thumb of misinformation when it comes to the airline industry and safety issues is absolutely unacceptable.Annie's book expands very well on the layers of bureaucracy, lies and cover-ups that occur even today within the many institutions set up to protect our lives in the air as well as on the ground.Dave Adams should be fired and the TSA should almost start from scratch and Mr. Mineta needs to be replaced immediately.The airline industry should somehow be held accountable for the lack of information they allow their employees to share and how this inability to tell the crucial truths about what happens in the skies of today kills people and will again and again and again.Ms. Jacobsen had a traumatic experience and didn't bury her head in the sand as so many of us have in the past. To pursue the personal truths that scare us so much is admirable. To pursue the truths that threaten a nation is courageous and patriotic. I commend her for telling a story that needed to be told, in a manner that is enjoyable to read and informative. This book isn't about her or her story.This book, after reading it, is about me, you and everyone else who \\"fly the friendly skies.\\"A good read.An informative read.An incredibly discouraging read."},{"Title":"Terror in the Skies: Why 9/11 Could Happen Again","review":"Annie Jacobsen's book is a harrowing, fascinating and informed perspective on two timely topics: terrorism and the administration's inability to face the facts and keep the public out of harm's way. The author recounts in great detail the airline trip she took in June 2004, one where 14 Syrian men -- flying on expired visas (we discover later) acted in a threatening and suspicious manner that led her and others on the flight to believe the 757 might be hijacked. It wasn't hijacked, but anyone who believes nothing happened on flight 327 should read this book before they offer up an opinion.It's been fourteen months since the flight landed. Department of Homeland Security has been investigating the flight, Congress has been investigating the investigators and Ms. Jacobsen has been investigating what government leaves out. What she's discovered paints an alarming and disturbing portrait: bureacrats behaving like bureaucrats and terrorists behaving like terrorists.Jacobsen's personal account is riviting and her journalistic talents provide a compelling narrative.In is no accident that excerpts of \\"Terror in The Skies, Why 9/11 Could Happen Again\\" appear in Houghton Mifflin's colege primer, \\"Many Americas: Reading and Writing Across The Cultural Divide.\\" This is a book that will challenge great minds to think critically. Our future depends on it."},{"Title":"Terror in the Skies: Why 9/11 Could Happen Again","review":"An eye-opener and in view of recent events in the UK, what Annie Jacobsen has to say is fair warning to all air travellers, despite the dismissive accounts of some readers (who, I feel, could well be trying to defend their own lack of common sense).It may be politically incorrect to stigmatise a cast or creed, but in view of the radical Islamic jehadists stance against the west and what they have already done, it seems only common sense to avoid any flights that might carry such personages.Personally, I won't take the risk in future and will be eyeing my fellow passengers very carefully. If I suspect anything might be wrong, I'll ask to be put on another flight. Maybe, if others do the same, the Airlines might begin to do something to protect their passengers, such as recommending \\"some\\" people fly Arab Airways instead.Thank you for your courage and writing this book Annie. It's a book that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Terror in the Skies: Why 9/11 Could Happen Again","review":"i'm shocked at how many people have bought into this garbage. it repeatedly comes across as one woman trying to retroactively convince herself that her initial paranoid delusions on flight 327 was the \\"right\\" way to think.her shocking facts and untold truths are nothing more then wind, blown out of other peoples mouths and lavishly scribbled onto a page to make it seem like something it isnt.doesnt every book making some outrageous claim back up their statement with \\"eyewitness accounts\\" or some firsthand experience or some secret information that only the author has discovered? honestly, if people are this gullible what do you think of the dozens and dozens of books written about the supernatural? numberless volumes all filled with \\"shocking first hand accounts\\" of the boogeyman or some other equally outrageous idea.with this book jacobsen has merely capitalized on Americans overly paranoid view of flying, middle easterners, and the combination of the two. there is not one page, not one scrap of evidence in this entire book that i would consider \\"conclusive\\". and these \\"official documents\\" that are now unclassified say nothing to the flavor of jacobsens words. after extensive background checks and follow ups it was exactly as it seemed, musicians with strange mannerisms on a plane. i dont know where jacobsen gets off, continuing to assert this was indeed some fictional \\"dry run\\" for a terrorist attack thats yet to happen?there is a very clear difference between being mindful of suspicious activity and blatant paranoia. Jacobsen's book clearly advocates one of those and it doesn't take much critical thinking to deduce its certainly not the first option.i'm shocked and appalled that fellow Americans could read this trash and take away any shred of beneficial information. The disgusting nature of this book is only matched by the ridiculous premise of her most recent. she must hate america, because clearly she thinks we are all idiots.ps. i'd like to add that this is only reinforced by the more ludicrous \\"history\\" she recently came out with about Area 51. she disregards facts and history to create a compelling story, something readers of 'terror in the skies' should be familiar with. the misfacts and blatant disregard to documented history in her area 51 tragedy are too numerous to name. these lies are being peddled as factual accounts, when really they should call a spade a spade. her books are fiction, intended to entertain and nothing more."},{"Title":"Terror in the Skies: Why 9/11 Could Happen Again","review":"Every American should read this book.Seven years after 9/11 not enough has been done to protect our airlines.Annie Jacoben's book should be a wake up call.

Since he was a citizen of Yugoslavia, and also actively involved to some extent in the political events of the early 1990s, Denitch generally discards with the customary cold, academic aloofness and feigned impartiality and tells the reader squarely where he stands on issues such as nationalism, the war in Yugoslavia, the events that led to the country's destruction, etc. This makes the text all the more interesting, as he offers very fascinating, if not sometimes controversial, views and insights into recent Yugoslav history and the ethic politics which hold sway in the Yugoslav successor states. His analysis of Yugoslavia's failure to progress into a pluralist democracy, despite being THE European socialist state most likely to do so in the late 1980s, is very interesting: he notes that the fatal flaw made by Tito and the ruling communists was to decentralize the country's decision-making processes rather than democratizing its political scene. His opinion of nationalism is, needless to say, very disparaging, and his intent in this book is to warn that ethnic nationalism and identity politics in today's world are an enemy to democracy everywhere, not just in the former Yugoslavia or the formerly communist Eastern Europe, but throughout the world, including the developed, allegedly rational and post-nationalist West. Regardless of what one thinks of Denitch's standpoint, this is definitely an important book to read for a better understanding of Yugoslavia's break-up and the problems that still plague the region today."},{"Title":"Buffy contre les vampires, tome 25 : La Tueuse perdue - Livre 1\\"Prophties\\" (French Edition)","review":"&quot;Prophecies,&quot; the first book in Christopher Golden's four-part &quot;The Lost Slayer&quot; serial novel, takes us back to the early days of season four, when Buffy the Vampire Slayer was trying to enjoy being a freshman at UC-Sunnydale and Willow was still dating Oz. Unlike the recently completed &quot;Unseen&quot; trilogy, this serial novel focuses primarily on the character of Buffy and avoids being caught in the limbo of writing about relationships that no longer exist on the television series. This is Buffy after Angel and before Riley, a young woman desperate to be more than just the Slayer and to carve out some semblance of a 'normal life. This is a Buffy who is on edge, accidentally backhanding Willow, repeatedly snapping at Giles, and finding freedom not in the classroom as she desires but only in letting lose the full violence of the Slayer in combat.But then two troubling things happen to up the ante. First, the shade of the deceased Slayer Lucy Hanover (first introduced in &quot;The Gatekeeper&quot; trilogy) appears in a dream and warns Buffy of a prophecy of impending danger that will somehow be caused by Buffy herself. Second, a new pack of vampires, with bats tattooed on their face and glowing orange eyes, and showing up in increasing numbers in Sunnydale. Of course, these two developments are related in the worst way possible. For most of the novel it seems pretty clear the title refers to Buffy as a Slayer who has lost sense of her true self. But then we come to the final chapter and a dramatic development that gives &quot;The Lost Slayer&quot; an entirely new and unforgetable meaning. This first book gets five stars because it achieves its highest goal, which is to make the reader desperate to read the next installment. Fortunately, I already have the next one at hand and I am going to start reading it as soon as I finish off this review.However, I do have one caveat: I do not think Camazotz would have two people occupying one cell, especially if the mirror was removed on day one. Then again, I certainly recognize how Golden did not want anything to get in the way of the gripping cliffhanger that ends Part One in this serial. Also, a minor complaint, which is not limited to Golden's novel alone, namely that Anya's constant talk about her sex life with Xander is becomingly really old, really fast."},{"Title":"These Were the Sioux","review":"Mari Sandoz, the daughter of German-Swiss parents, was born in 1896 on the Great Plains of Nebraska, and spent much of her young life amid the Sioux tribes there at that time. This book, which is only 118 pages long, briefly depicts much of what she learned first-hand of Sioux customs and rituals. She writes with great intimacy, love, and a depth of knowledge that few could match. Her prose sometimes meanders, and often gives the sense of being unstructured, without a coherent thread. This might bother some and not others. Admittedly, it bothered me at times, as I prefer my facts and history presented in a more cohesive context.

It was perhaps the first to bring the idea of continuing communication with a higher power to the attention of the general public. Until this book, the unquestioned assumption was that all such communication had ended in biblical times- and that anyone who claimed differently was obviously mentally unhinged. This book ,however, made a detailed, painstaking study (with personal interviews and case studies) of people in modern times who had experienced the same symptoms of revelation (the Divine Fire.) Steiger interviewed a wide variety of people from respected scholars and churchmen, to everyday housewives and business men, to \\"Jesus people\\" and New Age channellers.Then he examined the different types of contact and the different contents of the information recieved. He came to the conclusion that while some of the material seemed to come from conflicting sources, the vast majority appeared to be historically consistent in tone and content down through the ages- a universal theme coming from an outside intelligence.As the book points out early on, why should we think that the era of divine revelation is over? The eastern religious traditions have never made such an assumption. In the Vedic tradition the canon has never been \\"closed\\"- it is accepted that valid revelation continues to this day. Only the modern (as opposed to the gnostic) tradition has slammed the door shut in the face of God. And this seems to have been done more in the name of social control and the protection of a bureaucratic heirarchy than for any valid spiritual motivation."},{"Title":"Revelation the Divine Fire","review":"When I first flipped through some of the first few pages of this book, I wondered where Brad was going with it. Was he going to write a book about biblical prophecies and try and link them to past,present and future world events? Was he going to try and highlight modern-day prophets and show how even an \\"average joe\\" could predict the future...or was he just going to get some scientists together and make some logical sense out of prophecies, predictions and their fulfillment? Well...it turned out all of these were covered and thensome!Brad Steiger brings together so many experts, gifted people and \\"ordinary people\\" together to bring to light what it is that makes prophecies tick and how they have evolved over the centuries. From the holy prophecies of Elijah to the amazing insight of Nostradamus, prophecies are all around us and form the fabric of our society. Brad reminds us how fragile our world is, how important the gifted are and how we can no longer ignore them.If one message pervades throughout this fantastic book, then it would have to be this:BE FOREWARNED. The warnings and messages of hope alike have been coming our way for centuries and if we continue to ignore them, we may be ill-prepared when our time comes...and if Brad's book is a premonition itself...then it appears that we haven't learned our lesson yet."},{"Title":"Revelation the Divine Fire","review":"As a writer myself, I can only marvel at how well this book is constructed and reads as it presents a page-turner of spiritual experiences that are indeed timeless. From the opening to the closing, I could not but be in awe at the overall candidness, the clarity, and the comprehensive manner that Brad Steiger employed as he weaves these tales of truth-seekers into the Big Picture of Reality. More so, I consider this book to be the baseline for all of us that do research into the paranormal realms; it is the gold standard in fact. What a treasure chest to have in one's home library as it will remain in mine until the End Time and, perhaps, beyond! So do yourself a favor and buy this classic that has been reborn to be a collector's item today. It is truly a marvelous work and a wonder in and of itself from a literary standpoint, yet the content is also out of this world, literally!Dr. John Jay Harper is author of Tranceformers: Shamans of the 21st Century."},{"Title":"Revelation the Divine Fire","review":"With numerous stories and citations, the author discusses, often from a Christian standpoint, his belief that revelations continue to occur to common people around the world. He calls these revelations \\"Divine Fire--the transfer of thought, spirit, and power from an Infinite Intelligence to a finite, human intelligence.\\" Quotations and interviews of great variety support his position in a very readable format."},{"Title":"Revelation the Divine Fire","review":"It is about time this book came back into print and with such a marvellous cover too. Brad Steiger crafted a genius work with Revelation that explained such a lot for so many people. The work is truly inspirational and reveals the depth of the human psyche and the inner workings in such a way not seen since Carl Jung moved on. Every psychologist on the planet should read what Steiger has written in-order to better comprehend the more paranormal, paradoxical and sometimes pathological aspects of the human machine we call the brain - it does in fact have more to it than we all realize. Excellent work!"},{"Title":"Revelation the Divine Fire","review":"and recently reread it as I do every couple of years. There is a reason this book was first published 35 years ago and still is read around the world. Translated into multiple languages, this is the definitive tome on the subject."},{"Title":"Revelation the Divine Fire","review":"Brad Steiger is a super-prolific writer of books on the paranormal. According to his Wiki entry, he has authored or co-authored 162 books! Nothing wrong with that, per se. However, I suspect that Steiger sometimes sacrifices quality for quantity.\\"Revelation: The Divine Fire\\" was apparently first published in 1973. For some reason, this isn't mentioned in the 2006 edition. The book itself is a confusing, disjointed and badly edited smorgasbord of channelers, black magicians, UFO observations, astrology, the Jesus People, charismatics and very worried evangelicals. Steiger even quotes a paper by Clark Pinnock! (Yes, *that* Clark Pinnock).The messages from the alien entities are as trite as usual, and their names are downright silly: Sut-ko, Ox-Ho, Thrishna, Ishkomar, etc. At least Ishkomar was somewhat original. Apparently, the poor guy is really a kind of computer program loaded down into a machine by his alien colleagues, so he must have liked being able to speak through the mouth of a human. Ishkomar also reveals that there are still people onboard the space ships who carry out \\"menial tasks\\". I hope they have labour unions! Then there's Ted Owens, who claims to have gotten supernatural powers from the Space Intelligences, which he invariably uses to hex football players. Presumably, they don't like football in outer space. Or perhaps they are just bored doing menial tasks onboard the mother ship? Meanwhile, the Ambassadors of Yahweh eat fresh fruit, chant the name of Yehoshua and pray to \\"Our Father who art on Orion\\".Small wonder Steiger found Jane Roberts' Seth Material sophisticated!On some issues, at least, Steiger is more down-to-earth than the usual, starry-eyed writers of this particular genre. He admits that some contacts with the paranormal are \\"demonic\\" in character, mentioning a case of a young man in Virginia named Mark who was possessed by an evil spirit named Asmitor after experimenting with psychedelic drugs and black magic. Eventually, the young man committed suicide to get rid of the demon (or perhaps his own personal demons).Steiger also interviews a number of people who believe that one should \\"test the spirits\\" to see if their messages are genuine. This sounds trivial, but most contactees and mediums seem so gullible that virtually anything goes. Steiger's interviewees point out that the field is teeming with false prophecies, ego-tripped people who claim to be incarnations of Paul or the Virgin Mary, crazy cultists, etc. One of them feels that Aleister Crowley went downhill when he started channelling \\"Aiwass\\", and the same thing happened to Madame Blavatsky after her contact with \\"Koot Hoomi\\".Unfortunately, the last chapter of \\"Revelation\\" is less sober, with Steiger suggesting that the use of psychedelic drugs can get us in touch with the Divine Fire. He even quotes - guess who - Huston Smith on the subject.In the end, the author reveals his own belief in a Higher Being who can't be approached through organized priestcraft or dogmatic theology. We are entering a new phase of spiritual evolution, in which our consciousness will expand and turn us into highly evolved beings in communion with All That Is. In plain English, Brad Steiger is New Age and believes in the Age of Aquarius.I can't say I liked \\"Revelation\\". And no, I didn't read literally every word of it. But then, that's part of my point. The whole work feels more like Steiger's draft notes for a book, than the book itself. It gets tedious to read after a few chapters, unless you have a very extreme interest in the subject. The message was lost in revelation, so to speak. I'm not sure who might be interested in Steiger's opus. Perhaps people nostalgic for the Zeitgeist of the early 1970's? Or a certain kind of ethnographers? Contactees surely won't like it - it promotes all their competitors!I wonder what happened to poor Ishkomar. Was he ever freed from his computer and given shore leave on a better planet...?"},{"Title":"Revelation the Divine Fire","review":"Wow! The book began with such an interesting story, I read it is one sitting. After much research and study, Brad Steiger truly has become aware the spiritual gifts are alive and well in the world today. Many people across the world have staunchly stated that they have had revelations from the Lord or another \\"higher power\\". This book ranges from biblical quotes to UFO sightings but keeps consistency through out."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This review refers specifically to the Penguin Classics edition of LittleWomen, as pictured, with the introduction by Elaine Showalter. If you area fan of this piece, or would like to read it for the first time, I wouldhighly reccommend this edition. I would not, however, read theintroduction until after the text itself has been read, since, as a rule,intorductions usually give something away (often times even quoting fromthe book itself) &amp; this one is no exception. However, this edition offersa marvelous set of endnotes which help the reader to better understandsome unfamiliar terms.Most importantly, however, is the fact that Showalter has chosen topresent Alcott's novel, IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM. The chapters have beenrenumbered to maintain coherence, however, every word is true to theoriginal. It may not be known (as I did not know myself until I happenedupon this edition purely by accident) that there are two editions ofLittle Women currently in print. The second being altered slightly, asper a publisher's request (to remove certain slang and change somelanguage to what was considered more proper). This edition contains theORIGINAL text, as Alcott intended it, &amp; the majority of versions I haveseen contain the altered version, making the original wording very hardto find, indeed.I would definitely reccommend that anyone interested in this bookpurchase this edition, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"My mom bought me the book, Little Women, quite a few years ago. I'm a book worm and proud to admit it, but I didn't get around to reading this classic novel until a few weeks ago. I'm not sure why I put it off for so long, but I'm glad I didn't wait any longer. This a beautiful and rich tale that takes us to the past, where a whole different world awaits to be explored. Little Women is a must read!Little Women is the perfect story for the truly romantic person. Not just romance in the sense of love, but in the classical sense. Something being historical, timely, and good hearted. Little Women is full of the virtue and lessons that we try to find in our daily life. At the end, the reader is engulfed in happiness and satisfaction. Though not a deep, philosophical work, it provides its own morals, brought out in a way that can be enjoyed from generation to generation.The story centers around the lives of the 4 March sisters: Jo (Josephine), Meg (Margaret), Beth (Elizabeth), and Amy. Each sister possesses a unique personality with their mother as their link and loving companion. In the early part of this Louisa May Alcott novel, Mr. March is away at war and his daughters show concern for his welfare. It is said that Alcott didn't know what to do with the father's character so she wrote him as being gone to war. A genius solution to a literary block! Anyway, the story centers around the trials and tribulations of each girl and the family, as a whole. The family is poor, but still live to do good...or try to be good at least. Though it seems unrealistic that the family should be in bliss even in poverty, Alcott brings the fantasy level to ground level by portraying the girls as being a little selfish. With all the beautiful clothes and delicate manners, who could blame them for getting carried away with vanity. However, we also experience what lessons the girls have learned and appreciate their honesty. The family is not always going through pleasant situations, but take a share in heartache and loss, as every family does.In a time when modesty is not exactly a trend, Little Women sets a bar all on its own. It will warm your heart, even if you've already read the novel four hundred times. So, take some time out of your day to read the exhilarating trials of the \\"Little Women\\"."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I did not think that I would enjoy this book. After years of avoiding this paragon of femenine literature, I finally gave in and read it, and I'm glad that I did. This book is great. The author's use of language, the way that she writes is a pure pleasure to read. She also has her finger on the pulse of human character; I'm sure that is one reason this book is regarded as a classic. The characters experiences seem genuine and are truly touching. But for one glaring miss on the emotions of one character, I think the book is flawless and stands as a wonderful exposition on character and human relationships. I rate the book 4 and 1/2 stars, and would wholeheartedly recommend it to all the men out there that shy away from &quot;women's literature.&quot;"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Because of the reviews, I almost didn't read this book because I thought it must really be best suited for young teens.

Then my mom told me I should read this book because I was going to love it. And she was totally right. The good thing about this book is that it is real. I have to admit it: I fell in love with the real characters. This book shows that life can be great with love. Louisa transmits feelings, and reading this book you feel happiness, sadness, and lots of stuff. My mom told me that she even cried when she read the book. The characters will become your imaginary friends and I'm sure that, after reading this book, you will see life in another way. In a few words: I love this book and I'm sure you will love it too."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"\\"Little Women\\" is like the best vanilla ice cream-simple, sweet, pure, and something that always seems good, no matter what else you read (or eat!). As most of you know, \\"Little Women\\" is the chronicle of the four March sisters (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy) and their family, as they grow up in 1860's New England. Part autobiography, it is easy to see why it has become the classic it is.Sure, the \\"slang\\" is noticeably dated, the writing style is definitely \\"1800's\\", but the characters are what really makes this book great. Louisa May Alcott's chatty, graceful writing style is the epitome of warmth, and it definitely helps the characters to \\"come-alive.\\" Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy themselves are portrayed honestly, and the reader feels just like they are having a visit with the March as they read about Jo's highstrung good nature, Amy's hilarious \\"airs\\" and worries about her \\"un-Grecian\\" nose, Beth's good-as-gold sweetness, and Meg's gentle womanliness. The girls' struggles with poverty are gradually overcome throughout the book, and Marmee (as the girls call their mother) is a timeless beacon of love and lessons for the girls to take refuge in.\\"Little Women\\" is divided into two parts-I find the first to be (generally) slightly more well-written, and the second sometimes to be a little too long-winded and descriptive (the extensive descriptions and place names that chronicle Amy's European adventure are sometimes meaningless and boring to the reader). However, it is worth \\"plowing through\\" some less-than-choice chapters, for the end is pure gold, and the conclusion shows all of the sisters happy with their lives and reinforces the loving bonds of the March family.\\"Little Women\\" is truly a book that will make you laugh and cry. I would suggest that you be at least 12 before you read this alone (I usually don't give age ranges for books, but slight wordiness and some very involved passages are reason for it this time). Still, when confronted with the sheer warmth, honesty, and human emotion that come from the pages of \\"Little Women\\", it is easy to forgive some small faults."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I saw the movie first, but then I couldn't understand English(accent) as I do now.

You cry when their marmee have to go to their daddy, &amp; especially when Beth dies. You get angry when Amy burns Jo's precious dairy. And you will feel bad when Jo refuses Laurie and wish she hadnt done that. I still now wish Jo married Teddy. Meg is happy with John and I'm happy for her, also for Amy.

It was interesting, I'll give it that, but it didn't have the key things that a good piece of literature should have.It was set in New England and told the lives,sometimes dull lives, of the four March girls. Their hardships,sorrows, and happy times is what this book is all about. Desciption is really good in Little Women. When the girls' father goes to war, the girls and their mother wait for a lette, that would never come. Overall, 3 stars is all this book gets, nothing more nothing less.

I purchased this for my spouse as a gift and she adores it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott's LITTLE WOMEN is a classic novel about the four March daughters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, who live in New England at the time of the American Civil War. The book was originally published in two parts in 1868 and 1869; the first part concerns the girls while their father is away serving as a Union chaplain and the family is suffering financial hardship; the second half follows the girls as they marry, encounter tragedy and celebrate love. I recently read LITTLE WOMEN in the Sterling edition to my ten-year old daughter.The story holds up quite well 150 years after first publication. The first half is more accessible to pre-teen children. It isn't quite as reflective as the second half, which ponders more the trials of life. Understandably, the challenges of courtship and of married life aren't perhaps so compelling a topic for the pre-teen set. Moreover, the second part gravitates towards the melodramatic; it doesn't always ring true. The first half, on the other hand, engages the reader by deftly defining the attributes of each of the sisters: Meg, the responsible one; Beth, the sensitive one; Jo, the tom-boyish writer; and Amy, the girly-girl artist. The strong bonds between the girls are developed in the first half, and more just seems to happen, especially since their wealthy next-door neighbor Laurie, a friendly boy who is equal parts good hearted and playful, is an object of endless fascination to them. It's not surprising that children's adaptations focus more on the first half of the book.As one might expect, the novel does engage in moralizing. Each one of the children has to overcome defects in her character; Jo, for instance, is hot tempered. The lessons are just obvious enough to young readers, though they might be a little hackneyed for the modern adult reader. However that may be, one can be assured that the book promotes traditional family values. It is also refreshingly progressive--for a nineteenth-century novel--on the role of women in society; the daughters are not expected to set aside their personal goals for their husbands. Jo, for instance, tells her husband-to-be, \\"I have my duty also, and my work. I couldn't enjoy myself if I neglected them even for you...\\" (p. 509).The Sterling editions are well priced and nicely produced. They have decent bindings, generally good if spare illustrations (the illustrations in this volume are especially spare), and include a ribbon for marking one's place. These editions would make a nice addition to a child's library."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"i love this book every thing about it i don't think i would read it very fast but i read it in 4 days i couldn't put it down my favorite is Laurie he is so funny and sweet, and Jo is so sweet but tries not to act like it i could go on and on.

Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

I remembering hearing about it a little when I was younger and thinking it was fluffy boring stuff, but I love this book! It is now one of my favorites, right up there at the top with the Lord of the Rings trilogy and A Tale of Two Cities! Alcott's writing is not stiff or formal, but rather personable and believable. I fell in love with the March sisters and laughed at their idiosyncrasies and cried at their heartaches (I did!). There are even a couple parts in the book, relating to managing anger and nurturing marriage, that spoke deeply to me and have helped me in my personal life. Even the poetry \\"written\\" by the March sisters in different parts of the book are amazing.This is a must-read! It is also an easy read.

Beautiful book and beautifully written."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This story is about 4 sisters living in the mid 1800, somewhere near Washington, Philly, or NY. It chronicles their life from puberty to adulthood and is a warmhearted tale about love and loss. I found it funny, the customs of courtship especially and laughed out loud often.The story is driven by a very lively dialogue, making it a quick read. The Characters are well developed, but as a history buff, I missed the events of the outside world, war, prejudice, politics... Though it does tell of the morals, customs, and decorum of the times in detail.A great book for girls and women. It illustrates how much the roles of women have changed. Written by Alcott in the time in which she lived, and I believe that her Character Jo may have been modeled on her own experience as a woman and a author."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I love it so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much so that you have to get it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book went straight to my heart and I will never forget these life long lessons from these little women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I like this book alot.

All of the characters are fun to follow. The second group of stories are stronger than the first, but overall this is a great read."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Why I waited until I was middle-aged to start reading the classics, I'll never know, but I'm glad that I did. When I received my new Kindle Fire a few weeks ago, I downloaded some free books to test it out and among them was Little Women. I enjoyed the eloquent language and writing used. I had heard about this book many times over the years as a must-read chick-lit, but had never taken the time to do it. I even remember them talking about this book on an episode of Friends. Now I'm really glad that I've read it.The four Little Women are sisters in the March family, who has gone from fortune to working-class when their father became a preacher and went off to the War. At first, they regret losing their wonderful rich things and beautiful clothing, but through time and with their mother's coaching, they learn that money isn't as important as helping others and loving others.There are wonderful parts of the story that highlight each daughter's quest for marriage and grows into her own. Watching each girl grow up into mature women was like seeing your niece grow up, mature, and turn into a new person."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I've been reading on this book for some time; truth be told, I actually started reading this book about forty-five years ago! I set it down then, never realizing it would take this long to get back to it. Little Women is the story of four girls and their mom and dad during the Civil War. Their dad has gone off to minister to soldiers in the war and the girls and their mom are quite poor. Optimism is a key concept among the Marches, however, so you do not hear bellyaching or whining in this household. The girls find ways to entertain themselves with nary a Nintendo or tv. They continually renew their vow to keep a happy face and try harder to be good. Genuinely inspiring people in this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved this book. I found a lot of life lessons in it. I had such an easy time reading it on my Kindle, especially during my sleepless nights before having my baby."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa Alcott was born in the 1832 in a town called Germantown, Pennsylvania United States.Her father was a philosopher and teacher averse to any work activities.For this reason the family was forced to move in areas in and around Boston Massachusetts.In my opinion it is wrong to criticize him like an layabout mainly because he was surely against the labor exploitation and the alienation of the man - machine.The family was involved in an intense moral conviction, for instance they did not wear cotton, because it was produced by slave labor in the south of the United States.Reading this novel we will be conscious of the good teachings and the tension due to the Civil War.In my opinion this is a fundamental reading for young and adult readers, because they will learn the significance of poverty, the importance and rules of the family for the evolution of the society, and the collateral effect of the American Civil War on a family of four daughters.From the first paragraphs emerges their purity and social commitment when the girls decided to renounce of their Christmas' gift for buy a present to their mother and their commendable attitude in regard to the Hummels.The central character is Josephine March, in my opinion the author of this novel and the particular description of her childhood in a difficult context in a difficult time and her true love for a man and the culture.Before analyzing the most important phrases, I have to say that the good teaching of this novel is that as responsible citizens we must empower our children about their centrality for a proper development and maintaining of the society."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book was absolutely wonderful!! But the introduction was written in very bad taste. The insinuations were offensive and with out just cause!!Had I read the introduction before I purchased the book, I would have chosen another copy. I had purchased it and then read the introduction, so as I write, the pages have been cut out of this book. Louisa May Alcott did not deserve the insinuations from this person."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I had to read a novel for my high school English class. I picked &quot;Little Women&quot; because I had seen all the movies. I thought that I would be able to get through the book without concentrating, or wanting to...but was I wrong. Not only did I enjoy the book, but it was different from the movie which made it exciting to read. Meg- the mature one, Joe-the adventurous one, Beth-the fragile one, and Amy- the pampered one come together to prove how important love is. One would not expect that these four &quot;young women&quot; have the knowledge and intelligence to not only teach, but make an impact on the reader's life. But they do! Throughout the life of these girls, they suffer a great deal of hardships. Their father is at war, and their mother forced to leave for a great deal of time. These girls manage to take care of themselves and eachother, never forgetting the lessons their mother has taught them. Read the book. It is about 450 pages and it took me two weeks. (That is only because my English teacher made me keep a journal). The great thing about this book is that it did not spend 50 pages giving an introduction to the story. The first line is a quote- most of the novel is dialogue which also makes the reading easier. I recomend it. For school, or just recreational, &quot;Little Women&quot; by Louisa May Alcott is a book that every 11-18 year old girl should read."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read Little Women when I was a Little Woman. I just recently decided to buy it for my daughter and read it again. What a classic! This is a must for anyone's reading list both male and female. The story chronicles the March family, in particular one of the daughters, Josephine March. It is a story of hope and love. This is not a love story of romance, but one of tender, unconditional love that exists in a family of a mother, father and four very different daughters. There are moral lessons throughout the book that are refreshing and the character of all the girls comes through vividly. Alcott does a wonderful job devloping the different personalities of her characters. There are lessons for young people written between the lines on strength, wisdom, love, patience and quiet service. Boys and girls alike will benefit from the examples of polished and refined manners. A beautifully wirtten story that well deserves the label of a Classic.Just a note about this particular copy--We like to buy classics that are nicely bound and not cheap looking. I was a little hesitant to buy this online. I was pleasantly surprised when it came in the mail. It is nicely bound. The cover is hardcover cloth. The pages are not great quality but are sturdy and seem \\"old fashioned\\". It was a great value for the money and as well, looks good on the shelf. I am expecting it to hold up to lots of readings!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I love the novel and have been given several copies over the years, but I actually bought this edition. I love the Barnes and Noble classics series! The text is highly readable and easy on the eyes (while maintaining elegance), and the covers are well bound and lovely for a paperback. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is one of my favorite books of all time! In this heartwarming story about four sisters growing up during the Civil War, I have learned so much about the world around me, and ironically, myself. It tells of how people can choose to live their lives and how happiness can be found even through hardships.The Marches are a picture of a happy home - with brave and moral Father, who has gone into the army to do what he can for the North's cause, and kind, caring Marmee, who watches over her girls with gentleness and love. Then, there's the little women: sixteen-year-old Meg, who's pretty and mature; rough-and-tumble Jo, determined to become a famous writer; timid Beth, always putting others before herself; and spoiled Amy with her artistic talents. There's also their amiable neighbor, Theodre Laurence (Laurie). Join in on the fun and read all about Amy's trouble at school, Jo's precious book being burned, Meg going to &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; Beth's tragedy, and so much more! I highly recommend this book for guys and girls of all ages! No one can resist this incredible story!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The story of four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy is one that will forever be a part of American liteary culture. Set in the mid-1800s in a small New England town, Louisa May Alcott invites the reader into the home of these four sisters as they deal with the struggles of having a father off fighting in the Civil War, having to mature and grow up supporting themselves with little jobs here and there and finding out about the joys of love, children, and the sadness of death. This coming of age novel follows Jo mainly as she is faced with the day to day choices that will help her sisters and mother make it through the harsh New England winters. My nana gave this book to me and I hope to continue on the tradtion of passing this book on. It's a wonderful book to be shared by mothers and daughter and granddaughters alike since it shows the true spirit of women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women focuses on the four March girls; Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, as they grow up from childhood to adulthood. The characters in the book try to teach each other helpful lessons about life, virtue, and morality. The novel is a real eye opener for everyone. Each of the mistakes the girls in the novel make are intended to provide some guidance for the reader. Society is explained, the harsh winters are described, and the profound work ethic of the people is described to also give the reader a strong sense of what life was like during the nineteenth century. I can strongly relate to all the character's feelings which are strongly depicted in Alcott's writing. I firmly believe all teenage girls should read the novel to hopefully be as strongly influenced as I was. The girls are constantly troubled by the necessity of being good, even when they feel the desire to be bad. There are also many issues on relationships between girls and boys. Friendship turns into love and vice versa, making a strong theme out of gender relations. The girls also struggle with the ideas of motherhood, sisterhood, pride, education, and marriage. After reading this novel, the reader will hopefully look more at their own life and his/her morales. Through the novel there is clear representation of the benefits of what good does."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Buy this book now because in a year or two you'll want to read it again -- no matter what your age.I think I read Little Women first as a preteen. I identified strongly, probably like most girls, with the protagonist Jo, a tomboy who struggles to find her place in society. But as the years have worn on, I have found myself returning again and again to this enthralling story. The book has an emotional impact unlike any other I have encountered.The girls' antics will make you laugh; alternately, the book features two of the saddest scenes you will ever read. If you want to become engrossed in another world, affected profoundly not just by the fictional girls but by the knowledge that this book is semi-autobiographical for Louisa May Alcott, read it. Little Women is wholesome but not boring; classic but not hard to read; better than all of the Little Women movies combined. At the heart of the book is pure love and goodness -- what we all long for in life."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I give this a one-star only for the introduction. The book \\"Little Women\\" itself is a wonderful and lovely classic. However, this Barnes and Noble edition with the introduction by Camille Cauti is what I have decided to rate and I give it a one-star rating. If you are wishing to read a 21st century review of a 19th century book and desire to bring into the story links to homosexuality and questioning the sexual orientation of the author, Louisa May Alcott, then by all means, buy this edition and read the introduction by Camille Cauti. I bought this book to give to my 12yo daughter not realizing the introduction would be discussing this topic ...I thought the edition a beautiful copy...cover picture, etc. It wasn't until later that I read the introduction. Altho. I did not buy this from Amazon(I bought it at our local Barnes and Noble store), I offer this review of this particular edition to provide others with awareness of the introduciton by Camille Cauti and her unfortunate 21st century analysis. If you wish to have this sort of analysis of this book in your personal home library, then so be it...buy this edition. If you, like me, wish to have a copy of a classic and lovely story of Little Women without the 21st century analysis, then do not buy this edition. Just a heads up for anyone considering this Barnes and Noble edition."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This may sound ridiculous, but I was bound and determined to hate this novel. I had managed to avoid it all my life, but was recently assigned the text in a graduate class on the \\"Study of the Novel.\\" I consider myself a feminist, and a somewhat cynical one at that, and was sure this was going to be too \\"Pollyanna\\" for my literary tastes. I stand corrected!I absolutely fell in love with Jo's tomboyish headstrong character and furthermore, I must confess that next to Dolores Price (from Wally Lamb's \\"She's Come Undone) and David Copperfield (Dickens' own), Laurie has become one of my all-time favorite literary characters.There are a lot of overly religious maxims being spewed forth in the first half of the book, but it was not enough to detract from my overall enjoyment. And while the book is \\"light hearted\\" in many respects, there are many serious topics worthy of graduate level discussion, such as the suppression of feminine anger and utilization and importance of self control, inner versus outer appearances, Victorian expectations of behaviors across classes and genders, and the cause and effect of the absence of the \\"father\\" for the sisters, as well as Laurie.My overall literary experience has been greatly enriched by having read this book and I recommend it to all who have not yet had the pleasure of reading it. Of course, I especially recommend it to those skeptics out there, like me, who think they already have the whole thing pegged for \\"fluff\\" :)Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" is, without question, an American masterpiece and deserves to be on the shelves with the \\"Huck Finn\\"s and \\"Great Gatsby\\"s."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I purchased a copy of this book strictly based on the graphics of the cover. I was truly disappointed when I received the book of LITTLE WOMEN with an entirely different graphic for a cover, no way resembling the cover shown."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I agree with the reviewer below me 100%. This cover is disgusting. I was hoping to find a lovely copy of this book for my sister as a gift because she loved the copy I purchased for myself a while back. Mine is from Borders classics but unfortunately I don't think they are making the same copy anymore. It is a beautiful hardcover, fabric covered, bright red with gold embossing and nice victorian female silhouettes. I was hoping to find her something comparable. I don't know why they decided to make beautiful fabric versions of other classics such as Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre which i have purchased and love, but to release this horrible version of Little Women. I truly wish they had made it along the lines of the faric covered hard cover classics. I guess this was an attemt of modernizing a book which doesn't need to be modernized in order to be loved, that is what makes it a classic after all. What a shame."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A bit repetitious in the character morality lessons but that's just from my adult perspective.For Kindle Users:Recommendation - if want a fabulous fully illustration version, mobileread has it.

Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

I was quite disappointed compared with other audiobooks that I have listened to."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Set during the Civil War, \\"Little Women\\" is the story of the four March sisters. Meg, the oldest, is sixteen and very much into being a \\"young lady\\". Jo, fifteen, is the exact opposite of Meg, a tomboy who hates everything girlish. Beth, thirteen, is a homebody, always cheerful and looking at the bright side of things. Amy, the youngest, is loving but a bit selfish and shallow. The March's don't have much money, but they are rich in love and that love carries them throughout the course of \\"Little Women\\" which takes place over a span of ten years. The March's have many adventures as they grow up, several of them with their next door neighbor, Teddy Laurence. There is joy and sorrow in their lives, but the love they have for each other carries them through everything.\\"Little Women\\" is old fashioned, sentimental but not too sentimental, and a wonderful book to read. The book is partially autobiographical, based on Louisa May Alcott's own sisters and the love she had for them is evident throughout the book. There are heartbreaking parts which make me cry each and every time I read \\"Little Women\\", yet there are heartwarming and comical moments that make me smile every time I read it. The four March sisters are very realistic, even Beth, who is almost too good to be true. Alcott was an imaginative writer who could make inanimate objects, such as roses, seem alive. \\"Little Women\\" was originally written in two parts and Alcott's style changes a bit in the second part, as she addresses the reader directly and at times delivers little \\"sermons\\" to her readers.\\"Little Women\\" is a delightful book for readers young and old."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I love to read and have begun reading many classics. My teacher recommended \\"Little Women\\" for me to read. So, I went off and bought it at the bookstore. In this edition you read an introductin first which I thought was a bit boring and long. It tells about the back round of the author and how this book was made. This story is broken up into two parts. The story starts out with four girls- Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Their father is away at war. The first part of the story was too drawn out I thought. There is a description for everything. I did however enjoy reading it. The second part had a lot of action. There are weddings and births, and sadly even a death. It was more paced then the first part. I think Jo had the best character. She was so realistic. All in all, I thought this story was pretty good and I am not disappointed in it. I am very happy I read it. I know it is a classic and I do understand why."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This particular hardcover book is an abridged version of the books Little Women/Good Wives, (The movie is actually the two books filmed in one). The text is sort of a mixture between what happens in the actual books, and what happens in the movie, a happy medium.It is all in colour and has beautiful big colour picture stills from the movie. Some being of the four girls together and individually, Marmee, Lauries proposal, Jo and the Professor, Amy and Laurie. A good read for a younger person who doesnt want to go through the two books, but even better for a fan of the movie.FYI- If you are interested in one that doesnt have a dustjacket from Amazon, it's exactly the same underneath so you don't have a blank cover, still the big glossy picture and text."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"As much as I enjoyed this book when I was a girl, I still enjoy it now. It's a wonderfully warm tale of family love. There is tragedy, but from that tragedy comes hope. Real family values are taught by this book. It is a story about four sisters and their mother. Life deals them a series of blows, and the story is how each of these remarkable women persevered, and how they actually got the better of life. Miss Alcott has a real knack for characterization, and each of her characters in this story are so very real. If you've read this book before, but not for awhile, I strongly suggest that you take it up again. There are unlimited surprises in store, not the least of which is how much you'll enjoy reading this book again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Having read Little Men as a child, it was nice to go back and learn the stories of Jo's childhood. She is the sister that I related to the most & I loved getting to know her."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a wonderful book and romantic and filled with suspense.Engagingly vivid and merry and shows that these little women are not so small after all."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I remember seeing this book on my Grandmom's book shelf since I was old enough to read the titles. Yet all my life I just passed it by. I saw the '90s movie and read Little Vampire Women, but still did not pick up the book. Finally I decided to download it. I cannot believe I never read it before. It was such a great book. You feel for each of the girls and find a little of yourself in one or all of them. This is one of those books I could see myself reading again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The Whole Story edition of Little Women is Louisa May Alcott's unrevised, original publication from 1968. She later revised some of Jo's colorful language and use of slang as well as altered the appearance of Laurie and Marmie in order to appease the disgruntled \\"contemporary\\" public (who apparently didn't approve of foreign-looking men or stout women). In 1880, she published an edited version along with the Part 2 (Little Wives) that is included in most modern Little Women books. So, actually, The Whole Story uses the absolute original story. It has wonderful information on the era sprinkled throughout and a plethora of photographs and illustrations which is the hallmark of the Whole Story unabridged editions of classics. While I do wish The Whole Story series would release Little Wives (separately)...this version is definitely worth buying in conjunction with an ordinary unabridged book that includes the Part 2. That's what I did. I treasure all of the Whole Story series books...they're absolutely phenomenal -- if you're lucky enough to find them.I do think that Amazon should reorganize their lumping together of reviews for classics spanning various editions. It looks like they're trying, but it is still somewhat confusing. The way it's advertised, they claim to have The Whole Story Little Women on Kindle...which is not true."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved this book but after reading it I didn't realize it had two parts ( Good Wives is the second) and bought the second book.

I read it multiple times, and even held my own version of their Pilgrim's Progress roleplay. I hadn't read it for years, but when I got my Kindle for Christmas and saw this free version, I had to download it. The book is still as wonderful as I remembered (and some part of me still pulls for Jo and Laurie to get together, though I love Professor Bhaer, too). It's a gentle, quiet book filled with profound wisdom and loving relationships between family members. The path of growing up is never easy, but this book shows how for many, faith and family can be the underpinnings for a bright future."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"\\"Little Women\\" is so well written and accessible. I had only seen the movie before reading the book, and as with most all stories, the book is by far better. I felt as if I were a silent member of the March family.

I feel challenged to hold my tongue and have patience and to show kindness.

It wasn't until many years later that I noticed the words: \\"modern abridged edition\\" on the cover, and realized on comparison with the full text that my version had been all but chopped to pieces. No wonder I didn't understand anything!So it was a little odd settling down with the proper version of Lousia May Alcott's most famous book, knowing the basic structure of the story, but now having the chance to read it in its entirety. Ironically, Alcott wrote \\"Little Women\\" solely at her publisher's request for \\"a book for girls\\", with Alcott herself writing for purely monetary reasons and with no expectations whatsoever at to how popular it would become. Basing the March family on the Alcotts and her own experiences, Alcott's novel sold two thousand copies (the entire print run) in just one month. Requests for a sequel were inevitable, and so \\"Good Wives\\" was written, a story that is usually combined with \\"Little Women\\" in most copies available today.Quite episodic in nature, the story itself is rather straightforward, concerning four sisters dealing with the family's poverty and their own adolescence whilst their father is fighting in the Civil War. Ultimately the story, not counting the two later sequelsLittle MenandJo's Boys, covers a twenty year span, as Jo (the unofficial protagonist) grows from a fifteen year old to a thirty-five year old. The four girls are more or less counterparts of Alcott and her own sisters, and the author presents four distinct personalities to the reader: Meg, the motherly eldest, who struggles the most with poverty; Jo the tomboyish book-lover (an almost autobiographical portrayal of Alcott herself) who harbors ambitions of becoming a writer; Beth, the angelic and shy homebody; and Amy, the youngest: spoilt, pretty, and artistic.Alongside the girls are a range of supporting characters, including their mother (called \\"Marmee\\" by the girls; a name that is often pronounced phonetically, though in keeping with the New England accents of the time, it would have been pronounced \\"Mommy\\"), the housekeeper Hannah, sharp-tongued Aunt March, and a range of possible suitors for the girls, including their next door neighbor, the mischievous Laurie.It is the relationship between the sisters as well as their bonds with parents, friends and lovers that is the true heart of the book, and it is Alcott's ability to write with realism, wit, and understanding that made \\"Little Women\\" so distinctive, particularly for its time. That Jo was not an idealized heroine, but quite literally the girl next door; and that the girls did not deal with melodramatic adventures, but rather the day-to-day trials of ordinary life, was quite an innovation in the mid 19th century. When the story opens just before Christmas, each of the girls receives a present of John Bunyan'sPilgrim's Progress, a story that is often alluded as the girls learn to master themselves through facing the various obstacles in life.Each girl has their flaws as well as their virtues, and each struggle with their foibles as they grow: Jo's literary ambition, Meg's experiences with the ups and downs of marriage and motherhood, Beth's struggle with her failing health, and Amy's growing maturity and attempts to overcome her desire for marry for money. Though in many ways Amy is the only one who doesn't seem to grow as much as the other girls; that is we are *told* of a change, but do not *see* it in a particularly vivid way. By the end of the story, she seems a little too perfect, and the fact that she ends up marrying a very wealthy man doesn't do much for the \\"marry for love, not money\\" tract.On the one hand, it is rewarding to see the girls overcome their faults and become wiser, more contented young women, yet at the same time, it is their flaws that make them such loveable characters in the first place. At the end of part one, in which Mr March looks at Jo and says: \\"I see a young lady who pins her collar straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang, nor lies on the rug as she used to do,\\" one can't help but be slightly disappointed at the change.Another bad side-effect is the fact that Alcott can often slip into sentimentality and moralizing (something she apologizes for a couple of times in the text itself: \\"I dare say my reader has fallen asleep during this little homily\\"). Being written as a \\"girl's book\\", which were naturally meant to extol womanly virtues, it's only expected that some sermonizing would be present. But often they're completely unnecessary, particularly in the earliest chapters in which the girls learn a valuable lesson, only for Marmee to reiterate what's obviously just been learnt. Though the sincerity of the girls is inspirational, the preaching gets on one's nerves.As strange as it may seem by today's standards, \\"Little Women\\" was considered a revolutionary novel in regards to the feminist movement of the age. In a time when women were still expected to be subservient and obedient, Alcott created female characters that were not wilting flowers nor passive damsels in distress, but realistic women who were each deeply flawed in their own way, with their own dreams, goals and ambitions. Likewise, although the girls eventually marry, Alcott is careful to give them husbands that are complimentary to their natures, and with whom the girls often have disagreements with (some of the best and funniest chapters involve the tiffs between Meg and her husband John). In this case, marriage does not come at the end of the story, but the middle, and there is no such thing as a \\"perfect happy ending\\" - only life in all its joys and disappointments.Of course, despite all this, there may still be some dissonance between the book's values and a contemporary audience. Meg is ultimately expected to be a good little housekeeper, and any discord in the household is naturally placed on her shoulders. Despite her ambition to become a writer (and the hope that she'll one day write a famous novel, which she eventually does in \\"Jo's Boys\\"), Jo ends this particular tale as the mistress of a boy's school, married to a much older man. Amy goes to Europe with the desire to become a famous artist, but on being confronted with the splendors of Rome, realizes that she's aiming too high and instead choosing to focus on helping other people realize their goals (though to be fair, Laurie comes to the same conclusion in regards to his music). In all cases, romantic love trumps ambition, and though there's certainly nothing wrong or invaluable about being a loving wife and mother, they are deemed incompatible with having a career; something that may not sit well with today's \\"have it all\\" readers.There are certainly some mixed messages at work in the book, perhaps born out of Alcott's own uncertainty over the issue. A feminist herself, Alcott remained a self-described \\"literary spinster\\" throughout her life, but although she tells us that for Jo: \\"To be independent, and earn the praise of those she loved, were the dearest wishes of her heart,\\" she also has Marmee, that font of wisdom, tell us that: \\"To be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman.\\" Yet it is in these seeming contradictions between the freedom of a career and the warmth of a family, (as well as the rewards to be found in both of them) that the interest in \\"Little Women\\" lies.But possibly the one aspect of the book that sparks the most debate is the relationship between Laurie and Jo. Throughout the course of \\"Little Women\\" the two best friends seem destined for one another, sharing the same interests and fun-loving spirits...but as it turned out, Alcott had other plans for them. After the immense popularity of \\"Little Women\\" Alcott was inundated with letters from young readers who requested a sequel, simply because they wanted to see Jo and Laurie get married. Alcott was disappointed with what we call \\"shipping\\" today, but which Alcott herself termed \\"lovering\\", writing in her journal:\\"I don't like sequels, but publishers are very perverse and won't let authors have their way, so my little women must grow up and be married off in a very stupid style.\\" In a letter to her friend, she expressed her frustration with the mindset of her readers, all of whom were simply interested in: \\"who the little women marry, as if that was the only end and aim in a woman's life.\\" She went on to say: \\"I won't marry Jo to Laurie to please anyone...Jo should have remained a literary spinster, but so many enthusiastic young ladies wrote to me clamorously demanding that she should marry Laurie, or somebody, that I didn't dare refuse and out of perversity went and made a funny match for her. I expect vials of wrath to be poured upon my head, but rather enjoy the prospect.\\"So if you were upset at the fact that Laurie and Jo didn't end up together, then you can blame the scores of female fan \\"shippers\\" of the early 19th century, who wrote in so many letters to Alcott asking when the two of them would marry that she eventually wrote something else out of spite. Later in \\"Jo's Boys\\", the character of Nan plays out Alcott's original plans for Jo: as a female character who has no interest in marriage, but rather forges out a successful career and happy, independent life for herself.The popularity and endurance of \\"Little Women\\" speaks for itself. Although the title may naturally imply that it is only for girls, Alcott has some very astute things to say about gender relationships, and male readers may discover a thing or two about the opposite sex (boys, have you ever wondered what girls get up to behind closed doors? This may be set over one hundred years ago, but the essentials haven't changed). In any case, Alcott's general wit and warmth makes this a book that is accessible to a wide range of readers - it would be a shame for the title to prejudice readers against it when there's so much to be learnt and enjoyed from it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Every Christmas, I enjoy watching various versions of \\"Little Women\\" on video. My favorite is the latest one starring Susan Sarandon, Winona Ryder, and Christian Bale . . . lovely, true to the spirit of the original work, and the scene depicting the death of Beth (played to perfection by Claire Danes) breaks my heart, no matter how many times I see it. AS FOR THE BOOK . . . it is dated and preachy and quaint for the modern reader, no doubt; still, it is easy to see why the work has endured through the years. All the universal themes of family togetherness (and the pain of separation), self-sacrifice, faith, joy, love, and hope in times of war and deprivation and hardship (what family today with a loved one in a war zone could not relate to the March family of 1861?) -- we recognize ourselves in the book despite the Victorian mannerisms and concerns, and the sometimes stiff dialogue Alcott produced. I know I read it years ago, but I've forgotten so much detail (or perhaps the movies have dulled my recollection of the book, which is quite likely) that it seems almost a first reading. Free on Kindle -- so Kindle readers, download and enjoy this enduring American classic.

When Beth died, tears poured down my mother's face and into the stew. Even though I am 62 now, I still remember how Jo gave me the desire to be a writer with a passion that still burns today.

If you are looking for a perfect gift for a daughter or sister this rich story of the relationships between these young women is without a doubt a solid choice. It's also a winner if you are just looking for a great story to fall in love with and enjoy for years to come, this is a rare gem that will be more than worth the price.

Illustrating their bravery and spirit, coming of age, romances and tragedies, I remember happily losing myself in their story, but now find the language so ponderous that it is impossible to re-read.

What a disappointment. I couldn't even read the whole thing. I only read the first 176 pages out of 470, so if the last half is better than the first half, I wouldn't know. Thank you to other reviewers for giving me the major plot points. I skimmed a few of those and that was enough for me. I didn't want to spend any more of my time reading what I felt was a boring book. I liked three characters, Jo, Laurie and Beth, but again not enough to want to read the rest of the book. It was too syrupy sweet with the mother teaching her girls values such as helping those less fortunate than yourself, control your temper, work hard, be polite etc. These are nice values, and this might be more desirable for a parent to read to young daughters. Although be aware that there are a couple of deaths of main characters. For me, this book was not good enough. I want entertainment, creativity, surprise, unexpected events and interesting characters. I prefer books like Twilight and Harry Potter for young adults and myself.Data:There is no sexual content which makes it appropriate for children. Setting: 1860s the North during the civil war.

I can understand the many accolades the book has gotten from various writers (the afterward of the one I was reading, for example, was penned by Susan Straight) about the depiction of women, especially young women, as groundbreaking for its time. All well and good, but I couldn't get past the aggressive bucolic nature of the thing, which makes the Beany Malone novels seem as if they were written by Huysmans or Lautreamont (or Sartre or any other nihilist/existentialist you'd care to name). I have often wondered if there were a particular novel Melville were parodying in the hilarious opening pages of Pierre; it is obviously not Little Women, published some twenty-eight years after Pierre, but I can see where Melville was coming from anyway. (This was actually an accepted literary style of the time? How depressing.)You may ask what in the world I'm going on about (though I assume if you're a fan of the book you have an idea of what the word \\"bucolic\\" means without me having to explain it to you). It's this--no one in this book ever thinks a truly bad thought. No one could ever even consider doing a bad deed. These characters are squeaky clean. Have you ever, in your entire life, encountered a household with four female children (especially four female children being raised by two females, since dad's off to war) where there was no bickering? Ever? Where every small, unintentional slight was worked out by calm, rational debate? No. Of course not. Why? Because that household does not exist. It did not exist in 1880, and it does not exist in 2009. There are obviously those who can relegate that to the backs of their minds; I found it impossible.

They were each special in their own way, and love each other even more because of it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is my all time favourite book.It is the heartwarming story of a family during the American Civil War.It describes the joys &amp; sorrows of four girls belonging to the March family &amp; follows their journey through life.As a child it was their personal stories that fascinated me, but as an adult I appreciate the authentic potrayal of the turbulent times that were the American Civil War."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I recommend this book, Little Women for not only child but adult. This is a very heart-warming story. It is a story about 4 sisters - Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy during the Civil War. Through many experiences such as dreams, illnesses, quarrales and so on, all sisters get to go from girls to women. My favorite character is Jo. Though she was a very tomboy and quarraied with Amy so often, she ran through her dream to be a writer. I admired her intent mind. Also she had a kind heart to think about others even though sacrificd herself. Mr. March became ill during he went to the war. However Mrs. March didn^t have enough money. Then Jo cut her long beautiful hair and sold it to make money for her father. It was very hard thing for Jo but she sacrificd herself. What I was most moved i 4 sisters^ strong cooparation.

I was very skeptical going into it believing that this was more a book for little women than for big men. I have to admit that it was difficult for me. Their wasn't so much an enticing storyline, but rather a drawn out description and character development of the March sisters and their \\"march\\" into adulthood during the 19th century circa Civil War era. Little is really mentioned about the Civil War except noted that Mr. March served as a chaplain in it. What I did enjoy was the manner of which the March sister's exemplified an era where women prided themselves on fine etiquette, moral behavior, respect of family, the development of culture, and the role of keeper's of the home and hearth. The sister's were quite saintly, but not in a prudish way, but rather in an innocent and genuine way that is often lost in today's culture. I think that most young women today would find this book laborious, but I think it carries lessons that would be valuable to them. By the end of the book I was quite enamoured by the characters and longed for the past where character, poise, grace, and charm were sought after by young women, and young men."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Don't get me wrong. While I'm the type that shrieks and covers my eyes when watching something like \\"Spiderman II\\" at a kissing part (or at a violent part, for that matter...) I don't mind books about marriage. And so the first part, Little Women book I, was a perfect portrait of a family. A good book, despite the heavy prejudice I carried against it, as it was (gasp) A Required Reading Book.The Part II, Good Wives, was -- er....interesting. Let's go through it, marriage by marriage.Meg's marriage. Cute. Same age, good match, and even I, who have decided that my marriage to ANYONE (or dating, for that matter) would be a sign of the Apocolypse, could understand why some less fortunate souls devote their life to another, staying with that person forever (well, not in the twenty-first century they don't - unfortunately). Meg and John Brooke was good. Nice. Sweet. You get it. Now let's move on.Laurie (Theodore's his real name, for all you thinking that to name a male child Laurie is about the greatest measure of torture you can inflict upon a boy) and Amy. Still okay, though -- and I speak for my entire class here -- LAURIE AND JO SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN MARRIED!!!!Jo and Mr. Bhaer. Gag. Vomit. WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS THIS AUTHOR THINKING??!!

In the case of Little Woman, there are pictures of fashion, carriages, sample segments of newspaper, information on Pilgrim's Progress (a play put on by the girls), etc. Sometimes it made a section of the text more clear; other times it just added color to the story. A very worthy choice for your library."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is not an exciting book. But it gives a lot of insight about life, such as a positive attitude, selflessness, kindness and honor. It's got a lot of values and morals. Mostly this is a pleasant book, with short bits in between that are slightly boring. I usually finish novels in 2 or 3 days, but this took me about 2 weeks to finish, seeing as it's not that exciting.

This novel produces feelings so strong and sure. I bought this edition at BN for the full retail price. It's a beautiful linen cover and, unfortunately, I GOT A LITTLE NAIL POLISH ON ONE OF THE PAGES! Sorry, I had to vent. Anyway, I'm not sure why some people rate this as one star.

I've seen all the movie adaptations and also loved them (especially the Susan Sarandon, Winona Rider version, although K. Hepburn was a \\"capital\\" Jo!) I occasionally had a bit of a giggle about some of the sentimentality, the over-the-top language, (especially Amy's) and the dated mannerisms (so glad I didn't live back then ~ I'd be a social outcast!)

The book is about the life of a small American family that is facing hardships and trials during the Civil War. It deals with holding on when things around you are failing and time is so precious. I recommend this book, and its sequels, to any person that likes fun, adventurous, and love stories that have to deal with the love of your friends family.Jo, Amy, Meg, and Beth are four sisters that care for each other very much. They are all very optimistic, and that helps them to stand their teenage years without their father and through many other hardships. They have a mother that loves them, Laurie a good friend, and Mr. Laurence a kind old man, to take care of them. All of the characters are very well rounded and have strong family ties within the book. Jo is wild and outgoing; she wants freedom but also respect. Beth is shy and very musical. Amy is only interested in pretty things in the beginning but soon grows up. Meg is friendly and tries to be helpful.The girls are all very upset when their father goes to fight in the war. They do their tasks willfully, but they begin to dwadle. Days become long and hard for the girls until Jo gets up the courage to ask Laurie if he would like to play. They all soon become good friends. However, being in the time that are, things go to terribly wrong . . .Little Woman is a wonderful book. I believe that everone should take some time to read it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women captures the heart of four young girls as they deal with a changing world, growing up, and the harsh realities of the Civil War. Set in New England, the story captures the essence of sisterhood and finding things to occupy the time in days when there was little money or entertainment provided.Written by Louisa May Alcott, the story retells the childhood of Alcott and the ways that strong family values helped hold the family together during tough times. The story tells of how the family followed the transcendentalist theories which emphasized always perfecting oneself.

I have read and reread this story about 25 times and every time I find it as delightful as before and I am always finding new parts that I either missed or forgotten before.

It does not necessarily teach you lessons on how to live, but from reading the book you learn alot. I enjoyed this book so much. It taught me about family, love, sacrifices, hardships, and alot more.When Beth goes and visits the Hummel family and gets Scarlett Fever from the baby, you sense alot of feelings from everyone. That was a very intense part for me. Also when the Dad gets sick, and the Mom leaves that is another intense part. Alot of things happen that make you feel like you do not know what is going to happen.Then the sister's start to grow up and fall in love. You get to know them so much throughout this book. When they feel something like when Jo thinks Beth loves Laurie, the guy Jo met and become friends with, and then goes away and lets Beth have him. That hurts to know how she is feeling. But when Jo meets Professor Bhaer and starts to fall in love with him you get very excited.I was did not specifically like how the book ended becuase I wanted something else to happen that did not.

Though it is long I read it pretty quickly and enjoyed it immensely. After reading this wonderful book I became inpired to finish the trilogy about Jo and her family/life, and to read more of Alcott's work. right now I am reading An Old-Fashioned Girl which I am enjoying, but isn;t as good as Little Women, Alcott's masterpiece. this book is perfectly balanced because there are joyous moments, though sad things occur. This fictionalized story about Louisa may Alcott as a teenager is written well. I would reccomend it to any girl between the ages of 9 and 12! I will defenitely read this book again, to rediscover the timeless tale of four wonderful sisters.-S.L.B."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I think Little Women is a wonderful book. It is about four sisters who live with their mother, \\"Marmee\\". Their father is working in the Civil War. I think it was very interesting because Miss Alcott makes it full of surprises.

Im a very picky reader and I can not read a book with boring spots, but i can assure you this book was good. I found no boring spots.

It teaches good moral values."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women by Louisa May Alcott should be read by middle schoolers because it shows great moral values. For example they respected thier mother greatly.Also when in need they helped one another. Jo sold her beautiful long locks of hair for a train ticket so her mother could visit her wounded father. Another example of maturity was when Beth knew she was dying she handled it in an adult way. The young ladies in Little Women should be called Not so Little Women because they &quot;came of age&quot; in this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book Little Women is truley a literature classic. This book reflects on the lives of the fictional March family as Yankees during the Civil War. While Mr. March is away fighting in the war, Mrs. March and her four daughters Margaret, 16, Josephine, 15, Elizabeth, 13, and Amy, 12 (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy)must learn to cope while their nation is at war.

The girls have many adventures and meet Laurie, a true friend for life,and share many good times together. The girls begin to marry when they face the loss of one of their sisters and their aunt. However, in true March fashion, they get through the difficult times and focus on the successes in life. This book is truley inspirational and makes you think about how you can become a better person through sharing the experiences of these girls. At times this book could run on, so that is why i rated it 4 stars, not 5. However, this book still is great and a timeless classic and Louisa May Alcott did a fine job with the book. I enjoyed the book alot."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When I was a little girl, I didn't read very much, so I read this book the first time as a teenager.

The movies don't do it justice."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a one beautiful book to read ,the beauty of the book is that it has so many central charecters and each one holds his and her grounds completely.Amy is a wonderful girl ,who keeps the string of happiness in the family,but its the Mrs. march who is the driving force in the book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Alcott's novel recounting the lives of the March family is aremarkable book reflective of her own unusual upbringing (the Marchesare all modeled after her real-life family, from her artistic sister May to her scholarly father). The story is written episodically, making for ideal bedtime reading, and is filled with lessons of early feminism, transcendtal theories, and the advanced ideas of the Civil War era that Alcott absorbed from her father.I've read this book for a decade, and only recently made a trip to the Alcott house in Boston. What a wonderful way to come back to a book that shaped my life and ideas of independence."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"OK, so after the 17 hundredth time (yes, I'm exaggerating), I have finally finished Little Women, and I'm so glad that I did! It's so totally excellent, and each chapter has a moral. Like, not to be vain or to not waste time or to not put much stock in riches, for money never was the equivalent to true love and happiness. I cried &amp; sobbed, and laughed and just generally thought &quot;I wish I were as contented as Beth, or as clever as Jo, beautiful as Amy &amp; charismatic as Meg.&quot; You fall in love with each of these girls, and Miss Alcott gave such a perfect description.

It is one of the most influential books I have every read. I love all of Louisa May Alcott's books because they have good morals and lessons in them. I also would like to say to the ealier reviewer who thougth this book was &quot;Extremely Fictional&quot; because of how perfect the family is, this book is based on a real family and the character Jo is based on Louisa herself. Families really can be that happy. I would highly reccomend this book and any of Louisa May Alcott's books"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book was rich in a kind of sensitive way. It was writenfrom the eyes of Jo, the tom boy. There are 4 sisters. Jo and Amy havea temper tantrum. Mr. March is away working.

I've read a old kids version twice and seen lots of versions of the movie and I always fall in luv with Laurie! lol Well not really. But it's really good! It just shows you how well she explains her charectars in her writing!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The novel, Little Women, By Louisa May Alcott is what people would consider to be a classic real life novel. It tells about the lives of young people and all the events they must go through. The girls in this novel have to go through a death of a sister, a person that they all love more than life itself, the girls must grow up with their father in the war, forcing them to try and earn money for their family, and there is many other problems these girls must face. Even with all the troubles they had, they never let it get to them because they still tried hard in whatever they came across and respected and loved one another until the end. This book inspires readers because of the commitment of one of the sisters, Jo, and how she never stopped believing in her dream to be a writer, and how she felt committed to the family more than anyone else why her father was away. This book teaches young and even older girls how to live their lives. The girls in this novel learn everything from their mother and she is confident in all of them. This story shows the true meaning of love between a family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The heartwarming book, Little Women, has won its readers love and support. The generalized assessment shows fondness to the realistic viewpoint of the lives of Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy and descriptive details that transport the reader into the beloved fairy tale. The plot of the story centers upon the girls' lives as they grow up during the Civil War. Each of the girls is extremely distinct in their character, taste, and dreams for their future. The positive role model and personal advisor to all of the girls is Mrs. March. I feel that she advised all of her daughter in making good decisions, except for when she agreed with Jo that Laurie was not a suitable match. The change the girls undergo as they get older is completely intriguing as each has special qualities and drawbacks to their character. The realistic aspects of the tale is one of my favorite characteristics of Louisa May Alcott's writing style. The detailed descriptions sent picturesque scenes through my mind. The variety of emotions throughout the duration of the book takes the reader on an emotional roller coaster ride."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This timeless classic still makes me cry, still makes me laugh and still seems fresh, every single time I reread it! My mum read it as did her mum probably, I've read it over and over and now my two teenagers are reading it. I used to recite my own version of this wonderful story when my children were young girls. They loved it! Of course, they weren't quite old enough back then to fully understand or appreciate Louisa May Alcott's version so I'd improvise for them. They would hear about all the fun times the sisters had during the Civil War era. The games they played, how Amy (May) used to draw on her bedroom walls. You see, the wonderful thing about living in this suburb of Boston is the fact that I can drive 15 miles into Concord. Of course, as soon as my girls were old enough, off we went, to the Alcott house where we visited this big rambling house which they'd heard me talk about and by now, had seen in the movies. They SAW Amy's bedroom drawings all over her bedroom wall and her dresses laid out on her bed. They saw everything first hand which was a real treat for them. They didn't seem to enjoy the trip up to the old cemetery where Louise and her 'real life' sisters lay. Not quite as entertaining to youngsters...ha ha. I seem to have told you about the thrill of being able to actually visit the real Alcott surroundings, which seem to be stuck in a time warp with all the original old furnishings inside. So, back to the book. Need I even say it! I'm sure everyone who visits this site has read this wonderful book about a New England family growing up and their many adventures. Sure, we all know Louisa changed the names of her sisters then wrote a book around their lives. You can read this book a million times and never tire of it so imagine how I felt, looking at the actual sites and just imagining in my mind! I saw my girls eyes open wide in wonder! No, not everyone can come to Concord to see the Alcott house but you can pick up this book for your teenagers or just read it again yourself! In case you didn't guess, I LOVE this book. Please read it! As my daughters are right now...and so on...and so on...and so on...."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The four March girls (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy) come of age in Civil War America in this classic from Louisa May Alcott.This is a morality tale in which the girls experience separation from a parent (Dad is off to fight for the Union), caring for each other and their mother, travel, loss and death, love, marriage and most of the life experiences one might expect a young woman to encounter.My abridged edition proved to be a good reader... The story held her interest and the experiences of the sisters almost always led to good discussions about dating, loss, marriage, caring and the other topics Ms. Alcott does a good job of rostering up a chapter at a time.A good book for the elementary school set."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little women is a very heartwarming book it is about four sisters and their family, and what they go through. I think that what makes this book so heartwarming is, because of the fact that they deal with normal everyday problems. With most books they don't have too much reality involved, but Little Women does. The Marches family is a really close family who sticks together through everything that happens to them. None of the sisters are alike they all have different personalities, which is probably another reason why I like this book. Meg is the mature one, she is also very pretty. She is sixteen years old. Jo is the adventurous one; she wants to be a write. Beth is the very fragile one, and Amy is the one who is pampered. She puts everyone before herself. Marmee, the mother is all alone taking care of her children, because the father had to go fight for the north. The mother takes care of the children very well. She gives them lots of love and tender loving care. To me the mother seems like a second mother to me, because she seemed so real. I'm sure anyone who has read this book, and who doesn't have a mother thiks of Mrs. Marches as a mother to them. To me I think the funniest part was when the one sister cuts off the other sisters hair. The saddest part was when one of the sisters die. Yes, I did shed a tear when Laurie who is the Marches' neighbor proposed to Jo, and yet Jo turned his offer down. So, basically I would say that this book is somewhat humurous at points and somewhat sad at points. I'm not a book reader, actually I hate reading, but this book was a definite page-turner. I liked this book very much; I couldn't put it down. It took me about five days to read it, which is how good it was. Between a scale from one to ten, I would definitely give it a ten. Thsi book I would say is about four hundred and fifty pages. I wouldn't reccomend this book for anyone under the age of eleven."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is how my life used to be: I get home from school, wander around in the pantry for awhile wondering what to eat, snatch a bag of chips, grab the comics, sit down and read the &quot;Marvin&quot; and &quot;Pickles&quot; comic strips. Marvin's fun to read, and the Pickles' characters, Earl and Opal, put on an entertaining show. That was the past. Now I've found a book that sends Marvin, Earl, and Opal packing. When I started to read Little Women, things dramatically changed. It was good-bye to Marvin, Earl and Opal and hello to Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It was Little Women before food. It was Little Women first. Because of poverty, the characters stumble over many rocks on the road of their lives. Once in a while, they find a golden nugget lying in their path. In Little Women, author Louisa May Allcott shows the life of four sisters. Meg is a quiet proper young lady, who in spite of here desire of wealth, falls in love with her neighbor's poor tutor. Jo is the wild one with the lowest amount of properness and the highest amount of dreams. She is a young and talented writer and finds a deep friendship with the neighbor boy, Laurie, because of their great similarities. Amy is the artist. Her wish is to be popular at school. She is proper and receives great credit for it. As for Beth, she has nothing to look forward to. This frail young girl knows her future and has no wish other then love and happiness. Now I leave you, my friend, to find the future of these women by picking up the book and entering their lives."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is the best book I have ever read. The heartwarming story of the four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy is a classic everyone should grow to read and love. The story depicts one family's hope and strength to overcome one struggle after another. This story is wonderful for both children and adults, and it really shows how close families can be and how their love can affect one another. I think that anyone in need in a good book to read whenever should pick up Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. The sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys also give readers the stories of the March family after Little Women ends. Five stars for sure!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When I first read &quot;Little Women&quot; I was twelve years old and now, several years later, it is still my favorite book. One of the reasons for that is that the book is effidently written with much love and feeling, which is quite understandable, knowing that it is based on Louisa Alcott's own life. It is really tragic when one finds out what Louisa's real life was like and the way she describes it in &quot;Little Women&quot;. It is as if she were decribing the life she wished for, while she tries at the same time to depict the truth. The way she describes the family life is heartwarming and I always hope that my children will love me as much as the March girls love their mother. The book is a picture of love, confidence and goodness. Some people may say it is too soft and moralistic, but I think that it can't do any harm to think about that once in a while. I mean, what is wrong with being good? The March girls are not saints, not even Beth, but they try to be as good as possible and many people should try that too. This book is most surely the loveliest story I have ever read and probably the best I'll ever read. And I don't think I am alone in that, otherwise it wouldn't be so popular today, over a hundred years after its first publication."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was a well written book by Alcott. It really made you stop and be glad for what you had. This family treasured everything and it really made them better people. I have gone on to read Jo's Boys and Little Men.

I read it in my 20s and enjoyed it as much inn my 40s. Rarely do I reread any books, but L.W. is timeless annd a wonderful escape from modern daily life. Each character is unique and special and believable.Each entertwined story is as interesting as the next, you truly don't wish the story to end.Again, if you've never read a 19th century classic before, Little Women will grab and hold you throughout the entire book.L.W. is appropriate for all ages and especially &#34;tweens&#34; may receive a positive lesson in ambitions and decorum by enjkoying the way life was for their ancestors 150 years ago.This is an all-aroud 5-Star book any age girl won't want to put down.."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved that each of these characters had faults, recognized them and worked through the entire novel to grow and essentially conquer those faults.

I was a little surprised to see how small the actual copy was as the copy I had years ago was very thick and bulky. When I got my replacement copy, I was a bit worried the full story would be missing and very surprised and pleased to find it was the full story in a smaller, easier to hold book. I would like to find the copies of Little Men and Jo's Boys in the same format if possible."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book was good and the professional narration that came with it made the book all the better.

It is a lovely and inspiring book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is about a time and a place that our generation knows nothing about. I'm 36, and the world today is nothing like the world when Little Women was written. It's a great story about a mother and her daughters, and their struggles and joys at a time when the country is at war and their father/husband must go off and fight. The story is filled with happiness and sorrow, love and pain."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"What a great novel this is!!! It brings back so many memories of my childhood, I really love it. It is very easy to read (English is not my first language), very entertaining. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Some will say that LM Alcott is too openly preachy, but her unabashed devotion to all the tried and true virtues is refreshing. The story, which I have read many times, is sweet and sentimental. I last read \\"Little Women \\" as a teenager, and now that I am a 40-something year-old mother and wife myself, I am frankly shocked by how touched I was by the effect that re-reading it had on me. The little words of guidance, maternal advice, and quiet examples of virtue and self-sacrifice take on new meaning and seem to reflect even more timeless wisdom now that I have some years of life experience myself. I believe stories such as this are exactly what is needed to help guide a new generation of girls toward a happier and more peaceful adulthood."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is one of my favorite stories, it's very honest and kind, loving and hopeful.

Thanks"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book as a young girl and thoroughly enjoyed it then. Forty plus years on I enjoyed it just as much if not more the second time round. A book of it's time, very engaging and endearing the story follows four sisters throughout their moral upbringing to womanhood. Lots of lessons are learned by all four of the sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. who all have very different characters. Much laughter, fun and sad times too, the mother is portrayed as a loving, nurturing parent who directs her children through trial, tribulations and turbulent times. I would definitiely recommend for a heart warming story. I read it in abou four long stints, so be prepared to put some time on one side!Denise12/12/23"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have long been a fan of Louisa May Alcott and highly recommend Little Women be read to younger children as well as for teens. The engaging girls in this story are examined for their faults as well as their virtues. While it is an old fashioned tale, the message is timeless regarding choices that are made by young people. Also highly recommend &#34;Eight Cousins&#34; and it's sequel, &#34;Rose in Bloom&#34; by LMA."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by \\"Little Women.\\" It was one of the best books I have ever read. I highly recommend this book, it is one of my very favorites. It's a million times better than the movie! I loved how Louisa included so much about \\"Pilgrim's Progress.\\" Throughout the book I found countless truths and beauties that I shall always remember. Loved it! :)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is easy to read and takes me back in history. Even if it is fiction.

(read it for 5th grade)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"They did a great job formatting this classic! It reads easily, there are no typos that I have found yet and of course the book itself is... well... a classic! The story is one of a kind. One of those stories you can read over and over again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I really liked Little Women... the only problem was that in some parts the book got a little boring and wordy. I read this book as a school assignment, and had to read it in one week. I'm eleven, so it wasn't too hard to finish it before the due date ,but it was really good, and some of the parts in the book made it worth it. I liked Jo the best because she was really tomboyish, which was nice and different from all the other characters. For all of the people who read Little Women I recommend reading The Diary of Anne Frank, because it.... well, actually it doesn't really have to do with Little Women at all. I guess it's just a really good book. The part I liked most in Little Women was when, at the end, everyone got married and was happy! Well, almost everyone. Beth didn't."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read Little Women as a girl and loved it so I was excited to have the opportunity to review an audio production of the book. However, I was quite surprised when the audio book abruptly ended in the middle of the story. I discovered that Little Women was originally two volumes: Little Women and Good Wives. They were first published together as one book titled Little Women in 1880. Most versions of Little Women published today are both volumes together in one book. This audio recording is just the first volume. Because what most people read as Little Women is actually both volumes, I feel like there should have been some indication on the box somewhere that this audio book does not include the second volume.(I don't want to spoil it for anyone who may not have read it yet so I'll say this - remember the Friends episode when Rachel convinces Joey to read Little Women? And he has to put the book in the freezer because of one particularly sad part? This audiobook ends before that sad part happens.)Even though this book was written more than one-hundred years ago, it still has relevance today. I think that the four March girls and Marmee have some good lessons to teach young girls that are timeless. Reading it now as a mother myself, I marveled at Marmee's patience and wisdom. I could learn a lot from her! I was very impressed at how independent and free-thinking the girls and their mother were given the time period the book was written in and took place. (Of course, Louisa May Alcott was a Unitarian so I shouldn't have been surprised at that.)Lorelei King narrated this audio book. I thought she did a great job for the most part. The two voices I didn't like were Beth and Amy's. I thought Beth's was too breathy and Amy's was too babyish - they didn't sound realistic to me. Overall, I enjoyed this audio production. My biggest complaint is that it left unexpectedly hanging at the end."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A classic I always enjoy reading. Such an endearing story. Timeless characters that you love to come visit again and again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book had such an impact on me as a kid, it was fun to re-read it. I love the Jo character and really identify with her. I think it's interesting that even though it was set in the past, the concerns of the girls are very similar to those of people today. While each person wanted something different in life, they were all things I could identify with. It may be a classic, but the writing is still easy to read in current times. It moves quickly and I can see why it continues to be popular. If you haven't read this one, read it!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was actually the first book that I read on the kindle available for my phone and I was slightly skeptical. However, I really enjoyed reading it and loved that I could read it no matter where I was. The story was great, a little slow to start off, but overall a great book and I would highly recommend it, especially to girls of all ages."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"this is a good classic book that we've all heard of. i like it a lot.my only problem is that its a little too moralistic in some places.I would like to invite you to New Life Tabernacle in Arab Alabama.

It is slow reading. So far I am enjoying the read."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I actually liked the book Little Women. I am not huge fan of reading, but for some reason i really liked this book. It was sort of boring at parts, but other time you couldn't put it down. There was also very upsetting parts and even happy parts which made u keep reading and keep wondering. An ex. of sadness was when Beth passed away. It was shocking when Laurie asked Jo to marry him and she said no, and then he asked Amy to marry him and she said yes! A point of happiness was when Meg delivered her babies! I would recommend this book o others, but prefeberly women because guys will not enyjoy it or get enought out of it!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I can't imagine someone disliking this novel. That is impossible. This book has things for all tastes: romance, friendship, betrayal etc. I have read this book 3 or 4 times and everytime I can find something different, or, even, be surprised. I think it is a wonderful thing how long Louisa May Alcott's masterpiece has been delighing readers everywhere.As everyone knows this is the story of four sisters and their love for each other , but above all, for life. Jo is the most impetuous and she wants to be a writer; Meg wants to get married and be a housewife; Beth, the most sweet, loves helping people; and, Amy wants to be an important person somehow. Through many years of their lives we learn how they succed --or fail-- in their ambition.Alcott's novel became a paradigma of the condition of American Women during the civil war. Each girl can be seen as a possibility of what women had for their future by that time. Maybe this is why this novel is so timeless. The writer didn't want to make a sociological analysis of that period, but her work is very helpful, once it is quite reliable as a portrait of that society.This novel deserves to be read over and over again, and not only by little women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a story of four sisters with thier own point of views. This book has a very strong romantic field, but yet it has all of our child hood fantacies. The story is about four remarkable young girls, and as the pages turn they all grow up. Each one finds thier own love but desperate times happen more often. I love this book and, I think that this is a remarkable story of four sisters growing up together. As you read this book you may feel sad but everyone faces tough times. So read this book, It truly is worth reading."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a charming book for all ages old and young. It has been cherished in our libraries for so many years and it never gets old. The story is one of four sisters battling not only with perosnal issues but family issues. The March family is not exaclty wealthy and they must find their money is places they wish not to. But despite their financial issues the sisters make believe they live in other places, putting on theatricals, plays, making up clubs and tellong their most apauling secrets. With their father in the Civil War and their mother having the reputation of helping a young black girl, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy must search for ways to fit in. The book tells their story from when they are young girls in the Pickwick Portfoliio, to young women getting married and having a family of their own.I can relate to this book a lot because having sisters of my own I went and still go through a lot of the same things. When my sisters and I were little girls we played with eachother and made up games together much like the March sisters. And as we a growing older we find that life is not always as simple as when we were kids, like Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy all find out together. The book captures the essence and wonderful things to come when you have a sister that you love and care for and can tell all your secrets to. When you doubt yourself your sister will back you up and love you no matter what. There is nothing like a sister and to quote the book, \\" a sister's bond is one which that is stronger than marriage\\"."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book when I was 12 and I can't remember how many times I've read it in total.

There are 3 versions that I can think of."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I finally read Little Women last Christmas break after seeing all of the movie versions many times. I like the movies but nothing compares to the book. Even though it was written so long ago and I expected it to be hard to read, this story really touched my heart.

It is realistic, with ups and downs. Each character has its own personality; nothing has ever been like it before, in all my almost 13 years. It really takes you back in time, as if you are really there. My favorite character was Beth; I cried really hard when she died!! Jo was creative; Beth was a darling; Amy was prissy; Meg was vain. I liked how Beth was close to her cats, and I also liked how she \\"took in\\" rejected dolls. I also loved the fact that Jo was a writer, because that's what I am; I just LOVE to write stories, especially about horses.

Several years later, one of my very good friends that had the same taste as I handed it to me and said, &quot;Read it.&quot; I obeyed and it turned out to be one of the best books that I had ever read. This classic story about the March sisters and their joys, hardships, and growing up has proved to be a great lesson to me and my friends.

If my 53 year old dad read this, he would not have appreciated it as much as 19 year old me, who loves Jo and Beth the most because they struck a chord in my heart. Alcott, more than any other author, invites you warmly to sit on the couch with the Marches as they laugh, cry, think, and charm you right into their home and their lives. I was a silent cousin while reading this novel, and I still think Jo and Laurie should be together. Feminists, put your guards down because this book is not about submission or female inferiority, it is about overcoming everything with love, both for males and females. Don't watch the movie EVER.

I think that the author wanted us to see the struggle that everyday life can be for the rich and poor alike.I also thought that she potrayed the girls as wanting to be good, becuase she wanted us to realize that deep down inside of all of us there is a part that wants to do its best."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a great book for anyone to read!

I read for hours a day, often with a flashlight in the middle of the night. I cryed when they cryed, and laughed when they laughed. I felt as if the March sisters were my own, and Marmee was my second mother. As I read, I would loose myself into a world filled with love, warmth, tragedy, and hope. I have two sisters of my own, and as I read, I realized how special they are to me. The book inspired me to be a better person.

They are poor and their father is at war,and they have all sorts of, um, not really adventures, but you get the point. Well, it tells about their daily lives- not that interesting. Alcott devotes whole chapters to something as trivial as making dinner- and doesn't make it even that interesting. In the end, they are all happy and married with kids, thus giving the message to reach true happiness the ultimate goal must be marriage- not.I can't believe Alcott managed to write 647 pages of this- it was so dang boring! Of course, it had its interesting moments, but for the most part, I can't believe I'm alive, writing this review. Overall, this book hasn't affected me much- just another book.Plot- boringEnding- pretty satisfying, especially because it's the endingFlow- I still don't know which character is which, and the book went from, say, a tea party, to a dinner, and back to the tea party; confusing!Would I buy this book- I already did, but it was free (meh heh heh)Would I reread this book- NO!Bottom line: Must I say it again? BORING!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read Little Women recently and I would probably reccommend it to anyone that is okay with a sad, romantic book. The main character is Jo, a tomboy growing up in the late 19th century. It is Jo's story as she becomes an adult, and I think it is a great coming-of-age book for both boys and girls. (Girls would probably enjoy it a little more than boys.) Either way, it's a great book and you should read it as soon as you get your hands on it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A timeless tale that has a special place in all of our hearts, Little Women. The magical story of four girls having adventures while they lay in wait for their father to come home from the Civil War. In this tale, Meg, the eldest, marries Mr. John Brooke, Teddy's tutor, and has the life she always wanted, like her mother. Meg moved down he road from her family, and had twins, Demijohn and Daisy, becoming the model mother she always wanted to be. After Jo had \\"scorned\\" Teddy's love for her, Teddy went off to Europe to sulk. Around that time, Beth was getting weaker. With all this stress, Jo went away to New York. There, she met Professor Bhaer. She fell in love with him as he helped her to cultivate her writings, helping her to write a book based on her childhood. He promised her that he would help her get it published. Beth was getting sicker and sicker, so Jo went home to help Beth. Beth died in Jo's arms. Professor Bhaer came to the March's doorstep to give Jo her published book. He asked Jo to marry him, she said yes. When Aunt March died, Jo inherited her plantation. She realized, I love boys, why not fill this house with boys that she would grow to love. So the plantation became \\"Jo's School for boys.\\" The rooms were filled with the boys that she loved very much. Amy went abroad with Aunt March to help cultivate her art. There she met the crabby, snobbish, horrid side of Teddy that had come out because of Jo's answer. The more time they spent together in Europe, the more time they got to grow to love each other. They were married in Europe and Amy got the wealth and prominence she longed for as a child. This book is a wonderful tale for all. We all should read this book in our life. It belongs in our lives.This book had very detailed characters. Teddy is so detailed in the book, and you can actually hear them talking and his point of view on things. When Teddy got in a fight with Mr. Laurence, his grandfather, about going to college, he was so mad that when Jo meekly knocked on his door, he fired a mean insult and threatened to hurt his grandfather if he knocked one more time. Amy, at times, can be very nice in the story, but other times she was lying to make herself seem bigger than she was, and would even the score pretty well. When Jo, Teddy, Meg, and John Brooke went to the theater, Amy begged and pleaded to go, but Jo was firm, when she said no, she meant no. As they were leaving, Amy yelled at the top of her lungs to Jo, and said, I will get you back! (Not the exact words) When they came back from the theater, Jo wanted to write, but she could not find her book. She asked around, and then saw Amy watching the fire burn her book! Jo started yelling that she hated her and never wanted to talk to Amy ever again. Amy never even said she was sorry. Jo gets very fired up when something bad happens to one of her friends or family. When Amy was in school, she got in trouble, and the teacher struck her hand, and she had to stand up in front of the whole class, humiliated. When Jo heard about this, she was yelling, writing nasty letters, and was thinking about go down there and giving that teacher a piece of his mind.This story was very realistic. When Meg received John Brooke's invitation to wed, she refuses. Again and again, John asks, but she still says no. Rich, snobby Aunt March \\"overhears\\" and commends Meg for making such a decision, because John is dirt poor and money is one of the things that makes marriage run smoothly. Meg is appalled that Aunt March would say that. Aunt March also said that if she didn't marry in wealth, she would be cut out of her will. Meg tells Aunt March off, and tells her that John is a kind; caring, man and He would love her whether she was dirt poor or a princess. Then she realizes that she does love John, and she accepts the invitation to wed. Jo was asked to wed by Teddy, but she said no. The reason she said no was because they would always fight, like they did, with both of their tempers, they would never have a calm, cool, and collected argument, and they would never be really happy. Of course, Teddy did not understand at the time, but what Jo was trying to say was that she didn't want to be trapped in an unhappy marriage. Lastly, when Professor Bhaer proposed to Jo, He told her that his hands were empty. That meant that he would not have any money and could never buy the things that she would like. She replied, that his hands weren't empty anymore, and then she put her hands in his. This meant that she didn't care whether he had money or not, as long as he loved her, for she never cared about money, social status, or new clothes. She just loved Professor Bhaer.This book was very long. I loved this book, but she kept explaining every single little detail. When Beth died, she didn't just die, she died with an expression on her face. An expression that showed that she was content and ready to die, because she knew that there was nothing that the doctor could do. An expression that sent Jo into crying uncontrollably when Jo died. An expression to make Hannah, the Marches \\"live in cook\\", into sobbing while she was cooking, and saying \\"Too young, she was too young. She had so much strength left. See what I mean? When Amy burned Jo's book she was writing, Jo kept thinking about it, which made her even madder. When Jo and Teddy went ice staking on the pond, Amy came, but Jo and Teddy ignored her. Then, Amy fell under the ice. After that, Jo beat herself up over being mean to Amy, she even thought about either running away, or being Amy's eternal servant. When Jo was apologizing to Amy, tears were flowing and flowing down her face, and, one half of the chapter was about Jo regretting ever being mad at her. During the book, Demi, Meg's son, would get out of the bed during the night to be with his mother. John would not allow this, so every time he got up, John would take him back to his room, talk to him about why he should not get up and pop his bottom. This would go on for pages and pages without any progress. Finally, he stopped.This book is for everybody. I suggest for those to have the patience to read a book this long, I quite enjoyed it for it was a challenge; to read it and meditate on the lessons it shows usB. Rimando"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I first read Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" the summer between 4th and 5th grades. I was absolutely riveted by the story and characters and clearly remember sitting on the porch steps, my nose in the book. I cried when I reached the conclusion, because I was afraid that I had just read the best book in the world, and that I would never find anything else as good. The local librarian convinced me otherwise. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough - for people of all ages. It will always have a special place in my heart.Ms. Alcott writes about four young women, living in New England, during a period of much strife in America - the Civil War. They are self sufficient, creative and well educated, and each chooses a different life path, traditional and non. Considering the period when the book was written, the author's views on opportunities open to females, restricted though they were by society, is refreshing and liberating. Of course, this was not my focus as a nine year-old. The novel is long, but that never bothered me as a young girl, or much later when I reread it. I didn't want the story to end, actually.Sisters Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March and their beloved Marmee, (who offers her daughters guidance, comfort and unconditional love), learn to live in genteel poverty while their father, a doctor, is away treating wounded soldiers. This beautifully written classic, chronicles the girls' adolescence through womanhood, with all their trial, tribulations, and joys.Much of the novel focuses on Jo, the second daughter, and a gifted writer. She is very much a tomboy, and an avid reader who writes plays which the girls act-out with delight and exuberance. When they meet their new next-door neighbor, the wealthy, lonely Theodore Laurence, (called Laurie), they befriend him and invite him to become the only male member of their exclusive theater ensemble. Laurie becomes an important person in all of their lives, and the March family in his. Margaret, (Meg), the oldest, is quite lovely - a young woman with traditional values and tastes. Sensitive Elizabeth, (Beth), is the most fragile sister -quiet, caring and timid. And Amy, the youngest, is a gifted artist, with a tremendous sense of self-importance.Together they cope with their father's absence and their fear for his safety, severe illness in the family, a death, lack of money precluding many of life's small luxuries, romance, love, marriage and many glorious adventures. In the second part of the novel, Meg marries, Jo's writing becomes a priority, as does Amy's art. During a time of impoverishment, they learn how good it feels to give to those who are much needier than themselves. This aspect of the book is very moving. Ms Alcott brings her characters to life on the page. All of them, even minor personages, are extremely well developed.\\"Little Women\\" was first published in two parts in 1868 and 1869. The author drew from her own childhood experiences to dramatize the lives of the March family. The character \\"Marmee\\" is based on her own mother, Abigail May, (Abba), Alcott, whom she described as having: \\"A great heart that was home for all.\\" Like Marmee, Abba was loving and passionate about women's rights, temperance, and abolition. A truly compelling and wise novel!JANA"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott's novel, Little Women, is truly a classic story of family love. The novel chronicles the life of the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, during the time of the civil war.Each girl has her own unique characteristics and traits which Ms. Alcott does a brilliant job bringing each of them to life. Meg, the oldest, womanly, beautiful and proper; Jo, the author and tomboy; Beth, the frail gentle caring soul; and Amy, the youngest, the vain artist.Each of the girls lean on each other for support while their father is away at war and their mother taking care of the sick. The girls entertain each other by putting on plays in their attic that Jo has written. The girls also befriend their neighbor, Laurie, who falls in love with Jo.Throughout the years the girls experience Meg's courtship and marriage to Laurie's tutor, John; Beth's sickness and brush with death; Amy's venture overseas to study and travel with Aunt March; and Jo's travel to New York to \\"escape\\" and further her passion for writing. It is there that Jo meets Fridrich.This classic novel of home, family and love, inspired by the author's own life, will linger in your heart long after you have turned the last page."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly.

There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

I enjoyed the book alot.Read about Meg, the pretty and mature one, Jo, the tomboy, Beth, frail and quiet, and Amy, the spoiled and confident one. You can relate the these &quot;little women&quot; as you read.But don't forget loving Marmee, fun and lovable Teddy, and mysterious but caring Mr. Lawrence.I devoured every page of the book. I read almost 100 pages each day! The only part I found somewhat boring were the chapters about Jo in New York. Well the letters were a bit boring.There are so many memorable moments in this book: Meg's vanity fair, Jo's haircut, Amy's punishment and humiliation at school, Beth's sickness, the birth of Daisy and Demi, and Jo's school. Read this book to be transported to the world of little women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Why give your child an adaptation of a classic?The original book IS a classic because it's that good, but it's not intended to be an easy reader. There are lots of references to Dickens, 19th century schools of thought and people and places of the times.You can read the real book young-- I read it in 6th grade, and it's still one of my faves.But your child will not get it until they are much older, not matter how gifted they are!!!!!!!!!!!!An adaptation is not the answer. It's like feeding your child a pint of spaghetti sauce that has been drowned in a quart of water--the original is there, but the flavor is gone. And so it the nutrition!!!There are plenty of books your child will enjoy and RELATE to. Wait to read the real thing. Or if you really insist on exposing them to the story before they can read it, let them see one of the film versions first--they were all pretty good."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The story line is quite excellent, I love the words the Louisa uses! Such variety! In this book are triumphs and failures, love and loss. Overall an astounding book - I would read it again in a heart beat."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is one of my most favorite books which i love re-reading once in a few years.What makes this one a timeless classic is that it never grows old despite the story taking place more than a century ago. Why? Because we can always relate to the characters.My 12-year-old daughter, who is a modern child of the modern world, loves the book as much as her mom. We like to talk about the characters, analyze their behavior and choices.i don't agree when people says this book tells the girls to become housewives. It does not. Sadly, those were still the times when women did not have many choices, but it did not stop them following their dreams (especially Jo).This book also teaches us to be grateful for the opportunities we have today--the ones that the little women did not have."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I decided to reread Little Women before reading the Pulitzer Prize-winning March by Geraldine Brook, which is written from the viewpoint of the family's father, off serving as a Chaplain during the Civil War.As always happens, as I read a favorite children's book as an adult, I find things that I love to be reminded of, but also notice how many life messages simply slipped past me during the early reading. There are some great life lessons about marriage and relationships, especially after a child is added to the mix, for example.There were certainly aspects of the book that come across a bit too sweet and cloying, but those are balanced by the images of a young girl Jo (and her mother Marmee) stepping out a bit from the controlling and limiting expectations on women of the time.I read the book now from the viewpoint of a military spouse who has also watched my husband deploy into a war zone. I also do many workshops for military spouses dealing with the current deployments so I know what they deal with. My first reaction was that the March family and mother especially had it pretty good in comparison. They have a fulltime maid Hannah for one thing, something that any military spouse would give a lot to have! But many of the emotions, thoughts and fears of current military spouses are matched in this book (and even more so in March).All in all a great read, a nice view into a totally different time in our history -- now I want to watch the movie again!Kathie Hightower, coauthor of Help!

The print is quite small, due to the book's small size, but the binding is nice for a four dollar book, and my younger sister (for whom I purchased the book) is enjoying her forays into the innocent fun-filled world of Jo, Meg, Beth and Amy. Classic values of modesty, honesty, kindness and love meet challenges such as poverty, death and war, and the March sisters discover that love and faith can overcome even great obstacles.

This edition only goes up to the chapter titled \\"Aunt March Settles the Question.\\" This is because this is the Chrysalis, which is a UK company. In general, the UK publishes Louisa May Alcott's books separately as \\"Little Women\\" and \\"Good Wives.\\" However, in the US both parts of the story have usually been published as one volume entitled \\"Little Women.\\"Otherwise, the story is wonderful and follows four girls in their trials and tribulations. Certainly one can read this book only and get a good story. However, parents who are getting this for their children should also look into purchasing \\"Good Wives\\" or at least getting a US version with both books included.

I first picked it up about a year ago in a bookstore when |I was bored, which pretty unusual because I can usually always find something to read.It was the name that caught my eye. I had read a biography of Louisa May Alcott in a Social Studies textbook, and I knew about this book. But I had never read it.It was a small, thick copy in Scholastic Classics Edition. I opened it and the first sentence got mee hooked, about how tomboyish, bookworm Jo March wishes she had presents for Christmas.And then, I read on and on. I learned about grownup, sweet Meg, shy and music-loving Beth, and artistic, pretty Amy. 'But of course I had to leave that bookstore. But my very nice aunt bought the book for me.In that edition the book was 560 pages long, and I finished it in less than three days.This terrific book of love, laughter, friendship, and family is sure to charm everyone who takes the time and patience to read its thick volume.

The beautiful New England scenery, the excellent background music which somehow conveys the Civil War period, the fine acting - all make this a very enjoyable rendition.I somewhat reluctantly have withheld the 5th star - possibly unfairly so. I re-read Louisa May Alcott's book just recently. My conclusion was that because the book provides a much more comprehensive development of the lives of the four March daughters, no movie, within its modern time limitations, can really do justice to Alcott's plot. While I liked the portrayal of Professor Bhaer very much in this latest version, I think the movie adaptation made him much more &#34;modern&#34; than the book would allow - more youthful in appearance, more advanced views of culture, a manufactured love scene, etc.But all in all - highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"5 stars!!!!

I'm now almost 70. The opportunity to play Aunt March in a local theatrical production spurred me to read the book again. And I'm so glad. First of all, I realized I had never read the complete story. I'm sure I read the illustrated abridged version that is usually read by young children (and the edition I just bought my 9-year-old granddaughter). The 500+ pages would have seemed a bit overwhelming when I was reading it the first time. I also realized that even though it is recommended for children ages 9-12, I would never buy this unabridged version for a child in that age group.That being said, I would have to say that this book is absolutely delightful. I loved the story 60 years ago, and love it even more now. At times I'm reading with a big smile on my face. Other times the tears are running down my cheeks (when Mr. Laurence gave Beth the piano and Meg's wedding as an example). I cherish every word. Miss Alcott gave each of the girls very individual and endearing personalities. Visions of them run through my head as I read. They are filled with such joy but at the same time experience more than their share of sadness and hardship.

The binding is beautiful as well."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, from her \\"blood and thunder\\" tales to heartwarming novels about teens growing up.But there's something special about \\"Little Women,\\" a fictionalized account of her own family's growing pins. Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. The March family will come alive, and never quite leave."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women Louisa May Alcott, 2004, 520 pages. $9.95Sterling Publishing ISBN 978-1-4027-1458-0Have you ever had a brother or sister and you just can't be without them? Would you do anything for them? That's how it is for Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. They are not perfect but great sisters. They all are different, they are strongly bonded together, always their for each other, just like normal sisters.The main characters Meg, the oldest of the four, was sixteen and very beautiful, Jo, the second oldest, was fifteen, tall, thin, and has light brown hair, Beth, was called rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl, and was thirteen, Amy, the most important person to her dad life, the youngest. Some main characters emotions are happy, sad,/ baby time, dieing time, war time, and peace time.The background into the relationships among the four characters are, four sisters, the sisters who have a great relationships among each share in between the four of them. A summarize of the plot in the story would be four sisters and they are going throw, a dad in the war, it's hard to watch the four girls Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy grow up and move on with their live.A hint about the resolution of the plot, I would say a few years later the girls are grown up and someone comes home and then the family is all back together but one know everyone is going to be happy. The genre that I was reading was historical fiction. This book is part of a series, the little men which Louisa May Alcott also wrote. My opinion towards the book would be for the writer to make more books just like little women because the book was very interesting, my reaction on the book were sad, happy, terrified, and cry full.

Still it had a bit more explanation about things and it was a really good book I recommend it to everyone above the age of 12."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved Little Women, and I am actually surprised that I did.There is something alluring and engaging when the first chapter of a novel starts in a cold winter. My own temperament is neither made nor able to be trained for cold weather. I shiver even in a mild wind sometimes and yet I crave reading about my characters bravely battling a brutally cold winter, especially when the setting takes us to Concord, Massachusetts in late 19th century civil-war era America. Harsh and gloomy as the weather may be, the bleak of winter is no match for the warmth which stems from love, happiness, and tightness of the March family. Four sisters, one mother, one nanny, and a father at war, Alcott introduces us one by one to the March sisters and the bond of sisterhood which is tested, broken and mended again and again throughout the novel.The theme and plot of this novel paint the pictures from every day life for an ordinary family caught in, yes you guessed it, extraordinary times. The hardships of Civil War and near-poverty, while real for the March family, are not central to the plot and so \\"Little Women\\", which has many important messages, comes across as extremely light, fun and beautiful reading. Even if it's considered a children's classic, I shamelessly admit that I enjoyed it thoroughly.My most favorite character, of course, is the one and only Jo who shows us.......that short temper can bring about only regrets and how to channel that energy to good use....that we need to deal with the loss of a loved one and the abandon friendships at times....that we can create magic if we write from the heart....that maternal love can afford us more comfort than any other imaginable in good and especially in desperate times....that age difference and cultural gaps are no strike against a love story.Oh I loved Little Women! So happy to have read it. Pick up this classic TO-DAY!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"My mom encouraged me to read this story when I was 11. It was a bit too mature for me then, but I enjoyed it so much at 13. I identified with both Jo and Beth. I noticed Jo's literary bent and Beth's inherent shyness in myself.My British mom owned two volumes of Alcott's story--Little Women and Little Wives (sometimes known as Good Wives). Little Wives or Good Wives is simply Little Women, Part II in the U.S. As a young girl, I preferred the story of the girls before they married. As I grew older, I appreciated Part II or Little Wives so much more.I didn't often re-read the entire books. I had my favorite chapters. I just loved the chapter--Experiments--when Marmee permits the girls to enjoy the first week of their summer vacation with no household chores. It ends with them all thoroughly fed up with their life of leisure. Jo especially feels the need for work and gives a dinner party with disastrous results.Another favorite chapter of mine was when Meg goes to \\"Vanity Fair,\\" a weekend of frivolity at her wealthy friend's home ending in a ball where the rich girls lend her a gown to replace her old torn one. With the help of makeup and frills, they make her into someone quite different, taking away from some of the freshness and innocence she still possessed at 17. This is the night when she overhears a couple of old biddies talking about how good it would be for the March family if Meg could manage to marry the wealthy Laurence boy (Laurie). They were convinced that Mrs. March had her plans for the two.But Alcott made it very clear that Marmee was quite a different sort of mother--she wanted nothing but happiness and love for her daughters, and she didn't believe that a great deal of money was necessary in order to be happy.The moral lessons in this book abound. The sickness and death of Beth are looked upon as life experiences more than terrible tragedies, and death is seen as a beginning to a new life. Beth talks about how she'll miss Jo even in \\"heaven,\\" and Jo says after Beth's passing, \\"We must thank God that Beth is well at last.\\"Meg thumbs her nose at cranky, wealthy Aunt March when the older woman says that should Meg marry her financially-strapped suitor, John Brooke, that she'll inherit none of her money. She lets her know in no uncertain terms that love means far more to her than money.Jo gives up writing her \\"potboilers\\"--the violent, mawkish thrillers that her German professor friend hates and instead pens a touching story about her sister, Beth, and wins his approval and a marriage proposal. She has already turned down Laurie's proposal because she realizes that although she loves her \\"boy\\" as a friend that she needs something different in a husband.So there are many lessons, but I never felt as a child that I was reading a book of sermons. I felt as though I were reading about real people and I learned to care about them. I loved all of it--the fashion talk--the way Meg and Amy cared so much about style and how Jo would carry a lemonade-stained glove crumpled up in her hand and wear a gown that had fireplace burns on the back of the skirt and just laugh and enjoy herself.I read all the Alcott books to my daughter when she was ten. When I read the final words of Jo's Boys, \\"Let the curtain fall forever on the March family,\\" the tears rolled down her face. I remember just a while after I had given birth to my daughter thinking, \\"Oh, wonderful, I'm going to share Little Women with her--what a joy!\\""},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this as a young girl and love it even today.

I hope that the person who left the bad review does not give up on the \\"classics\\", and that they will find one that sticks with them forever.

I finally did one day when I saw it on my friend's bookshelf and asked to borrow it (to which, of course, she agreed; we exchange books as often as we exchange words). I read it in a week and when I finished it I thought, I should have read this years ago!! I went to the library the same day I found out there were sequels. Perhaps the conversations are a little too long; and some of the old mannerisms hard to understand, but stick it out for the whole thing and you won't be sorry! And one more thing -- read it even if you're an adult or a boy. It isn't just for twelve-year-old girls (excuse the fact that this was written by one); and it isn't about sisters making calls and gossiping. It's about life and growing up and everyone on the planet should read it!Now I hope I've made my point; I have to go to the library now to get Little Men."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women has been an endearing classic since its publication, and it has touched the hearts of many people. However, many reviews already comment on the story, and I only wish to comment on a particular edition, particularly the Penguin classics one. Not only does it have a beautiful cover illustration of the four sisters, it has plenty of end notes printed in the back for a better understanding of the text. Although Alcott's language is not convoluted in any way, the culture the four sisters lived in is very different from ours, and thus there are some idioms or expressions that are now archaic. The notes help explain such terms very well. There was some confusion about one of the editions not having both parts, but rest assured, Penguins includes both parts of the story. Furthermore, the introduction states that this particular edition contains no altercations or editing that some later texts contain, and is presented as Alcott originally intended. Sadly, this edition has no illustrations besides the one on the front cover, and thus may not be the most ideal edition for children. However, Penguins is the perfect edition for those seeking a lovely copy and a fantastic read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"In Little Women, you will meet the March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth & Amy who live with their mother, Marmee, and their maid Hannah, during the Civil War. The first half of the novel takes place while their father is away, serving in the war. Each sister has a distinct personality, a reader, an artist, a musician, the quiet one. You will get to know this family in touching little stories of their daily life. Each chapter seems to set up a moral lesson for the reader to learn. We also meet a wonderful set of neighbors, Mr. Laurence and his nephew \\"Laurie\\" who quickly find a place as part of the March family.The second half of the novel, focuses on the girls as they leave their childhood and begin their journey into adult life. Lessons of friendship, family, and love are covered as we join the characters through the ups and downs of life, good times and bad. It seems that Louisa May Alcott used her own family as the basis for the stories in Little Women, basing the character Jo on herself. It is amazing how though the book was written in the late 1800's, so many things about humans remain the same. The foundations of life that are important in friendships, family & love don't change through time, as Alcott has shared with us. This is a book that young and old can read and appreciate."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read.

While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

The descriptions of the girls and their friends are missing, as are descriptions of their clothes, home, etc. Alcott herself wrote (ch. 1), \\"...young readers like to know 'how people look.'\\" I question the decision to leave out the descriptive passages as they are some of the most interesting writing, especially to younger readers."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book when I was 12 years old. I had to read it for school-it was a desperate last choice for the required reading. Boy, didn't I see this coming! It took a while, I will offer that (I eventually had only read half by the test.) But it changed my life. I model myself after Marmee, the loving and kind mother. This book taught me to have self respect and hold myself with dignity. I taught me to be polite and respectable. Throughout the turmoil of adolescene, with kids growing up to model pop culture icons and growing up too fast, with sex and drugs littering the road to adulthood, I held myself like a lady. Thank you, library, for having little selection. This book changed my life. Everyone has to read it. After that book, I read more classics, and let me tell you they are lovely. I mean this with all my heart, when I say that Little Women is the purest, realest, lovliest novel I have ever known. Thank you, Louisa.

I love all of Louisa May Alcott's books dearly, and I seem to keep coming back to this one. Who cannot laugh with the Alcott sisters when Jo burns Meg's hair off? Who cannot shed at least a few tears when sweet, gentle Beth dies? Whose heart cannot be ripped apart in agony when Jo rejects Laurie's declaration of love for her? This book is a masterpiece. It's a role model - an encourager. To the person who said that the Marches were the &quot;perfect&quot; family - I dearly hope to have a family as good as they when I grow up.

Through many things the girls never forget what is important, their family. The book progresses as the girls grow older and it is a great novel. My friends know I'm a fast reader but they took one look at it and told me that it looked so boring that they bet me it would take me weeks to finish. Boy were they surprized when I was on the first page a week later, they said &quot;told yah so&quot; and I said that they were wrong and I was rereading it! I became so ingrossed in it that they accutually let me tell them what it was about and they hate reading. They still haven't read it but thats their loss!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I chose to read Little Women for my 6th grade English book report because I had heard that it was a really great book as well as a great American novel. I am 12 years old and really love to read. I have to say that this book was very challenging, with a lot of new words, but it was worth the extra time and effort.Right from the start you see the four main characters, who are sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy along with Mrs. March (Marmee) working together to get through the hardship of being without their father, Mr. March, who is off to war. The way the family cares about each other and people who are even less fortunate than they are is really a great lesson. There are funny parts, sad parts and really unexpected turns to this story.I really enjoyed getting know all the characters and REALLY loved Jo! Everyone who has read this book says that I'm a lot like her. I think anyone who reads this book will have fun seeing which girl they most are like. I thought all of them had really great personalities, most of the time...just like me.I really enjoyed the book more than the movie (the Katherine Hepburn one) because the book is loaded with details and I was able to picture the people and the scenes in my mind better (in my opinion) than the movie did. So DON'T skip the book and just watch the movie!!This book is really long, so make sure you're up for the challenge. But if you want a way to pass a rainy day (or even a snowy one), this is one of the greatest books to curl up with."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I've only read it fifty or more times. At one time in my life I read it through and started right over again at the end. I could recite large portions of it, as well as the table of contents.I first read this when I was about eight. I didn't understand it at all. Re-read it when I was a few years older and couldn't live without it. My grandma sent me a copy which I later replaced with a better one (the old version of the Children's Classics series) and I passed my first copy on to another LW admirer.I've always enjoyed this book. I remember being thrilled when I was fifteen like Jo is at the beginning of the book. I always liked Jo best... because I felt I was very like her. I've always liked to write. But then the artist in Amy appealed to me as well. I always loved Beth also and her dolls and cats. Meg was the only one I never felt I could relate to... later on though I re-read the book after a long absence from it and Meg's character seemed much more interesting. There's a charming supporting cast in these pages too... Laurie, John, and the Bhaer... Hannah... Aunt March...I like the Pilgrim's Progress theme of the first half of the book. I think it's so nice that these were four girls who really wanted to do right... and went to the right place for help - the little Books Mother gave them under their pillows... There is humour and sadness here, much reality, and plenty of charm. I always appreciated the simple but profound style of Louisa May Alcott - it bears up under so many readings very well. It's been about a year since I last read it... I think it's time to pull it off the shelf again.I get a strange feeling that this review is a bit scattered. But if you've gotten the idea that I love and recommend this book, it serves its purpose."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"If you've never read this book, you simply have to! Women of all ages can and will relate to the follies of the little women. From burnt hair to boy troubles to feeling stupid and made into a fool, we've all been there and experienced it in some form or another. My favorite chapter is actually the first one (Though I can recite any passage from any chapter of the book word for word.) A Merry Christmas introduces us to the characters and show the unity and support in American families during the Civil War. Dark Days has you feeling the worst is around the corner, but then some sun peeks through the ice encrusted tree limbs. And though The Valley of Shadow brings about darker days yet, good things come of them, and in the end, life is beautiful! It doesn't matter what your usual style of reading material is, this is by far the greatest work ever published. I have this particular copy and there are about four or five exquisite full color drawings inside and some truly magnificent sketches, aslo. Don't even consider waiting one more second to pick this one up, whether you're a long time fan who's been looking for the perfect copy or a new reader, trust me when I say you will want this one longer than any library in the country will allow it out. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I'm sure there are plenty of reviews on the actual story, so I'll just comment on this particular edition of Little Women. I'm referring to the Grosset & Dunlap Illustrated Junior Library edition. I found this at a local Borders and was immediately attracted to the cover illustration. This is a beautiful book. There are many illustrations throughout the book, both in color and in back and white (the majority are in black and white).When I looked it up on Amazon, I was a little hesitant about buying this book because I had read reviews stating that it only contained the first half of the story (288 pages). The book I bought (at Borders) contains the entire story (643 pages). So, if you like the appearance of this particular edition, but are put off by the lack of the second half, it is available with the complete story. Just be careful when making your selection."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a child -- and even now, the chapter \\"Dark Days\\" (and other parts, too!) make me cry. I NOW find the character of the mother (\\"Marmee\\") and her constant moralizing annoying; but it's still a great book. And little girls still read it and weep over it (I volunteer in schools and meet a lot of kids).I think this is because the characters of the girls and Laurie are so real and the book has so much more heart than many things published now; but who knows? At different times in my life, I've liked each of the sisters (except Meg) the best and think this is quite common though most of us first like Jo. At any rate, I believe in the characters and find the book touching...even when I'm annoyed by Marmee! I just ignore her moralizing as I probably would have tried to do in real life if she had been my mother.Two facts: If you visit Boston, you can go to Concord and see one of the houses where Louisa May Alcott lived -- it's now a museum and furnished as it would have been in her day. And the conversation in my novel BLOW OUT THE MOON about Litle Women, Jo, and Amy is one of the things that happened in real life just as it does in the book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The first time I read Louisa May Alcott's Little Women, I fell in love with the story. Little Women is the story of four girls that were coming of age during the civil war. Each of the girls, all sisters, has different personality traits and characteristics that are developed throughout the book. Meg, the oldest, is the sensible sister, while Jo is hot-headed and independent. Beth is musical and Amy, the youngest, is the more material of the four. The girls grew up in a very close family and strived to support each other in their dreams. But Jo, the second-born, has a difficult time seeing all of them growing up and leaving home. She wants things to remain the same, always. Change is inevitable, however, and throughout the book, the girls' love for each other is strong, as they face different challenges and joys of growing up. They keep their strong sense of family... I thoroughly enjoyed reading Little Women. It has been awhile since I was able to sit down and read a book I so love. Louisa May Alcott's character, Meg, did not hold much interest for me... Amy, the baby of the family, was too materialistic for my taste. The character I related to the most was Jo. I do not know if it is because I am like her, or if it was her spunk that I really liked. I loved to see the blossoming love Laurie had for Jo... I think that Louisa May Alcott did a wonderful job in writing Little Women. I could relate to the book and with how the four sisters were at home with their mother and their father was off doing military things. I grew up with a father in the Navy and he was gone a lot. My mom, brother and I had to take care of things while he was gone. Life goes on even if the whole family is not together.I fell in love with the Little Women at a young age and I hope to read this book to my children as they get older... This is a great book for teaching these things to children."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A timeless tale of four sisters struggling their way through life during the Civil War. I have read this book more times than I can count, and I still love it. Once I pick it up I can't put it down, lost in this seemingly fantasy world, which was actually quite true more than 100 years ago.My favorite thing about Little Women has to be the characters. Jo, the day-dreaming tomboy, Meg, pretty and proper, Beth, the quiet sweetheart, and little Amy, our artist, who always tried to grow up too fast. Then of course there's Laurie, the tall fun-loving boy-next-door, and so many other fabulous personalities (Aunt March, Fredrick Bauer, Hannah, Marmie, etc.) that I couldn't possibly name them all.This book is one that I think everyone absolutely MUST read some time in their life, for it teaches moral values that should be used by people of all ages.

It still dared to tackle subjects previously taboo. (For Little Women, it was daring to show girls with personalities, for Brady Bunch, it was new to show blended families.)The world was never like this--even Alcott's own life was not. She idealized a miserable childhood into something that would sell: a noble, genteel poverty that conveniently appeals to today's nostalgiacs. If you enjoy that, great. Just keep some perspective.Belongs in classes studying how literature has changed."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"My mother, an avid reader, always introduced books to me and &quot;Little Women&quot; is one of them. But I eventually rejected it after looking through it. It simply isn't my cup of tea because I don't really related to four proper ladies during the 1800s who all eventually got married off and produced offspring, including Jo, who was supposed to be &quot;tomboyish&quot; and independent-minded. Additionally, it may be a little too cloyingly sentimental for me to stomach. But however, if it is a good, well-written book with inspiring characters, especially women living in the 19th century, then I guess I'd recommand it to anyone who would like it nevertheless."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little women are the perfect compliment to little men. Large men can like them too, however, if they are careful."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women's Dreaming GlassesI have always had extremely vivid dreams. While asleep, I have been known to shout out loud to people in my life who are hard-of-hearing; speak French; throw punches; laugh; and carry on lengthy one-sided conversations. Throughout these dramas, I am treated to Technicolor images playing on the back of my eyelids.At one point in my life, a friend suggested I talk with a psychologist who was well-known for her expertise in deciphering dreams. To be honest, I was pretty skeptical. It sounded like either fortune-telling, or a waste of my time, or perhaps both. Talking with this woman, however, turned out to be incredibly helpful. She did not tell me about myself, my life, or my dreams: instead, as the best guides do, she gave me the tools to find my own insights.Surely, this is what our best writers and most influential teachers have done for us, as well. When people write a good story, or help us to interpret those stories, they are offering us a new set of glasses to try on - a set of glasses through which we may catch a different way of looking at ourselves and our world. These glasses, whether they are labeled \\"Marxist\\", \\"Christian\\", \\"Feminist\\", \\"Jungian\\", or what-have-you, may give us deeper insight into parts of our own personality, or they may give us a view of a part of the world we've never even considered.In the case of the above-mentioned psychologist, she suggested I look at each object or person in my dream and see it as a representation of ...ME. So, the ugly couch is me; the thunderstorm in the background is me; the broken teapot is me, as is the table it is sitting on .... This may not help me understand every aspect of my dreams, nor every dream I have, but it is a great starting point. I have also found this to be true in my personal reading. Even if the purpose of reading a certain book is to learn about something completely foreign to you, it helps to get a foothold by finding a familiar aspect, something to which you can relate.Recently, I started reading Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\". This lovely little book is, unfortunately, one of many of the \\"classics\\" that I have never read. Despite the fact that I love to read, I do find \\"The Canon\\" (capitals completely intentional) rather daunting. I was surprised, then, to find myself wholly sucked in to what could be criticized as a overly simple, moralizing story, written too long ago to be relevant, in words which may now seem stilted. What could Jo, Amy, Beth, and Meg have to say to a modern woman, more than 130 years later? Why, as I devour the pages of their story, do I feel such love and sympathy for them?And then, I realize, in the clarity of thought that often comes as I put down a book for the night and just before sleep takes me, that these characters are ... ME. Scholars and historians who have studied the life and writings of Louisa May Alcott attest to the autobiographical aspects of \\"Little Women\\", and how Louisa created the character of \\"Jo\\" to represent herself. As I am reading, I sympathize with Jo - her stubbornness, her tomboyish ways, her fierce loyalty to her sisters and her family, her writing, her bossiness. So, at first, I say, \\"I am Jo.\\" But then I realize I relate to Beth, too, especially as members of her family protect her, with her perhaps overly sensitive heart, and her health problems. And - admit it, ladies, even the toughest among us - who doesn't want, in some corner of her soul, to be \\"petted\\" and admired at times, like the little princess Amy wants to be; or to be the nurturer, older sister, eventual wife and mother, Meg. And, hey, guys, who knew that \\"Little Women\\" might be a better guide to understanding the females in your life than anything contemporary pop psychologists are writing?And so, with the help of this classic, I have touched base with parts of myself I haven't acknowledged in a while. The way symbols and themes and people may show up in your dreams, though you haven't consciously thought of them for a long time. This is why the great stories truly last.Author of \\"Hobo Finds A Home\\" editor \\"Of A Predatory Heart\\""},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is okay but it is DEFINETLY not the best. Meg, Jo, Beth and Amys' father has gone to war and they all have their own problems.

I did not enjoy her style of writing at all. Another factor that lead to me not liking this book is that it was from the 1800's. Young teens like me are not into these types of boring \\"1800's\\" books. This book was a torture to read. You might ask, \\"what was going through your mind as you were reading this book?\\" Well, to all of those people out there, my answer is \\"boring!\\" Louisa explained everything that was going on... only a little bit too much. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a mature mind and enjoys reading classic style books."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The rating is for THIS edition of the book, feminist ideologue Elaine Showalter's genital revisionism blots the text everywhere. Nor is the theme concerned with the &quot;tension between social responsibility &amp; individual and artistic freedom&quot; except in the fevered dreams of academic collectivists obsessed with &quot;group identities&quot; who have instigated more cultural disintegration then anyone since the anarchist 60's by eroding all Individual Responsibility &amp; intellectual standards. Since acquiring a CEO from Disney the Penguin Classics once a distinguished series has become largely a pulpit for multiculturalists, feminists, post-colonial theorists and academic careerists brainwashed by Edward Said to &quot;re-frame&quot; &quot;de-construct&quot; and deface in the name of a politically reductive, emotionally vacuous jihad against Western Culture.

There was absolutely no humor and I frankly didn't care what happened to the very unreal characters. The four sisters were too different to be actually related and Beth was too much of an angel. At the end of the novel, I did not find that I was attached to any of the characters.The book did not give me any emotional satisfaction and there were too many plots going at once.However, I will give some points to the quality of the plot. It was very realistic and surprising. Set during and after the Civil War, the March sisters(Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy)struggle to grow up and, if not conquer, at least suppress their worst faults.In short: This is an okay book, but I would never reread it.Recommended instead: Anne of Green Gables series(characters are much more satisfying)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Our favorite charcter was Amy.

I liked the romance in the story, and how there was a little sadness in the book as well. This book was also definately worth reading even though it was long.

It was a book that was hard to put down, with all the struggles and problems the characters overcame in it.

It shows not only feeling and emotion on the part of Mrs. Alcott, but of these four girls, who by the 2nd page, feel like family. No one could ever guess that this beautiful story is fiction. It seems imposible that such intrecate detail can come from the imagination of another. I was read to this book when I was very young, but only did I understand it's full meaning until reading it again recently. This is a classic book that is not to be missed.

I love it and a whole family can read it !"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This timeless novel appeals not only to the young, but to the seasoned reader as well. None have captured the hearts and minds of the feminine creature as has this famed American author. Whether the reader desires a realistic period piece or a touching story about life, love, death and the human condition, Alcott covers all the bases. Few women can come away from &quot;Little Women&quot; without having made a connection to the personalities which transcend the constraints of the time the novels reflects. Jo is every author's heroine. Beth, our picture of healthy mind, healthy soul, and healthy spirituality. Meg is the mother-to-be in us all, and Amy the ill-tempered blossom who grows to the beautiful woman (inside and out) that we all dream we are. Classic novels are more than artillery for our educational arsenal, they are explorations of ourselves. &quot;Little Women&quot; does not disappoint to be all that and much more."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott weaves a wonderful and touching tale about the March sisters:Amy,Meg,Beth and Jo.The way she describes it,tells the story,has a touch of old-fashioned charm in it,taking one back to the days of long gowns,bonnets,rich lords and ladies and the such.The four sisters' personalities are also vividly described in Louisa Alcott's eyes."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This story is very interesting and good.It talks about alot of different things, like sorrows, mishaps, love, etc.I especcially like Jo."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"a very nice story. you can read it as many times as you want. it is always fresh."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A timeless tale that has a special place in all of our hearts, Little Women. The magical story of four girls having adventures while they lay in wait for their father to come home from the Civil War. In this tale, Meg, the eldest, marries Mr. John Brooke, Teddy's tutor, and has the life she always wanted, like her mother. Meg moved down he road from her family, and had twins, Demijohn and Daisy, becoming the model mother she always wanted to be. After Jo had \\"scorned\\" Teddy's love for her, Teddy went off to Europe to sulk. Around that time, Beth was getting weaker. With all this stress, Jo went away to New York. There, she met Professor Bhaer. She fell in love with him as he helped her to cultivate her writings, helping her to write a book based on her childhood. He promised her that he would help her get it published. Beth was getting sicker and sicker, so Jo went home to help Beth. Beth died in Jo's arms. Professor Bhaer came to the March's doorstep to give Jo her published book. He asked Jo to marry him, she said yes. When Aunt March died, Jo inherited her plantation. She realized, I love boys, why not fill this house with boys that she would grow to love. So the plantation became \\"Jo's School for boys.\\" The rooms were filled with the boys that she loved very much. Amy went abroad with Aunt March to help cultivate her art. There she met the crabby, snobbish, horrid side of Teddy that had come out because of Jo's answer. The more time they spent together in Europe, the more time they got to grow to love each other. They were married in Europe and Amy got the wealth and prominence she longed for as a child. This book is a wonderful tale for all. We all should read this book in our life. It belongs in our lives.This book had very detailed characters. Teddy is so detailed in the book, and you can actually hear them talking and his point of view on things. When Teddy got in a fight with Mr. Laurence, his grandfather, about going to college, he was so mad that when Jo meekly knocked on his door, he fired a mean insult and threatened to hurt his grandfather if he knocked one more time. Amy, at times, can be very nice in the story, but other times she was lying to make herself seem bigger than she was, and would even the score pretty well. When Jo, Teddy, Meg, and John Brooke went to the theater, Amy begged and pleaded to go, but Jo was firm, when she said no, she meant no. As they were leaving, Amy yelled at the top of her lungs to Jo, and said, I will get you back! (Not the exact words) When they came back from the theater, Jo wanted to write, but she could not find her book. She asked around, and then saw Amy watching the fire burn her book! Jo started yelling that she hated her and never wanted to talk to Amy ever again. Amy never even said she was sorry. Jo gets very fired up when something bad happens to one of her friends or family. When Amy was in school, she got in trouble, and the teacher struck her hand, and she had to stand up in front of the whole class, humiliated. When Jo heard about this, she was yelling, writing nasty letters, and was thinking about go down there and giving that teacher a piece of his mind.This story was very realistic. When Meg received John Brooke's invitation to wed, she refuses. Again and again, John asks, but she still says no. Rich, snobby Aunt March \\"overhears\\" and commends Meg for making such a decision, because John is dirt poor and money is one of the things that makes marriage run smoothly. Meg is appalled that Aunt March would say that. Aunt March also said that if she didn't marry in wealth, she would be cut out of her will. Meg tells Aunt March off, and tells her that John is a kind; caring, man and He would love her whether she was dirt poor or a princess. Then she realizes that she does love John, and she accepts the invitation to wed. Jo was asked to wed by Teddy, but she said no. The reason she said no was because they would always fight, like they did, with both of their tempers, they would never have a calm, cool, and collected argument, and they would never be really happy. Of course, Teddy did not understand at the time, but what Jo was trying to say was that she didn't want to be trapped in an unhappy marriage. Lastly, when Professor Bhaer proposed to Jo, He told her that his hands were empty. That meant that he would not have any money and could never buy the things that she would like. She replied, that his hands weren't empty anymore, and then she put her hands in his. This meant that she didn't care whether he had money or not, as long as he loved her, for she never cared about money, social status, or new clothes. She just loved Professor Bhaer.This book was very long. I loved this book, but she kept explaining every single little detail. When Beth died, she didn't just die, she died with an expression on her face. An expression that showed that she was content and ready to die, because she knew that there was nothing that the doctor could do. An expression that sent Jo into crying uncontrollably when Jo died. An expression to make Hannah, the Marches \\"live in cook\\", into sobbing while she was cooking, and saying \\"Too young, she was too young. She had so much strength left. See what I mean? When Amy burned Jo's book she was writing, Jo kept thinking about it, which made her even madder. When Jo and Teddy went ice staking on the pond, Amy came, but Jo and Teddy ignored her. Then, Amy fell under the ice. After that, Jo beat herself up over being mean to Amy, she even thought about either running away, or being Amy's eternal servant. When Jo was apologizing to Amy, tears were flowing and flowing down her face, and, one half of the chapter was about Jo regretting ever being mad at her. During the book, Demi, Meg's son, would get out of the bed during the night to be with his mother. John would not allow this, so every time he got up, John would take him back to his room, talk to him about why he should not get up and pop his bottom. This would go on for pages and pages without any progress. Finally, he stopped.This book is for everybody. I suggest for those to have the patience to read a book this long, I quite enjoyed it for it was a challenge; to read it and meditate on the lessons it shows usB. Rimando"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have a very special place in my heart for this book, & not only because I really learned to LOVE reading as I enjoyed this book for the first time, but also because of its characters & heart-warming story. It truly is a coming of age tale of the March sisters & their unbreakable bond through all of the tough times that life places before us.In my opinion, this book was very relateable with situations that many of us as readers have encountered. For me, it was very nice to see such a close-knit family who loves each other so much, as opposed to the broken family homes turning up in novels so often today. (And don't get me wrong, I know how important it is to portray the 'broken' homes too-I come from one myself.)Another reason why I loved this book was because of the warm & endearing bond that the March sisters shared. I never had a sister & having the chance to peek into such a relationship between these sisters was very much so enjoyable for me.This novel is well-written & has obviously withstood the test of time for it is just as well-loved now as it was five, ten, or twenty years ago!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When i was sixteen, my favorite book in the world was little women. i identified very much with jo march, a tomboyish girl who loves to read, go for \\"larks\\" with her best friend (the neighbor, a boy named laurie), has a short temper and dreams of one day becoming a published author.i longed for the companionship jo had with her three sisters, the short \\"romance\\" and the longterm firendship she had with laurie, her sucess as a writer, and finally, her romance with the german, Professor Bhear.this book is comical, witty, and has a wonder and warm sense of family life for those of us who hunger and thirst for love and belonging."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is a classic favorite, especially for girls from the age of about 11-14 (depending of the reading level of the girl). Its made all the better for this age set because there are sequels- \\"Little Men\\" and \\"Jo's Boys\\" which continue the saga of the March sisters. The lives of these girls is related in an exciting way- sometimes gently moralizing (19th century middle class Protestant Christian values), sometimes sad, sometimes innocently romantic. The book is a good gift for any young girl who likes historical fiction, and has always been a treasured hand-me down in our family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I first read this book when I was 29 years old, and I was really quite amazed. I was inspired to pick it up after seeing the opera \\"Little Women\\" by Mark Adamo, and I have to say that the book is really quite a lot better (and different, to my way of thinking) than the opera.Rather than being a ponderous, dull book, this was actually quite a good read. It's straightforward, making it accessible to kids, but it held my interest as well. There's not really a single well-defined plot, but rather a series of episodes in the characters' lives over several years, with a few common threads running through them.This is the type of book I would like my children to read someday (boys or girls!). Besides the obvious emphasis on family life, a very important underlying theme is an emphasis on virtue. In each \\"episode\\", the girls (and the boys too) learn something, \\"build character\\", or increase in virtue in some way, and the lessons they learn carry through the rest of the book. I found that incredibly refreshing in our post-modern age! (Contrast with the common notion today that \\"personality\\" is a rather privileged, self-defined thing, and challenges or obstacles must be negotiated so that the character can basically maintain his or her own unique identity, warts and all). Also an important theme in the book is finding our role in service to others - that we do not live simply according to our own whims and fancies. Sometimes we have duties in life that may seem unpleasant, but it is in the performance of said duties that we find fulfillment.*spoiler warning*Another common theme that I see running through this is that, through their marriages, each of the characters is given the opportunity to become a better person. So while we might wonder wistfully at what may have been with Laurie that Jo, in the end it is Amy that allows Laurie to grow into a virtuous and responsible man, and the Professor that allows Jo to move beyond her own self-interest. Similarly, Meg and John have a positive effect on each other, despite various trials.Perhaps this all sounds very old fashioned. The book is very clearly grounded in 19th Century Christian values. But a look at this book suggests that such notions are still very relevant today!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"My God-mother gave me this book. After chapter one, I was hooked, but since I'm not usually into the \\"classics\\", I was quite surprised at how much I liked it. I read this book in about 3 or 4 days. It's a must read. Read this one. Your eyes will thank you later."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Much to my delight I read this book after a semester of boring classes and this was the PERFECT distraction. Even as an adult (almost there anyway), I could identify with nearly all of the March sisters, moved to tears and laughter throughout the whole book. I recommend Little Women to everyone especially young girls - you will absolutely treasure this book. Another reviewer said it best - this book will make you late!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is one of the most touching tales ever written, a classic. It is also one of the best books, along with Leah's Way and the Red Tent, ever written about women. You know it's a great book when it can still be read with the same joy that has thrilled readers for decades and decades. This book never gets old, and it will inspire future generations and generations. I wish more contemporary books strove for this kind of permanancy."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is just as much fun to read at the age of 33 as it is at 13. I laughed out loud and stifled sobs throughout the book as we watch the four March girls - Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth - turn from young girls to young wives. As I read, I worried that that description sounded a bit boring although it really is an entertaining book. Then it dawned on me that, as each chapter is a small vignette from the progress of their lives, this is a lot like watching Little House on the Prairie. This would be an exceptional book to read to children and is quite enjoyable for women of all ages to read for themselves.It was a bit of a blow when reading the afterword to find that Louisa Alcott did not like the book. She had been pressured into writing it by her publisher and regarded it as \\"moral pap for the young\\", calling the first part \\"The Pathetic Family\\" and writing an alternative second part she called \\"Happy Women\\" in which the sisters flourished in professional careers in a community of spinsters. \\"Good Wives\\" obviously won out and I can't say that I am not happy about that.One thing the book and the afterword did do is awaken an interest in Louisa May Alcott herself. This might be a wonderful place to start on a women's study given the disparity between the work produced and the authors ideals.Whether you are interested in reading it for sheer enjoyment or as a \\"jumping off point\\" for broader studies, you will enjoy the book. It is almost impossible not to."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a wonderful little book -a definite GREAT BUY!

Why wait any longer to buy this great book which should become a family classic in your family as it is in mine.?"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"While this book is often relegated to \\"girl's fiction\\", Little Women should be read by anyone interested in American literature and history. Little Women is based on Alcott's life at home with her sisters, mother and father, but is in no way a biography. She transforms personal disappointment and loss into a story of close family love, personal growth, moral duty and fulfillment.The writing is humorous, sentimental, a bit moralistic (which was the style at the time--the height of the religious revival in America.) The characters are true--because they were taken from Louisa's own sisters and parents. \\"Laurie\\" may be David Thoreau, a neighbor for whom Alcott may have had an unrequited love.This is one of my favorite novels. I loved it as a child and I love it still."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is my favorites. This book is about four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. These sisters are very differnt. Meg, who dreams of having a husband and a family. Jo, who is a tomboy and who dreams of being a published writer. Beth, who is nice and sweet and loves to play the piano. Amy, who is vain and a good artist. Everytime I read this book, I cry. If you have or do read this book you know why. A very touching story."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a really great book! If you haven't read it yet, READ IT TODAY!!! It's a great book that reads all too quickly. It's very strongly emotioned,so just about the only people I wouldn't recommend it to are people who are ashamed to cry! Other than that,I think it's the perfect book for anyone above the fourth grade level!!! It's got all the ups and downs of a great roller coaster;except sometimes the cars collide on this roller coaster, and you don't know whether to laugh hysterically, or to ball your eyes out! Among other things, I loved the characters! They were very well written and easy to relate to. The best thing about this book (to me, anyway)is that it's about life. It's about how it feels to grow up, to be a woman, and to deal with more hardships than I can count! It's better than any soap opera or movie, so what are you doing just sitting there on your computer?!?

It is a charming story about 4 sisters, Meg (Margaret), Jo (Josephine), Beth( Elisabeth), and Amy. The book includes the truth about real life.

I was first attracted to the book because of the obvious factor: the youngest and most rebellious had the same name as me! I first read the children's edition to get the main idea of the story, then bought the original novel and read that. I was captivated by Alcott's style of writing and subtle-ness at important parts of the story so that the reader can decide for themselves what was about to or already has happened.I would suggest this book to anyone because it inspired me and I hope it will inspire somebody else."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When it's cold outside, they huddle together. When they are sad, they are sad together. When they are poor, they work through it together. They are always there for each other. Little Women, by Louisa May Alcott was published on September 30, 1868. Even though that was over 100 years ago, it still captures the heart and attention of the majority of its readers. After their father was shipped off to war, Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth March lived with their mother, or \\"Marmee\\" as they normally called her. They lived a life together, and although they never seemed to have enough of anything, they almost always got along. They were very few moments when they didn't. The daughters are fairly creative and act out plays that Jo wrote by herself in her free time. None of them were old enough to work yet, so the family struggled together to stay together. At one point the March family was having so much financial trouble that Jo decides she has to do something for the family. She was very dedicated to keeping their family together. She must have felt that since they had so little to begin with, losing anything more would be unbearable. Jo went out and sold her beautiful long brown hair in order to earn money for the family. Back then, long hair was everything, so for her to cut it so drastically was a huge deal. Jo wants nothing more than for her family to be happy. This book doesn't really remind me of any other books. In most books, family problems and arguments are normal occurrences. However, in this book, family came first all the time. I think it should be that way, but realistically, that is not how most families work. Other books I have read are not very determined to show the bond a family maintains by spending time with each other. Also, I didn't like the way they kept their opinions to themselves during this story. I think that people are very open with their feelings, especially towards family members, but in this book they weren't. Even with the drawbacks I have mentioned about this book, I would still recommend it to everyone. It has a great storyline. I think it will make a place in your heart that will never close up."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is the best version of Little Women that I have ever read. It is the complete and unabridged version and the reader can tell that there's a difference. The story centers around four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy who are growing up during the Civil War.

A must read!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was delightful! I have wanted to read this book for many years and finally got to it, and I am SO glad! It is a wonderful story, full of charming characters, emotions, and situations which are amazingly relevant to todays world. I was truly surprised at how much the various situations in the book written nearly 150 years ago mimmick the same situations of today. For example, I laughed at the March girls getting ready to go to a dance, with all of their primping and preparations, burning their hair with a curling iron, etc. I could easily remember my own primping for school dances and picture my daughter and her friends getting ready for theirs. I was afraid that the language used might be quite stuffy or antiquated, given it is quite old, but didnt find that to be the case. I thought it amusing how often Alcott says they will have a \\"capital time\\". Obviously, the use of this phrase has not stood the test of time, but then again I wonder which phrases we use now will die with time too. The family goes through joys, troubles, and near tragedy, just as in real life. I cried when Beth was ill. I laughed at many of their antics. I loved the kind and quite manner of Mr. Bhaer. Laurie is such a treat and gives a nice balance to the girls. This is by far the best book I've read this year, and after reading it I only wish I would have read it sooner. I wanted the story to go on. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Fair pricing, Fair delivery charges, quick shipping, accurate descriptions of products and good products delivered.Met all expectations. Thank you so much."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Okay book very sad in some places because some people die but it is written so you almost feel like you are there."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Sorry , but I truly could not abide the narrator. Smarmy beyond tolerance. It the March girls were 5 or 6 years old I could perhaps understand the way their voices were characterized but considering they are teenagers.....well, intolerable. I really tried, but I could not listen for more than half an hour and then I was done. Too bad they didn't find a better narrator."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The first version of this book (which is this one) is so much better than the other versions!

The Barnes&Noble edition at their store is only about $10 and it's hardcover, you get the exact same words, PLUS ~ introduction, time-line, short bio of author, end-notes, and even questions and comments at the end about the novel... although I really love this painting on the Signet Classic paperback edition, the painting on this one is \\"Home Sweet Home\\"."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I quite enjoyed the book. Although it's long, I think it captures many readers because so many events happen, and so randomly.Little Women is the American classic tale about Margaret (Meg), Josephine (Jo), Beth (Elizabeth), and Amy growing up during the Civil War, with their mother, who they affectionately call \\"Marmee\\". Their father is off in battle, and while the girls are unhappy about being poor, they learn that they don't need that much to be happy.Meg is the eldest, at 16 at the start of the story. She has lovely dark hair, and is sensible and pretty. Jo is a regular tomboy who loves to write, and at one point cuts off her chestnut locks to help get money for her father. Beth doesn't have much of a physical description, but is very kind and sweet. Now Amy, who I don't like too much, has golden blond hair and blue eyes.This book was nice, but it rather focused too much on who's pretty and who's not. Laurie was a delightful character that added a lot to the book, however.I liked the chapters about Demi and Daisy, but I really didn't like the part when Jo dismissed Laurie, for I think they would have been perfect together. I also hated that selfish Amy went off and left poor Jo in misery so she could have a good time, AND stole Laurie away.While the outcome of the book is rather disappointing, this is truly a timeless tale of love and poverty, of life and death, and all the while very amusing."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I bought this edition of Little Women for my niece. I chose this edition because the product description mentions margin notes that provide a historical perspective. There are no margin notes! You get the great, classic story, of course, but the description is inaccurate. There are several illustrations, but be warned that the margin notes do not exist."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When I started reading this to my children, I had to read ahead. Soon I had finished reading it to me, but not to them! My oldest has since read it. I liked this book so much better than Little Men and Jo's Boys. Girls coming of age really strike a chord with me. I wish I'd discovered these as a girl!I would highly recommend this classic for girls and women alike. The stories are engaging enough for boys as well, if they can get past the title. :) It definitely belongs on my list of my 10 favorite children's books of all time."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Girls of all ages should read this book and come back to read it again as women. This novel is truly a treasure."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I usually only read Action/Adventure, so when my friend request that I read this book I just stared at her with a blank expression.I started reading and I could not get through the sentences fast enough. I laughed and I cried.This truly is a great read!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The loveable March sisters are easy to grow on you. For my recent (14th) birthday, my 16 year old brother gave me Little Women. I read it, and it took me a while, but it was totally worth it. Occasionally, I would have to re-read sections. But that helped me to understand it, which payed off in the long run. If you're thinking of purchasing this book, a word of advise: Go for it!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Oooh, I have for years wanted to read Little Women by Louisa May Alcott, and I finally got the chance. This book is so amazing, you actually learn to love each one of the characters, yes, even that selfish and smoiled 'Lady' Amy March. The story focuses on four charming yound ladies, Margaret 'Meg', Josephine 'Jo', Elizabeth, 'Beth' (Who by the way is my favorite) and Amy March, these girls are tought several and important lessons, some softly and some a little more harshly by one of their greatest teachers, their mother, Mrs. March, called sweetly by the girls as \\"Marmee\\".The story begins, slowly and happily in what seems like a perfect world, even if Father is away at war. The sisters make new friends, attend elegant parties, and each find small adventures of their own, at home, at school and everywhere. Of course, things change, dark days come along, Meg is falling in love with Mr. Brooke, Laurie's (The Marches' neighboor) tutor and Jo fears that her sister might soon leave them, and poor shy, sweet Beth gets the scarlet fever, who at the end has very serious and sad consequences.There are happy and sad moments in this wonderful masterpiece, and I recommend anyone to read and enjoy them as much as I did."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I am a young girl myself like this book very much because it gives girls like myself something to read that is not inappropriate. I really like this book because it gives me a look into how girls lives were when this book was written. Little Women is about the March family and their trials while Mr. March is at war. There are four girls Meg,Jo,Beth and Amy who expirence growing up in a society where you are judged by how much money you have. Eventhough they may be down on their luck they still manage to keep on giving to others that's what I really like about Little Women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book was really good. It tells you how you should do things thing when you grow up. It is a romantic love story between 3 girls, who are named Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Beth dies, in the middle of the book.

Intending to give it as a gift, I ordered this book because I was under the impression that it had the famous Jessie Wilcox Smith pictures. What a disappointment!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"How to review a beloved classic such as Little Women? I have been considering this question since finishing the book a few days ago.Hailed as one of the best books written for children, Little Women has stood the test of time and is still read by many today, clearing showing that most love this book...however, I did not enjoy it that much. This brings us to the difficulty in reviewing, as book critics, schoolteachers, and children the world over disagree with me.The writing is beautiful with descriptions of the girls, their home, and their lives..but I didn't really relate to any of the characters, even Beth or Jo, which would be the two most memorable of all the girls. I also wasn't caught up in the plot and found it easy to walk away from the book for days at a time.I would still recommend this novel as it gives a glimpse into another time and is an important piece of classic literature, but just don't expect it to be too riveting."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I've read \\"Little Women\\" several times through the years - the first time when I was about 10 years old I guess, and always enjoyed it.The story is simple and sweet, but I think it still carries a strong message about the strength in the bonds of women. Progressive for the time, Alcott presents in the March women different \\"types\\" - Meg, the pretty, domestic one; Jo, the tomboyish, independent rebel; Beth, the too-good-for-this-world moral angel; Amy, the flighty, spoiled, bratty princess - at least at first; and then Marmee, the redeemed wild child who is now their strength and moral compass. The men, while not maligned are almost incidental, serving as props to highlight the different personalities of the women.The characters are wonderfully developed, as we see them grow through the years. The setting is very well described - you can \\"see\\" the gardens and rooms. And again, having been written for young women, the writing is easy to read and follow, if a bit long-winded. Despite Jo's detailed character development, I feel her love story was rushed and not developed enough - as opposed to those of Meg and Amy. I imagine her relationship with Bhaer is delved into more in the sequel \\"Little Men\\", which I haven't read yet.Although I like the book very much I think it suffers in comparison with Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Even though the time frame of \\"Little Women\\" - during and after the Civil War - is almost 100 years later than \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" - late 18th century/early 19th century - I think Austen's classic feels more relevant.I definitely recommend \\"Little Women\\" to everyone, not just pre-teen and teen girls. It's a beautiful, well-told and surprisingly progressive story."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I first read this book when I was in third grade. I was about halfway through the book when I had to fling it across the room from me in utter horror. Eventually, the pull of the book was too strong: I picked it up, finished it, and sulked for a week. And ever since then, whenever I try to reread it, I end up tossing it across the room, screaming, pulling my hair: the characters just get under your skin. You *care* about what happens to them.The little women are Meg, Jo, Amy, and Beth. They have flaws, just like real people: Meg is vain, Jo is boyish, and Amy is a bit of a brat. Beth is utterly angelic, and can do no wrong. But while these may sound like pasted on personalities, they're not. Over the course of such a long book, you become deeply attached to the characters, and get to know and love them.The story centers primarily around tomboyish Jo. She is constantly getting into scrapes, but is dedicated to her family and goes to great lengths to prove it. It's a growing up story: we follow Jo from a carefree girl who whistles and runs outside to a wife who would give everything for her husband.Now for the bad: Louisa May Alcott is fond of injecting moral lessons into every chapter. That might have been nice in the 1800s, but now, it can seem a bit cloying. That said, the stories themselves are enjoyable enough if you can get past the morality.Further, this book offers some of the most emotionally dissatisfying scenes I've ever read. Hence me throwing the book across the room. I don't want to spoil it for you; you'll know it when you get to it. And you'll be as upset as I was. So be prepared.Overall, Little Women is a good family story with realistic characters. Young girls will probably enjoy it the most, but I think anyone can get something out of it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I must have read LITTLE WOMEN when I was about ten years old, yet, it is one of those exceptional examples of literature that stays with you years after you've first come to know the March sisters, their trials, triumphs, joys and sorrow. This beautiful book truly captures the strength of family, the courage one must exercise in the face of great adversity and the wisdom we are lucky to acquire if we get through it in one piece. Jo March is the epitome of the irrerepressible, hot-headed and adventurous tomboy. Her character was actually based on the personality of the author, Louisa May Alcott. Meg is the eldest and the most traditionally-minded, Beth is the more retiring, shy and selfless one and Amy is the selfish and strategic one. Together, they all are devoted to and have great respect for their mother, Marmee March, and await the arrival of their father who is serving as a chaplain for the Union Army.LITTLE WOMEN is the first book in a series chronicling the lives of these intriguing and well-developed characters. Even more than one hundred years later, this book still presents timeless themes of friendship, courage, dedication, faith and determination. It's not difficult to see why this story was retold so many times in film."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This version of Little Women is only half the book, the cover says complete and unabridged but that is not true. It is not complete; it is only Part 1, which is very disappointing when you're expecting the whole book.I have nothing against the story, that is not why I rated this product low, I just thought people should know its not all of the story and have to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I just love this book!!YOU should READ THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I had the great pleasure of reading the book \\"Little Women,\\" written by Louisa May Alcott, a story of real experiences and new feelings one experiences through the miracles of family and letting life take it's course; to live it to it's fullest. The March family is a true loving family who is as tightly woven as an old pair of blue jeans. In fact, they have as many stories to tell as old jeans that have been worn by so many. The March family had some hard times, but even burning of each others manuscripts can't put holes in their pockets. I believe this story is worth reading, because Louisa May Alcott defines si wekk in words how a family like the Marches can use their abilities for good and to learn a little more about life's true meaning. When I read this book I can see their life like I was a curious on-looker peering from behind a bookcase. I have become friends with these characters, and feel as if I had been a part of their noveled life. I became so engrossed in \\"Little Women,\\" when it was time for the light to go off I just realized that in fact I was not touring Europe with the Carroll's, I was laying on my old lumpy mattress with sleep nipping expectantly at my eyelids. To be truthful, the books I had been reading, such as \\"Babysitters Club\\" or \\"Vampires Don't Wear Polka Dots\\" hadn't been keeping me up so late that my light bulb flickered off with a sputter.There are not any faults in this wonderful story that my peering from behind the shelf could notice. It was as if Alcott wrote about her own real life and saw it from all her family's point of view.This book may be sad in some parts, but the blue jeans threads held it together. This was so inspirational to me I decided I should be a Beth or Jo. Maybe even a Meg or Amy. This book isn't just entertainment for the young (or even old) person's mind, but it is a lesson written to fit 400 pages. It can teach you about life, I recommend it greatly.I will not give away the ending, but here is the summary: a dear family holds on to each other through thick and thin, and with their friend's help they still are a family. The family gets smaller then bigger, and the book ends with one sentence, \\"Oh my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a greater happiness than this,\\" and this is where I end."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Alcott's 'Little Women' is delightful and heartwarming, ever since I started reading it at 10 years old. The novel never fails to show me how we all make mistakes, we all fail, and we all triumph. Some of my friends have told me the book is boring, slow-paced, and idealistic. Little Women is simply about a family facing trials during the Civil War, and every chapter presents a fresh situation with a good deal of humor too. Alcott's style allows you to feel you are one of the March family, and her development of all characters is fantastic. Her details and dialogue allow the story to flow smoothly, and I've learned a lot from this great piece of American literature. I never tire of reading Little Women. It's that wonderful."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I'm writing this review, not to tell you the classic story of Little Women, but to strongly advise you to buy this beautiful hardcover. I was amazed to find this very one on Amazon, because my mom gave me this version 23 years ago, for Christmas! I'd already read Little Women at least twice before she gave me this book. The pictures and layout of the book drew me in to read that book countless more times! Even now, I glance through the illustrations and remember how they enhanced my numerous readings. This is the perfect gift for a 10 year old girl (that was the age I received this), because she will keep it forever!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I am a 10 year old girl and i just finished reading little women. First of all i Loved this book! I would recomend this book to absolutly anyone!!!!!!!! Keep reading :)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I love \\"Little Women\\" by L.M. Alcott. It's a great book. Unfortunately whoever published this version left it full of spelling and punctuation mistakes! I can't believe it's sold like this. Didn't someone edit it???Very dissatisfied and will be returing it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I can't say I regret reading this book, since I did enjoy the descriptions of day to day life during a period of time in the U.S. (Civil War era) in which most writings of or about the time, focused on the war. Also, it is a classic and it's always fun to finally read something you've heard about for years. I have not seen the Winona Ryder movie version, but I'd like to, just to see how it compares to the book.Alcott's writing is provincial and preachy, though, and I thought her characters were two dimensional at most. I can't help imagining Marmee as a statue of the virgin Mary, with a frozen little smile on her face as she peers down on her children scattered around her. And Dad (what was his name?)! An image doesn't even form in my head about him. Jo rejecting Laurie is an interesting twist, but disappointing, especially when she falls for an old stodgy absent minded professor. Laurie was the only character given human qualities, and I couldn't help liking his grandfather, too. Beth was just unreal, and Meg was annoyingly subservient (I know, that was how things were back then). And how many times did her characters blush? If there was anything the sisters had in common, it was the propensity to change colors at the slightest whim. Otherwise, their qualities seemed mutually exclusive which, as another reviewer pointed out, doesn't seem realistic for sisters.To be fair, I realize this was written for a younger crowd than me, so I should not have expected edginess or depth. So there are my 3 stars."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"this is my favorite book of all time, one I re-read every year around Christmas time - nothing will ever be able to compare, even Pride and Prejudice (which is also one of my favorites).Little Women was originally written in two volumes: Little Women and then Good Wives; today these two books are combined, so will be my review... ((this may be a bit long of a review so bare with me - there is just soo much to cover in this book))Loosely based off of her own life, Alcott presents a story about four women who grow both individually and together as a family during times of trouble, turbulence, and peace. Each sister has their own hopes and dreams, and each sister finds their place in the world only after discovering heartache, pain, love, and loss. Jo, who is loud, rambunctious, hard headed and impatient, finds solace through her writing. She struggles greatly to find peace within her self and accept herself as she is. Meg, the oldest remembers a time when the March family was revered and was not in financial hardships, making it hard for her to accept life as is, all the while being kind and understanding to her young sisters. Beth, the quite and timid sister, who is always kind and sees the good in everyone and everything, desires nothing more than to remain at home with her family and dolls. Amy, the youngest of the sisters, is constantly concerned with how prime and proper she should look, act, and speak, but remains true to her character.Laurie, the boy next door, finds himself a home he never expected in the March household as he finds it hard to live up to his grandfather's expectations of him. He is seen as an older brother to all the sisters, never faulting in his devotion to them, that is until his feelings for Jo grow into something more. However, Jo is unable to see Laurie and he wishes and her desire to find her place in the world is never greater.You really see the divide between childhood and adulthood when each of the sisters go their own way: Meg gets married, Beth remains at home, Amy travels abroad to Europe, and Jo goes to New York (Laurie is also left to his own devices, first going off to college and then working for his grandfather in Europe). It is only when tragedy hits the sisters, are they all able to come back together, as new adult women.While this novel is filled with girls knitting, needlepoint, and darning (which were expected of women of the time), it goes much deeper than that. Alcott presents the constant struggle that many women had, and even many women of today, between their loyalties to their family as well as to theirselves, and trying to find a balance between the two. This is a wonderful novel that can teach anyone many different lessons about life and love and family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"this is my favorite book of all time, one I re-read every year around Christmas time - nothing will ever be able to compare, even Pride and Prejudice (which is also one of my favorites).Little Women was originally written in two volumes: Little Women and then Good Wives; today these two books are combined, so will be my review...

The story of four sisters - Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy and their trials, tribulations, joys, and life with their beloved mother Marmee appeals on so many levels. These young ladies go through so much, and bear it all stoically, especially with their father being away during the Civil War.Jo, the protagonist in this story is a strong-willed, independent-minded young woman and the character that appeals to me the most. She chafes against the strictures imposed against the women of her time, and struggles with her losses whilst trying to establish herself as a writer. The themes in this novel are varied - poverty, family, friendships, grief, and female emancipation and are deftly dealt with. This will always be a classic and one I hope to share with my own young daughter in the near future."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book for the first time 25 years ago. It was one of my favorite books as a child. Each of the girls is an amazing charactrer with her own strengths.I love this book as much today a I did when I first read it.

They are the March family, and they consist of Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, guided by their loving \\"Marmee\\" while their father is away in the war.We first meet the \\"little women\\" when the older two are in their teens and the younger two are approaching those adolescent years. We follow their progress as they learn life's lessons via their beloved \\"Pilgrim's Progress.\\" We see their faith tested, and the goodness they strive for is elusive--especially for Jo and Amy.ThroughoutLittle Women (Signet Classics), we observe the warmth and nurturing they receive and which others long for but never achieve.I first read this book as a child; in fact, I read it over and over, until some of the more memorable moments were so completely ingrained that they became part of who I was at that time in my life.Now, many years later, I reread it, wondering what I would think and feel about this book. Would my own experiences in those interim years somehow change the story for me? Would my love of this book lessen because I am in a different place now? Well, I am happy to report that I read and achieved each milestone with the March family, all over again, with joy and delight; I remembered and celebrated those moments, almost as if I were reading them for the first time, yet with the extra special glow that comes from reexamining a beautiful treasure from the past.This adventure in reading was well worth it. Next I will be rereading some of the other Alcott books, knowing that I will surely enjoy them (again) as well.I am awarding this wonderful book five stars."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Somehow I missied this classic growing up and only downloaded it as I was looking for something to read with substance that was free. What a lovely tale. Definitely on my list of alltime favorites. I am now inspired to peruse more \\"great classics\\" I passed over in favor of NYT bestsellers in the past. Thank you Amazon."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I think the title of this book is wrong. They are women, but they aren't little. They are very mature for their ages. Beth is 13, almost like me, but she acts like she is Meg's age and above. Amy is a little whiner. She dislikes her nose and loves to paint. Jo is a dreamer. She has all the dreams of writing and such. Meg is the oldest. She has a job as a governess for two little kids. Little Women is a great book, although it gets a little lengthy."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I admit...I watched the movie so much to the point where I can recite it word for word. It is one of the best. Just to let you know it is the one that has the cast of: Susan Sarandon, Clair Danes, Kirsten Dunst, and Winona Ryder.The book was so lovely. It naturally has a lot more detail and happenings than the movie. Oh I loved it. It is a great classic. And it is deffinately in my top five."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women, a classic novel written by Louisa May Alcott, is about four girls coming of age during the Civil War. It tells of the lessons they learn and how love conquers all. Even though I had seen the movie before I read the book, I found the book to be intriguing, romantic and kept me hooked from the beginning. The one aspect of this book I did not care for was how the author described relationships or objects, which went on for sometimes pages at a time. That was the only downside, beside it being over 750 pages and not letting me read any other books for a month.Otherwise, this was an excellent novel that I will remember and keep as one of my treasured books; it has taught me many lessons that I will remember always."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book Little Women, is about four sisters, Meg March,Jo March, Beth March, and Amy March, and their mom Marmee. The mother is rearing the four girls to be loving, responsible young women.They are living in the time of the Civil War. Marmee teaches them values that will result in happiness for each of them.The values would make them happy throughout their lives. The most important lesson Marmee teaches her daughters is love,and how to overcome their hardships.They achieved these things by through God, and the love of each other.Meg was the oldest at age sixteen. Meg was pretty and had soft hair. She worked because her dad lost his job and they needed money. Meg was a happy child. She sang with her sisters.Jo was the second oldest at age fifteen.

Its story of family love, loyalty, fun, daily life experiences, and sacrifice in difficult times is an inspiration to all readers. It is one of my favorite youthful reading memories!..."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book, Little Women, written by Louisa May Alcott, is the most captivating book I have ever read. I watched, and fell in love with the movie, but I never realized how much more I would get out of it, by reading the book. The famous saying, \\"Money can't buy you happiness\\", really shows through in this book. Living in the 1800's, during the Civil War, and very little money, the March family shows what little things can make you happy.At the beginning of the book, the four daughters are introduced, but as you continue reading, you become apart of their lives. Alcott really has a way of bringing out each character, and making them so strong and powerful. Meg, who is very mature and grown up, thinks about getting married and taking care of children. Jo, is the tomboy and doesn't seem to take anything seriously. Beth is the most selfless, and is always willing to do anything to help others. Young Amy tries so hard to be perfect and loved by society, but is spoilt and selfish. The March family is faced with many trials and tribulations, and fight so hard to overcome them, especially the death of a loved one. Through everything that they go through, they stay positive, and continue to follow their dreams.Reading this book, helped me to find the importance of family. No matter what happened to this family, they were always able to turn to each other for love and support. This is how I want to be able to live my life. Not to be poor, but to have such a strong bond within my family.I have read this book once, and I plan on reading it many times over, and hopefully passing it on to my daughter when she is old enough to read and understand it. I recommend this book to any women, whether they are young or old. I hope that whoever does choose this book, apreciates it as much as I did, and always will."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"With these four girls growing up together many other girls can easily relate to many of the simple problems that they encounter even though this takes place so long ago. From hair, dances, boys, and growing up. Little Women is a timeless classic that all are sure to enjoy forever!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a period piece no mistake. I recall being quite mystified by certain aspects when I first read it at twelve. If the Marches are so poor how come they have a maid? (today household help is a luxury, back then it was a necessity. One woman simply could *not* run a home alone) What's so awful about having to work for a living? (middle and upper class girls were supposed to be supported in idleness by their fathers until marriage, having a job was quite declasse) I was fascinated by the idea of school being optional, (No public schools back then, and no truancy laws) and I'd never heard of 'Pilgrims Progress'.Yet dispite the increasing alieness of 19th century life most young girls fall in love with Little Women at some point in their development and I was no exception. I think it is character of Jo who captivates us. It is with her, restless and unconventional, that most of us modern girls identify not with goody-goody Meg, or pathetically saintly Beth or spoiled Amy."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Growing up in the March house is no easy task. Four girls growing up during the Civl War was hard for tomboyish Jo, gentle Beth, helpful Meg and exciting Amy. When they meet their wealthy nieghbor, Laurie, life becomes anything but boring. They go through spring days and trials together. As the sisters go from girlhood to womenhood, they find their selves going through life changes they never imagined they would go through. So dive into the wonderful adventures of \\"Little Women\\" as they learn life changing lessons."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Do you have sisters? Whether you do or not,read Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. You'lllaugh and cry as you join the girls' journeys ingrowing up.

I bought this copy because I wanted a nice, hardbound version and I liked the illustrations."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"An adorable book that may seem long at times.The story is about a family with four daughters,Meg,Jo,Beth and Amy. The book opens when the father is away at war. It is Christmas time and the girls and their mother, whom they call Marmee, haven't much to live on but love. This book is a recounting of their lives, until three of them get married and have babies of their own.The book ends with them all attending a birthday party, and eachrealizing that they couldn't be happier for they all have whatthey always dreamed of.As I said before, this book is overlong at places. Iprefer to watch my soap operas on tv. And some of the words were British, and I never did find out what they meant. Other than those faults, it was a grand book, and I give it a rating of 3.5 stars:)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book month ago. I love it. Lousia May used her childhood stories wrote this book. In the book there was Meg who was a really lady like Louisa's older sister Anna, there is Beth, who is my favarite, she may be sick, but she is a very nice girl; there was a Amy who love to paint, and of course there is the tomboy Jo, who may be a girl but a tomboy in her heart. This book tell the stories that the four March sister have while their father are away. They have some awasome advangers. If you like to knew about Louisa May Alcott, you should read this book, Jo acted a lot like Louisa May herself. I like is book very much it's wonderful."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have been wanting to read LITTLE WOMEN since I was in BYE BYE BIRDIE in high school because of an allusion made to the book by Rosie Alvarez and Albert Peterson. However, like many books I wish to read, I never got around to it until recently when I was required to read it for an adolescent literature class.LITTLE WOMEN was the book that brought Louisa May Alcott fame, fortune, and freedom. It has become an American literary classic and is probably more popular today than when it was first published. The story explores the lives of the four March sisters and the trials and tribulations they go through while growing up during the mid 1800's in the New England. The book is somewhat long, but easy to read. It contains many ethical and moral lessons. The book primary appeals to girls and women, but men can enjoy and learn from the book, too. The Penquin Classic edition of the text includes a rather dry introduction by Elaine Showalter.I thoroughly enjoyed reading LITTLE WOMEN. It has all sorts of great messages about faith, love, and life. It's a great book and I now know why it is Albert Peterson's favorite novel."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Oh,my sweet Lord I love this book!How original and captivatingcan one book be?From a girl who L-U-V-S Harry Potter ,Redwall,Chronicles of Narnia,The lost years of Merlin,Artemis Fowl,His Dark Materials,and the like,this book was quite out of theordinary.But I found this book thoroughly ripping and a smashinggood read.What a marvelous book!Warm and tender with a lot of TLC(tender Loving Care)!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I think the title of this book is wrong.

Beth (the second youngest) catches a disease and her sisters care for her. At the end, Christmas is very special because their father comes home from war. I think only girls should read this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a good book overall. There are enjoyable, funny, romantic and sad parts in the book, but sometimes it was too detailed and descriptive. I did like the closeness of the family shown throughout the book through good times and bad. I like how they all learn about life while they're growing up together. I would probably have to read it again to fully understand it and get all that it has to offer.I also like the richness of the characters. Jo, the tom-boy, Meg, the pretty, mature one, Beth, the sweet, shy one, and Amy the artistic, prim and proper one. They are fun characters to read about along with Laurie, Marmee, Aunt March, and others.I definatly think this is a good novel to read because it is a classic and it would be a good one to read to learn more about the time period.I just wish it wasn't so long."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book is the coming-of-age story of four sisters. In a very precise way, their lives together are documented in accordance with the times - of what's expected of them as women and what contradictions arise and also social situations that demand attention to several of the sisters.The characters are almost unreal - they're so exaggerated that one cannot help to relate SOMEHOW although weakly to any of them. Even the trials and tribulations warrant a very soft feel to them. I found myself emotionally detached to most of the situations and was scanning after near half of the reading and I feel as if I had gotten just as much out of it as I had previously.If you're going to read it, be a 7 or 8 year old girl learning the value of friendship and family and other kindly things that involve morals, love, and adaptation to change.Otherwise, read Anne of Green Gables instead. It offers just as much and more... esp. with entertaining situations that as compared to the reviewed are so much more the delightful."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Please note that I am rating this particular edition of the novel. The book itself is surprisingly wonderful and easily deserves five stars. This particular edition, however, is flawed.

To ensure that your reading pleasure is not disrupted, please consider getting another edition of this fantastic book!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book after talking with a friend of mine about it. She said I would enjoy it because of the historical setting (Civil War). I took her advice end enjoyed reading it. It gives a look at the social history of the time which is all too often over looked by many authors, something about battles and war being more interesting. Don't let the title fool you, men and women will enjoy this great piece of literature despite some of the questionable events (A man marrying a women 20 years or so his junior was more acceptable back then)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book was so good, that it has come up to be one of my favourite books!If you haven't read it, then you must read it!I know you will not regret it!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I am genuinely baffled by the degree of devotion this book still inspires based on the reviews at this site. I remember trying this book as a girl and disliking it; I gave it another try now on vacation, at the age of 47. I still dislike it. The characters are caricatures and speak in stilted dialogue unlike that of any real people--much less interesting people. Don't misunderstand--I like good nineteenth century novels. In fact, I love Dickens, Trollope, the Brontes, George Eliot, Mrs. Gaskell, etc. This book is a pale imitation of those--a mere period piece."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I just recieved this treasured book from my childhood along with Little Men and Jo's Boys and now I am in the Christmas spirit.

I loved it so much I got it on my kindle."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book has become one of my favorites. I don't know what took me so long to read it, I've seen the movie version a few times.The four March sisters named Meg, Jo, Amy & Beth live in a cozy home with their mother 'Marmee' while their father is away in the Civil War. The family was wealthy at one time, but it is hinted that he helped a friend who did not repay the debt, and that is how the family ended up living in poverty. The girls do feel sad having so little, but their mother reminds them that they have more blessings than most.The one thing I didn't like about this book was that it got real 'cheesy' at times. At one point Jo and her professor are singing together out loud in front of family, him in his German accent none the less...lol. It also tends to get 'preachy' as well at times. Looking past that, I highly recommend Little Women. I found it to be a 'comfort book', a very sweet read. It's about family, friends and love."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"In researching whether or not this is \\"half a book\\" I found the following information: Alcott wrote a second part, which was published in 1869. Both parts were called Little Women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. Part II picks up three years after the events in the last chapter of the first part Little Women (\\"Aunt March Settles The Question\\"). In 1880, the two parts were combined into one volume, and have been published as such in the United States ever since. In the UK, the second part was published under the title Good Wives, though Alcott had no part in the decision.So, I guess you could say this is half a book but only in the U.S.I do have a problem with Amazon's search engine not being able to find this book.

Presenting an idealized view of life beginning in Civil War era New England, it gives a glimpse into the world of their class and time.

Furthermore, the binding challenges ones ability to keep the book open in a manner proper for reading.After a few tries, I gave up and decided it was better to just let it sit and look pretty on my shelf.I should have gotten the softcover version."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I was expecting the book in the picture but what I received was a solid blue covered version. Would not go through this seller again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott has done a wonderful job making this book.I first read the easier book of Little Women and I loved it!This year I read the harder book and I loved it even more!Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I first read Little Women in elementary school, and enjoyed it so much that I read many of Louisa May Alcott's other works. Precisely why I decided to pick it up again at age 24 is unknown to me, but the reread was well worth it.Alcott tells the story of the four March sisters--Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy--as they grow into young women. Each girl has her faults, and they struggle to overcome them. They also must face the consequences of the family's poverty as well as separation from their father, who is serving with the Union Army during the Civil War. The book is told in episodic fashion, with many chapters acting almost as short stories complete with crisis and resolution. The sisters act appropriately for their time as well as display the sibling rivalries and affection present in most families.Reading Little Women as an adult, I realized just how moralizing it is. The March girls learn important lessons from nearly every event in the book. Beth is elevated to near-sainthood even before she becomes ill. But, other than the preaching, I found Little Women to be a thoroughly enjoyable read. I might just pick up Little Men again one of these days."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I like the book Little Women because it tought me I dont need money to be happy. The characters Meg, Amy, Beth, and Jo, were happy because they had each other. They always talked, spent time with each other, and believed in God.Its pretty cool that even if they were poor they enjoyed them selves.They went to parties and traveled.They did what ever any oyher girl could do.Each girl had a specal thing about them. Meg was the oldest. She had soft brown hair,and was pretty.Jo was a tomboy. The only thing nice about her was her hair."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book when I was 10 and on a vacation, and for my lil brain at that age it was great, but now it's just a little too simple that the children always try to do the right thing no matter what, always do as their mother tells them to, and always end up learning something wonderful. For the young reader, read it! If you're older and you want to read a children's story, read it! but if you want to read a book that seems realistic, don't"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I really did no t find this book interesting. I like James bond more. I grade it 5 stars. This is a girl but one who is a tomboy. But that is my opinon. Most people love it but I did not"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a book that I'd heard about all of my life, so I figured I ought to finally read it. Unfortunately, it is truly miserable. I would have given up on it about halfway through, but our internet died for a few days so I wasn't able to download anything else from the library.To be fair, the book was written for prepubescent girls, and I am (at the time of this writing) a 38-year-old man. But I have to believe that even the target audience - in this generation at least - would find it a slog.This book features the March family - primarily Mrs. March and her four daughters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It describes the daily joys and travails of these mid-19th century New England women. Unfortunately, nothing much happens to them. Trivial events - such as a disastrous meal, or a picnic lunch are the subjects of full chapters. The girls mostly sew, do their chores, play outside, eat, and sleep. The book is full of moral lessons, admonishing us all to be selfless, good, pure, and true. Some of these morals are timeless, and good behavior is something we can all aspire to. But the lessons are delivered with as much subtlety as a sledgehammer, in such a cloying way, and with so many superlatives as to make you want to stick a finger down your throat.The book also has lessons that are not (thank God) timeless. Three out of four of the little women who feature in this book have interesting talents: Jo writes, Amy draws, and Beth plays music. Each initially aspires to do something great with her talent, but these dreams are summarily squashed. By the end of the book, and with the admonition that \\"talent isn't genius\\", Alcott has impressed upon her audience that such dreams are almost always fanciful. The lesson seems to be: harbor such dreams at a young age if you must - - but in the end, you'll be much happier if you get married, have kids, live puritanically, and take care of your husband. I just can't get behind that."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was a very good transaction. The product was shipped on time and was in good condition."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"ITS A GOOD STORY I WISH JO WOULD HAVE BE MORE TOMBOYISH BUT I LIKED IT"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott's book, Little Women, does a great job of showing how five women and a lot of love can make it through anything.The plot of this book is adventurous. With every new chapter, there is an exciting new thing about to happen. Every chapter has a story involving one of the characters. As one chapter comes to a close, you can't wait to see what new adventure lies ahead.The best audience for this book would be women. Since the book is about a mother and her four girls, women enjoy it immensely. Teenage girls may also enjoy this book. The girls in the story are all in their teens, so it is easy for teenage girls to relate to. If you are younger than a junior high student, I wouldn't recommend this book.Other similar books are: Little Men and Jo's Boys. In fact you can buy these books in a set of three. They are all written by Louisa May Alcott, and they follow right after the one before. If you enjoyed Little Women, I would definitely recommend reading the other two. The style of writing in these three books is very much the same. If you wanted to know more about what happens to the family after Little Women was finished, then you would definitely want to check these two out.The themes and lessons in Little Women really go straight to the heart. Every chapter has it's own little lesson to be learned. The book as a whole has a great theme. This book gives hope to many readers and brings families closer. Mrs. March along with her four girls prove they can handle anything. The family is very close and each person portrays a different personality. They stick together through the good and the bad. The bond that this family shares makes others families want the same. Through every trial that life throws as them, they stick together and prove they can handle anything."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is one of the best books I've ever read.

Take my advice and read both Little Women and Jo's Boys."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have read Little Women nearly every year since childhood. This book, as well as Anne of Green Gables, are in my opinion among the best literature about girlhood. As I pass through each stage in my life, I find that I understand one of the girls a little more and see more and more of the universality of its theme. Someone once said that Little Women shows how when you are young, all possibilities seem to stand open before you but as you make choices in life one by one other doors close to you. I plan to pass this book on to my daughters."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"That was one of the best books I've ever read.

My favorite character is Jo, the tomboy. She dosen't like any thing about being a girl. They all miss their father. Jo miss's him. She think it's so dreadful to be poor."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book first some twenty years ago. It was our high-school text book. I did not realise it then that the book we were reading was an abridged version .. that ends with the father returning home to his family. All through the years I've had vivid reminiscences of what I had read in the book .. the four daughters, the guy next door, the dinner party, Beth falling ill, day-dreaming .. for real life seemed to live in every page of that novel (like the dessert with a pinch of salt) and I could identify myself being in a similar situation almost every day.It wasn't until later, much later, that I realised that Louisa May Alcott's original novel ended very differently then I could have ever imagined. I happened to read the unabridged version a few months ago and it came as a big shock to me to realise that Beth had passed away. It was so sad. I wept. All these vivid characters had lived in my memory for all these years. They were an epitome of a caring family. It had ended all so well twenty years ago. And now, all of a sudden, brute reality struck. One sister was dead and the guy next door was torn between two sisters.Now that the ending has finally sunk in, I'd say that this novel is one of hope .. not of marriage alone as one reader points out. HOPE. This is what keeps us all alive. We all dream that one day we'll achieve something .. peace, prosperity, happiness .. and this novel reinforces that sentiment and can be rightly dedicated to &quot;those who dare to dream&quot;.Read this novel if you feel like saying &quot;If only ...&quot; and it's gonna make you say &quot;I will ...&quot;."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"this is a book filled with tons of adventures"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I am nine years old and read Little Women recently. This book is very poetic. I like the way the four girls are each interested in different things; for example Meg is very motherly, Jo is a tomboy and loves to write and do plays, Beth is shy and thoughtful and Amy is good at art and is very concieted. Some parts did go a little slow. It's very realistic because the girls do have some fights and act very much like sisters. Their father is at war and they are not very wealthy, but throughout the book they learn that they love eachother and have good times without money. They realize that without a lot of money they are really very lucky and also realize that there are others with money that don't have as much family love as they do. I think you will really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"One of the novels that I have read this summer was \\" LITTLE WOMEN\\" by Louisa May Alcott. The characters in this book are Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. These girls and their mother are poor. Their father is also in the navy so he can't come home to see his family. I really liked this book because it shows that kids should be more greatful to their parents an d that you can never get everything that you want if your parnets don't have the money. One thing that I about the book was how the author declared that those girls' father was in the navy. I liked that she wrote that because it matches up to the fact that their family is poor.If i had to tell the author what to improve about the book is that she should maybe give more information ab out the mother and the housekeeper that lives with them. I would recommend this book to all the people that I know because it shows that people should be greatful about what they have and that they should respect the people that take care of them. I really enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This timeless children's classic is read and enjoyed by many adults as well as children. Unlike most classics considered children's works today, Little Women was intended for an audience of children. It takes place during the Civil War and the years following, and narrates the story of 4 girls as they grow up, including their friends and their family. Louisa May Alcott based this work in large part on her family, although many of the events are born totally of her imagination. Jo is based on Louisa May; Meg is based on her older sister Anna; Beth is based on her younger sister Elizabeth, or Lizzie; and Amy is based on her youngest sister May. Because the character Jo is based on the author herself, she is the most well defined character in the book and the one most children identify with. A tomboy, a writer, and quite determined, Jo is the central figure in the book and most events center around her growing up, but all of the other girls get special attention in stories particularly about them from time to time.There is a great sense of morality in the work, but it is never treated in a 'preachy' manner. Values and morals are taught and absorbed by the reader as the girls learn them through various trials, some funny, some sorrowful, some frustrating. There is likewise a very strong emphasis on God. Much of the first half of the book centers around concepts found in the Puritan work, Pilgrim's Progress, by John Bunyan. The girls are often pointed by their mother toward God and placing their trust in Him and seeking His aid in various situations. Louisa May Alcott was also a transcendentalist and her family was close friends with Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne. Because of this, there is a sense of joy found in nature as well as respect. In addition, Louisa May was an avid feminist in her day, although not in the sense of feminist that many think of today. She believed that women should not be barred from admission in the workforce, or limited to work as seamstresses or governesses, nor should marriage be their only avenue of insuring a stable and secure future. She did not get married, but did raise her sister May's daughter after May died. Little Women is definitely not anti-marriage, but some of the characters dream of becoming well-known in their favorite fields; also, some of the characters speak about how the only way they can insure a positive, pleasant future is by marrying well, which is later rejected in a way that asserts that women should be able to choose marriage freely for love, not for position or money and likewise free to choose not to marry.This book is well loved by so many. It spurs many children on to become strong readers for life and the childhood copy of Little Women will become worn from much loved reading. This book will be loved by most girls, but boys will enjoy it as well. Jo's tomboyish behavior and the neighbor boy, Laurie's presence will attract the attention of boys. It makes a great choice for bedtime reading with chapters of perfect length to read one per night and short enough that if begged by the kids, you can read two. In addition to Little Women, it would also be beneficial to read a biography of Louisa May Alcott.I strongly recommend an unabridged version. Don't miss out on the well-known sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Rosemary R.ISBN:1-4027-1236-7I would recommend this book to anyone because of it's amazing qualities and meanings. The characters just all around have great qualities and are so loveable. It's a nice life story to read about. The genre is like a biography but not quite. It's a great old fashion book to read and shows the true meaning of family. It's a sure attention grabber! The Little Women have gone along way in their lives and will continue to live their lives to the fullest ability no matter if riches come or do not come their way."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a book that once you read it you will never forget it. It is a timeless tale of 4 sisters and their struggle through life. When I read this book I started thinking about the charecters and thinkng would Jo do this or I wish I was more like Beth. Every girl needs to read this book even if you hate to read you neee to read this book. You wont be sorry."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I haven't read Louisa May Alcott's Little Women but I recently listened to the audiobook recording which was read by Jamie Lee Curtis and I thought it was a very good story and I liked the characters, especially Jo, Marmee and Laurie. Jamie Lee Curtis gave a wonderful reading performance and I would have liked it if this had been an unabridged audiobook intstead of just abridged but unfortunately she only recorded an abridged version but anyway I highly recommend this audiobook and I will have to look for the paperback book too!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I finally read Little Women when I wa 23. When I was in junior high, my mom and grandmother recommended I read it, but it sounded so dorky and old fashioned that I never gave it a try. Even my best friend whom I considered \\"cool\\" told me how great it was, but I didn't believe her. I saw the 1998 movie when I was about 22 and that led me to finally read the book. I was surprised that the book was even better than the movie. I think this should be on teen's summer reading lists. Even though it was written a long time ago, it is definitely still relavant."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"As I began the first chapter of this book, I thought I had made a mistake in purchaing it. It started off kind of \\"goody-goody\\" sounding and written for young adults. But I gave it a chance, and it paid off. As I got further into the book, I was hooked. I fell in love with the characters and kept turning the page to see what would happen next. It's a classic story for every woman. I enjoyed it so much I bought it for my 8-year-old cousin.The story is essentially about 4 sisters as they grow up. Each sister is unique, with different ideas and priorities. \\"Watching\\" them grow up through out the book is entertaining and heart-warming."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but &quot;Little Women&quot; retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of &quot;Little Women&quot; come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, &quot;poor little rich boy&quot; Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to &quot;Little Women.&quot; Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- &quot;scribbling&quot; down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But &quot;Little Women&quot; is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as &quot;heartwarming&quot; stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the &quot;perfect little homemaker&quot; image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.&quot;Little Women&quot; is one of those rare period novels that is still relevant, funny, and heartbreaking today. Fun, sweet, and a beautiful experience."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a charming story that transports back in time and tells the story of the March family. It follows the trials and triumps of the close-knit family living in the Civil War era. The four March sisters manage, although fequently challenged, to remain close throughout time. From the very first chapter the unique character traits arise pretty, proper, and mature Meg, tomboy Jo who loves to read and write, shy and caring Beth who loves music and animals, and vain Amy with an artistic talent. They are as different as sisters can be, but their strong personalities bring them closer together. The family is held together by the loving parents who are devoted and fair. The parents work to mold their daughters into responsible young women by teaching them morality and love. It is very much a coming of age story, each girl striving to become a good woman, and tying to let go of their past. Even though it was written over a hundred years ago, modern readers can still relate to the story. The girls still fight, they serch for love, they deal with loss, they struugle with poverty and fitting in. The story teaches great morals that are as important now as they were when the book was written. The book teaches the value of family, the importance of self-improvement, and the truth that love can withstand all. It is a plot that will involve the reader, a book that you will not be able to put down. By the end of the novel you will feel like you know the Marchs personally and will want to read it all over again. This story has passed the test of time and is a beloved peice of literature that brings people together. It is a tale that has touched countless generations, and will continue to do so for many more."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Some books transcend the time in which they were written, because the truths they contain are simply timeless. Such is \\"Little Women,\\" a simple tale of four sisters in rural New England during the time of the Civil War.Yes, they wear long skirts, and yes, one is NOT seen at a ball without white gloves, and yes, there are horse-drawn carriages. But Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March are as modern in their simple desire to be themselves as any teen living in today's techno world. The hurdles the girls face seem tougher than the hurdles of today, but are they really? Meg, the oldest, is not the saint she appears. She secretly misses the money her family once had, and desperately wants to \\"fit in\\" with the in-crowd, in this case, the high-society milieu that has rejected the Marches because they are poor. She also wants to find a nice man and get married. Not so very different...Jo (Louisa May Alcott's fictional persona)constantly flies in the face of convention, finding the restrictions of being a woman in her time almost unbearable. A feminist long before there was a hint of such a thing, Jo wants to dress like a boy, have the freedom that men do, and think for herself. She largely succeeds.Amy is the 19th-century version of \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.\\" She wears a clothespin on her nose each night so it will \\"turn up\\" and look pretty. She hoards her small pittance of an allowance so she can buy herself small trinkets. She is beautiful, selfish, but lovable deep inside.Beth, modeled after Alcott's real-life sister, truly IS a saint--and is martyred for it, having caught scarlet fever from a destitute family whose baby she tried to nurse back to health.All four girls struggle to live their lives while their father, a chaplain, is away at the War, and their mother is forced to do menial work to keep everybody fed. Family values are preached and preached again, but Alcott's \\"marmee,\\" the mother, is too human to be obnoxious. And the lessons of helping one another, living a good life, and making appropriate choices are not lost on the girls--or the reader.This is the perfect tale to read to your daughter, and I recommend the book before any movies (there are several wonderful film versions; my favorite remains the one that stars Katharine Hepburn as a simply fabulous Jo). To my way of thinking, \\"Little Women\\" is part of growing up. And deservedly so."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I bought this book for my girls and we all love it!!Hours of good reading.

I finished reading it a few weeks ago and already feel the urge to read it again. Alcott's novel presents subtle yet astute viewpoints regarding the tension between the traditional domestic roles of females and the push for women's rights which was beginning in the mid-1800s. Pay close atttention to the character of Beth to see Alcott's view on how overly-domestic women fair in the modern/changing world. I will say, though, that the ending seemed very forced, almost contrived.Also, Amazon suggests that 9-12 is a good age to read this book...maybe that was true 50 years ago, when society read more and was more literate in general, but for today, I would personally suggest 12-14 as the perfect age to read this book (for average readers)."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I'd read this book 60 years ago and had forgotten how beautifully it was written.

My own copy, much loved and well thumbed, has been with me since I was a ten year old. I bought the Kindle version just to have it in my portable library, since I thought I knew it almost by heart. To my surprise, when I started looking it over, I found that the book was not the same at all. My original copy must have been &#34;modernized&#34; at some point. All of the familiar passages were there, but there was a great deal that I didn't remember reading before. Some of that was a specifically Victorian kind of moralizing, but there was also some expansion of the story.. I'm not sure that I would have appreciated it all when I was younger, but I found it a delight to read now, as an example of a book of its times. Now I'm going to download the rest of the Alcott catalogue and see how it compares to the books I thought were the originals when I read them many years ago. This was still an exemplary book. It will always be one of the classics."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I am a 14-year-old girl and just got around to reading Little Women about a year ago. It is a great American classic written by Louisa May Alcott. It is about the four March sisters: Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. They live in New England during the Civil War. They are poor, but they try to make the best of it as they grow and learn. We follow them through good times and bad as they, with help from Marmee and Laurie (their next-door neighbor), bear their own unique burdens. Meg's is poverty, Jo's is her temper, Beth's burden is not being able to play on a piano, and Amy's is her unaristocratic nose.

I particularly chose the \\"Whole Story\\" edition because of its broad margins, easy-to-scan pages, and charming illustrations and margin notes that add historical texture to the story.Imagine my shock to discover that at the end of THIS edition, Jo has not written a book, Amy has not gone off to Europe, Professor Baer has not made an appearance of any kind and....you'll never believe this....Beth is still carrying on a conversation (I'm trying not to spoil the plot of the real thing here).That's because, apparently, \\"Little Women\\" was initially published in two parts (\\"Little Women\\" and \\"Good Wives\\"), which are generally published as the same book. Whole Story has chosen to stop at the half-way point, so much of the story you remember, loved, cried, and laughed over is just not here.Imagine getting only the first half of Tom Sawyer...leave him stranded on the island forever!I feel completely conned.

The one star rating is for this particular edition of the book. I have loved this book all my life and having worn out my childhood copy, was hoping to get a new one. An UNABRIDGED copy!! This is not the original...words and whole phrases have been changed and added to this copy! If you, like I was, are looking for an original, untouched, UNABRIDGED copy of Little Women then bypass this edition!! I cannot even begin to tell you how disappointed I was!! I will be returning this copy and continue my search for a REAL copy of Little Women that hasn't had words changed, modernized, or \\"dumbed down\\"!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Sure the story is great (as it would be with any version) and this version does have the nice print and book mark, however, the advertising suggested to me, at least, that there would be several illustrations. There were none except silly chests with each little woman's name engraved on them at the start of each chapter.Do not select this book if you are looking for an *illustrated* version. The Illustrated Junior Library version is well illustrated and at least as high quality a printing.By the way, read the sales copy above to see how misleading it is. Just for that reason, consumers should eschew this version, and Amazon should have them change it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"As an unabridged edition, all of Alcott's words are there. The narrator, Sandra Burr, takes us through the classic work in a style that takes the listener inside the story. Voices for the different characters are all created, but never in a melodramatic fashion. Listening to the story is like watching a fine and faithful production"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When people ask me how I became such an avid reader, my answer is because I read Little Women in High School. This timeless classic of four sister growing up during the Civil War is my all time favorite book and I do not even know how many times I have read it. I treasure my copy of this book and it is one I could never part with.Little Women is a coming of age story about four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, and it always amazed me how Marmee would sit back and let them learn life's lessons and always find the right words to say to each of them afterward. Family values and morals as well are hard lessons to teach but through love and understanding they all learn.Jo is my favorite character, she is so vibrant and full of life and the character based on Louisa May Alcott herself. My favorite movie version of this movie is the 1933 version with Katherine Hepburn as Jo, she truly captured Jo's spirit.This story has been read by many generations and I'm sure that there will be many more generations enjoying the story of Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy for many many years to come."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Having not read Little Women in many decades, I was drawn back to the book by my love of visiting the Alcott family home, Orchard House, in Concord, Massachusetts. I plan to re-visit that wonderful home and want to refresh my recollections of Little Women before doing so. By the way, if you have a chance to visit Orchard House, I strongly recommend that you do. Your sense of Little Women will expand.As I re-read these delightful pages, I found myself comparing Little Women to Pride and Prejudice, that outstanding work that captures human psychology so well. The comparison made me see new depths in Little Women that convince me that Little Women is by far the stronger work.But my biggest reaction was how modern the views in the book are. Women should have education, access to opportunities to develop their interests and marriage to men who will complement them. People should be concerned about each other and help one another, lest any person's life be harmed or feelings hurt in the process.I also noticed how complete a community of loving women can be within the same family.The writing style is beautifully spare. The key point of a chapter may turn on two or three words. And then, everything changes in the twinkling of an eye.Being a long book, Ms. Alcott has plenty of chances to develop her characters and she does so beautifully . . . allowing Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy and Laurie to grow and change as they age.I also came to appreciate more the scope of the book, taking the young women from teenage years through the first few years of marriage. It's a time period that few books consider. Usually, it's all over when the marriage happens. I like this approach better.Should you read Little Women? Does the sun rise in the East?If you haven't read Little Women, you've missed great role models for how to be a parent, spouse and child.Here's the story in a nutshell: During the Civil War, Mr. March is away serving as a chaplain in the Union army. Mrs. March (Marmee) and her four daughters are at home in the cold north making do on small income with the help of one servant, Hannah. As the story opens, the March family is facing a frugal Christmas. But events soon take an unexpected turn and their hearts are filled with gladness. Jo makes an unexpected and most humorous acquaintance of the Laurence boy (Theodore, known as Laurie) who lives next door with old Mr. Laurance, his grandfather. The two families draw upon one another for strength and friendships grow. Illness intercedes making the two families even more dependent on one another. One by one, the children move into adulthood, deal with their romantic feelings and form their alliances.The characters of each child are quite different, allowing Ms. Alcott to explore the contrasts by putting them together in various private and social occasions. Meg is beautiful and much admired. She should attract many suitors. Jo is energetic, self-absorbed and talented in writing (the character closest to Ms. Alcott herself). Beth is very kind and yet fragile. Amy is the social climber in the family . . . and the pet. Laurie has an artistic temperament, but finds himself expected to play an heir's role.You'll long remember with delight the stories of their thespian performances, games, dances and social visits. Although the book makes up a wonderfully detailed novel, the chapters are written almost as stand-alone short stories that pack a powerful punch in their modeling of good behavior.What a joy!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature.

Then there's the little women: sixteen-year-old Meg, who is pretty and mature; free-spirited, fiery Jo, who is determined to become a famous writer; timid Beth, who always puts others before herself; and young Amy with her artistic tastes and airs. There's also the March's lonely neighbor, Theodre Laurence (Laurie), who befriends the girls and supplements their experiences and family.MY REVIEW: This heartwarming story about four sisters growing up during the Civil War visits upon themes of family, transcendence, sincerity, and duty. In a novel based upon her own family and experiences, Louisa May Alcott chronicles the first of three books about the March family, which is the universal story of the family unit and the self in the face of the world: how each lives and how happiness prevails in morality and truth.Alcott's novel caters to all audiences, regardless of age and gender. As a children's book, as it is often placed, Little Women serves as a record of the coming-of-age of four girls as: Amy bears injustice at school, Jo struggles with personal, literary, and romantic issues, Meg faces society and Vanity Fair, and as life threats Beth's solitude. As a piece of classic literature, Little Women serves testimony to the emerging conscious and individual. It's impossible to resist the gentle lessons and the charming, dimensional characters that stimulate the reader to the same awakening and discovery of value."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is fantastic. I first read it in fifth grade and it still brings tears to my eyes and a smile to my face every time I read it. It stars the March sisters; Jo a tom boy writer who scribbles away and is a strong willed free spirit, while Beth is a sweet girl who never says a mean word to anyone, Meg is the motherly oldest and Amy is the childish youngest who must be surrounded by pretty things. It is a very touching story where four young girls become young ladies and their interactions with eachother and society. It is an utterly splendid story :)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is now my favorite book! The struggles that the whole family goes through touches me. It reveals how sorrowful and joyous a person can be in a matter of time. Happiness doesn't come with your wealth or belongings, but with your family and friends. I can relate to the girls in the different situations. The story made me laugh and made me cry! I would say it is by far better than the movies. The use of detail and description is beautifully done. I like how the language and story are so old fashioned and find myself using such dialect after reading it! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes bitter-sweet stories that make you think."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature.

My daughter (11) loved this book adn so did I when I was a girl"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"this is my favorite book of all time, one I re-read every year around Christmas time - nothing will ever be able to compare, even Pride and Prejudice (which is also one of my favorites).Little Women was originally written in two volumes: Little Women and then Good Wives; today these two books are combined, so will be my review... ((this may be a bit long of a review so bare with me - there is just soo much to cover in this book))Loosely based off of her own life, Alcott presents a story about four women who grow both individually and together as a family during times of trouble, turbulence, and peace. Each sister has their own hopes and dreams, and each sister finds their place in the world only after discovering heartache, pain, love, and loss. Jo, who is loud, rambunctious, hard headed and impatient, finds solace through her writing. She struggles greatly to find peace within her self and accept herself as she is. Meg, the oldest remembers a time when the March family was revered and was not in financial hardships, making it hard for her to accept life as is, all the while being kind and understanding to her young sisters. Beth, the quite and timid sister, who is always kind and sees the good in everyone and everything, desires nothing more than to remain at home with her family and dolls. Amy, the youngest of the sisters, is constantly concerned with how prime and proper she should look, act, and speak, but remains true to her character.Laurie, the boy next door, finds himself a home he never expected in the March household as he finds it hard to live up to his grandfather's expectations of him. He is seen as an older brother to all the sisters, never faulting in his devotion to them, that is until his feelings for Jo grow into something more. However, Jo is unable to see Laurie and he wishes and her desire to find her place in the world is never greater.You really see the divide between childhood and adulthood when each of the sisters go their own way: Meg gets married, Beth remains at home, Amy travels abroad to Europe, and Jo goes to New York (Laurie is also left to his own devices, first going off to college and then working for his grandfather in Europe). It is only when tragedy hits the sisters, are they all able to come back together, as new adult women.While this novel is filled with girls knitting, needlepoint, and darning (which were expected of women of the time), it goes much deeper than that. Alcott presents the constant struggle that many women had, and even many women of today, between their loyalties to their family as well as to theirselves, and trying to find a balance between the two. This is a wonderful novel that can teach anyone many different lessons about life and love and family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"it is a really nice novel. it is so good that i wish i could read it more. it was like i was witnessing the whole story myself . it was a really nice experiance. we can learn so much from it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Definitely a classic that I think should be required reading.

Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. It started out that I just wanted to get more AR points than this other girl in my class who had been unable to finish the book because she had thought it was so boring. I was anticipating the worse, but I began to read it and I just fell in love with the dear little book. It was just so great! My favorite character by far was Jo. After I read it more people in my class became curious and four other people in the class read it including the first girl who gave up on it. She tried again and after she finished it she said that she had loved the book too."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The Book little women is a classic tale of four sisiters liveing with there mother, there father risking his life in the civil war. it tells what it was like to be a girl in the times of the war. The girls are people you could look up to. Jo the secound eldest is a tom boy wishing that she was born one, and a book worm. Amy the youngest one is very wise for her age.

I strongly recamend this addion for its beautiful illustrations that complament the classic story, you will treasure"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a 500+ page book. Although long, it is a wonderful book that I will eventually read again. Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy are four teenage sisters. Throughout the book we see their lives. The father is fighting in the civil war. They are a poor family. But even so they find a way to make the best of life. Meg is proper and ladylike. She simply loves silk dresses. Jo is a tomboy with a temper. She loves to write and although she wants independance and freedom, she also wants to do something for the world and craves respect and honesty. I am most like Jo. I love to write and even though I am not a tomboy I feel that I most identify with her. Beth is a sweet pianist who is a little angel. She is timid and feels that she does not do enough with her life as she mostly stays home with their maid Hannah. When she is on her deathbed she reads a poem by Jo about her and realizes that she made a difference in her older sister's life. THat makes her feel better. Amy is a bit of a snob. She is a talented artist who hates her nose. She says she will marry for money. Laurie is the next door neighbor. He and Jo become best friends. When he asks Jo to marry him she refuses because they are both so independant that it would ruin their relationship as just friends. It breaks his heart. He later marries Amy, who although Laurie does have a lot of money, she also loves him. Marmee is a mix of all four of her daughters. I highly recommend this book. Don't put it down because it is too long. The second half of the book is better. I admit, I felt like punching it when I was at the last 25 pages. Suffer through 562 pages and not regret it because of the ending, trust me you will love this book! Go Little Women!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women was a fantastic book. It's a story about the life of the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. The girls and their mother are very close. Mr. March is away in the Civil War. The book tells of the adventures of the girls as they grow up. It tells of their poverty and how they shouldn't take anything for granted. It shares stories of bad moments in their lives. A teacher hit Amy as a punishment therefore causing and uprising. The girls mother then pulls them out of school. It tells of their love lives and the conflicts between Laurie and the sisters. They also try to find a happy medium of good and bad. They want to be bad and do mischivous things, but need to be the proper ladies that they are expected to be. They spend their lives trying to balance the two ideas. They try to learn the difference between dreams and reality. They dream of a life of riches, where they get everything they want. But in reality, they are not even close. They try, throughout the whole story, to be good sisters to one another. They also try to be good to their mother, since she is struggling while her husband is away. At Christmas, the girls planned on buying eachother and themselves gifts. Later, that changed to buying presents for their mother to show her how much they appreciate her hard work and love. The author, Alcott, portrays they life and society during the civil war superbly. This book is good for boys and girls of all ages because everyone can learn something from it, wether its about love, lust, money, pride, education, or anything else. This book shows us the reality of life. It deserves all five stars, if not more."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"How can you not love this tale of 4 sisters struggling to have a normal life despite a father away fighting in the Civil War and diminished means because of his absence? Jo is a feminist of whom Susan B. Anthony would be proud. Poor Beth is so good and easy to love that her illness is heart-breaking. Meg is strong and practical. And Amy, well, you have to love her despite her vanity and selfishness. Of course, Marmee is the tie that binds this family together. So many wonderful movie adaptations of this beloved novel have been produced, including the very faithful one starring Winona Ryder, but, really, one should read this novel to totally immerse themselves in the lives of the March girls. If you love the movie, do yourself the favor of reading this book. Read it to your young daughter, or buy your 4th, 5th, or 6th grader her very own copy to treasure."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a classic story written by Louisa May Alcott. This is a marvelous story. It concentrates on these four little women with their dad off fighting in the war and the March family going poor. Alcott incorporates the feelings of each of the little women as the story progresses. She wrote a great story with such great detail with each of the women. During the coarse of the story, Alcott uses many literary devices in her writing, but there are a few that are more immanent to the reader.Louisa Alcott uses a combination of two literary terms, an understatement and figure of speech. Josephine March constantly uses the phrase, \\"Christopher Columbus\\" during the coarse of the story. She usually uses this phrase when something marvelous or great happens. In the story, Jo is invited to visit the ill Mr. Laurie. When he shows her the house and invites her for tea, Jo uses \\"Christopher Columbus\\" when she sees the great and luxurious music room. She really means how marvelous and great the room was. People around her may not know what she is talking about, but Jo surely does.Louisa Alcott also uses the literary device, foreshadowing. She does this when Jo comes home from town one day with Laurie. Jo comes running up to her house and there was Meg talking with John. Jo gets jealous and mad because she doesn't want Meg to fall in love with him and marry him. Then that means she will have to move out and the four little March sisters will down to three and Jo does not want that. So as Jo, Meg, John, and Laurie are talking, Beth comes home from town. All of a sudden, Jo grabs Beth and gives Beth a hug and says, \\"Beth you are never going to leave. You are going to be the one to keep the family together.\\" With Jo saying that, it foreshadows that something bad is going to happen to Beth and surely something does. Beth dies from Scarlet fever that she got from the baby she was taking care of. Jo was of course devastated with the death and lost of poor Beth. Before Beth dies, she confronts Jo in the attic to talk her. They talk about her (Beth) dieing and leaving Jo. As Jo is crying, Beth starts doing a soliloquy in which she makes a long speech with Jo about dieing. She talks about how she will always be with her and how much Jo means to her. She also says how she is not scared and how what is happening is what is the right thing. With her relationship with Beth, Jo is later inspired to write a novel to be published about her Beth.Finally, Alcott uses all of the characteristics in a character. For instance, Jo is a great example of a static character; she never changes through out the coarse of the story. At the beginning, Jo loves to write and wants one of her stories published. At the end, she still loves writing, but at the end, her story My Beth is published. Laurie is a good example of a dynamic character. At the beginning, he falls in love with Jo, but as he confesses his love to her and her hand in marriage, she turns him down. Then as he is visiting Europe, he meets up with Amy and things just click and he starts having feelings for Amy. Later they get married, but Jo and Laurie still stay the best of friends just as they were before. Examples of flat characters are Demi and Daisy because they are only described as the twins of Meg and John. Beth is an example of a round character because she is a very quiet but very virtuous. She does nothing but try to please others. She adores music and plays the piano very well. She seems like a real person that some one would know from school. These are just a few examples, but there are many other characters that fit the description of each of these.Little Women by Louisa May Alcott is a great book. No matter how old or young a reader they maybe, they would enjoy it. It is a book for all ages. Alcott words the novel as though it is a true story happening to real people. Readers can relate to the events in the story and can relate to the feelings of the characters. This book may be a classic, but it is still enjoyed by many. Little Women is a novel that will never fade away and will continue to be read by others for as long as time can tell. Now that is fantastic novel."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The main reason I loved Little Women is that it displayed so many different personalities within one family. Meg, being the oldest, was more refined and mature than her sisters. She always felt as if she had to set a good example for the younger siblings. Jo was the daydreamer and had strong ambitions to become a writer. Jo, according to the story, is the one who wrote this book. She was the tomboy who always wanted to have fun. Beth was the quiet sister. She was always listening to the other girl's problems and giving advice. Amy was the youngest sister, and to be quite frank, was just plain spoiled! She always got what she wanted and in the process took many things that could easily hurt Jo. Going to Europe was one of Jo's dreams. Whe Jo finally thought she was going to get to go, her aunt asked Amy. Instead of refusing to go and offering her spot to Jo, Amy accepted her aunt's offer immediately. The book Little Women is not just a story about four different girls growing into women; it is a tale of friendship, family, and belonging. It shows how four ppeople can have a huge impact on each other's lives and on the lives of many others."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature.

And in the end, the book is ultimately a coming of age story that would be better suited for someone much younger than myself.Reading the book as an adult, I found it hard to get into. It went from slow and meandering in the beginning to an almost break-neck pace towards the end. It was heavy on description and the characters weren't all that deep. I know it's a classic and people love these girls, but they seemed very two dimensional to me. Each had her very own set of traits and none seemed to share a trait with another as sisters would. While that could allow for each character to be her own person and made it easy to distinguish one from the next, it didn't seem real.A wonderful book for children, but the experience doesn't justify a reading as an adult. I'm glad to have read it to try to understand the perpetual love people have for it, it wasn't something I enjoyed enough to ever want to read again.

Alcott shows the trials and tribulations of young people dealing with the death of a loved one, family crises, and the mending of broken hearts. Readers today are still inspired by the lessons taught by Marmee on how to be a good person and how to achieve happiness in life.Marmee (Mrs. March) is the mother of the family and the glue that holds them together. She displays infinite wisdom in dealing with her daughters and also shows unlimited patience with an exceptionally charitable nature. Her main goal in life is to be a pleasing wife and secure the happiness of her dauthers. She diligently teachs them the lessons they need to achieve a happiness that will carry them through their adult life.In reading this novel it gives the reader a glimpse into what its like for women growing up in the 1800's. Readers today remain inspired by Meg's devotion to her family, Jo's commitment to her writing, and Beth's willingness to help the ones she loves. Meg is the oldest sister. She is plump and beautiful with a sweet temper and very motherly. She appears to be somewhat vain and does not like the poverty status she is reduced to living. She dreams of having money to spend on beautiful clothes and live like the rich society girls that have become her friends. She fights a constant battle with her feelings even into married life but comes to the realization that she will be content with what she has rather than spend her life wishing for a wealth she will never achieve. Jo is the next oldest and the main herione. She is very much the tomboy growing into maturity with a quick temper. She is always quick to chastise her inner self and live the values that Marmee has taught her. Her main goal in life is to be a writer and she spends endless time pursuing this goal. Jo's personality is real and evokes sympathy from the reader in her attempts of trying to fit into a society that she doesn't relate to and falls short of those expectations. Jo's quick temper proves to be a constant battle for her but she diligently battles her demons while being consumed with self doubt. She works very hard to be a good and pleasing child to her parents. I feel her character most resembles the author's life. Alcott goes to great lengths to paint a picture of Jo's character giving great detail and attention to explaining her because she most likely understands her the best. She is very self sacrificing and has a strong maternal instinct to her younger sister, Beth. After the death of her sister Jo tries to become her sister in an attempt to hold on to her. This was her way of keeping Beth close to her but she soon realizes that given her rebel nature it will not work. Beth is the quiet, very shy, child who is third oldest. Throughout the first half of the book I wanted her to blossom and mature to become a personality that would equal her sisters. This never happened as she always seemed to be content with her state of life and wrapped herself up in her cats and dolls while tending to the minute details of the house trying to make it as happy as possible. If this was her allotment in life she achieved it very well. I thought of her as a little angel. Amy is the youngest, being quite selfish and spoiled. Her desire in life is to be an artist in which she diligently looks for the beauty in the world around her to paint on canvas. Amy is, however, to be admired for her persistence in dealing with the elite society and striving to rise out of her poverty stricken life which she accomplishes by marrying Laurie, the rich boy next door. But instead of just enjoying her wealth the couple decides to use that wealth to help the less fortunate.Little Women serves as a reminder of just how fragile life and feelings can be. Alcott breathes life and existence into the characters that makes them come to life on the pages before you. The reader feels as if they are a part of the family. I had feelings of joy when they succeeded and sorrow when they didn't. When Beth was very sick I could sympathize with Jo and I also wanted deperately for her to recover.Alcott does not profess openly any political or religious beliefs but the story has undertones of the beginning of the women's rights movement and it suppports religious beliefs of the Quakers while promoting the ideals of married life. Quakers in those days believed that divine relation was immediate and individual; all persons may perceive the word of God in their soul. It recognizes the presence of human evil and works to eradicate as much as possible. The girls definitely followed these beliefs. When Meg was having marital problems after her twins were born it was Marmee that told her, \\"A woman's happiest kingdom is her home, her highest honor the art of ruling it not as a queen but as a wise wife and mother.\\" In the end Jo inherits the estate of her rich aunt. Prior to this time in history women were not allowed ownership of property and centainly not the right to vote. A woman was discourged from concerning themselves about politics. But Marmee gently suggests to Meg this may be a way for her and her husband to reconnect. This would also explain why the book is more self-centered on the characters than the realities of the era which are not brought into focus.I would not read the book again but I did feel it was worth reading the first time and I am glad I did. I would very much recommend it to anyone searching for a book that you could relate to the characters and can't help care about them"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"There's a reason why some books like Little Women manage to live on for years and years after it's been written and that is simply because they're wonderful, timeless stories. Little Women is definitely one of them. I still to do this day consider it one of my favorite books, as my tattered copy will prove. You can't help but fall in love with the main characters as you get to know them so well over the length of this book. While I must admit that each time I reread it I hope and pray that by some miracle Jo won't refuse Teddy, I always finish it happy that I was able to be a part of the March's little world. It's a wonderful book for young girls as the lessons to be learned in it are numerous. Read it with your daughter and you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I'm so glad to see that the cover and illustrations for the hardback version of LITTLE WOMEN have stayed the same; this book (along with Frances Hodgson Burnett's A LITTLE PRINCESS) were staples of bedtime reading when I was growing up, and as I became an avid reader on my own later on, LITTLE WOMEN revealed more layers to me. Some people think of it as old fashioned, when actually the novel was considered unconventional in its time, focusing as it does on what is -- for the first half of the book, anyway -- a single parent home made up entirely of women. The girls in this story are DOERS, and their lack of funds don't hold them back from attempting things. (In fact, it pushes them to be imaginative, as when Jo ruins her gloves with lemonade and can't go to a dance, so Meg lends her one of her own clean ones to wear and they both carry a stained one. Genius, Meg.) The second half of the story, especially, has scenes of tender drama, which is one of the reasons the material has been adapted to the screen so successfully and repeatedly over the years. (Was there a dry eye in the house when Winona Ryder came across Claire Dane's dusty childhood trunk in the attic and ran her hands across it?) The bond that the March sisters share is extremely moving, and like all good drama, it's based in recognizable human emotion. I've always been at sea when my gay friends report that they've &quot;come out&quot; to their brothers or sisters. Aren't siblings the people you walked to school with for years, the people whose diaries you shared or broke into, the people you ran away from home with for an afternoon? How could they not know you to begin with? LITTLE WOMEN is primarily about that bond, and it's a great, malleable dramatic subject."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Have you ever had the life of poverty?Having your father away in the Civil War not knowing when he'll back?Or waking up on Christmas morning not having any presents?Well, you soon know how it feels in the great book Little Women.

It looked to me then that it was a girlie book, but I still enjoyed it very much. I think I read it twice. Although the story is very sentimental and it has many morals, it is an extraordinary portrait of life in Northeast US during and after the Civil War. It was still very much a protestant, puritanical society, starting to modernize but still very provincial. The characters are well-rounded, alive and real, and the stories are amusing. It has no specific plot. It is the story of the March family, and it starts when the father is away, fighting on the North's side. The Marches are a respectable and educated family, but they're not wealthy, so the book depicts the troubles and efforts of the four girls, their little successes and disappointments. If you like the first part, you will also like the other three novels, although this is the best."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"little women was one of the best books ive read. the girls meg, jo, beth, and amy all have their own personallity which add to the humor and the saddness of the book. laurie( thier next door neighbor and jo's best friend) is a wonderful, giving guy who is trying to win the heart of one of the sisters but you will have to read the book to find out which one. overall i give it five stars."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"&quot;Little Women&quot; was one of the best books I have ever read, and I am no stanger to the literary world, not to mention Victorian-era classics such as this. Never have I read a book that better deserved the title, &quot;classic.&quot;This is the moving story of the 4 March sisters, each strong in their own accounts and weak in others. It shows us their trials in life and leaves us with a sense of belonging to their world.I think that this book is more important now than ever, because of the strong feminist attitude expressed by the family as a whole. Though the recent film treatment of the book is probably the definitive screen treatment, it could never capture the sense of beauty that the book did, or develop the characters as well.I was only 15 when I read this book, but I consider it to be one of my all-time favorites even still.I would not recommend this book to ANYONE, but anyone with an appetite to learn and an appreciation for life in general (or lack thereof) should find this book a reminder that despite wealth, poverty, sadness, happiness, death, and all other aspects of life that may separate us, we are all human, and the one thing that keeps us us together is love. -Ben, age 16"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I'm 52 years old and remember well reading this as a kid, and loving it.

I'm trying to build up a library on my Kindle of the classics I never had time to read in high school or before, although this was not one of them. Haven't read the free Kindle version yet but I will.

Also, as I learnt some years ago in my teachingdays, this is not a book to be used in the classroom. It is best savedfor long winter days, when reading a chapter can be a daily visit withappealing friends.Much of it is way too puritanical for mytaste. Daughters cannot so much as have their rare good breakfast onChristmas Day, and presents need to be sacrificed because how can oneenjoy oneself when soldiers are not? But the characters are oftenvivid, and the relationships between the sisters are quiterealistic.That said, it does tend to be a winner. The very youngtend to focus on the fun parts rather than the New Englandcongregationalist preaching ... don't spoil it for them, at the youngage, by telling them just why the Alcotts, on whom this work wasbased, were the &quot;poor&quot; outcasts in the wealthyneighbourhood. END"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I hate to say it but this is a book designed primarily for women. I am a male and I would have to refrain from calling it a classic as it failed to cross the sexual divide. The characters are well developed and undoubtedly you care for the four children and their mother especially. The girl's lovers are unfortunately less developed as characters and they come across as prissy men. The plot is overlong and unexciting. Is there even a plot? However the plot of Emma was also non-existant but the writing had an edge to it that dismissed any boredom. Unfortunately boredom can creep in while reading this tale. The death of one main character seemed to drag on and on and on... Am I the only person in the world who rejoiced upon reading that the girl had passed on. &quot;About bloody time!&quot; I cried. I thought about giving this book a solid three stars but that would have been too generous. It is regarded as a classic but to me it was a sentimental piece of rubbish. 2 generous stars"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"She is better then any other writer! Sakespeare is tied with her.

This book is a diaryof their lives, until three of them get married and have babiesof their own.The book ends with them all attending a birthday party, and eachrealizing that they couldn't be happier for they all have whatthey always dreamed of.As I said before, this book is overlong at places.

This book would be classified as a young adult.Little Women is the strory of three sisters. It shows the trials a girl can face as she grows up into a women. The book is filled with romance, trouble, revenge and many other domestic problems.I have read many books that are similar to Little Women. The Old-fashioned Girl, is another delightful story with a similar genre. It is also by Louisa May Alcott.I really enjoyed the book. I love Alcott's style of writng. You are really able to connect with each of the charcters. I found the strongest connection between Jo and myself. She is an independent women. She and likes to be philosophical. We are very much alike in these ways. &quot; Jo is our Literary fellow.&quot; This was said about Jo form her sister Meg. The whole March family thought Jo was the greatest authoress that ever did live. I to would love to get such praise for my writings.However good this book may be it does have its drawbacks. I feel there could have been several things omitted. I would recommend this book for those who enjoy stories about women who in their own little ways try to make their world better."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I am absolutely torn as to how to rate this book.On one part, I feel awful about giving it a BAD rating, because it is a classic novel with an impeccably clean story.On the other hand, I can't bring myself to give it a GOOD rating, because the whole thing read like a Puritanical rant.Therefore, I think I will go with a 2.5 out of 5 star rating.I feel that Ms. Alcott said it best in the following quote: \\"'You said, mother, that criticism would help me; but how can it, when it's so contradictory that I don't know whether I've written a promising book or broken all the Ten Commandments?...This man says, \\"An exquisite book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness; all is sweet, pure, and healthy\\"...The next, \\"The theory of the book is bad, full of morbid fantasies, spiritualistic ideas, and unnatural characters.\\"'\\"As this quote was found in Part 2 of the book, which was written some years after Part 1 was published, I can only assume that the quote itself reflects real criticism that Ms. Alcott received for Part 1 of Little Women and reiterate that \\"I couldn't have said it better myself.\\"Of course, all of this is coming from one who is long past childhood and young adulthood and therefore somewhat jaded in both spiritual and relationship matters, and as this book is basically the epitome of happy endings and moral tirades, I just could not bring myself to enjoy it as much as I may have 10-15 years ago."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a GREAT book! I was thrilled to find it at my library, because everyone told me that I should read it. This unique story shows how the March sisters deal with problems together. (I have two sisters, so I can relate to that). The four girls, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, form a tight bond as they deal with frienships, money, marriages, and much more, during the civil war, when their father is away. When their mother, &quot;Marmee&quot; goes to help their sick father, they struggle to find any help for Amy, who is dreadfully ill with the scarlet fever. This, and many more problems fill their lives, and they learn to live a better life as they mature and grow strong within each other. This is a wonderful classic, and I encourage you to read the book,watch the movie, or listen to the cassete (of which I have done all three!)."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book a long time ago and absolutely hated it. Then someone recommended Louisa May Alcott to me so I gave it another shot, but by the end I was truly wondering why Little Women had become such a classic. I found that the first half was lacking in plot - when I looked back on it I realized that I had spent at least a couple hours reading about a ball, a sickness, and a bad dinner - and that the second half had far too much plot. The first part was very hung up on morality and sometimes felt too pious, although Marmee was a remarkably enlightened woman. The characters, especially Meg, didn't feel distinct and realistic throughout the second half; I felt like the three years that had passed distanced me from the characters. Attempting to jam three romances, a death, and a storyline involving Jo's writing into the second part only made things feel more detached. As for the aforesaid romances, I tried desperately to find the emotional reasoning behind Jo's choice and came up empty handed. The one thing that saved this book was the simple language and writing; I found it easy to read.In short, I'm sure that this book appeals to some, but I didn't like at 7 and I don't like it now. I definitely agree with the people that recommended Anne of Green Gables instead - it and its sequels are great books."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I never read the book in this form, but did read it many years ago. I gave it three stars based on what is think of it, which is four or five stars, and the fact that my grand-daughter was bored, which deserves maybe two stars. I think before you buy books, you should try to know the book and the child fairly well beforehand, in terms of what you think they would like. I know that many kids will dislike a book which many others like (like you today, perhaps). Considering the caveat I said, I'd consider buying it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"EVERYBODY has to read this book. It's like the best book in the world.

This book, as well as Anne of Green Gables, are in my opinion among the best literature about girlhood.

It comes from Little Women, the beloved classic of the four young March girls. Meet sixteen-year-old Meg, the plump and matronly oldest sister; Jo, the awkward and rambunctious tomboy; Amy, the spoiled and artistic blond; and Beth, the quiet and reserved youngest sister. With their father away at war, the girls grow up under the watchful eye of Marmee.Of course, the March family is not perfect, which is why we love them. Meg succumbs to vanity a party when she borrows a dress that is far too stiff with a train that is far too long. She also fears during dances that her earrings will fall off. Jo refuses to forgive her sister Amy for an act of vengeance, until a skating disaster reunites them. Amy receives the strap at school for ignoring a rule about candy. And Beth loses a beloved bird during a disastrous week when the girls experiment with idleness. Even the one who most often instills moral guidance, Mrs. March, admits that it's taken her over forty years to only partially cure her anger.While the entire family is creative, Jo is the writer amongst them. This is my main reason for liking her best. We're both always reading. Jo likes to receive books as presents, is most attracted to homes where the owners have libraries, and typically cites examples from literature to prove her points. We're also both always writing. Jo writes plays and contributes news to the family newsletter. She loves sharing stories about what happens in her life. I also most identify with her habit of getting herself into scrapes.Despite the absence of their father, the family is close knit. The Marches sing together. They help the needy, even to the point of giving up their Christmas breakfast to help a starving family. Not being rich themselves, they produce their own plays and a family newspaper for entertainment. Under the moral direction of their mother, they also learn many life lessons. I embraced many of the principles myself such as refusing to let the sun go down on my anger. Little Women continues to be one of my favorite girl books."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a coming of age tale chonicling the lives of the March Sisters.

The first three quarters of Little Women were amazing, couldn't stop reading. The last quarter was slow. I had to skip a chapter or two to keep from dozing off, but the ending was very nice."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"From the very first time I read Little Women (at about age 9) it immediately and firmly established itself as one of my ultimate-favorite-forever books. As a young girl I took immediately to Jo, and from that moment on wanted to become a writer. I remember even attempting to write a story about girls using the same formal, slightly-affected-19th century style as Alcott (blushing). I soon outgrew that, but the desire to be a writer never left and even still hasn't quite died in me, although life has gotten in the way and I doubt that I will ever write a book.Yes, Little Women is old-fashioned, sometimes affected and often moralistic -- particularly in the first half -- with a strong emphasis throughout on \\"being good\\" and Marmee turning practically every event in their lives into a teachable (lecturing) moment for her daughters. And yet, for all that it remains firmly ensconed as not just one of my favorites, but as my ultimate comfort read. There is just something so warm and soothing about this sweet, sentimental and often funny story of a close-knit family in simpler times and its gentle but insightful look at many aspects of human nature.And now thanks to this wonderful audio version (which I have listened to twice already -- I can't even count the number of times I've read a printed version) I have a new way to enjoy this much-loved classic.

As a nearly 50-year-old woman, I thought I would find it childish and boring, but instead I was in turns fascinated, intrigued and charmed. Accounts of everyday life as lived in the time of the Civil War in Concord, Massachusetts were every bit as fascinating as Pride and Prejudice. In particular, it was intriguing to hear how women spent their time forever mending clothes, cooking and cleaning. The explanations of how young women were expected to act toward the opposite sex were interesting, too. I also caught glimpses of myself, very young, reading the book for the first time. There were actually passages that I distinctly remember reading, for instance, I know I identified completely with Jo, who preferred to spend her time reading and writing, didn't want to cut her hair, and who wanted to simply be \\"one of the boys.\\" This is one novel I will be passing along to my two young nieces, as a piece of Americana that will never go out of style."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women, being one of the classics of American literature, is not surprising to be said one of the best books I have ever read.

As Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy grow up, their adventures and mishaps provide examples for any reader of all ages. As they grow up, they struggle with many ideas. First, they are constantly troubled by the necessity of being good, even when they want to be bad. Second, as they grow up, they confront different types of relationships with boys. Friendship turns into love and vice versa, making a strong theme of gender relations. The girls also struggle with the ideas of motherhood, sisterhood, pride, education, and marraige. Finally, two of the most important ideas in the novel are dreams and work. The girls spend their childhoods and adult lives trying to balance the two and fulfill both necessities. Also, throughout the book, society is explained, the harsh winters are described, and the profound work ethic of the people is portrayed to give the reader a strong sense of what it was like to be living during the 19th century. The book gives the reader some mportant guidance to people in similar circumstances in their adolescent years. The novel motivates positive decision making, looks past materialism, teaches morales, and shows us the importance of real happiness."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This hardbound book by Louisa May Alcott is a MUST for anyone wanting a truly \\"good\\" book for their child or themselves to read. The book is printed on quality paper and beautiful cover. There is also a bookmark incorporated into the binding to keep your place. We have used this with the Unabridged story on CD to help the younger children with their reading. They can listen and follow along. It is a quality story, a timeless classic, in a quality binding. It far surpassed what I had expected in terms of paper, binding, etc. I am so happy we got this book, and the price was more than reasonable for what we received!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This edition of LITTLE WOMEN is great! First of all, there's the wonderful story of the March family in the years during and after the Civil War, as the 4 daughters -- Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy -- grow to womanhood, experiencing joy and overcoming obstacles and tragedy. This edition stays true to the language and grammar used in the original. I have read versions of the novel in which the girls' grammar is cleaned up for them!In addition, the introduction by Susan Cheever is first-rate; it is neither too long or too short, and she beautifully ties it to her own experience without being cloying.Another reason why I so highly recommend this edition is because there is a glossary at the back to explain some of the obscure (to modern readers) terms and obsolete slang. Also, there's a nice essay/review by G.K. Chesterson, who warmly praises Alcott's book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book Little Women is a heart-warming story. It is one I would read more than once. I dont see how anyone could not like it,exept maybe boys. I chose it because I had seen the movie and i heard that the book was one you can't go your life without reading,so I went to my school library and checked it out.This book is about four sisters growing up during the 1800's. They are faced with many challenges they must overcome. These things bring them closer and closer. During the war their father must leave for war as a chaplain. While he is there he gets injured and Marmee (the girls mother) has to go take care of him. The girls must help there mother out by taking care of themselves. The girls have to deal with many other things such as losing people they love, getting married,saying goodbye, and falling in love.My favorite character was Marmee I liked her because she was so loving and hardworking. Through the many difficult trials in life she remained strong. When I grow up I hope I can be like that,I don't want to tell you anymore i want to let you read the other things yourself. I hope you don't have anywhere to be because once you start reading this book you can't put it down. I recomend this book for girls of any age, young or old I am sure you will enjoy.WARNING:THIS BOOK CAN MAKE YOU LATE!!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women was our reading selection for October 2002. We thought this timeless classic story of four sisters was wholesome and heartwarming.This coming of age story that was inspired by the author's real life family teaches family values and morals. Each of the girls have their own set of problems but through love and understand they learn the lessons of life.All of us agree that the character were well written and the story is one that will stay in your heart long after you have read the same page. A few of us have read the many times and we all highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is heart-warming and inspiring. It is the story of a family of four girls, Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy, their friend Laurie, and their search for their &quot;castles in the air.&quot; The girls go through life trying to follow the example of their good and generous parents. They correct their faults by listening to, learning from, and teaching each other and the people around them. Each person chooses a different path to try and get their wishes or &quot;castles in the air,&quot; as the four March girls call them. The eldest sister, Meg, wishes for first a house full of luxurious things and a lot of money. She then also would like a good husband and healthy children. By the end of part one of the book, Meg is well on her way to getting her wish. However, her priorities seem to switch places. Beth is the &quot;pet&quot; of the family and she deserves it. She is a shy, sweet girl who only opens up to those she trusts. She is the third child and is very attatched to her older sister Jo. Beth's castle in the air is only to live quietly and to take care of those around her. God grants her wish.Amy is the youngest March sister. She has artistic talent and so understandably her wish is to be an artist. Amy tries her best to improve herself and be a lady of society. Her hard work and good sense reward her in the end. Jo is the second eldest sister and the most unique. She doesn't care what others think, except for her family and a few special friends. Jo is stubborn, quick-tempered, and blunt. However, she is also kind, forgiving, and full of passion. She learns her lessons the hard way, but tries to catch others and save them the fall. Jo's dream is to support herself and her family by doing what she loves best, writing.Laurie, or Teddy as Jo calls him, is the neighbor and life long friend. The girls, especially Jo, teach him to get over his bashfulness and help him to grow into a fine young man. He struggles, but this is a hopeful book, and he wins his battle. He also wishes to love and be loved by one of the March sisters. All of the charachters do end up getting their castles in the air. It is very enjoyable to read how their wishes change throughout the book. Little Women is a fantastic novel. It is full of smart lessons and important morals. I especially enjoy how the story tells the difference between loving someone and being in love with someone. I like how the book is hopeful and am inspired to try and correct my faults and go out in search for my own &quot;castles in the air.&quot;"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I was in the middle of Meg and John's first real dinner together since their babies were born and all of a sudden the story switched to Laurie and Amy.

I read this when I was too young to appreciate it and have read it over and over again all my life. The heart of America. Buy it. Keep it. Treasure it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"If I could give it 10 stars, I would. As someone who never had a sister, I closed this book wishing dearly that I had. Following the trials of the four March sisters was something that I didn't want to stop when the book ended. It was overall, a book of good will and good nature, full of people who are struggling to find themselves and ending up in places they never quite suspected by the end. But what I found most astonishing about Alcott's characters was how I found a little bit of myself in each one.What I found most fascinating was the culture of the mid-1800s- learning what was proper and not proper, and being astonished at just how much women's roles have changed since then.The book is a very quick and easy read, perfect for young people and adults alike. I was literally absorbed into this story, much like I was with the movie version starring Winona Ryder that was so perfectly cast and faithful to the book, I should hope that all filmmakers are as kind to the literature on which they are based.I highly, HIGHLY recommend Little Women!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This story takes place mostly at the March's house and the Laurence house which is important because it gives the reader an idea of how the each live and helps the reader understand them better.This book is mostly about four sisters named Margaret, Josephine, Elizabeth and Amy March,their mother Marmee March, Theodore Laurence, Mr. Laurence, they are always helping each other and others in need and are happy the way they are and will always be friends, are always thoughtful, truthful, and use manners even when talking to each other and others and even though they have very few money they still enjoy their lives and Mr.Laurence enjoys the company of them at his house, even though the Laurence's are wealthy the girls him and his grandson the same way they treat each other with respect and tells about their lives.In my opinion this is the best book I've Ever read ! I think this is an educational book because it teaches that money isn't everything that's better to be happy the way you are and you don't need money to be happy and you can be happy by helping people and that you should respect elders and others.I would recommend this book because it's educational and a good book to read when bored or just want to read a book or read an interesting book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When I was in junior high, my mom made me read Little Women for one of my school assignments.

A MUST-read!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"very timely delivery. got for granddaughter and know she will love it. every young girl should read this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"My first actual introduction to Little Women came from watching the Winona Ryder version of the film on a snowy, beautiful day in New England during my sophmore year of high school. I immediately fell in love with the movie and tracked down the book in my library. I read a few pages of it, couldn't get into it, and brought it back to school unread. And that was that (sadly this happened with a few classics that weren't required of me). I ultimately decided that I should give Little Women another shot due to my love of the film. I'm so glad I did.Okay, sure some of the views in this book (one being that a woman's worth was determined on how well she kept house) did prick my feminist nerves a little bit, but I did keep in mind that this was a wildly different time than the one I live in now. The book was a bit on the preachy side, but Little Women had such a humble and homey feel to it that I really didn't mind being preached at most of the time.Now, on to The Little Women...I was endeared by all of the characters in this book (Marmee, Hannah, etc.), but of course I was mostly endeared by the little women (and Laurie). I just loved Meg, Beth, Jo, and Amy (to some extent, at least). My favorite was definitely Jo. She was just so strong, independent, and marched to the beat of her own drum. And I adored her relationship with Laurie. When I finished the film, I remember thinking (HUGE SPOILER FOR THE END HERE) \\"Laurie ends up with Amy?!??!? What a rip-off!\\" Even while reading the book, I kept hoping that I would turn the page and Jo would end up with Laurie.On the one hand, I thought that Jo and Laurie were perfect for each other, but on the other hand, I loved that they had such a strong friendship that not even unrequited love could ruin it. However, I still don't like that Laurie ended up with Amy. Out of all the sisters, she was the one I was least endeared by. I would've loved nothing more than to drop her down a peg or two (or six). However, nothing can be done about it at this point. The fact that I'm so into whom should end up with whom just shows how attached I am to Little Women. (END OF SPOILER)So, I absolutely loved and adored Little Women. I found it to be one of those classics that's just incredibly easy to read that even those whom don't have much experience in reading classics (like me) can understand the language without much difficulty. Little Women was just an adorable and sweet book that I know I'm going to re-read this book for years to come."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I really liked this book sooo much! Sometimes the way the language was back then, i had a little bit of a hard time understanding it, but all in all what a wonderful story, and i fell in love with all the sisters in the novel! Great read!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"\\"Little Women\\" by Louisa May Alcott has been undervalued for most of its history. This book is a true American Classic. Published originally in October of 1868, it is a story set during the Civil War, but Alcott does not deal with the specifics of the war. Instead, it serves as the pretext for the absence of Robin March, the father of the four \\"Little Women\\", for a large portion of the first book. The novel today actually consists of two books, the original \\"Little Women\\" from 1868, and the sequel \\"Good Wives\\" which was published the following year in April of 1869. The two volumes started being treated as one in 1880.The first book deals with the growing maturity of the four sisters, and in particularly of Jo and Meg as they have to learn to help their mother out more and do with less during the war, and while their father is away. Meg is the eldest at 16 when the story begins, and Jo (who clearly represents the author) is 15. There is then a gap of a couple years with Beth being just 13 and Amy 12. Their lives transition from that of young girls to young women, and each sister has her own unique traits. Margaret \\"Meg\\" with her beauty is following the traditional path in entering society and heading towards marriage. Josephine \\"Jo\\" is attracted by intellectual pursuits, in particular reading and writing. Elizabeth \\"Beth\\" is very shy and demure. She is also a peacemaker between the sisters, and enjoys helping others. Sadly, she also falls sick and never fully recovers from scarlet fever. Amy is the baby, and likes to tag along with others. She is also used to getting her own way.The first book is masterful in its simplicity. The story feels real, undoubtedly largely due to the author drawing on her own experiences, but Alcott also cleverly avoids adding too much into it and thereby making it unrealistic. She chooses a good steady pace, and the characters are well defined and consistently portrayed. Her dialogue is not perfect, but that adds to the overall realism of the telling of the story. It is a wonderful story for young women to read, and is also very readable for older readers.The second book is fairly good too, though it fails to be as believable as the first book as Alcott allowed herself to be convinced to have Jo marry. Alcott never married, and the union she chooses for Jo is a bit unusual and thus it doesn't feel right. Outside of that, though, the second book is a worthy successor to the first. Meg's choice of husband fits perfectly with the character and ideals that she develops in the first book. Most of Jo's actions in the second book also fit well with her character up, including her avoiding marriage with Laurie, her friend and neighbor who plays an important role throughout both books. Only at the point where Jo marries does it not fit. The tragedy of Meg's passing is beautifully described, and the reader is touched by the goodness of her character. Lastly, the full development of Amy fits well, including her choice of spouse.The Penguin Classics edition of \\"Little Women\\" includes a very informative introduction by Elaine Showalter and extensive notes by Siobhan Kilfeather and Vinca Showalter. One of the important notes is that this edition is based on the original publications, and not those which were amended by Alcott for later editions, though obvious printer errors were corrected. There is discussion of some of the changes which Alcott made in the notes to the text. This is a wonderful book, but I will take part of a star away and round down for Jo's forced marriage."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I like this book because of Jo March. And I never cry when Beth dies, because she annoys me."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I was thrilled to find Little Woman for free on Kindle. I remember reading this book over and over again when I was a child. I believe the version I read back then (many years ago) was slightly different from this one. There are scenes in the Kindle version I don't remember from my childhood. Of course, it could just be a faulty memory on my part. Either way, this is a wonderful book for both children and adults."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"\\"Little Women\\", written by Louisa May Alcott, is about four sisters, Jo March who is fifteen-years-old, Meg March who is the oldest, Beth March who is thirteen-years-old, and Amy March who is the youngest by twelve-years-old, who live in England with their mother, Marmee. They are poor, and their mother mostly does the working, while their father is out fighting in war, but help out by working little jobs outside of helping in the house. The four sisters go through so much in life, but they don't care much about what others think because they are happy that they were blessed with a father and a mother who love them very much, and they always got each other.\\"Little Women\\" is an amazing book that I recommend to anyone. It teaches people a life lesson, and shows how a person with less fortune lives throughout their lives. As I read this book, so many emotions went through my head, I found myself crying, happy, and wanting to read the book continuously without stopping. This book was originally written in 1868, it being the first novel book that she has ever written. Louis May Alcott was born in the year of 1832 in Massachusetts. She was the second daughter to Bronson Alcott and Abigail May. She had three sisters, Anna, Elizabeth, and Abby. When Louisa was about ten years, her and her family moved to Harvard, Massachusetts. On a hillside farm they planned to establish a model community, Fruitlands, making use of no animal products or labor except, as Abigail Alcott observed, for that of women. She and her small daughters struggled to keep household and farm going while the men went about the countryside philosophizing. In a few months quarrels erupted, and winter weather saw the end of the experiment. The only lasting product of Fruitlands was Louisa's reminiscence, \\"Transcendental Wild Oats.\\" Her and her family moved to Concord and for the next three years lived across the road from Emerson in a house they called Hillside, a relatively happy period preserved in the first chapters of Little Women. Closeness to the Emerson family was important to Louisa. Her first book, Flower Fables, 1854, was written for Ellen Emerson, whose father she idolized. Years later Alcott told Emerson about her early romance. \\"He was much amused,\\" she wrote, \\"and begged for his letters, kindly saying he felt honored to be so worshipped. The letters were burnt long ago, but Emerson remained my 'Master,' while he lived, doing more for me,--as for many another--than he knew, by the simple beauty of his life, the truth and wisdom of his books, the example of a great, good man.\\" In these years, Louisa \\"got religion,\\" as she later put it. Running in the Concord woods early one fall morning, she stopped to see the sunshine over the meadows. \\"A very strange and solemn feeling came over me as I stood there,\\" she wrote in her journal, \\"with no sound but the rustle of the pines, no one near me, and the sun so glorious, as for me alone. It seemed as if I felt God as I never did before, and I prayed in my heart that I might keep that happy sense of nearness all my life\\" (Louis May Alcott). On March 1, 1888, Louisa visited her father for the last time. \\"I am going up,\\" he said. \\"Come with me.\\" \\"Oh, I wish I could,\\" she replied. Bronson Alcott died on March 4, and Louisa May Alcott on March 6. She was buried in Sleepy Hollow cemetery in Concord. Her grave bears a Civil War veteran's marker. Throughout her life, she was successful, writing books about inspirational families and people. She was a great person in general as well, leaving a great memory of a wonderful woman who was loving and caring"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I can't remember if I ever finished this book in high school. If I did, I didn't appreciate it as much as I did now - many, many years later :DIt's a lesson on good manners and right conduct, on faith, on family relationships, parenthood, sisterhood, brotherhood, friendship, neighborliness, courtship, marriage, child-rearing, dreams, frustrations , life itself - all found in the saga of the March sisters from when they were teeners and tweeners through their adulthood. I have highlighted quite a number of lines in this book that I would have shared if not for space limitation. The message is timeless - if we would all have the sense and character that was instilled in the March sisters; if all families were to see and act on its role as the most elemental unit in society(but the most important nonetheless), this world would be a better place for all of humankind."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Unfortunately, I just couldn't embrace this book. However, I also couldn't give it less than three stars because it is such a time tested classic and I could understand why generations of readers have adored it. For me, personally, I found it too feminine and sentimental. The narrative was laced with morals and the romantic and flowery language was tedious. The characters were well developed, though some were more sympathetic than others. As a writer, I had a natural affinity towards Jo, and how could any reader not be fond of gentle Beth. Meg doesn't become interesting until she becomes a mother and I never felt much depth in Amy. Of course Marmee was full of sage advice, Laurie was quite a rascal, and Professor Bhaer was the epitome of kindness. While I did care about what happened to the March family and I was pleased with the conclusion, I didn't feel devotion to the book itself because I'm just not the type of romantic individual who can identify with such feminine notions."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I purchased this audio book to introduce my 10 year old daughter to Little Women. We began listening to it while driving on a seven hour trip. We found that while the story can still engage a modern reader, this version of the audio book was not well delivered. The recording is just a bit flat. The reader sounds like the schoolteacher from Little House on the Prairie. The production does not deliver on the emotional aspect that underlies the text. Maybe we've been spoiled by superb audio-book readers like Jim Dale. But I found this recording a bit disappointing. My daughter finished by book from a print copy rather than continue to listen."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book as a kid, and loved it. However after reading this version I realized that I had read a shortened version. I'm so glad I took the time to re-read such a wonderful book. The longer version is definitely better.This should be required reading for junior high students as there are many life lessons contained in this terrific story."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this book. I aquired the audiobook version from audible and listened to it in my car with my seven year old son. I really didn't expect for him to like it and though he never seemed to pay attention to it - however he always knew what was going on and was quite upset that the ending didn't play out the way he wanted. Apparently my little 7 year old boy who revels in dirt and climbing trees is a closet romantic and expected a wedding - no matter that the characters were a bit too young to get married.The short summary - We follow the March family, 4 dutiful daughters and their mother through the period of time that their father is away at war (I believe he's a chaplain). They befriend their neighbors and go through several trials, all learning to be better people through it all.It doesn't sound very exciting does it? Well it's not exciting in the shootem up explosion type way - but it is very engaging and endearing. Many people argue that this book has lost it's luster since the girls spend time sewing, studying and functioning in rather \\"old fashioned\\" ways. Some have even complained of the overtly religious overtones. I personally though it was a wonderful story of four young girls learning each in their own way - that life can be hard, life can be heartbreaking, death is very real, but then so is love, friendship and joy. Some argue that Mrs. March is an unattainable visiage of a \\"perfect mother\\" however I argue that we see her only through her daughters' eyes - and that every mother is on a pedestal in the eyes of their daughters. We don't know if the moments when she is out of site, she is sobbing at her loneliness or having bouts of internal rage at the behavior of her children. She simply projects and outward calm, which most mothers attempt to keep in front of their children.There is a certain beauty to this story, each of the girls has their own personal battle to fight within themselves and we watch as they find ways to overcome, either their envy, their vanity, their selfishness - some turn to friendship, others to prayer. I have to admit that I too had hoped for the ending that my little son wanted - even though I knew it was silly to wish for two young people to end up together, but who knows what the future holds for them after the last page of the book.The simple fact that a little seven year old ADHD boy was able to love and care about the people in this story, and to have hopes for them - shows the power of the writing contained within. I highly recommend this book - even to those who are not into \\"romance\\" or \\"period literature.\\""},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a story about four sisters who live with their mother. I thought it was a great story because it is really easy to figure out what they are doing in a jiff. The best part of this book is that it shows the characters have feelings and emotions that are throughtout the whole story. The story explains to me what it was like to live back in the older days. Yet to me this book seems new. If I could say who represents me most,it is Jo. Jo is a great reader and it comes in handy when she meets a boy named Laurie. Laurie is a rich kid who ends up being like family to these sisters. This story really reminds of how life is sometimes. Will you find out what happens to these sisters?

The illustrations by Jessie Smith are outstanding. Also, the story is set in a period of our history which is so fascinating."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book reads like a children's novel and is an extremely pleasant reading experience. Really lovely!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a heartwarming tale of four sisters growing up in their mother's house in (I believe) New England. We follow the girls through their teens and into marriage and (in some cases) motherhood. Obviously intended mainly for young women, this is not a book to buy for your brother or boyfriend. It is, however, a fascinating look at life in another era, before everything got complicated. I was just as devastated as any of the characters were when tragedy struck. This novel is followed by Little Men, in which Jo and her new husband open a home for runaway boys, and Good Wives, in which the sisters are all grown up and married. You won't regret taking a trip back in time and watching the girls fall in love, lean on each other and learn what life is about"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"It was such a pleasure to meet the sisters as they were created by the aurthor. At first you feel like it was written to teach young girls their morals, but it is so much more. Ms Alcott's reflections on relationships still hold true today. For a period book, the writing is very smooth and clear enough for our generation to understand. In fact, it actually helps you to get closer to the era."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book when I was a little girl and I love it as much now as I did then. The neat thing about Little Women is how I connect more with different characters during different points in my life. Romantic Amy, Rebellious Jo, Homemaker Meg, I love them all. This is a definite must read!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Have you ever thought about what it would be like to live during the Cicil War? Little women, by Louisa May Alcott is a sterling example of this. In Little Women, there's a family of seven. Marmee(the mom);Meg, Joe, Beth, and Amy(sisters), a maid, and the father who is a chaplain in the Civil War. The sisters are good friends until their handsome neighbor Teddy moves in with his grandfather. Then they start vying each other for his attention. Through all this, there are fires, dances, family problems, etc. Towards the end one of the sisters dies from scarlet fever.Little Women is a book written for middle to high scholl students. The language it is written in, and some of the things that happen would confuse elementary. It;s a very good book for sisters, friends, etc because it teaches you not to become jealous.Little Women can be both sad and humorous at times. Throughout the story the dialouge switches back in forth. For example, when Amy was talking to Joe she said \\"You like Teddy, You like Teddy\\". Then in the same paragraph it talks about there father. At sometimes the girls are happy with each other, while sometimes they are angry. For a chapter at the end it's very sad when one of the sisters dies.The content of the book is very good. It goes back and forth from fictional stories from the civil war to non-fictional stories. A lot of the places in the book are real to. For examole, Virginia. The book teaches a very good moral. Not just for sisters but for anybody. It teaches you not to get jealous, and yearn for things others have or want.If you want to read a fictional story about sisters set in the Civil War, then this book is for you!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I just finished reading Louisa May Alcott's Little Women and I thought it was okay. Some of the problems that she wrote about I would not have to worry about today. One problem that I wouldn't have to worry about would be having a good dress to wear to a party,like Jo had to. Not many girls wear a lot of dresses to parties. Some parts of the book were better than others,like when all the girls pitched in money to buy a present for their Mom instead of themselves. Louisa May Alcott also wrote the book kind of like a sequal to Little Women called Little Men,if you would like to know what happens with Jo."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The story of these four girls and their experiences growing up is one that all readers can relate to. I have read the book multiple times, and each time I do I discover a new thing about these vivacious girls. I would especially recommend this book to anyone with sisters because the relationships between the four sisters is the main focus of the book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was the first book I have ever read by Lousia. Through the years I have read ALL her other books but this one remains my favorite. If you read it you will understand why it is a classic!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have read Little Women nearly annually since I was 8 years old. The story never ceases to amaze me. As a youngster, I related to the tomboy Jo. As a new wife, I laughed out loud at Meg's attempts to make jam. Although I know it is going to happen, I never fail to cry when Beth's &quot;tide goes out easily&quot;. Now that loss has touched my life as an adult, the story becomes even more poignant. I gave this book as a gift to my oldest &quot;little woman&quot; in the hopes she loves this book as much as me."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read Little Women many times as a pre-teen. I would re-read and cry over the passage where Laurie comes home married to Amy. Now, 25 years later, I recently decided to read it again. It is even better now, reading it with an adult's perspective. The characters are so deeply developed, their Christian faith plays a big role in their lives, the wives they become.....it is even better than I remembered and I'm not even sure why it is considered children's literature. Good for all ages!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The first part of &quot;Little Women&quot; is an innocent portrait of girlhood (at a time when 16-year-olds, could still be girls without any hurry to grow up). Each March girl has her own burden to carry, trial to overcome, and castle in the air to wish and work for. Meg has to keep her head from being turned by rich friends who dress her up in their finery at their &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and make her feel ashamed for coming from a poor family. Beth has to overcome her fear of crotchety Mr. Laurence so that she may enter the &quot;Palace Beautiful.&quot; Amy has to pass through the &quot;Valley of Humiliation,&quot; and learn to humbly admit her wrong. Jo has to subdue &quot;Apollyon&quot; (the &quot;Dark Angel&quot; in abridged versions), swallow her pride and learn to forgive and forget the destruction of her most prized possession.Of course, every step of the way, Marmee gives counsel, comfort and encouragement; and their neighbor Laurie adds fun and mischief like only a boy--and an honorary brother--can.Louisa May Alcott constantly alludes to &quot;The Pilgrim's Progress&quot; by John Bunyan. She also has an entire chapter that sees the March girls impersonate characters in a Charles Dickens novel. Yet none of this is above the heads of young readers, who can take each episode in the March girls' play in stride. Children's fun is universally understood.I am never tired of rereading this part.The second half of the novel (which is actually &quot;Good Wives&quot;, the sequel of the original &quot;Little Women&quot;) is very different. More serious, it shows the girls growing up and getting married--or passing on to another world. If Book 1 told stories of the golden morning and afternoon of childhood, Book 2 has stories of the dark night of maturity. Despite its funny and light-hearted parts, the bittersweet thought that childhood is now far away lingers in the air. (After Book 2, &quot;Little Men&quot; was a relief--proof that the sun always rises on the next generation of children.)There are few classics I consider as timeless as Louisa May Alcott's novels about the March family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Hi I;m Amanda.

I enjoyed how the author managed to make the book readable to people of all ages even though it was about children. Also, I approved of the theme-- the satisfaction that simple virtues can bring, even if you must sacrifice greater ambition to acheive it. At least, that is the message I took from this book. Additionally, Beth's character and death were beautifully and compellingly written. The one problem I had with the book was the style of narration; it was written in first person with the author referring to herself. This made it hard for me to lose myself in the story, as I kept getting dragged back to reality by the author herself mentioning how the story was a story. This was annoying, to say the least. All in all, I recommend this book, as it becomes even more relevent in today's pleasure-loving mindset, as the characters do their duties wholeheartedly. A good, homelike, virtuous book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Great classic read. I enjoyed this book decades ago when I was in high school, but enjoyed it even more this time.

It's still the fiesty, independent Jo I admired, so I enjoyed reading this version. There were some formatting issues, such as many paragraphs being completely indented, but that's formatting, not content."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is the first novel by Louisa May Alcott, written in 1868, and the first of the Little Women series. The story involves the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, their mother, Marmee, their neighbour, Laurie and his tutor, Mr Brooke, and is set at the time of the Civil War. Their father, Mr March, is away ministering at the war and his absence looms large for the family, whose circumstances are much reduced due to an unwise investment some years ago. Mrs March works dispensing charity to the poor and those affected by the war and does her best to hold together her family; sixteen-year-old Meg, who remembers how is was when they were better off and loves fine things, works as a governess, teaching the King girls; fifteen-year-old Jo, a budding writer, is employed as a companion for the formidable Aunt March; shy, thirteen-year-old Beth, the musical sister, helps at home while eleven-year-old wilful Amy, whose vocation is art, attends school. While the first chapter introduces a family that seem sickeningly good, each character soon enough becomes human, flawed and likeable for their individual faults and charms. As the war, penury and scarlet fever impact on their lives, each of the March girls has her own trials, faces challenges, learns lessons about vanity, selfishness, anger, change and love from the events of life and matures during the course of the twelve months over which the novel is set. The lessons may seem simplistic, but perhaps these were simpler times. After some time ago reading March, the excellent novel by Geraldine Brooks about the absent March father, I resolved to reread this novel. With only the vaguest of memories of the last reading, the plot and characters seemed relatively fresh. This very enjoyable and thought-provoking read now spurs me on to read Good Wives, and back to reread March."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I was skeptical about reading such a feminine book but after a few chapters I was hooked. The characters have such depth and they bare all their trouble with a kind of strength that you'd never expect from young women. All the girls are tremendously well developed, and the story touches on nearly every vice and nearly ever virtue.It's a tremendous story of love and growth that I would recommend to any one. The relationships between characters are complicated and multifaceted: making the girls seem so real you'd expect to meet them on the street."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was one of my favorite novels as a child. I just recently read it again and it was still a wonderful and entertaining book. It is still one of my favorites!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Great read.

Delivered quickly and will no doubt order from them again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I enjoyed it a lot. All of my sisters had read it but me and I wanted a little fun reading it was great funny, sad, and a great ending"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"First, this is not a review of any abridged version of the book. That book is garbage, and you should not buy it, regardless of the illustrations.Second, why is this book good? It's not particularly well written, for example. And there aren't a lot of deeper layers. Yet somehow it is good; but not just good. It's great. One of the great early American novels. So I guess it is the story itself, that of the timeless March sisters. Applicable to every family, every girl, and maybe every childhood. First fantasies, first loves, and first disappointments.One of the things I like most about this book is the unpleasant turns it takes regardless of the reader's wishes -- thus reflecting life itself. We want Beth to recover, but she does not. We want Jo and Laurie to marry, but that doesn't happen. Or at least for neither to be complete without the other. But again, no. Life does not cohere like that, and neither does this story. The dead remain stark dead and the \\"true loves\\" find other loves that they ultimately find truer. And that is striking; very realistic, very wonderful. Also probably why this story works better than Little Men, which was not based as much on reality.Some postscript notes: the earlier parts of the book are best, before we become depressed by the dual disappointments. It peaks when it tells about Beth's final days, that poor, gentle soul. I'm pretty hardened, but that got to even me -- well, a little, anyway."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I got this for free for reading on my Kindle and I just LOVE being able to read it whenever the mood strikes, wherever I may be.

Louise May Alcott, by her own admission, can be a bit melodramatic, but that doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the story."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"For those who love classics this is a start. I had read this book even before I got my kindle and as soon as I got my kindle this was one of the first books I looked for."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The story Little Women by Louisa May Alcott, is a wonderful and amusing story about a family, mainly four sisters learning as they grow. Together they have many good and bad experiences, but all of them they will never forget. It is perfect for young adults, especially &quot;Little Women&quot; who are growing up, because of the experiences it deals with. With every turn of the page, there is a new adventure to be found. The book is so brilliantly put together that you won't even want to put it down. There are new situations and lessons to be learned after each chapter. The story relates it's situations to some that actually happen in everyday life. For example, the way Amy wants to look perfect all the time, and the way Jo acts like a tomboy. Through all the obstacles in the girls' lives, they always stick together working everything out, and never giving up. This story is a perfect example of how family's should love each other and not give up on anything."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"In the senior class of the &quot;Great Books&quot; program at the college I attended, one of the weekly speakers asked how many of the women had read Little Women. Nearly all of the women in the class raised their hands. Then she asked how many men had read it. One man raised his hand - the chair of the English department! That was when I decided to read this book, and it has become one of my all-time favorites! I would recommend this book to everyone - men and women, young or old."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved the book. I thought that Louisa May Alcott did anoutstanding job describing Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy.

I cried at the partwhere Beth died of Scarlet Fever. But other than that sadpart the rest of the book was great"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"It takes a real man, who is secure in his manhood, to admit to reading a book like Little Women. I am such a man. A few months ago I read Pride and Prejudice, although to be fully honest, the reason I read it was so that I'd appreciate Pride & Prejudice and Zombies more. There are certain books that I feel should be read by everyone. This is one of them. It's classic literature and has stood the test of time.That being said, I can't say that I particularly enjoyed reading it. Was I on the edge of my seat wondering if Meg would learn how to make fresh jam or not to spend her husband's earnings on frivolous things? No. Did I cry when Beth was on death's doorstep with Scarlet Fever? Not quite. Was my heart warmed when Jo sold her hair to help with the family's finances while their dad was away at war? Please. Nevertheless, it's an excellently written book. I can see why it's considered a classic. But before I'd be able to read another book like this, say Jane Eyre or something, I'd need to read 25 or so books for pleasure."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book starts out with four teenagers, tells the story of them growing, until the four girls become little women. The four girls have very different personalities. While they are growing, many things happen to them. Here are four explanations of the four little women:The oldest and probally the most important to talk about is Meg. She loves to play with her sisters and to take care of them. She gets married (first) to Mr. Brooke the tudor.The second oldest is one year younger than Meg, named Josephine. She is a tomboy whom is a very great author. She is feircly independant, and likes people to call her 'Jo'.The second youngest is Beth. She is a little girl with a very shy personality, and loves music. (By the way, I was suprised of the fate to one of the girls...)The most young of the children is Amy. She is a very selfish, prissy, bossy, and artistic. She is the third person who marries, and she marrys \\"the Laurence boy\\". She complains to many people that her nose is flat."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"You know the story. If you don't, many of these other reviewers have done the job for me. For me, this is my most favorite book in all of American literature. Growing up, I had a friend who was just like Beth and everytime I re-read this book, I remember my childhood adventures with Beth. The fictional Beth in \\"Little Women\\" was as much of a friend as my other friend, too.I cannot recommend this book enough. If you haven't read it -- you must read it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is, to put it simply, an great book. Any young woman with the slightest interest in reading would certainly be able to identify with at least one of the four unique sisters, and as I child I was fascinated by the predicaments and adventures of their lives- and convinced that I was in love with Laurie, their charming yet complex \\"boy next door.\\" This story has not lost its charm because of its powerful illustration of female (obviously, sisterly in particular) relationships, as Alcott emphasizes their commitment to each other even as they grow in separate directions and face adversity. There's a reason why it became a classic...don't pass it up."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"If recommending a classic novel to someone who wants to read examples of good writing, no recommendation would be complete without the addition of Little Women, and the four March sisters; Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It is a story about the devotion of these four young sisters to each other, to their family, and to their friends. No matter what the age, all of us must learn to endure the obstacles that life will throw us. So it is in this story. Although originally written in 1898, this novel transcends time. Alcott weaves the story of these sisters as they search for love, security, peace, and happiness. \\"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,\\" grumbled Jo, lying on the rug. So begins this richly written story. Even if you have seen the movie, do try reading this beautiful classic. Perhaps we can learn a thing or two from a classic writer.It transcends all time. It doesn't matter if the time frame is the late 1800's; good writing is good writing, which should lead to good reading. Louisa May Alcott was so ahead of her time in writing about spirited, independent women in a time when it was not fashionable to be so. If you liked this book, you may want to refer to other books by Alcott, but I still believe this is by far her best."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little women is a book for all ages.

The way the sisters lives turned out was way different than they thought but they still lives happily."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A very early reader, I received a copy of \\"Little Women\\" at age 7. From the very first time I read this lovely book, I fancied myself as Jo, and so thoroughly identified with her that even through all the succeeding decades and thousands of other books read, this book will remain one of my top five favourite books because of her. I read and reread this book sitting in a big apple tree in my parent's back yard, laying on the grass on a summer's day, and under the sheets with a flashlight I now suspect my parents knew I had stashed under my bed.In an age of easily digested and mass-produced books with weak characters and plot, \\"Little Women\\" is a stand-out that resists the passage of time for its exemplary characters, theme of family unity, and love on so many different levels (friendship, familial, true love, and romantic love).Readers today might find the writing and occasional chirpiness of the March sisters when faced with their poverty a bit difficult to relate to, but knowing stories of how my own mother and sisters faced the Depression and then WWII in the UK made me realise from an early age that trying to find things to rejoice in is essential to surviving tragedy and loss on a personal level.The March sisters encapsulate female society in most countries even now, and are well-written individual characters, each with a different goal they wish to fulfil in life. The girls do not become career women, and their parents do preach the importance of family life and sacrifice, however, each one does what was expected of young girls at that time. Jo's daring in writing a sensationalist \\"man's\\" story and insisting on payment commensurate with a man was unheard of in those days and when one considers that women are still underpaid, it makes Jo's triumph still relative today. Amy's goal of being comfortably well-off is eventually tempered by her own personal sorrow at the poor health of her own little Beth, Meg wants to be a mother and wife, and she learns not to overachieve, and Beth who overcomes pathological shyness through her altruism and empathy for others and which leads to her death is still inspirational today.My suggestion is that if you have a daughter, sister, granddaughter or friend, take turns reading it. It will improve your vocabulary, make you smile, and dear Beth's stoicism will bring a tear to your eye."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women was one of my favorite books as a young adult.

The story lines never come together. Basically, the entire book is a set of character sketches. Yes, it kept my attention and I did finish the book, but by the time I was finished, I regretted spending the time on it and fussed at my mother who told me in advance that this was not one of her favorites.

They are helped by their daughter Anna, who is just getting over an unhappy love affair. Less helpful are their other two children, Helen, a hopeless bungler who is hoping to be taken on as a nun, and Brendan, who has escaped his childhood home and family to take up farming with his Uncle Vincent in Ireland. Other guests include the best man Frank, who has become much more successful than Desmond and the maid of honor, Helen, both of whom have their own problems. Deirdre is extremely concerned with appearances, since she married &quot;beneath her&quot; 25 years ago, and her gentle falsehoods and nervous posturings effect her children and others around her. Each of the eight main characters is introduced in a chapter and they all come together for the celebration at the end.

Anyone who has ever organised a family event such as this will love the descriptions of family politics, and I'm sure many will sympathise with the heroine's family traumas and how being 'the responsible one' can lead to all sorts of complications, not to mention that vaguely disquieting feeling of being put upon.

There are secrets involved in everyone's lives and this book is a reflection upon that.There is Anna, the daughter in charge of planning the anniversary celebration, who is in love with an actor still married to his wife and mother of his sons. There is Brendan who fled England back to the Irish farmland that his father had escaped from. There is Helen, the youngest child, bent on becoming a nun in an order that doesn't even want her. There is Desmond, their father, miserable in a management level of a grocery store chain and their mother, Deirdre, who has always tried to maintain the look of happiness and perfection. And they all come to self-realizations in this novel. There is Deirdre's maid of honor, Maureen, who became a successful business woman, and there is Frank, the best man, who is the head of the grocery store chain. And other characters with a delightful insights written by Maeve.This book is nice ~~ it's comfort reading, if you will. It is not, by far, her best book. She has a tendency to string her readers along for more juicy tidbits and end it promptly without revealing any more stories. It's frustrating because it leaves all the questions unanswered. So it's not as good as &quot;Circle of Friends&quot; or &quot;Light a Penny Candle&quot; or her others. But still, it is a comforting read.It is a nice little story of people and friends of a family in England.

All of her books are filled with character description and are definately page turners.

This is the seventh book of Binchy's that I have read and everytime I finish one, I can't wait to start the next.

As we meet each character, their inner thoughts explain their relationships to each other, and to the activities that are happening in each individual's life. This bittersweet tale is very realistic in explaining how and why people act in the strange ways that we all do. As we meet each person, the puzzle comes together and by the end the reader has a complete picture of the event, the thoughts, the preparation, and the cast of the Silver Wedding Party.

Silver Wedding strikes me as one of her more unique stories, one that goes out on a bit of a ledge.The book is comprised of something like 8 different parts; each with it's own narrator & we get a glimpse into that person's life. We start out with the eldest daughter of the anniversary couple, Anna, and then to her two other siblings- Brenden & Helen. We also read about her parents and their friends. In the final part we see them all reunited for the anniversary party.The book was not exactly what I was expecting- it wasn't really a very \\"happy\\" book. In fact, the stories inside it were quite sad & depressing. I did enjoy though what almost seemed like a book full of mini-stories all coming together at the end. So far it's not my favorite of her's, but I enjoyed it just the same."},{"Title":"Silver Wedding (Paragon Softcover Large Print Books)","review":"This book takes a typical family, examines its seperate members, and then provides a look at the whole with the knowledge of the secrets each member has.I enjoy Binchy's style of writing interconnected stories that weave together.

I would have rathered her write about only half the characters and go into more depth about those.

I did like the part about the various invites to the party which had been answered, (Not a direct quote) - &quot;They would send flowers and a card,but would not attend, and that is the way it should be&quot; It was a quick read, though - great for a rainy weekend or a trip to the beach.

Anna, the eldest daughter, blindly in love with an out-of-work author; Helen, the youngest, struggling to become a nun; Brendan, the only son who went against the norms and his parents&iexcl; wishes to work in a farm in Ireland. Also weaved into the story was Frank, the best man, a successful business man, though slightly less successful in the affairs of the heart, Father Hurley, the priest who married the couple twenty-five years ago, and feisty Maureen, Deirdre&iexcl;s best friend.These were ordinary characters, but what would make the reader go on is that each of the character had its own unique tale to tell, from managing family relationships, to hidden and secret affairs of the heart.I felt a slight disappointment, however, at the end of the book as it left me with a sense of non-fulfillment. We were given insights to the problems but were not shown solutions. For instance, Deirdre&iexcl;s uneasy relationship with her children did not appear to be improved and Maureen&iexcl;s relationship with Walter did not develop further. Maybe this is the author&iexcl;s reflection of the real world, that not every question has an answer to it."},{"Title":"Silver Wedding (Paragon Softcover Large Print Books)","review":"This was only my 3rd book by Maeve Binchy, and compared to Evening Class and Echoes, Silver Wedding wasn't near as entertaining.

Murillo. Moreover, \\"the nature of Colombia's internal conflict has been completly distorted by the prism of drug-war politics,\\" he adds in the opening chapter. To this end, the author provides hard-hitting facts to support his claim that United States aid to Colombia, \\"is very often used by the Colombian political and economic elite to promote its own agenda.\\"Murillo does not stop there...he exposes Colombia's feeble legal system. \\"In Colombia, the Constitution and its laws are often ignored and rarely enforced, either because of a lack of bureaucratic capacity on the part of the state to do so, or because of an absence of political will on the part of the ruling elite to execute those laws that are designed to protect the public,\\" he reports.The author has few kind words for President Alvaro Uribe. Murillo attacks the politically motivated violence \\"by the state and its paramilitary apparatus.\\" He also is critical of the corruption of the traditional political parties, run predominantly by elites...\\"who compete for the spoils that serve as an incentive for cycles of generalized corruption.\\"The origins of the conflict, the myths behind Colombian democracy, the principal actors in today's conflict and the many views in the United States are studied in detail in this text. The analysis of the paramilitaries in Colombia is brilliant...particularly in respect to the millions of displaced people and the terrible treatment of Afro-Colombians.Still and all, the best part of this book is the call for change. Murillo slams Alvaro Uribe's unconditional support for George W. Bush and worries that the impunity of the violent actors in Colombia will continue to fuel the civil war. In conclusion, the author clearly states that a pure military solution is impossible and that only true democratic reforms can stop the violence. Recommended.Bert Ruiz"},{"Title":"Colombia and the United States : War, Unrest, and Destabilization (Open Media Series)","review":"With the presidential elections right around the corner, or as Mario Murillo, author of \\"Colombia and the United States (War, Unrest and Destabilization)\\" (Seven Stories Press), might put it: the elections right around the corner, Colombian President Alvaro Uribe V&eacute;lez is vying for Colombia's first-ever re-election. Rising quickly to the Nari&ntilde;o House in Bogot&aacute; on a promise to use military might to solve Colombia's ills, Uribe has ridden a wave of popularity he created from his \\"strong hand, big heart\\" slogan to his image of a hard-working man. He has even appeared in public in a poncho and campesino hat with a ranchero look strenthening his popularity.For those unfamiliar with the Colombian conflict, Murillo's book serves as good starting point, showing how the conflict has been oversimplified in the media and why one should be wary of doing so. The historical context Murillo presents is surprisingly thorough for a 200-page book, banking on a wide variety of Colombian and American sources, including an author's interview with a high-level FARC leader.Murillo's stellar Chapter 6, \\"Colombia in the News: Structural Damages in a Post 9-11 World\\", is reason enough to read this book. Murillo's unique research yields gripping data regarding not only how (or how little) the media covers the conflict in one of the countries receiving the most U.S.military aid, but the surging Orwellian doublespeak that appears in Colombian and U.S. media.Despite the likelihood of another Uribe term, Murillo offers a refreshing voice calling for non-military/non-Uribe solutions to conflict in Colombia."},{"Title":"Colombia and the United States : War, Unrest, and Destabilization (Open Media Series)","review":"This is a good book to get some review of events that have happened in Colombia.

Nothing is perfect, but Colombia is a far better place in eight short years.Saen Higgins"},{"Title":"Colombia and the United States : War, Unrest, and Destabilization (Open Media Series)","review":"After WWW II in Colombia, writes the author, only 3 percent of the population owned 50 percent of the land. Half the population was illiterate, most lived in the countryside. After election in 1946, President Mariano Ospina launched a reign of terror against the peasants, increasingly restless as they were for better land and not to live in misery. After the 1948 assassination of Populist politician Jorge Gaitan, the decade long period of \\"La Violencia\\" was in full swing, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands.The Betancur government made a deal with the FARC guerillas in the mid 80's that allowed it to demobilize and participate in legal politics. The FARC formed a political party called the Patriotic Union (UP) along with indigenous, union, women, peasant and other groups representing the masses. However, almost immediately UP activists and political candidates were subjected to assassination by the thousands. The FARC returned to the battlefield and began increasingly getting involved in drugs to finance better military equipment. It's human rights record deteriorated and its popularity plummeted. The AUC death squad arose during this period, to do the dirty work of the Colombian military, to terrorize against peasant aspirations stimulated by the UP.About 2100 to 3000 people are killed every year for political reasons in Colombia, 70 to 75 percent of them by the AUC(United Self Defense forces of Colombia), and other smaller death squads, according to human rights groups.. The author writes that in the city of Barrencabermeja dozens of union organizers have been killed, \\"disappeared\\", forced to leave the country, etc by the AUC. Women's organizations in the town have launched courageous protests against all this despite AUC threats and violence. Coca-cola has been linked to the killing of union organizers at its bottling plants in the country and BP to the killing of activists protesting its pollution of the town of El Morro.Peasants have been forced to grow cocoa and poppy to survive, because the opening up of Colombia to transnational Agribusiness, has made them unable to compete in their own market. Peasant movements have demanded to be provided with replacement crops; the government has promised but never delivered. The U.S. backed fumigation against poppy and Cocoa growing and terror by the AUC and to lesser extent the FARC have created close to three million internal refuges. The fumigation (designed by John Kerry advisor Rand Beers back in the late 90's) seems to have caused major health and environmental problems. With the peasants driven off their land, ranchers, oil companies and so on can seize the latter. He describes the AUC massacre in the \`lush\\" Naya region. In late 2000 many indigenous and Afro-Colombian leaders in the area were murdered, including three 200 meters from an army roadblock. The AUC caused a refugee flight by its demands that the people in the area leave their homes. In April 2001,a Colombian military unit appeared, demanded to know where some units of the ELN guerillas had gone and when the villagers said they didn't know, warned that their \\"cousins\\" in the AUC would soon appear. In the subsequent orgy of killing and burning, AUC leader Carlos Castano, denounced the government tally of close 50 dead as too low and claimed 100 dead in what he called a \\"glorious patriotic act against subversion.\\"The author notes the atrocities done to Indians by American oil companies. The was the extermination of the Yariguie Indians due to forced labor and disease working at an oil concession granted partly to a subsidiary of Standard oil after 1905. Then there was the robbery of most of the land and decimation of the population of the \\"Motilion savages\\" in order for Gulf Oil, owned by former U.S. treasury secretary Andy Mellon, to drill on their land in the 1930's. Today Occidental oil has been trying to drill on the lands of the U'wa.The current president, the reactionary Alvaro Uribe has made a great show of decommissioning military officers found to be associating with the AUC. But Human Rights Watch and other groups say that all this is just cosmetic. Very few AUC members have ever been prosecuted for crimes. The U.S. placed the FARC and ELN on its list of terrorist groups in 1997 and demonizes the FARC as \\"narcotraffickers.\\" In August 2001, it placed the AUC on that list. However it has continued to send the Colombian military half a billion dollars annually, claiming decreasing paramilitary-military collaboration when in fact the evidence is the exact opposite. Uribe has been waging total war against the FARC. The author writes about how the peace talks were substantially sabotaged by the unwillingness of the previous administration of Andres Pastrana to curb the paramilitaries and consider alternatives to fumigation. As peace talks opened in January 1999, the AUC killed about 150 people in a show of force. Pastrana originally presented Washington with a \\"Plan Colombia\\" that dealth with alternative crops and poverty reduction but the massa objected......The author writes that many of the AUC members currently being \\"demobilized\\" by negotiations with the government are actually filling up the ranks of Uribe's new rural \\"civilian defense\\" forces. In other words the paramilitaries are quietly being institutionalized under a different guise. . In 2002, the U.S. requested that Castano and two of his lieutenants be extradited for five counts of drug trafficking. The author suggests that Uribe may try to convince the U.S. to drop these demands \\"in the interests of peace.\\"Meanwhile, U.S. backed drug eradication has not done anything to reduce the drug trade. Poppy and Cocoa growing is merely drifting south towards Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru. The drug war is merely a cover to expand U.S. political and economic domination, indirectly supporting major drug traffickers and killers. The author shows how Uribe is really not that popular as the polls claim."},{"Title":"Colombia and the United States : War, Unrest, and Destabilization (Open Media Series)","review":"Yet another attempt to bring an easy solution to a difficult problem that has no easy solution. Nice try, and at least it is fairly even-handed."},{"Title":"Symbiosis and Ambivalence: Poles and Jews in a Small Galician Town","review":"This book covers the vicissitudes of pre-WWII Polish-Jewish relations in the town of Jaslicka, SW Poland (post-WWII boundaries), from a few centuries ago until the Holocaust. To begin with, the term \\"Polish nobility\\" spanned the magnate and the poor noble-in-name-only, and constituted the largest franchised class in Europe: 8-12% vs. 1-2% of other European states. (p. 58).Contrary to the likes of Heller's ON THE EDGE OF DESTRUCTION, the evidence doesn't support the awfulization of the Jewish experience. In fact, most of the time, Polish-Jewish relations were good. (p. xxi). Although both lived in a poor country, the Jews, on the whole, were wealthier than the Poles. (p. 64). Contrary to the common misconception about the Poles having ostracized the Jews and forced them into ghettos, it was the Jews who had, using modern parlance, self-segregated themselves. Lehmann comments: \\"We have seen that the Jews strongly marked themselves off from the Poles. The distinction between the Jews (yidn) and non-Jews (goyim) reflected the Jewish fear of Gentile intrusion, as well as Jewish disdain for the gentile world.\\" (p. 124).Negative stereotypes coexisted with positive ones, and weren't the exclusive provenance of either group. For instance, Poles had their folk tales about Jews using the blood of kidnapped Christian children, and Jews had their Hassidic teachings about such things as the Jews being God's ONLY people, and gentiles having no hearts (only an organ that resembles a heart: p. 93). Polish peasants at times thought of the exploitive usurious Jew, and at other times the benevolent usurious Jew. (pp. 71-72). However, even when Jewish usury was benign, the lot of the poverty-stricken Polish peasant could only breed resentment: \\"This (like any other) form of involuntary dependence typically gave rise to feelings of hostility and frustration.\\" (p. 84).The Endek-encouraged boycotts of Jewish shops, in favor of Polish ones, weren't practiced by most local Poles. (p. 82). This adds to similar testimonies elsewhere, and reinforces the premise that Polish anti-Semitism had been much more bark than bite.During the Holocaust, the Germans came and took away the Jews, while the Poles were forced to stay indoors. (p. 147). This adds refutation to the notion that Poles tended to stand around and mock the Jews during such events. However, Lehmann follows the guilt-by-observation thinking of Michael Steinlauf and Jan T. Gross)(pp. 183-184). By some leap of logic, the Poles are now in a sense culpable for the Holocaust merely for being AWARE of the fact of Jewish deaths.She mentions the Lemkos, some of whom considered themselves Ukrainians, and a considerable fraction of whom were pro-Nazi. (e. g., p. 141). Lehmann also characterizes the postwar killings of local Jews as the deeds of \\"local criminals, bandits, and soldiers\\". (p. 152).In common with many authors, Lehmann portrays \\"anti-Semitism without Jews\\" as something profound, and fulfilling of some deep pathology. (p. 8). How about simply reputations of peoples in general going far beyond the confines of the time and place of their domiciles? (Consider, for example, manifestations of \\"anti-Polonism without Poles\\" in such places as China)."},{"Title":"Jacqueline Kennedy.","review":"This biography tells the different parts of Jackie's life really detailed, with lots of information and for somebody who hasn't read something about Jackie before it might be difficult to over view the mass of information. Especially at the beginning it starts with a great mass of information and it is sometimes a bit exhausting. That goes along around 20 sites and then Elisabeth Veit finds a better, more lively style of writing, one can feel that she now knows how to pack the information that it sounds interesting. This book should be a book to complete your knowledge of Jackie Kennedy, you can find lots of new expressions and impressions of friends, colleagues and little amusing or shocking details that you haven't found in other biographies before. For example Elisabeth Veit writes a bit more about the time Jackie was addicted to steroids and amphetamines. Other biography authors mostly tried to hide this fact. What I also liked was that Elisabeth Veit always wrote quotes about what the magazines and newspapers worldwide wrote about Jackie and her actions.My greatest adoration is for Elisabeth Veit's loyality. Many authors of biographies try to manipulate the reader, want him to believe what he writes, want him to have the same view. Even through the facts can be right in history most of the authors interpret Jackie's actions different, but Elisabeth Veit is loyal in this point. She writes the clear facts of Jackie Kennedy's life and tries to find out more about her soul and her myth, but she has never expressed her own opinion . But you shouldn't think that the books is just a boring encyclopedia, it has to be clearly said that is a biography in Elizabeth Veit's loyal view, but it also isn't a novel, like Edward Klein's biography \\"Jack and Jackie\\" is.Elisabeth Veit also beared resemblance to other First Ladies. So a part of 16 pages is about the First Ladies before and after Jackie, there are little portraits about Eleanor Roosevelt, Mamie Eisenhower, Patricia Nixon, Nancy Reagan and Hillary Clinton.The pictures are really well opted and you can also find little portraits of her partners, her family members and children .At the end you can find a great detailed chronology.I give the book 4 stars, because it starts a bit exhausting at the beginning, a little dry spell, but after this dry spell Elisabeth Veit quickly recovers to a great style of writing. This book is a must have read for every Jackie fan."},{"Title":"I Love You Just the Same","review":"It subtly senses and addresses a child's anxiety about growing up and succeeding, much the way \\"Goodnight Moon\\" reassures a young child about going to bed in the dark.It has become my son's favorite story."},{"Title":"I Love You Just the Same","review":"This is a sweet and touching book with fabulous pictures.

If you want to read his best book under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, Why Revival Tarries, is the primer to follow in the footsteps of Ravenhill.He is a man of tremendous prayer and going publicly to proclaim Jesus. This is not a new book but has been in existence longer than I have been alive. Reading books like this should NEVER be a substitute for the Primary book: The Word of God. However, this would be a must for those wanting to get away from American religiosity and dive into a deep, pure, obedient call to Biblical Faith in Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries","review":"Great read really made a deffrence in my prayer life and my desire to serve god.

Leonard wants everyone to know why they should be more intent in maturing in their faith. Great book and a great Christian writer."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries","review":"I think every Christian should read this book earnestly and follow and do it. I also think that not every Christian will be able to. Jesus says that only those the Father draws can come to and believe in Jesus. There are many &#34;Christians&#34; out there who have no idea who God is, and they will not believe nor understand the Scriptures, and this book.But to those that do, listen to this book and REPENT! And REND your hearts!"},{"Title":"Why revival tarries","review":"This book should come with a warning label on it saying: \\"If you want to destroy your life go ahead and read this book!\\" This book absolutely destroyed me in every way possible. I remember recieving this book from a friend in Philly and was in a bad season in my life and also remembering being scared to read the book. No wait I wasn't scared to read it I was absolutely terrified, and my pre-concieved notions were correct. Once I picked up that book I was as good as dead. I began to weep and groan for weeks and weeks. The burning words in those pages completely consumed me and scathed me. I was skinned and hung up for death. Everything in my life was burnt up and left in an ash heap before my feet, so that I had to turn to God and say what now? He replied and said do what I have always wanted you to do, die! Everything changed for me, prayer life, ministry, preaching, relationships, church, conduct, and everything else. I walked away broken, battered, and bruised from this book and have never been the same. So with that read this book unless you want to live in your 'normal' Christian life, but if you have enough guts to actually do what the bible says, let Ravenhill expose your fakeness and start all over again from step one!"},{"Title":"Why revival tarries","review":"Leonard Ravenhill was a man of passion. His books represent just a taste of that passion. No other book in the 20th century so captured the heart of a man like this book. Brother Leonard longed for revival. He believed that the Church was playing games with a holy God and that the need of the hour was for genuine revival praying.This book is not a how to of prayer. It is much more. It is a call to prayer. It is a much needed rebuke of our spiritual laziness and apathy (Amos 4:1). We need men and women of faith to rise up and pray with all their might (1 Samuel 12:23; 1 Thess. 5:17). The sad reality is that the early Church was birthed in prayer (Acts 1:14) but today's church knows nothing of prayer. The prayer meeting, writes Ravenhill, is the Cinderella of the Church.Let this book go through you and may God use it to spark a hunger for Spirit-filled praying (Eph. 6:18; Jude 20)."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries","review":"This book was written in 1959, and 45 years later, what Ravenhill writes is still applicable today! This book is a prophetic call to the Church to wake up and be the Church of God. I picked up this book as it was highly recommended in another book that impacted me (Growing Deep in God by Edmund Chan), and I have found it deeply ministering.Ravenhill writes with many one liners that cuts to the chase in the heart of the matter that he is communicating. Phrases like \\"No man is greater than his prayer life. The pastor who is not praying is playing; the people who are not praying are straying\\", \\"Many pray, but few have faith\\", \\"God does not want partnership with us, but ownership of us\\", and \\"Our eyes are dry because our hearts are dry\\" are just some of these phrases that speak mountains of the situation in the Church today.I do not agree with everything Ravenhill writes about, but I read beyond the words and understand his heart from which he writes this book. Ravenhill's desire for God comes across strongly, and anything that is apart from God or does not seem to fit into his godly values would seem as \\"sin\\" and hence to be dealt with. Hence, I recommend this book to your reading (and read beyond the words to catch the fire that burns in Ravenhill's heart), and also Edmund Chan's Growing Deep in God. I find that as I read these 2 books, it is like God doing an open heart surgery on me, revealing the true nature of my heart so that I can repent and have God place a new heart in me (Ezekiel 36:26)."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries","review":"My prayer life slowly dwindling into obscurity, regulated to 5 minute sessions here and there, I knew I had to do something to revive my prayer life. I searched various authors and decided to give this one a chance. Thank you God! Within 15 mintues, I was on my knees pleading with God to forgive me for my self-centeredness, my wife wondering what was wrong with me. If it doesn't do the same for you, you are either an Elijah in prayer or your heart is calloused. Either way, you still need to be pray. Very brief yet potent!

Awesome book, get it, read it, live it!"},{"Title":"Why revival tarries","review":"\\"Why Revival Tarries\\" is truly one book you won't want to put down. With a sort of prophetic voice from the grave, Ravenhill's plead for prayer is just as applicable today as it was when in was published in the 1950's. To call it timeless, would be an understatement. It's the perfect gift for all those searching for personal and/or church-wide revival - and is nothing less than breathtaking."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries","review":"Leonard Ravenhill stikes me as a man of integrity by listening to his audios, but just as Paul mentions in 2 Corinthians that he lacks power in his voice but his written word speaks for itself, Ravenhill draws the power of the Holy Spirit onto paper as best a man can do.

And as the man is, so are his writings. If you can read this book and not be driven to your knees, even as you rend your clothing, then buddy you're dead already!A condensation of &quot;Why Revival Tarries&quot; into a few words would yield the truth that it's Man's fault alone. You see, God wants to pour out revival, to set all of us ablaze with the fire of His Spirit, but we are so oblivious to the truth that our hearts are totally turned away from Him that we cannot begin to acquire what He is so richly wanting to shower us with.It starts with repentence - and not your mamby-pamby, watered-down 21st century style repentence, but the kind that tears a man or woman down to the soul, only to allow God to rebuild and reshape. Ravenhill argues that this is not something that happens overnight. If the Church wants revival, it's going to come with a cost. He proceeds to layout a compelling vision of that cost and the crucibles needed to hold what God will pour out.No Christian library is complete without the works of Leonard Ravenhill, and the best place to start is with &quot;Why Revival Tarries&quot;.

Of course it needs to be balanced with other books, (namely books on grace).This is meant to start a fire in you, not to give some theology on how to pray.

I challenged myself to see God through Leonard's eyes. If you take the time and pick it back up you will see that Leonard's sword cuts both ways and spares no Christian Denomination.His call is for all to account for their time spent here on earth and how Prayer focuses us in that pursuit.Because Revival starts with you and I, my prayer it that we can see through the growing pains and only focus on the God who made us all.

This is not a lightweight book, but one where Ravenhill gets to the core of people and the church. Why Revival Tarries? carries a lot of passion and practically demands that the church of Jesus Christ wakes up to the reality that there is a disconnect from the early church. Sometimes Ravenhill can be a bit radical, but that's what set him apart from other preachers of his time (as well as today). He was unashamed to call it like it was and he was not ashamed of the truth. This book is no different.

We both have the books well underlined in several places and I have purchased the book since then for several people. A few years before we read these two books, I was listening to a Christian radio station on my way to a friends house. The preacher I heard on the radio was so powerful, that I literally had to pull over to the side of the road. The preacher was Leonard Ravenhill. He was preaching on America and television, etc. and he was so right about what he said about Christianity today. I beleive this is a life changing book and should be read by every Christan.

I actually thought that was a book by Charles G. Finney, and that the Holy Spirit was prompting me to order it. I was surprised, and yet not surprised when I saw that Leonard Ravenhill was the author. Approximately twenty years prior I had received some material from Last Days Ministries in East Texas (The ministry Keith Green started); and it was from them that I first heard the name Leonard Ravenhill.Sadly, it wasn't until 2008 that I actually ordered the book from Amazon and read it.I inhaled it! It was a breath of fresh, holy air.I consider it a modern day classic.Somewhere along the way, I discovered that the books available in our modern day christian bookstores are not necessarily acollection of \\"The Greatest Hits\\" of all time. Just as you have to dig for precious metals and jewels, you have to dig for truth and the anointing. It doesn't just fall on you like rain from the clouds. Though very thankful for the lighthouses christian bookstores are in a dark world, sometimes you have to hunt for hidden treasures that are no longer seen on the shelves.I began watching video segments of Ravenhill on youtube and ordered the interview of him that was taped shortly before his death. Since then I've been hoping that a biography would turn up, and now it finally has. \\"In Light of Eternity\\", the life of Leonard Ravenhill is a book that you might like to get. It's on my list of books to acquire.In the meantime, \\"Why Revival Tarries\\" is the definitive book that expresses the ministry of Leonard Ravenhill. Please get it, and get ON FIRE FOR GOD!"},{"Title":"Why revival tarries","review":"Fifty years ago Leonard Ravenhill wrote Why Revival Tarries. It is now a modern classic. It has sold over half a million copies, and is translated into numerous languages. It is still widely available today.This book is a devotional classic because its author is one who was more concerned about the verdict of the Almighty than his own reputation; more interested in holiness than happiness; and more interested in the glory and honour of God than the praise and applause of men.It is actually composed of various articles he had written earlier, but because it flows from a heart on fire for God, and a life dedicated to holiness and sanctification, the words contain fire and power. No one who is sick of the ordinary and is desirous only of God and his best will be untouched by this powerful book.How can one adequately review a book such as this? Every page has memorable ideas and burning words. Perhaps the best way to present this book to others is simply to feature many of its valuable quotes.Ravenhill argues that we do not have revival for the simple reason that we really don't want revival. We are simply too contented, to smug, too self-satisfied, and too carnal. Our hearts are not broken and we do not earnestly long for a powerful move of God.\\"Revival comes as a result of a cleansed section of the Church, bent and bowed in supplication and intercession,\\" says Ravenhill. \\"The price of revival,\\" he says, \\"is travail.\\" But where is the prayer, the brokenness, the seeking after God?As he says elsewhere, \\"\\"The only reason we don't have revival is because we are willing to live without it!\\" That is our problem. We have become too comfortable, too lazy, too apathetic and too indifferent. In other words, we are neither hot nor cold, but, like the Laodicean church, are simply lukewarm, and we deserve to be spewed out of the Lord's mouth.Prayer is the key to revival, and Ravenhill speaks as much to our prayerlessness as anything else. Unless we get serious about prayer, and forget our trivial pursuits and worldly amusements, we simply will not see revival break forth.Prayer is the key says Ravenhill: \\"No man is greater than his prayer life.\\" Our greatness for the Kingdom will be directly proportional to our greatness in prayer. \\"To be much for God, we must be much with God.\\" The praying man is unstoppable: \\"He who fears God fears no man. He who kneels before God will stand in any situation.\\"Ravenhill reminds us that \\"As the Church goes, so goes the world.\\" The world is in a mess because the church is in a mess. And the church is in a mess because so many of its leaders and preachers are in a mess: \\"The tragedy of this late hour is that we have too many dead men in the pulpits giving out too many dead sermons to too many dead people.\\"If our churches are not full of dead men and women, they certainly seem to be full of sleeping men and women. \\"In the church pillars have given place to pillows.\\" How can God move in such a situation? How can God work when the material in his hands is hard, unwieldy and crumbling?Until we start to see our spiritual need, and start to cry out to God, revival will elude us. \\"If the Church today had as many agonizers as she has advisors, we would have a revival in a year.\\" Where are the men and women of God who travail and agonize over the woeful situation we find ourselves in?Until we are broken and repentant, we will see no fresh move of God's Spirit. \\"The church must first repent; then the world will break! The church must first weep; then our altars will be filled with weeping penitents.\\" Ravenhill goes so far as to suggest, \\"This generation of preachers is responsible for this generation of sinners.\\"Strong words, but true. Our problem is ourselves and our spiritual leaders. We need to break up the fallow ground and seek for the new rains. We simply cannot keep blaming the world for all our troubles. In many ways we have only ourselves to blame:\\"I do not marvel so much at the patience of the Lord with the stonyhearted sinners of the day. After all, would we not be patient with a man both blind and deaf? And such are the sinners. But I do marvel at the Lord's patience with the sleepy, sluggish, selfish Church! A prodigal Church in a prodigal world, is God's real problem.\\"He reminds us of 1 Peter 4:17: \\"Judgement must first begin in the house of God.\\" This is where we must begin. It is long overdue. If we do not act, and act soon, then the chances of revival - at least in the West - look very slim indeed.This book is spiritual dynamite. Those who already have it should pull it off the shelves and reread it. Those who do not yet have it need to go out and get it. The revival we all so desperately need basically tarries because of us - because of our coldness and hardness. This book will go a long way in helping to melt the ice and soften our hardened hearts."},{"Title":"Why revival tarries","review":"Ravenhill says it like it is, and will bring you to your knees if you have any reverence to the Lord.

His comrades continually tell him that he is born under a lucky star and it certainly seems so, with the meat grinders that his infantry unit seems to go through, one after the other, and his good luck at surviving.You'll like this book if you want to get a flavor of what a Soviet front line soldier goes through and understand the experiential nature of the fighting.You won't like this book if you are looking for detailed descriptions of combat, including numbers, dates, maps, etc. Mansur Abdulin writes this book many years after the war (50 or 60 years if I recall correctly) and the sequence of events sometimes follows a stream of conscious rambling (near the end of the book in particular). He recalls some details that are clearly inaccurate but that's not the point of this book.I was glad I read the book since it is rare to get a Soviet soldiers perspective from the front line; I haven't seen too many available. I wouldn't put this on par with some of the other classic autobiographies from WWII, but rather it's a good book and a quick read."},{"Title":"Red Road from Stalingrad: Recollections of a Soviet Infantryman","review":"Just started reading and its everything I was hoping this book would be engrossing- captivating cant put it down for a second."},{"Title":"Red Road from Stalingrad: Recollections of a Soviet Infantryman","review":"This book isn't written very coherently, but I suspect that much of that can be ascribed to the translation.

The author, Mandur Abdulin, was a Siberian miner who began fighting in 1942 as a Mortarmen in the Infantry.The book is written in such a way that the reader is sitting in the room with the author, listening to his recollections of these experiences. The author has a very vivid memory for events, comrades, places, battles, and other details. He describes in a very engaging and vivid way the struggles of fighting in Stalingrad, Kursk, Prokhorovka, Dnieppe, and the Ukraine, among other places. The reader has the chance to experience the intense pride the Soviet Soldiers fought with, in spite of the common knowledge that most of them would never return home.Also discussed are the other challenges of war, comrades lost, lack of food, sanitary conditions, weather challenges, the enemies they fought, and the soldiers with whom the author fought side by side, including the challenges of military comrades and Communist Party members, many of whom were less than ideal people.I found this book to be an engaging read, fascinating in it's scope and detail. I also enjoyed the personality of the author and the forthright nature of his writing style. I came away from this read with a feeling that the author was brutally honest, and very proud of his service in World War II.As a scale modeler, I would have liked to have had a little more inside information on weapons, vehicles, etc., but this text has been written for a different purpose, the recording of a single soldiers' experiences.This book is highly recommended for students of The Great Patriotic War, especially those looking for the Soviet perspective. At only $16.95, it is also a great value.I would like to thank Stackpole Books for the review copy of this book."},{"Title":"Red Road from Stalingrad: Recollections of a Soviet Infantryman","review":"This one was a great find. I've read several Soviet soldier's memoirs and most of them are painfully lacking in details or they're overblown with impossible heroics - or they're just downright boring. This book is a gem and it belongs on the shelf of every Eastern Front history buff. Yes, there are some translation goofs and problems throughout the book, but, all of them are easily understood as such and they do not detract from the very detailed account of this man's years on the front and his remarkable ability to stay alive when most around him did not. I highly recommend this one to anyone who's interested in studying the day-to-day life of an admitted Communist party member soldier who genuinely believed he was fighting to save the world for Comrade Stalin. This is a superb book and it will become a classic in the annals of military autobiographies."},{"Title":"Red Road from Stalingrad: Recollections of a Soviet Infantryman","review":"Considering the titanic struggle between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union generated some of the most tragic superlatives in human history (bloodiest battles, longest siege, greatest tank battle, etc.), it still doesn't get the attention it rightfully deserves in Western culture. While historians from Europe and North America thankfully produce a continuous flow of literature that analyze the myriad of components that comprise such an enormous and complex event, there seems to be a void when it comes to personal accounts of the conflict from the Red Army perspective. In my opinion, there are surprisingly few personal narratives from the Soviet point-of-view that captivate the desperation, death, hatred, brutality and enormous destruction that defined Eastern Front combat and \\"Red Road from Stalingrad\\" is one of those few. Mansur Abdulin's memoir as a junior officer in an elite Guards unit serves as a great example of the nightmare the average Red Army soldier must have experienced while serving on the front line amid the fury of Eastern Front combat.One way to describe Mansur Abdulin is that he could likely be Soviet Union's version of GI Joe ... an ordinary man assigned to achieve an extraordinary task. Coming from the mines of Eastern Russia, Mansur was well-equipped mentally and physically to handle the strain of front-line duty in some of the most pivotal battles of World War II: Stalingrad and Kursk. Abdulin's account of his service, while gripping and vivid, is humbly written. His story provides rare insight as to what a surviving Red Army soldier experienced in fighting battles that are typically defined as bloodbaths.There are several attributes to Abdulin's book that I found appealing. First, the book is engaging and easy to follow. Many first-hand accounts told by Soviet veterans, in my opinion, are not enjoyable to read because they are written in such a straight-forward manner and are void of any emotive quality. Running through a hail of bullets appears no more exciting that sitting in a foxhole smoking a cigarette; it was just something that happened and we're being told about it. Abdulin, on the other hand, articulates his experience quite well and makes it easy for the reader to empathize with his moments of fear, frustration, anger and elation. Rather than dutifully telling us where he was and what he did, we go there with him ... we see the mangled corpses and feel the concussion of an artillery barrage; we are blinded by the smoke and taste the powdery dry dirt and grass in our mouths. The descriptive quality of the author's writing is simply captivating. Second, his story comes across as sincere and modest. Mansur Abdulin tells us about what he sees and experiences but does not portray himself as heroic (regardless of the medals he was awarded). Third, his experiences are enthralling:- Getting caught disobeying Stalin Order 227 (No retreat!) and not getting shot solely because the Captain he faced was Estonian.- Several accounts of luck saving him from certain death ... including an informal gathering of Stalingrad survivors that was interrupted by a random artillery round ... killing everyone but Abdulin.- The descriptive combat recollections of the Battle of Kursk from an infantryman's point-of-view.- The numerous towns and villages he liberated during the Red Army advance. Seeing first-hand the brutal impact of the Nazis (who poisoned the wells and razed the buildings in their retreat).- Possibly shooting down a German plane with small arms.- Getting caught in a cross fire, playing dead and making a run for safety\\"Red Road from Stalingrad\\" is the best first-hand account I've read from a Red Army soldier so far. As I continue my search to find more combat narratives from the Soviet perspective, Mansur Abdulin's book will serve as a benchmark."},{"Title":"Red Road from Stalingrad: Recollections of a Soviet Infantryman","review":"Great insight into the life of an ordinary soldier in the Red Army during The Great Patriotic War as experienced by a Tartar muslim from Tomsk region in Siberia. He fought at Stalingrad during the Encirclement and again during Kursk and then on the Dnieper River Front.

I don't ususally post reviews, but, I have to say that this book is one of the best books I've read about the war. As much as I like reading about battles, tactics, weapons, etc, this book is filled with that and so much more. The compassion of the author for his fellow soldiers is something that is missing from many memoirs, but it isn't only compassion, more so his actions and witness accounts of what happens in the midst of battles. Although it is fair to say that many memoirs talk about the above mentioned topics from one degree to another, this book does something more which I doubt anyone can describe well enough with words. It will stay with me for a long time as being one of the best memoirs of the war."},{"Title":"Red Road from Stalingrad: Recollections of a Soviet Infantryman","review":"A series of new World War II memoirs by soldiers of the Red Army provide fresh and valuable insights into the Soviet armed forces of the Great Patriotic War. Readers will find Mansur Abdulin's \\"Red Road From Stalingrad\\" among the best written, compelling and moving works recently published.Abdulin reminds us that Ivan, the Red Army soldier, was a living, breathing being, who cherished life as much as his counterparts in the West and who was willing to defend his family and his homeland fanatically and lay down his life dearly for all that he loved. This stands in stark contract to the myth of the Soviet soldier - savage, unfeeling, and following orders unquestioningly - embedded in the military culture of the West by the officers of the defeated Wehrmacht seeking to exploit the growing rift between the West and the Soviet Union after the war.In the first months of his invasion of the Soviet Union, Hitler's Wehrmacht inflicted catastrophic losses on Stalin's Red Army, causing many to wonder how it was Russia managed to survive. By December 1941, or only six months after the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the Red Army had lost 177 divisions, comprising some five million men, including almost three and a half million, which had been captured by the Germans. Gone too were tens of thousands of combat aircraft, tanks and artillery pieces. Abdulin's book makes it clear that by 1942 Russia's strategic situation was already stabilizing, although much hard fighting and further defeats lay ahead. Still, in 1942 and 1943 Soviet Russia and the Red Army were fighting to survive a Wehrmacht bent on nothing less than the complete annihilation and enslavement of the Jews and Slavs and winning Lebensraum [living space] for Hitler's Third Reich. Liberation of the wide expanses of the Soviet Union captured by the Germans seemed a distant hope in 1942. It was only through the heroic efforts of tens of millions of Red Army soldiers like Mansur Abdulin that Hitler and the Wehrmacht found only defeat in Russia.Born a Tartar in central Siberia in 1925, at a time when the newborn Soviet state was suffering from prolonged famine and disease, Abdulin experienced a hard childhood. \\"My mother would sometimes get hysterical from constant starvation and despair, screaming madly,\\" he remembers. Abdulin went to work at a young age as a miner alongside his father. In June 1942 he volunteered to fight for the Red Army. After completing his course at the Tashkent Infantry School, he fought as mortar man on the Stalingrad Front during the Soviet counter-offensive, which crushed Field Marshal Paulus' Sixth German Army in the city between November 1942 and January 1943, killing and capturing hundreds of thousands of German and Romanian soldiers. Later, in July 1943, Abdulin took part in the battle of Kursk, where the Red Army held its ground against an unprecedented German onslaught led by Hitler's most elite divisions and supported by hundreds of new Tiger and Panther tanks. The Wehrmacht and the German panzer force were gutted during the battle and the Red Army followed up with a stinging counteroffensive, which hurled the Germans back across the Steppes all the way to the banks of the Dnieper River. It was there that Abudlin was seriously wounded.Throughout his book Abdulin describes the small delights as well as the agonies of being a soldier in the Red Army during the war. \\"It was a great joy for us to receive a letter, a note, or a parcel from home,\\" he writes. \\"Also, in each box containing shells, bombs or cartridges, we found pleasant surprises: a piece of paper bearing the address of an unknown girl, so that we could write her, or tobacco pouches filled with makhorka [strong Russian tobacco].\\" These small joys, however, were overshadowed by the death of friends and family, which dogged every Red Army soldier with each step westward. \\"I cried, like women cry, beside the dead boy of their beloved,\\" admits Abdulin, poetically, as only a Russian can, on the death of a close friend in January 1943. \\"I howled, like little children howl, when they are greatly and unfairly offended by someone.\\" The author also details the atrocities uncovered by Red Army soldiers as they advanced westward, liberating Russian villages and towns. \\"We entered a concentration camp for Soviet prisoners. Some of the men were on the verge of death; they were speedily evacuated to hospital,\\" he remembers. \\"Several thousand corpses were stacked in an open field. One horror followed another. How can I survive this nightmare? If a bullet doesn't find me, surely I'll lose my mind...\\" Indeed. In all, more than three million of the almost five million Soviet prisoners held by the Wehrmacht died in such camps during the course of the war. Such atrocities fed Ivan's hatred for the Germans, prompting the Soviet solder to attack even more attack fanatically and defend even more tenaciously than before. More ominously, such massacres also fed Ivan's thirst for revenge. The author admits that at one point he ordered the execution of more than two hundred German prisoners held by his unit. \\"By nature I am a tender and sensitive person,\\" writes the author. \\"I was never a hooligan or a brawler. But when I went to war I wanted to destroy the Fritzes; \`Kill or be killed.' This was my message to the newcomers. I was consumed by the idea that while alive, I would have my revenge on the Germans in advance: for I never expected to survive that slaughter.\\"In January 1943, Abdulin's 293rd Rifle Division was redesignated the 66th Guards Rifle Division for its role in the battle of Stalingrad. \\"Fighting for our Soviet Motherland against the German invaders, the 293rd Rifle Division proved to be a model of bravery, courage, discipline and order,\\" noted the order signed by Joseph Stalin, designating the unit an elite formation. \\"Engaged in continuous combat...the division inflicted heavy casualties on the Fascist forces and with its shattering blows destroyed enemy manpower and equipment, mercilessly crushing the German invaders.\\" Abdulin was one of the fortunate few to have survived the war. Having done his part to defeat Hitler's armies, he returned to his work as a miner. He lives in retirement near Orenburg in the Urals, one of Russia's Greatest Generation."},{"Title":"Red Road from Stalingrad: Recollections of a Soviet Infantryman","review":"From the battles of Stalingrad and Kursk, to the banks of the Dnieper River, This Memoir presents the author's experiences and observations as a 19-year-old frontline infantryman in the Soviet Red Army. The hatred and violence that had erupted on the Eastern Front was generated largely by Hitler's declared intention of annihilating the Soviet Union. Aware of the odds against survival, Abdulin's main goal was to kill as many enemy soldiers as possible. This saga commences with his first shot on the Don Front in November, 1942.As the Soviet infantry advanced toward Stalingrad, trained dogs carrying 18 lb explosive charges were sent out to destroy enemy tanks. In the heat of battle, a wounded comrade was seen to cut off his dangling leg. Another, with both arms blown off, yelled for a smoke. But Stalin's Order 227 - No Retreat - created a firm bond between the comrades who knew that the alternative was death. In the trenches, living conditions were deplorable. At minus 40 degrees, many soldiers suffocated from toxic fumes in the shell craters where they slept. Snow-covered manure pits were warmer and safer. Hunger, cold, constant lack of sleep, and continuous hard work took their toll. Worse by far were the infestations of lice, which were regarded as enemy No. 1; the Germans were enemy No. 2.Having no food for 10 days turned the comrades into walking skeletons. They lived on boiled horse fodder that often gave them intense pain while defecating. For good luck, each comrade carried a mascot, and loss of the mascot was seen as an omen of death. Soldiers who stole watches from dead Germans seemed to get killed in battle. Cowards also seemed to perish. On the outskirts of Stalingrad, thousands of wounded Germans were frozen to death on an abandoned runway, and the corpses of Soviet prisoners were stacked in the fields. The German Army capitulation at Stalingrad brought only temporary relief to the comrades. Their louse-infested uniforms were replaced.Cited by Stalin for exceptional bravery in combat, Abdulin's regiment was rewarded with promotion to the elite 'Guards' rank of the Soviet armed forces. They moved on to the Voronezh Front and the battle of Kursk. Starting at Pokhorovka in July, they were engaged constantly against elite Nazi Divisions. Soviet manpower losses were very heavy. The reinforcements were deeply shocked to see the countless burned out tanks and decomposing bodies on the battlefield. In numerous villages, the streets were like trenches turned into communal graves. When a distillery was captured in a village on the front, half a battalion got themselves dead drunk. As the drunken soldiers collapsed on the ground, they were incinerated by Nazi flame throwers. Abdulin expresses dismay and sorrow at this senseless loss of life.The Germans completely scorched the earth as they retreated. Foodstuffs were destroyed; entire villages were razed to the ground. Everywhere, women, children, and old people lay massacred in the streets. The war devoured people mercilessly. Abdulin sobbed violently with anger and rage, and promised to avenge the massacred people at the first possible instant. The fighting became more desperate and more intense as the soldiers sacrificed themselves for the Motherland.Reinforcements arrived every night, but the following day every unit was again undermanned. By November 1943, a bridgehead had been established across the Dnieper River in order to continue the Ukrainian offensive. It was there that Abdulin fired his last shot. He was seriously wounded, and evacuated to hospital. During his recovery, a close comrade regretted there wasn't a writer to describe what really happened. Abdulin's Memoir tells the story here. It is the priceless testimony of a simple soldier who faced death almost every day of his frontline existence, and who survived the pivotal battles of WWII on the Eastern Front. With 165 text pages, 5 sketch maps, 33 photographic illustrations, and 3 appendixes, this work is an excellent read - informative, compassionate, essentially personal, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Red Road from Stalingrad: Recollections of a Soviet Infantryman","review":"This is an excellent account of the war as seen by a mortarman attached to a Soviet infantry division. It is very moving to read of the hardships Abdulin and his comrades experienced in this most brutal of wars. I was particularly struck by one story, in which the author and his friends feel overjoyed to immerse themselves in human excrement in an old latrine that had been forgotten and covered by snow. Compared to the -50 degree temperatures they had experienced, the feces were like a warm blanket. This really brings home just how unfathomably horrible the Eastern Front could be. Abdulin also gives us a view of the take-no-prisoners mindset that characterized both sides on the Eastern Front. He boasts of an incident where he and his men shoot several wounded Germans after overrunning their positions. As anyone who has studied the Eastern Front knows, this was an unfortunate, but common, practice on both sides. It makes the reader hope quite fervently that war will never reach this level of cruelty again. It should also be remembered that it already has, many times even if on a smaller scale, since the last shot rang out in Berlin."},{"Title":"Red Road from Stalingrad: Recollections of a Soviet Infantryman","review":"Overall this is a pretty good book. It shows the very hard life of a Soviet soldier in WWII. One does, however, have reason to question the accuracy of the author's memory. For example, he tells us that just prior to the battle of Kursk he and other veterans told inexperienced soldiers about the strengths and weakness of various German tanks, including the Ferdinand. Since that particular tank made its debut at Kursk, his claim is hard to believe."},{"Title":"Red Road from Stalingrad: Recollections of a Soviet Infantryman","review":"This is a first hand account by a private in the Red Army fighting near Stalingrad, through Kursk and the Ukraine. Mansur is born in 1923, the son of a Communist Party Member who is a technician at a mine; later on Mansur works at the mine also. When the Nazis attack in June 1941, he and three friends who are all exempt from military service as miners, eventually manage to enlist. At school he is selected to stay on as a Lieutenant and instructor but he does not want that. Given an opportunity, he is sent to the front as a private where he is assigned to an 82MM Mortar section. Being a member of the Young Communist League, he is given the duty of keeping records of other party members in his company. His unit is sent to help circle the Germans at Stalingrad and he ends up fighting in the city. After that battle his unit ends up at Kursk. He becomes a Komsorg, basically the senior NCO of the Battalion, whose duty is to be the first man to lead the attack, a position that has a life expectancy of less than 2 weeks. Seriously wounded in November, 1943 he spends the rest of the war in hospital and recovery then ends up back at a mine.This book reminded me of Guy Sajer's The Forgotten Soldier, or With the Old Breed. Mansur has written what he remembers and historians can quibble with some of it, but it is a pleasure to read because it is such a rarity for a Russian Private to have written about his experiences. I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars because of the lack of detailed maps showing where he fought. As a combat vet I was able to identify with his thoughts and experiences in battle. A worthy read in my opinion."},{"Title":"Red Road from Stalingrad: Recollections of a Soviet Infantryman","review":"The author states his personal memories of fighting in World War 2 as a Soviet Infantryman, having first fired his weapon in combat on 6 November 1942, and last shot on 28 November 1943. Due to the need of raw materials, the author was exempt from conscription (draft) in being a skilled Siberian miner. He still volunteered and eventually was allowed to enter the Soviet Army at 18 years old and became a mortar man. After his critical wound, he eventually recovered and returned to the mines.The book provides viewpoints from the first person perspective with some additional historical background added in to provide insight into the bigger picture of how he and his unit fit into the battle. His unit took part of the winter offensive that surrounded Stalingrad and later counterattacked north of Kursk in the summer offensive.The book provides a unique insight into the Soviet military, how their battalion level supply system worked in providing food and ammunition to the front line companies. Also presented is how their awards were presented, \\"donations\\" to the state were collected and not sent in, replacements assigned to the platoons, and what life was as a front line soldier.Other books such as Infantry Aces and Panzer Aces provide company level viewpoints from the German perspective. These books described the amazement on how the Soviets would attack in mass waves, wondering how the Soviets could repeatedly do so.The author describes entering villages that were destroyed by the retreating Nazis, who executed the old and young indiscriminately. This evil senseless killing angered the Soviets into pushing harder and willing to sacrifice themselves to avenge the innocent civilians massacred.Mansur also explains the Soviet view and the very high attrition rate and low life expectancy was for veterans selected to be leading the attack, like himself. A sobering point of his book was the loss of one of his comrades, injured in the leg and dropped off at a medical \\"loading point\\". After the battle ended, he returned to the loading point, only to find all 200 soldiers still there, left to die in the freezing cold, the limitations of the Soviet medical and transport system while closing the gap around Stalingrad.The appendices provide excellent background information that explains his unit's evolution from a standard 293rd Rifle Division into the elite 66th Guards Rifle Division. Also provided are key dates in WW2 and background info on the areas the author fought in.Yes, a historian will quibble about inaccuracies or slight exaggerations of numbers found in the book. But it is based on memory, not a research paper that references \\"official\\" documents. There will always be differences as exact numbers are often forgotten, but the brutal events are not. Official documents are often \\"sanitized\\" with true losses downplayed for propaganda reasons, in all countries. Example would be the US Army reporting only combat losses and not including injuries or illnesses as described in the US 29th Infantry Division's experiences in Beyond the Beachhead by Balkowski or the Soviet Army in Afghanistan in the 1980's.Overall, the book is an excellent, quick, and easy read, less than 200 pages, including the index. There are some good photos from the Soviet perspective too. Always enjoyable to learn what the \\"other side's\\" experience was like."},{"Title":"Red Road from Stalingrad: Recollections of a Soviet Infantryman","review":"There aren't many books by soldiers who served in the Russian Army against the Germans in World War II, so that makes this one pretty special. The author participated in the encirclement of the German Sixth Army at Stalingrad, the savage fighting at Kursk, and the nightmarish crossing of the Dnieper River.

He talks about ordinary life during the famine of the 1930's, Order 224 not a step back order, and the use of blocking detachments and penal companies.

It explains how we need to teach the whole child according to the child's individual God-given gifts. True wisdom progresses beyond intellectual pursuit; it is practical.The goals outlined in this book will help you prepare, teach, and evaluate your children from a Biblical world view. It will also advise you in helping them become self-motivated, lifelong learners.This book has four intriguing sections:The first section explains how we have been conditioned to believe the state is competent to access our children's intelligence! You'll learn how different a Christian world view is and how to RENEW your mind to get rid of this \\"public education mentality.\\" It includes a look at the Greek history of state education compared to history of Biblical education. The Hebrews focused on the home. Worship, family and academics were taught in the home, not separated subjects in individual locations. The home was more important then the synagogue. The center of all life-- religious, education, and training--was the home.The second section explains what achievement tests are, test terms, test scores, testing limitations, avoiding testing anxiety, possible benefits from testing, states that require testing, alternative methods of evaluation, and much more.Section III explains a new teaching approach (based on a combination of several effective approaches including Charlotte Mason, chronological history, Ruth Beechick, etc.) called The Heart of Wisdom.The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach is centered around reading the Bible through in one year and the creation of a Bible portfolio. The Bible is the main focus and the core of the curriculum, with the secondary focus dedicated developing writing skills using the \\"writing to learn\\" method. The H.O.W. approach leads progressively to a renewed mind and to a self-chosen commitment to a life of intellectual and moral integrity. You can use this approach as explained, or adapt it to the methods and curriculum you are using. (Explained in detail on the Heart of Wisdom web site).Section IV includes check lists are divided according to grade level K-8: Math, Science, Language Arts, and Social Science. Studies show \\"Evaluation Check Lists\\" are far superior to Achievement Tests. You can evaluate and make notes for up to five children with these lists.Bible Reading checklist and a Character Traits list are also included as well as extensive glossaries and reproducible forms.I agree with those that recommended this book- it has changed my view of education drastically!"},{"Title":"What Your Child Needs to Know When: According to the Bible, According to the State: with Evaluation Check Lists for Grades K-8","review":"I purchased this book after discovering another book by the same author, titled: &quot;A Family Guide to the Biblical Holidays.&quot; This book was such an inspiration to me and helped me to re-evaluate my curriculum choices.

HOWEVER, I got much more. I came away in awe! I learned how badly I needed to renew my mind regarding education. Mrs. Sampson explains in easy to understand language how many homeschoolers begin on the right path-wanting to teach their children how to be godly- but leave this path due to fear.This book begins with an explaination of our assumptions about education (with a great parable) and then gives examples and suggestions on how to put education in the right perspective by teaching our children what TRUE wisdom is. Mrs. Sampson gives excellent teaching ideas to make the Bible the focus of your school day. The last part of the book is full of the checklist by grade level (for up to five children).Reading this book motivated me to get back on the right path and back on my knees making God the Lord of my homeschool NOT the state.Two chapters of this book describe Mrs. Sampson's unique approach she calls \\"The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach.\\" It's a great combination of many poplar practical approaches including Ruth Beechick, Charlotte Mason philosophy, and Bible methods. I also found more details in several free download files on the Heart of Wisdom site.I have used this book over and over and have even bough copies for friends (I won't give mine up!).

The \\"what your child needs to know in..\\" series will also help.What sets this one aside is it also covers character education and has check lists for what you might need to teach your child at different ages in character education and Biblical education.One of the things that I liked is that there was a place to write each child's name and youc an easily track what your children know at each level up to three children. Another thing I liked was that the checklists seperated out by grade were also seperated out by Character/Biblical Principals vs. State expected checklists.

The author is too non-critical and assumes the kind of detailed knowledge of the then-recent past that any educated adult would have had in the 50's, but which is long-gone now. Still, a fascinating study of economics, anti-semitism, and the condition of the South."},{"Title":"Mr. Baruch","review":"I enjoyed this book very much, as it is about a member of my family."},{"Title":"The New World of the Gothic Fox: Culture and Economy in English and Spanish America","review":"This novel take on the comparative economic fortunes of the north and south should encourage other scholars to focus on questions of economic culture.

It was written more than ten years ago by a Latin who is obviously an Anglophile. He goes to the origins of English and Spanish character traits, the origins of Latin American dislike of things U.S. and makes a very compelling case that those countries of Spanish origins, due to their heritage, have and will have a very hard time developing in our changing world. It is not politically correct but it is real. A must read for those trying to understand why everything south of the Rio Grande is so terrible.For those interested, read Carlos Alberto Montaner and Octavio Paz, one Cuban the other Mexican (1990 Nobel Prize winner for literature, actually poetry) for similar views from authors who are not enamored of the Anglo-American world."},{"Title":"Catseye (The Gregg Press science fiction series)","review":"I ordered a very old (over 50 years) out of print book from this seller, and it arrived with a minor problem.

However, I want to point out that Catseye was published for the Young Adult market and so can be read by both children, young adults and adults. I originally read this novel as a child and it still remains one of my favourite Andre Norton books.Far, far into mankind's future, when humankind has spread out into the stars from the original planet of Terra and encountered other races...Young Troy Horan is a refugee/displaced person due to war, living the shadow life of an unwanted, non-citizen in the Dipple camp. His world and past life has gone forever and he has no future. The elite and powerbrokers of the galaxy, gathered on the pleasure planet of Korwar, prefer to ignore the unpleasant truth of the Dipple under their noses.One day, Troy has the unbelievable luck to secure some temporary day work in a luxury pet shop. While there, he stumbles on a mystery that could cost him his life, and he goes on the run with the special sentient luxury pets he has discovered he can communicate with in the petshop.Who can Troy trust? He and his Terran animal friends hold a dangerous secret, and various interested and powerful parties now set off in pursuit of Troy and his friends as they escape into the highly protected nature wilderness that comprises most of Korwar, and finally into the mysterious, forbidden and sealed ruins of a previous race which existed on Korwar. The ruins are officially sealed for a reason - can the escapees survive their pursuers and what lurks within?Language and content are appropriate for children/young adults. In addition, the writing and plot is at an extremely high level, appealing to adult readers as well. Some themes are environmentalism, power, war, refugees and animal rights. One of my favourite SF books still, as an adult reader. Also one for cat lovers."},{"Title":"Catseye (The Gregg Press science fiction series)","review":"The action of several of Norton's science fiction novels have begun on Korwar, whose people deliberately chose to make the planet a playground for the rich and powerful of the galaxy. Ironically, this is the best possible protection for Korwar from the interstellar corporations represented by those same people - while they often plunder worlds for natural resources, they won't foul their own nest.Despite their protection, however, Korwar isn't untouched. During the great war between the Council and Confederation governments (its aftermath appears in several books, such as DARK PIPER), the capital city of Tikil became the site of a refugee camp. After the war, those whose worlds were gone, whether destroyed or traded away at the peace table, had nowhere else to go, so the refugee camp became the Dipple, an unofficial 3rd face of Tikil making an ugly contrast to the expensive haunts of tourists or even the working city of the spaceport and warehouse district. The Dipple is a perennial problem, and CATSEYE follows Troy Horan, brought to this sterile warren as a youngster from the plains of Norden. There are only three options open to a Dipple-dweller: attempting to join the Thieves' Guild (as Ziantha of FORERUNNER FORAY escaped), signing on as indentured labor for a frontier world (as Niall of JUDGEMENT ON JANUS did), or scraping by without sub-citizenship by competing in the very tight casual labor market, as Horan does. Consequently, while the protagonists of FORERUNNER FORAY and JUDGEMENT ON JANUS also came from the Dipple, Troy Horan's story is the first to concentrate on Tikil and Korwar - the other tales leave the planet early in the story.On the morning the story opens, Troy has incredible luck - the assigner has a job for someone with \\"knowledge of animals\\", and Troy's reply that he has that of a Norden herd rider lands him indefinite employment at Kyger's pet shop, which provides exotic pets as status symbols for the rich. Troy's initial worries about the decade separating him from any contact with animals aren't a problem - his initial work assignment to help retrieve some new acquisitions from the port lengthens when an attempted hijack en route puts a full-time Kyger employee temporarily out of action.But why would anyone try to hijack a shipment of exotic animals bound for a life as pets - even as pets of the Gentle Fem San duk Var, rich and influential though she is? Delivering a fussel hawk and accompanying its first hunting expedition with a Ranger of Korwar (and giving us our first glimpse not only of Korwar's huge unspoiled nature preserves, but of the mysterious Forerunner ruins of Ruhkarv) leaves him with an impression that Korwar's guardians are taking an unusual interest in what is, after all, only a pet shop. After all, it's not *illegal* to convince credulous rich people that their little darlings can't survive without special diets, available from Kyger's. :)Then the routine of delivering special pet food to a Sattor Commander's beloved kinkajou is disrupted by murder - and Troy covers the kinkajou's odd behavior with a plausible story for the police. He finds himself wondering just how intelligent these animals are - and whether he should ally himself with Kyger, who may provide a permanent escape from the Dipple, or with a certain cats-eye view of the world.(Ruhkarv, and the disastrous fate of the last archeological team ever allowed in the place, are mentioned in some of Norton's other works - DREAD COMPANION mentions it in passing, while a Zacathan scholar in BROTHER TO SHADOWS attempts an experiment with a revised version of the device that brought final disaster to the Ruhkarv team - but CATSEYE provides more information about Ruhkarv than any other story to date.)"},{"Title":"Catseye (The Gregg Press science fiction series)","review":"Catseye (1961) is a standalone SF novel in the Dipple universe. When the War of Two Sectors broke out, the Council had evacuated the Horans from Norden to the Displaced Persons center on Korwar. Range Master Lang had volunteered for military service and did not return. Then his wife died of the Cough, a passing illness that was particularly hard on those from Norden. Their son was the sole survivor of the Horan family.In this novel, ten year later, Troy Horan has only his wide Range Master belt and a few memories to remind him of Norden. Now he is working as a casual laborer in Tikil. One morning, he is offered a job by the mechanical assigner and accepts it. Today he will escape the Dipple for a few hours.Troy reports for work at Kyger's, a purveyor of extraordinary pets. On his first day, he frustrates an attempt to steal a pair of Terran cats. Supervisor Zul -- a full-blooded Bushman -- is wounded in the attempt and Kyger offers Troy a seven day contract to fill in for the injured man.During the incident, Troy receives a warning in mindspeech from the cats. Later, he approaches their cage and exchanges a few thoughts. He conceals these communications from his employer and co-workers since he is not really sure what has happened.Troy has an affinity for animals and does especially well with the fussel hawk, a hunting bird from Norden. He is asked to accompany a customer into the wild to prove the bird's qualities. He will spend three days in the company of Rerne, a high ranking member of the Hunter Clans.Before this excursion, Troy is sent to a hillside villa to deliver special food for a pet kinkajou owned by Commander Varan Di. Since the Commander had just been murdered, the patrollers warn off his flitter, but allow him to continue after he explains his errand. As he is approaching the villa, the pet runs away from a patroller carrying it out of the building and leaps into Troy's arms.The patrollers are upset at finding the pet rummaging through the Commander's papers. Troy points out that the kinkajou is a very imitative animal and his probably copying his master's habitual routine. While he is talking to the patrollers, the kinkajoy is pleading with him in mindspeech to take it away from the estate. Eventually, the patrollers tell him to return the pet to Kyger's shop and they fly away.In this story, Troy finds that a pair of Terran foxes can also talk to him in mindspeech. He even overhears a conversation between the animals and their master. He begins to suspect Kyger of some form of espionage. Then Kyger is murdered and Zul tries to kill these animals. Troy steals a flitter and flees into the wilderness with the five Terran animals.Troy and the animals are followed by Kyger's associates and the flitter is forced down in the 'accursed place' of Ruhkarv. Now they are hunted not only by Zul and his men, but also by the rangers of the Hunter Clans. They travel deep within the alien ruins and find much to fear therein.This story is a precursor to theBeast Masterseries. Although Fors has mental communications with the great hunting cat Lura inStar Man's Son, this tale depicts a team of human and animals. Unlike Storm Hosteen's beastmaster team, however, Troy's group is more accidental than intentional. But it is still a combined force against their enemies.Highly recommended for Norton fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of human-beast teamwork, future cultures, and high adventure.-Arthur W.

In fact I know a few Iyawos, and a few Babalorishas and Iyalorishas menores like my self who have stated the same things. Okay so with that said, she has published two good books and I must say this one is one of them.

This book is a classic: it is imperative to read.I disagree with the reviewer below (Mr. Landon) who calls for a repudiation of natural selection. I do not believe that sufficient evidence exists to recall the theory of natural selection.Richard Hofstaedter is not, I repeat, is not calling for that, either. Recalling a scientific theory because of political difficulties caused by misguided adherents is neither right nor necessary. And Richard Hofstaedter demonstrates why it is not necessary right here in this book.The take-away from this book is that social Darwinism, the belief that only the \\"fittest\\" (whatever that means) people among us should survive (rule, whatever), is on shaky ground. Always a morally repugnant doctrine, Hofstaedter shows social Darwinism to be logically suspect as well.As Hofstaedter points out, one can start with the social Darwinist's appropriation of (or more accurately with their failure to reckon with) the term \\"natural\\". Darwin's principle of natural selection never addressed individuals within a species, and its application to individuals is a tremendous mistake. Writing about individuals striving to be \\"fittest\\", Hofstaedter here, from the pen of Mr. Darwin himself:\\"People who are selfish and contentious will not cohere, and without coherence, nothing can be effected.\\"Rugged individualism is repudiated by its supposed inventor, and is fatally wounded.One ponders the origin of the social instinct. Social Darwinists believe it to be contrived. But we were either created or selected to have it, this Darwin seems to know. And we should know it, too.Hofstaedter avoids bombast, ideology, and religion. Yet he most effectively shames any false philosopher who would trample underfoot the least of his brothers and pronounce it \\"inevitable\\", by demonstrating the fallacy of his \\"logic\\".By revealing the spurious origins and assumptions that form the foundation of the doctrine of social Darwinism, Hofstaedter undoes the false conflict between evolutionary science and Christian ethics.In the end, Mr. Landon and I agree: Five stars. If you're interested in the most significant question arising in the past couple of centuries for social science, ethics and religion, the buck stops here."},{"Title":"Social Darwinism in American thought","review":"Richard Hofstadter is an excellent historian of the trends in American political, social, and religious thought. This book chronicles the rise and fall of Herbert Spencer's philosophy as a reinforcing doctrine for laissez-faire political economy. Hofstadter deftly combines his own observations with carefully selected quotes from the thinkers themselves. One lesson that may be gleaned from this work is that controversial and complex ideas such as Darwinian evolution may be used for a multiplicity of purposes, some of them conflicting. For those who seek a greater insight to the struggle between individualism and collectivism in American political culture. I would also recommend reading Will Durant's chapter on Herbert Spencer in The Story of Philosophy as a supplement."},{"Title":"Social Darwinism in American thought","review":"If by chance you are unaware of what Social Dawinism is and/or do not know how it has flowed through America's bloodstream (most virtually since the Civil War) you are in for a reader's exploration that is destined to change your world view. For sure, you will realize how social Darwinism is alive and well today and, I offer, that you will be howling to leave it by the wayside by the time you've turned the last page of this unexpected history. This is a cornerstone read for the history buff and a must read for anyone seeking reasons why life--for most of us--is not as joyful or pleasant as it could be...In this light Richard Hofstdter's book is a teacher of both the mind and heart!"},{"Title":"Social Darwinism in American thought","review":"This book doesn't really take much of a position. Rather, it is a historical chronicle positions others have taken. But if there is a hidden 'thesis' to this book, my guess is that it would look something like this: Evolution is a unique science because it touches on the very idea of who humans are, individually and as a group. Becuase of this, there has been a great urge to make sweeping proclomations applying evolution to politics, ethics, economics, etc. This book is the historical record of various attempts.What one learns in this book is that far from being limited to Spencer and the laissez-faire crowd, evolution has been invoked to support just about every governmental and economic scheme imaginable: Kropotkin tied 'mutual aid' to anarchism; Marx applied it to communism; Spencer to capitalism; Dewey to government interventionism, etc....etc....Hofstadter takes us on a ride that begins with Darwin and winds its way through these varied schemes. Everyone, it seems, wanted to apply this newly found science to their side before the other guy could monopolize it! If you couldn't link your beliefs to evolutionary support, then your beliefs may risk seeming unscientific (especially if the other guy COULD claim evolutionary support). And this is the story of that multifarious race.Obviously Spencer and Sumner are written about quite a bit, as they have become the public face of 'Social darwinim.\\" (As it is a bastard philosophy, I refuse to capitalise the \\"d\\" in Social darwinism.) Kropotkin and those who tied evolution to altruism are also gone over a good deal. From there, we get a survey of the often neglected pragmatists and their understanding of Darwinism (I think they got it right; particuluarly William James.) We end in somewhat of an irony, with the anti-Spencerian economists who applied evolutionary thought to the OPPOSITE conclusion from Spencer's.It is a good read, especially for those interested in the history of ideas. But anyone looking for much of a thesis in this book will be disappointed. The book is not pro- or anti-evolution in any way whatever. The book only suggested (to me anway) the danger that comes when evolutionary thinkers unhinge themselves from the empirical and begin philosophizing about normative things like ethics and politics. Evolutionary psychology is one thing, but evolutionary ideology is quite another (in whatever shape it comes)."},{"Title":"Social Darwinism in American thought","review":"ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS WRITTEN ON THE AMERICAN WAY OF THINKING AND EXPLAINING THE UNDERLYING ATTITUDE and beliefs regarding our attitude about social issues and social responsibility. This thought provoking work is as relevant today if not more so than the day it was first published."},{"Title":"Social Darwinism in American thought","review":"I was blown away by this book when I first read it, back in the 1970s. And I give it three stars because it did introduce me to many of the ideas and thinkers Hofstadter highlights.But I can't give it more than that. Hofstadter overstates the significance of social Darwinism. It wasn't the whole of the case for laissez-faire economics. After all, David Ricardo made that case well before Darwin saw any finches on any islands. And Ricardo's disciple, Harriet Martineau, was popularizing and idealizing the free-market case in the 1830s, still long before Darwin or Spencer or the rest of this lot.In the US, the arguments of classical economists combined with the old Puritan ethos to gain force. One interpretation of Darwinism strengthened such thoughts, but RH takes that out of context."},{"Title":"Social Darwinism in American thought","review":"Hofstadter's classic work remains one of the outstanding challenges to the effect of Darwin's theory of evolution on social attitudes and beliefs. One of the great fallacies of evolutionary thinking can arise from the assumption of universal application of its mechanism of natural selection to all times, thus to the present and future. This is a fallacy and an inherent trap in confusing evolutionary process with a natural law, as in physics. The result of Darwin's theory was to make 'natural selection' a social strategy in the minds of many in a total confusion of theoretical domains of application. The outcome was the many variants of Social Darwinism that stretch into our own times. Hofstadter's documentation of the many shades of opinion generates a sense of deja vu, for few of the viewpoints we hear now are new and appear somewhere in the book, in a merry-go-round of confused thinking. It is a dreadful legacy that too many fell obligated to correct in the wrong fashion, by exempting Darwin entirely, and blaming those who came afterwards. In fact, the perception that Darwin's theory is simply wrong or incomplete is the only antidote to social Darwinist attitudes, which linger in the tacit belief of too many in the need to mimic the ruthlessness enjoined by a confused theory. Robert Bannister's Social Darwinism is also a partial comment on Hofstadter, but does not supercede this original and enduring work."},{"Title":"Marriage in Jeopardy: Hometown U.S.A. (Harlequin Superromance No. 1336)","review":"MARRIAGE IN JEOPARDY by Anna AdamsIn MARRIAGE IN JEOPARDY, Anna Adams tells the tale of a married couple whose marriage had been falling apart for years. The story opens with Lydia Quincy in the hospital attached to all sorts of machines, having flashbacks of the unexpected beating she received outside the courthouse where her husband Josh Quincy, a public defender, had just lost a case. The wife of his client became so angry at the thought of her husband going to prison that she attacked what was most precious to Josh - his wife. The physical attack killed Lydia's unborn son, and Lydia luckily escaped death herself. Lydia and Josh's marriage had been troubled for years, but their hopes were lying on their unborn child to bring them closer together again. With that dream of a newborn child gone, Lydia was no longer sure her marriage had a chance. She knew one thing, though, that she did not want to go back home to Hartford.Josh's family background was one he did not feel comfortable talking about. He lost his younger sister many years ago when she was only 5 years old, due to his parents negligence, and because of it he spent a few years living with foster parents while his own parents were sent to jail. Now, many years later, his parents want to make up for those lost years, and one of the things they want to do is be there for Lydia and Josh while Lydia recovers from her beating. Josh is against this idea, but Lydia refuses to go back home. There are too many painful memories there. Lydia convinces him to go with her back to Maine to spend some time with his parents. While he is at first against the idea (he wants to forget his memories of his childhood home), he slowly softens and finds that he still has something to say to the parents he felt weren't worthy of his attention or love.While the novel had a good start along with some serious themes that could have made for an outstanding book, I felt the characters were not developed well and I had a problem with seeing them as real three-dimensional people. The dialogue felt stiff at times, and the story line felt a bit contrived. Another problem was that I liked the parents more than I did the two main characters, Lydia and Josh. I'm giving this book a three-star rating for the good story theme, but it certainly could have been written better. It didn't help that the two main characters were difficult to like. -- Courtesy of LoveRomances"},{"Title":"Marriage in Jeopardy: Hometown U.S.A. (Harlequin Superromance No. 1336)","review":"Josh and Lydia Quincy seem like the perfect American couple. That is until Vivian Durance, the wife of her spouse's client, assaults a pregnant Lydia near the courthouse. She miscarries. Psychologically Lydia fails to heal and is unable to remain in their expensive townhouse and needs to leave town. She believes Josh prefers keeping his reputation as best public defender in Hartford, Connecticut over her needs for them to feel safe; this was not the first incident only the deadliest.Lydia threatens to end their marriage if they fail to leave town and to return to his hometown. Josh agrees to the blackmail because he still loves Lydia, but this is a place he detests as this is where his worst nightmare occurred. His sister drowned because their parents were too drunk to rescue her. As soon as he reaches Maine, Josh begins to wonder whether staying with Lydia though he loves her is worth the price of coming to a place that hosts his nastiest nightmare.MARRIAGE IN JEOPARDY turns a light on the aftermath impact of a tragedy on a relationship even a loving one. There is no doubt that Josh loves his wife or he would never agreed to go to Maine yet he still may find her needs too overwhelming as he has his own demons fueled by guilt and grief to fight. This is not an easy tale to read even with a glimmer of light amongst the dark; yet no question this is a deep well written character study in which love may not prove enough to save a MARRIAGE IN JEOPARDY from a tragedy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Love the Sinner: Gracie Lee Mystery Series #1 (Love, Faith and Getting It Right #5) (Steeple Hill Cafe)","review":"Fun read!

What should be even more unlikely is that Dennis, Gracie's husband, would be such a scoundrel, preying off woman after woman, but the evening news tells us that it happens! Despite the deaths and the miserable people in this book, it was enjoyable.

He has not only gotten into a car accident with her car and taken her money, he's also gotten another woman pregnant! And it's someone from Gracie's small group from church! Then if things couldn't get any worse, he gets murdered in the hospital! Gracie finds out there are several suspects that could have done this including her (evil) mother in law and her (nasty) step daughter. She has to discover who the murderer is before she becomes the next target.This was a fun book. It's not your normal Christian happy family novel. There isn't really a happy, let's tie up all the ends, everyone hugs ending. And Dennis commits huge sins that he never repents for. Which is fine with me, to me that is more realistic than him getting a deathbed conversion. I really could not stand her mother in law or her step daughter. I know mothers are usually blind to their children's faults but Edna was just unbearable. I also found it interesting at how the ex-wives got along well with each other. Of course they had something in common, but it was interesting at how there wasn't any animosity. Although I did find it rather unbelievable that both Gracie and Heather would turn up in the same small group at church. I mean unless God planned it that way on purpose, the odds of a wife and her husband's mistress that were miles apart showing up together, is not strong. I thought Gracie had a good relationship with her son as opposed to Dennis' relationship with his daughter. I enjoyed reading about Gracie learning to use instant messaging to talk to Ben. It's cool when parents try to relate with their kids and I like reading about adults who do attempt to learn how to use the computer as opposed to those who just write it off as only something for the younger generation.

Usually I find the older romance novels amusingly quaint (how they can hop on planes and smoke everywhere etc) This book is perhaps not showing its age in the best way. Lorraine is a senior at University (their in England) studdying english, her summer break she has arranged to work as a maid at a hotel. Also staying at the hotel is an author that she greatly admires, Mark Taylor. Their first meeting I found very entertaining (she gets her hair stuck on the bed springs of his bed while cleaning underneath it and he rescues her). She however is never able to shake that inital embarrassement from their first meeting and so they are at war for the rest of the novel except for brief interludes of kissing and sexual tension.Added to the mix of characters is Mark's sister, her brother-in-law (a rival for Lorraine), Mark's mother and Lorraine's little 12 year old sister Jennifer. As Lorraine and Jennifer have been orphaned Mark also suspects Lorraine of being a gold digger. (A pretty stupid plot twist).The best scene is when a storm takes Mark and Lorraine by surprise and they are breifly forced to get along.The book dates itself in several ways. Mark smokes quite a bit, he wears velvet suits with ruffled shirts (I had to laugh at that)and the pair's interation is very heavy handed.Not a terrible book but it didn't immediately draw me in either."},{"Title":"Modern American homes,","review":"As a collection of homes -- mostly from the Chicago area from the first two decades of the 20th century -- this book is a wonderful piece of architectural history. At the time of its original publication, it became a pattern book for contractors and a source of ideas for architects across the United States and beyond. It contains a collection of examples of built residences and numbers among the architects therein Frank Lloyd Wright and others noted for their introduction and use of the prairie style. Bungalows and American Four-Squares are represented as well as some early Spanish, Colonial and Tudor Revivals. If you have a house from that time period it may be \\"in here\\" or inspired by what appeared in these pages.Wright biographers ought to be more aware of this book than they are. It appeared just after Wright's midlife crisis abandonment of his family and sojourn in Europe with Mamah Cheney. Wright had contracted with von Holst to take over the Oak Park Studio. Architectural historians have downplayed the connections between Wright and von Holst preceding that move, and they have almost universal missed the fact that von Holst was much more aware of and sympathetic to the prairie style than has been credited him by the \\"experts\\". This book goes a long way to counteract that.Hermann V. von Holst (1874-1955) was an American architect practicing in Chicago, Illinois and Boca Raton, Florida, from the 1890s through the 1940s, best remembered for agreeing to take on the responsibility of heading up Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural practice when Wright went off to Europe with Mamah Cheney in 1909. von Holst was born in Freiburg, Germany on June 17, 1874. von Holst graduated from the architecture program at the University of Chicago in 1893 and the architecture program at MIT in 1896. He found employment as a draughtsman at the prestigious architectural firm of Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, in their Chicago office, one of the successor firms of the celebrated architect Henry Hobson Richardson. By 1900, von Holst was head draughtsman at the firm. Following extensive travels, von Holst opened his own practice in Chicago in 1905, with offices in The Rookery Building, Chicago. In 1909, he moved his office to Chicago's Steinway Hall, where he was among a collegial group of Prairie School architects.Active in professional organizations, von Holst served as Treasurer of the Architectural League of America in 1905. He published several books on architectural subjects, including \`'Cyclopedia of Drawing'' (1907). He served as professor of architectural design at the Chicago School of Architecture at the Art Institute of Chicago. He also taught design in the Department of Architecture at the Armour Institute of Technology (later IIT). He took over and successfully headed Wright's Oak Park Studio when Wright and Mamah were off in Europe and excellent prairie style houses emerged from that arrangement. Later, he removed to Florida and work in the development he nursed into being called \\"Floresta\\" near Boca Raton (that is now mistakenly attributed by realtors to Addison Mizner) sells for millions.So, there is more than houses in this fine, thoughtful collection."},{"Title":"Spawn (Book 4)","review":"this is a very worth buying comic book. it has an exciting plot that includes emotion drama and lotsof brain pounding action plus you find out a little more why al simmons/ spawnwas assasinated and sent to hell. this book also has a very intresting twist with the famous magician harri houdini . and even if you arent familiar with the concept and story of spawn this comic is a pretty good place to start. i would recommend this spawn to any new or old fan."},{"Title":"Spawn (Book 4)","review":"Spawn Book Four collects the debut of Greg Capullo as penciller of Spawn.

It is meant to be a book we will read when at the quest of love and peace. The book is meant to be read when you are angry, sad, experiencing fear and judgment. Of course you still need to find other ways to work on your anger, this book simply have the power to help you let go of those nasty thoughts. This book is not meant to be used to suppress/deny the existence of anger and fear, for, we need to accept human has all ranges of emotions. There is no right and wrong for whatever and however we feel things. At the end of the day, we are just saying prayers to let go of the emotional poisons. That is the essence of this book. The words of the book can only be experienced and felt. You cannot use your judgmental mind to think and to understand nor can you try to rush finishing the book. Some books, for example this one, just are not meant for speed reading because you cannot experience the peace the author wants to give you. When you open your heart and feel the power of the words, you experience lots of love and compassion to yourself and others. That is how you want to use this book to open your spiritual eyes and stay there. This book is easy to understand. It is meant to be read again and again, especially during turbulent times where we are most easily to slip back to the judgmental self. I definitely recommend this book to someone who is experiencing some sort of a significant loss in life (whether it is a loved one's death, a lost of job or a loss of marriage). May we all come out from the turbulent times and experience love and care, which help us return to our authentic self - with love and care and without judgment about self and others?"},{"Title":"Prayers: A Communion with Our Creator","review":"I went to a spiritual retreat and found this book.

You take on this small booklet and it takes you right on to that wavelength by use of his amazingly apt imagery.

A way of prayer with my god, as this read has taught me, simply restored my happiness. I'd have to say that I have tried to forgive others and even bought other books on forgiveness, but nothing brought me that need as this book has. This is just not one more book on spiritual guidance, this rates with the best as it is real, solid, and not a weak reason in it.If you want another strong read that also deals with overall and personal destiny I strongly recommend a great spiritual book, SB 1 or God by Karl Mark Maddox"},{"Title":"Prayers: A Communion with Our Creator","review":"With reverence, at the very least! I came to this book after the author's 4 Agreements and found the prayers and guided meditations here very effective as I learned meditation and began to deepen my spiritual practice. It doesn't matter which denomination or religion you claim to belong to, because these truthful, poetic insights and encouragements transcend labels and unnatural boundaries. It is as if Ruiz discovered a coven of saintly horses who taught him these golden words.

However, although this is included as a column, many of the entries gave the abbreviation \\"mq.\\" According to authors this means that the food \\"may contain a measurable quantity.\\" After looking at another Nutribase guide for more clarification, I found that this abbreviation is used to indicate that the food can have fluctuations in whatever it is that was being measured, and this can vary from nonsignificant amounts to substantial amounts.This, however, does no good for me. Might as well not give me any information. I'd rather have a food counter that takes a stab at it and gives me an average rather than no information at all. I returned the book and got something else.If you're not buying a fat counter to keep track of saturated fat, then I suppose this counter will work quite well.

The game is a trick taking 3 to 4 person card game consisting of four rounds, with five games per round, with plastic gems used as currency. The play style is not unlike an odd cross between spades and hearts. Fair warning - neither the plastic gems, nor the cards are highly durable. The gems will get chipped and cloudy over time - I use glass counters like those used in M:TG and other card games. The cards will begin to split over time as well, but very quickly, the art will begin to wear with normal use. Protect them with card sleeves.The cards themselves look something like tarot cards, and are beautiful portraits in a soft style and color. The art is stunning, and the suits Dragonlords, Druids, Warriors and Nomads are all in their own themes. The cards however are *old* and can easily be damaged. I gotlarge protective sleevesto stop white spots from rubbing into the surface from friction during normal play. The spots started to appear after only a couple of games on a wooden table.Each round starts with a Dragonmaster, and the object of the game is to accumulate the most gems by taking tricks, or forcing other people to take tricks, depending on which game is being played. The Dragonmaster controls the course of the game, but it doesn't guarantee he or she will win the game they have chosen.There are three play levels: Basic, Advanced and Expert. In expert games, other players can wrest control of a round from the current Dragonmaster by running a Power Play, and potentially gaining more gems.Basic is great for the whole family to play, but it will take teens and up to fully realize the fun of playing expert and advanced modes, which can get fairly competitive."},{"Title":"Dragonmaster: A Fantasy Game of Mythical Cards and Magical Crystals [BOX SET]","review":"Long live Dragonmaster.

Instead of a well behaved rich kid they get a wild, red-haired hellion, that insists on playing Indians, and sacres one of his kidnappers so much that they finnally take him back to his father, thinking that they'll just get rid of him then and there. Well, instead of a reward the kid's father says that if they pay him a hundred or so dollars he'll keep his son back for a while and he won't tell the neighbors that they brought him back until nightfall.

I do not even personally know any Vietnam Air War veterans. And until recently, I was quite happy about missing out on the experience. It was a war, after all. What's there to miss?However, after reading Fast Movers I have changed my mind. Dr. Sherwood's portrayal of the people involved in this conflict, their colorful personalities, camaraderie, and determination to make the best of the worst left me in awe. I would have loved to have met some of these people, spent some time with them, and learned from them important lessons on leadership, courage, conquering one's fears, and maintaining personal integrity and a sense of humor even when things got really tough. Dr. Sherwood exhibits many of these qualities himself. I am sure he is getting a lot of flak. Basing a book on oral histories and personal accounts is always a risky proposition.

I was so upset while reading this clown's book that I had to convince myself to finish it, solely for purposes of writing an accurate critique. This so-called \\"naval historian\\" knows less about naval aerial combat techniques and terminology than Martha Stewart!!! But what I found MOST disturbing was the way this coward defamed and slandered a navy pilot who was killed in Vietnam. To make such an egregious statement as \\"Roger Locher and Bob Lodge had clearly become so absorbed in the killing process on 10 May that they lost track of reality: their basic survival instincts were eclipsed by blood lust. Lodge, in particular, had no other life to live, no wife, no child, not even a girlfriend or a hobby. Killing was his only passion.\\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME????? To make the comment regarding Bob Lodge that \\"KILLING WAS HIS ONLY PASSION\\" because he wasn't married or had children is the MOST INCREDULOUS, IRRESPONSIBLE statement I have ever heard!!! For this IDIOT to use terms like \\"BLOOD LUST\\" to describe what, at that time, were irrefutably THE WORLD'S MOST WELL-TRAINED, WELL-DISCIPLINED PILOTS IN THE WORLD is both unprofessional, childish and completely irresponsible. Mr. Sherwood you are not worthy to wipe the boots of one of these men let alone write such vitriolic, childish dribble.

You are quite the man of courage Mr. Sherwood!"},{"Title":"Fast Movers","review":"One of the reasons I bought this book (12 years ago) is that some of the people in it are friends. I've also read many of the readers' comments about the inaccuracies presented by the Naval Historian Sherwood. He wasn't there and certainly is unfamiliar with some of the terminology but I believe he tried to get accurate information. Tried...One Navy A-6 story I'm personally familiar with is very accurate, sans a few mistakes with acronyms and chatter terms. And I know he got his information for this story right from the source, the B/N. However, I was a little disappointed about the lack of Marine Naval Aviators but, that's the destiny of the Marine Corps; first in and last out of the dirty missions with no acknowledgement beyond a, \\"Good mission\\" statement from the CO. But that's okay. Marines understand that treatment. It has been said (by one Marine Naval Aviator) that \\"The Air Force flies at 30,000 feet, the Navy at 10,000 feet and the Marines at 150 feet as they eliminate the enemy threat to save your infantry asses one more time\\".\\"Marine F-4's...! We're gonna get out of here alive!\\" has been said many times by 03xx's.All in all, Sherwood's book was a touch and a glimpse of people in a war most didn't want and nobody cares about today so, perhaps it'll stay on my bookshelf to be perused from time to time. A rainy Sunday evening, a glass or two of wine... no, perhaps Macallan, 25 year old... and a brief look into the past of the forgotten people and a forgotten war that wasn't a war.Okay. \\"Fast Movers\\" stays."},{"Title":"Fast Movers","review":"Top notch telling of the story that has waited too long to be told: how the privileged class of warriors known as &quot;top guns&quot; suffered many of the same post-Vietnam War stresses that those of us in the infantry felt upon returning home. These guys were modern Kamikazes flying almost daily missions into the mouth of the cat (we grunts always felt as if we were in the other &quot;end&quot;). Although &quot;Tomcat&quot; feels that he deserved more space in the book (this man is a hero for what he did for his fellow POW's), the book is nonetheless a 5 star read. It is also an important document that preserves these experiences as our generation ages and the stories are lost forever."},{"Title":"Fast Movers","review":"I read this book because my father is a retired Air Force fighter pilot and Vietnam veteran. Imagine my shock when I found myself reading about him on page 52. I telephoned him immediately because he was mentioned in a negative light. As I quoted the passage about him and others he lived with and fought with to him over the phone -- he remembered the days events in a completely different manner. &quot;Tax's&quot; rememberance of the Kep Airfield incident wasn't factual. Sounds like he had some axes to grind. What a bunch of sour grapes he spouts. If this recount is so glaring wrong I can only imagine how many others also are. The first rule of jounalism is to check and then recheck the facts. How many other men were slammed without being able to respond or defend themselves? The author never called my father. Bet he didn't call anyone else portrayed in these heresay conversations. I couldn't believe a word that was written after page 52. You shouldn't either."},{"Title":"Fast Movers","review":"In Fast Movers: Jet Pilots And The Vietnam Experience, John Sherwood focuses on fourteen jet fighter pilots, one at a time, to guide the reader through each phase of the Vietnam War air campaigns. Together, these lively and impassioned individual struggles demonstrate and document the difference that a single courageous pilot could (and often did) make. Fast Movers describes the thrill of the hunt, the suffering captivity in the Vietnam POW camps, the off-duty and aerial combat experiences that made up the totality of the combat jet pilot experience. Fast Movers is highly recommended reading for military buffs and historians."},{"Title":"Fast Movers","review":"I was loaned this book by a friend because of my interest in aviation and my work as a docent at an Air Museum near my winter home in Arizona. I had expected it to talk about the planes and pilots of the Viet Nam War, but I did not expect the eye opening experience that this book turned out to be. John Sherwood steps on some toes in this book and as a result some of the reviews herein reflect personal displeasure when his stories come too close to home or cut too close to the bone. I found the book to be a sobering experience and one which awoke much of the anger that many of us felt about how this war was conducted, not only by the generals, but more especialy by the politicians all the way up to LBJ. The fact that we dropped eight million tons of bombs in SE Asia and lost over 8,500 planes and helicopters without winning the war is an unsettling fact. However, bombs do not deliver themselves and real people were in those planes and helicopters and a great many of them lost their lives in this mishandled piece of business. It is the spirit of those that fought, even when their hands were tied by the ones in charge with foolish rules of engagement that is at the heart of the story that is told. It is not a pretty story. It is often a story of the raw underbelly of war, but it is a story that needed to be told and John Sherwood, an official U.S Naval Historian tells it without fear or favor. Had the war been managed in that fashion, the outcome would have been much different. He has my gratitude for doing it."},{"Title":"Fast Movers","review":"I have read several books of this type and though this one provides quite specific details, they turn out to be quite different from other books. Sometimes I feel like the author making new stuff for the fun of the readers (for example the battle of the air force on May 10 1972). Another thing is that this one purely tells stories rather making deep analysis about the airwar, the formations, and technical issues. Better spend your money on &quot;Clashes&quot; of Marshal L. Michel III."},{"Title":"Fast Movers","review":"Official Air Force books told us on typical operational history: units, battles,.. facts, figures. John Sherwood looks at the fighter pilots life, their flying skills and attitudes. He draws from memories or interviews with some Air Force pilots including such famous figures as Olds, Ritchie.. John Sherwood opens a new perspective on the air war in SEA. He brings you from operation room to the cockpit and back on the airbase with the after hours activities: Officers Club , and sometime he adds a touch of female companionship. John Sherwood has written an excellent book on the social life of fighter pilots during the Vietnam war. This book is a must for any SEA conflict student."},{"Title":"Fast Movers","review":"I know next to nothing about jet fighters, the air force or the air war in Vietnam. I found this book to be an extremely interesting and entertaining read. Unlike some military books, the author assumes no prior knowledge of the subject. The strengths and weaknesses of the different planes and the resulting tactics required to fly them are explained in simple terms. This really gives a good feel for what it was like to fly the different planes covered in the book.Each chapter deals with a different type of fighter and focuses on a specific pilot who flew that plane. Perhaps the characteristics of the different pilots are slightly exaggerated for effect. Who cares? It makes for a great read. Another thing I appreciated was the fact that all aspects of the airwar are covered, including the less glamorous ones like Medivac or POWs.Highly recommended to all readers."},{"Title":"Fast Movers","review":"JD Sherwood has completed the work I most wanted.

I flew over 400 combat missions (in A-4s and A-7s) from carriers in SEA. I flew with many of the men mentioned in the book.The author states as fact opinions of some of his subjects. He uses incorrect terminology. He quotes stories with glaringly incorrect information. (pg 160, Harrison's flameout landing: he says Joe Simon was the &quot;maintenance chief&quot; but goes on to quote Simon telling Harrison that he, Simon, is the commanding officer - impossible!Pg 183 - he quotes Nichols as saying &quot;You're going to learn to be a yo-yo.&quot; No fighter pilot would say that - yo-yo is a term in air to air combat describing &quot;using the vertical&quot; - Nichols was obviously saying he would teach them to yo-yo. He says the Navy made the officer's club at Cubi for the pilots and the one at Subic for the married officers. Absolutely untrue. Cubi point WAS the Naval Air Station and Subic was the Naval base, there was no fence between the two but there was no segregation either. Each base had its own officer's club and the Cubi club was definitely less sedate because it was most frequented by pilots , in part because it was closest to where the carriers docked.There are countless more errors of fact in the book, too many to make Sherwood a credible writer.And how does a Naval historian write about the air war in SEA without mentioning either the A-4 or A-7 aircraft?I hope the author is more careful with his facts when acting in his capacity as Naval Historian!I hope the author is more careful with his facts when acting in his capacity as Naval Historian!"},{"Title":"Fast Movers","review":"Sherwood tells the story mostly from the view point of Air Force missions and surprisingly, mostly from navigators. The yarns are mostly good although there are some silly statements. The reader will get almost no idea that Naval Aviation had any real presence in North Vietnam. Where are the stories about the A4 Skyhawk which probably had the most missions of any type of aircraft flown up north? Where are the A7 stories? Most aggravating of all, not a single mention of the Navy's Ace, Randy Cunningham. Where are the stories of the Navy pilots who flew 300 and 400 missions? Every pilot who flew up North has some hilarious stories and some heartbreaking stories. You missed almost all of them, Sherwood. Also, before one puts Official Naval Historian under one's name he really should know something about the US Navy and Naval Aviation. I had over 200 missions over there and would say to the reader, you really will only get half the story in this book. The Air Force half."},{"Title":"Fast Movers","review":"As a Reagan-era USAF pilot whose only direct knowledge of the Vietnam War is from the stories of the veteran pilots that I had the fortunate opportunity to learn from, I get a bit troubled when I read &quot;military history&quot; that includes author opinions like the following:&quot;... Roger Locher and Bob Lodge had clearly become so absorbed in the killing process on 10 May that they lost track of reality: their basic survival instincts were eclipsed by blood lust. Lodge, in particular, had no other life to live, no wife, no child, not even a girlfriend or a hobby. Killing was his only passion.&quot;Or this:&quot;(Steve Ritchie's) training and preparation prevented him from falling into the same emotional trap that killed Lodge.&quot;It would be one thing if the actual participants were directly quoted making these statements. It is entirely another thing to have a so-called historian some 28 years after the fact make these grand judgements about the mental well-being of a man who made a common combat mistake. What I smell is controversy-motivated psycho-history to sell books.The reason I purchased this book was to read the &quot;facts&quot; about the &quot;stories&quot; I had heard about an USAF pilot who choice death to avoid capture. What I read was a hatchet job on a man who can't even defend his honor because he made the ultimate sacrifice for his country while I and this author were still playing &quot;cops and robbers&quot; at recess in elementary school.May Robert Lodge rest in peace. He was a combat pilot who made a mistake and paid for it with his life. Those are the historical facts. Any judgments about his mental state, his motivations, or what he was thinking at the time is historical fiction."},{"Title":"Fast Movers","review":"HORRIBLE with some bright spots. I shudder to think that this man is a Naval historian. I flew over 400 combat missions from carriers in SEA. I flew with many of the men mentioned in the book.The author states as fact opinions of some of his subjects. He uses incorrect terminology. He quotes stories with glaringly incorrect information. (pg 160, Harrison's flameout landing: he says Joe Simon was the &quot;maintenance cheif but goes on to quote Simon telling Harrison that he, Simon, is the commanding officer - impossible!Pg 183 - he quotes Nichols as saying &quot;You're going to learn to be a yo-yo.&quot; No fighter pilot would say that - yo-yo is a term in air to air combat describing &quot;using the vertical&quot; - Nichols was obvioulsly saying he would teach them to yo-yo. He says the Navy made the officer's club at Cubi for the pilots and the one at Subic for the married officers. Absolutely untrue. Cubi point WAS the Naval Air Station and Subic was the Naval base, there was no fence between the two but there was no segregation either. Each base had its own officer's club and the Cubi club was definitely less sedate because it was most frequented by pilots , in part because it was closest to where the carriers docked.He uses &quot;Iron Hand&quot; to describe an Air Force Wild Weasel mission. ( Iron Hand was strictly a Navy term.) There are countless more errors of fact in the book, too many to make Sherwood a credible writer.And how does a Naval historian write about the air war in SEA without mentioning either the A-4 or A-7 aircraft?I hope the author is more careful with his facts when acting in his capacity as Naval Historian!"},{"Title":"Fast Movers","review":"Having waded through the author's previous work on Korean fighter pilots, it was with some hesitation that I read this book. In effect, it is a continuation of his explication of the &quot;flight suit culture&quot; of military aviators and how they fly and fight. It is also a semi-psychological profile of jet aviators. Having been through Navy flight training, I can attest first hand to the status of jet aviators in the services. I was particularly dismayed by the almost complete lack of acknowledgement of the Navy light attack community, the A4s and A7s. I say &quot;almost&quot; because the story of Mike Estocin, an A4 pilot of VA-192 who won the Medal of Honor posthumously, is told as an adjunct to the story of F8 driver and Mig killer John Nichols. That this is a sort of history is undeniable. It tells of the US involvement in the Vietnam war and the horrid mismanagement of it. The trouble is that it is so anecdotal that it appears that only those oral accounts that support the author's point of view are included. Some aviators of the era come off very badly in the stories told and others seem almost fictionally perfect. Some of the prose is melodramatic in the extreme as if writing the facts alone wouldn't be exciting enough. This is, too, almost exclusively an Air Force book and because of that, balance is lacking. Of course, the book is short, but to leave out the fact that the Navy had an ace too is incomprehensible. I was interested to find the background of thriller novelist Tom Wilson in the book; he was a Wild Weasel backseater, which accounts for the accuracy in his early books. The section on the POWs was, again, a reinforcement of the author's perception of flight suit culture. While interesting, that section was nothing new and has been better done in other works.All in all, less pretension and simply telling the aviators' stories with minimal explication would have made a better history book. What this means is that the definitive history of flight ops in Vietnam has yet to be written. Hopefully this book will stir someone to do it right."},{"Title":"Fast Movers","review":"I see that Mr. Smallwood likes S.L.A. Marshall; no wonder. Marshall made up much of his work, especially the infamous &quot;only one man in ten in combat fires his weapon,&quot; and it seems Smallwood follows his example by making up episodes to keep the book interesting. Much of what he says, especially the Ritchie/Lodge episodes, is simply wrong, except perhaps from Ritchie's eyes. One shudders to think this person will be writing serious history for the Navy. Skip it -- try Thud Ridge for real combat action and Clashes for real history, or wait a few months for Rebound."},{"Title":"Fast Movers","review":"I got it; I read it; I liked it; it was true; I know, I was there.

Growing up listening to my father's tales of life as a ground crewman at Da Nang in '68, I could well imagine plight of the brave men featured in &quot;Fast Movers.&quot; Sherwood does honor to those men who fought in that unappreciated war, while capturing the spirit of their comradery and the pain of their suffering.No account of warfare can be without controversy, and to be sure, &quot;Fast Movers&quot; will raise some. Memories fade and personal accounts are shaped by the passage of time-- especially those of combat veterans. The author can only do his best to cross-check facts with others who were there. If minor discrepancies in the oral history arise, we can only accept that such is the nature of the media. From this reader's perspective, I can only say that this account rang as true to me as the memories of my father's experiences were to him."},{"Title":"Fast Movers","review":"The air war over Southeast Asia showcased the proud, dedicated Americans who unselfishly did what was asked of them. This group, highly motivated though they were, was unfortunately misused and mismanaged by the very government that sent them there. True or not, many still feel that if they had been allowed to do what they had been trained for, most of their friends would still be alive, and Vietnam would not be seen as a \\"loss.\\" Indeed, the common retort was \\"We were winning when I left.\\"The new book Fast Movers: Jet Pilots and the Vietnam Experience takes a hard look at some of those men and what ultimately inspires them. Author John Sherwood, official historian of the U.S. Naval Historical Center, is well suited to bring this long-overdue book to the public. He realized that most books dealt only with air war tactics. Few examined the warriors themselves. With over 300 interviews and extensive research, Sherwood attempts to reveal the personal side of these pilots. Contrary to most opinions, these men wanted to be there, to test themselves against the most hostile environment ever designed. They were the \\"fast movers\\", those who flew jet fighters and attack aircraft. In all, 14 pilots are examined here: some Air Force and some Navy, some famous and some not. Whether battling the North Vietnamese defenses or trying to survive in such places as the Hanoi Hilton, these military professionals proved they had \\"the right stuff.\\" John Sherwood tells their story well.Robert S. DeGroat, Flight Journal"},{"Title":"Fast Movers","review":"I agree with the reviewer who wrote \\"Too Much Psycho-History for Me,\\" as far as he was able to comment - but I can go a bit further. I knew Bob Lodge. Sherwood's comments about him are disgusting, and nothing but character assassination on a fine officer. I did not know Roger Locher, but his experience was historic and heroic - something Sherwood will never be. Sherwood wrote,\\"... Roger Locher and Bob Lodge had clearly become so absorbed in the killing process on 10 May that they lost track of reality: their basic survival instincts were eclipsed by blood lust. Lodge, in particular, had no other life to live, no wife, no child, not even a girlfriend or a hobby. Killing was his only passion.\\"And\\"(Steve Ritchie's) training and preparation prevented him from falling into the same emotional trap that killed Lodge.\\"I knew Bob Lodge very well. He was my Element Leader during my 4th Class (freshman) year and Flight Commander during the 3rd Class (sophomore) year at the Air Force Academy. Bob graduated in 1964; I, in 1966. He lived either next door or across the hall from me for two years. Bob was dedicated and tenacious. He set very high standards, for himself and others. He wanted to fly more than anything else. Related to the Henry Cabot Lodge family, he had completed one year at MIT before accepting an appointment to the Academy, knowing that he would have to complete the entire 4-year program. He sought it because he wanted to fly as an Air Force officer, and thought the Academy was the best way to do it. While at MIT he contributed to, and was credited in, a textbook on advanced mathematics - something I found out using that text, while he tutored me through a rough spot.I do know that Bob was determined not to be taken prisoner under any circumstances. He would rather die. Even at the Academy he said he would never be taken alive. The story of his death was told to me by one of his classmates while I was on one of my B-52 tours (following the Linebacker II Christmas bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, enforcing the \\"peace\\" accords to ensure the North kept to its word). Bob and his GIB (Roger Locher) were pursuing a MIG (they had shot down several previously) - but another got on his tail, and got him. As the story was told to me, Bob's back seater, Locher, bailed out, but Bob refused to. Allegedly, Locher called to him to bail out, he indicated he was going to ride it in, he wouldn't be taken. For those of us who knew him, that was tragic, but no surprise.As for no wife, no kids, no family - Many of us did not want to leave widows and orphans. Bob felt that way, and he stuck to his principles. The time for making families was after the fighting was done.As far as \\"training\\" creating the differences between Bob Lodge and B/G Steve Ritchie, the assertion is nothing more than rank speculation that is disposed of with even minimal examination of the facts. They were classmates at the Air Force Academy. They went through the same training there for four years. Then they went through a year of pilot training, similar at all of the eight bases. They went through the same checkout in the F-4 Phantom. Steve Ritchie was even Bob's instructor at the USAF Fighter Weapons School, after Bob had transitioned from F-105s into the F-4! They fought under the same commander in the same squadron. Both were fighter pilots, and extremely good officers. I did not know B/G Ritchie, but I did know Bob Lodge, and I'm better for it. \\"Killing\\" was not his passion - but he hated Communists.So do I.And Sherwood knows not of what he writes."},{"Title":"Dali","review":"As a college art major I developed a distaste for Dali and his art, even referring to him as a \\"pimp\\" in an essay. I was turned off by his commercialism and his overly-polished style. But over the years my opinion began to shift, and the major retrospective at the Philadelphia Museum of Art has completely renovated my appreciation for the man and his art.This huge and handsome tome is the catalogue for the Philly retrospective, and includes hundreds of color images along with insights into the thought behind the imagery. The book takes you through his youthful experiments in post-impressionism and cubism (there are a few works you'd swear were by Picasso!), into his affiliation with Surrealism, his development of his personal \\"paranoiac-critical\\" method, and his later interests in physics and conversion to Catholicism. The middle section of the book and exhibit includes hundreds of his best-known and most widely-admired paintings, but surprises abound in the early and later sections, with works most people never knew he created.What struck me most in the show and the book was how thoroughly dedicated Dali was to his art, and how intellectually involved his work was. His draughtsmanship was also so acute as to defy belief. I realize now that I was sold so completely on his posture as an eccentric personality, that I lost sight of the power of his art. But this show and book reveal how truly special and significant Dali was as an artist, art theorist, and explorer of the hinterlands of the mind and soul."},{"Title":"Dali","review":"This book is the definitive look at Dali. I own a few other of his books but this one blows the out of the water. The only negative aspect about the book really comes down to my opinion. Some of my favorite paintings are fitted onto a page with 3 others making them a little difficult to see the extreme detail. While others get their own page but in my humble opinion didn't deserve it. While reading or just skimming through the paintings its awesome all the way through. The book is in chronological order so you can see his progress throughout his life. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, even if you don't like Dali's style, there is so much in here that you'll find something. I've spent dozens of hours looking through it, finding something new each time."},{"Title":"Dali","review":"While it may be hard to get a hold of here at Amazon, &quot;Dali: The Paintings&quot; is worthwhile in searching for.

Over 1600 of them to be exact, almost all of them produced in vivid color. The book progresses year to year, giving a glimpse into Dali's changing techniques and styles.

Ades is one of the formost Dalinian scholars.

A few of them are photos of Dali or the people and places that inspired him. A very few show existing artworks to which Dali's creations responded. The overwhelming majority, however, display Dali's own paintings or the sketches related to them.And the mass of imagery is overwhelming. The book traces Dali's output from his early, formative periods onwards. Although Dali was productive in the 1920s, his familiar style emerged in the 1930s and simply expanded for the next half-century. The chronological organization of this book lets us see Dali's art and personality develop. Among other things, we see how his sketching evolved from pen drawings early in his career to loose oil sketches later. This also seemed to complete some kind of cycle, from the relative crudity of his early work, to the crystalline finish of his best-known years, back to imprecision again, but with all of his mature expressiveness.By its attempt at completeness, this presents aspects of Dali that other authors often ignore. For example, Dali was profoundly influenced by Catholic Christianity. Although his personal beliefs may be difficult to fathom, he produced some of the most beautiful images of Christ ever created.Descharne's commentary supports the images well, but it's hard to read. I don't mean that the text is badly written - quite the opposite, it is very helpful, especially in biographical notes that describe Dali's life at the time of each work. Instead, I mean that my thoughts can't stay on the words for long when the pictures take such command of my attention.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Dali","review":"a beautifully sized book that contained excellent text about the painter's life and superb reproductions of his work in the book"},{"Title":"Dali","review":"Dali (Mallard Fine Art Series)I have read this book cover to cover and enjoyed every word! Paul Moorhouse manages to give a great amount of information covering Dali's life, his contribution to Surrealism, hidden aspects of his personality, his thinking and preferences at different periods in his life, thus allowing the reader to enter the magical world of Dali. The paintings selected span Dali's lifetime and represent the major directions of his work at different points in his life. The explanation provided for each painting includes its symbolism, its relation to what the artist was going through personally at the time, as well as connections with the historical period and other influences.

I wanted to read and understand about the art, to bad."},{"Title":"Dali","review":"Any review of this book would have to start off by emphasizing that this is a short book. It is only about 96 pages a significant share of which consists of Dali's most famous paintings. Hence anyone looking for an encyclopedic overview of Dali's works would do well to look elsewhere. The question becomes, for its short length, how good of a job does the book do in terms of providing a decent succinct overview of his art? The answer to that is quite well.This is primarily due to the fact that the author, like most of his colleagues who have written other titles in the Taschen \\"basics\\" series, is extremely knowledgeable of this subject. He provides an excellent, albeit brief, overview of Dali's art from the beginning of his career to his end. The reader sees Dali's progression of art through its early stages through its conclusion where religious matters become paramount as Dali comes closer to facing his end. The quality of the illustrations, as in all the Taschen \\"basics\\" series, is magnificent, as usual. The prints are on very high quality with vivid color (which would be essential to appreciating Dali's style) on high quality premium paper.The book does have some gaps however, especially in terms of Dali the man and the motivation behind his art. The author, for example, does not address the question of whether Dali was insane (or mentally unstable), like Bosch or Van Gogh, for example or whether his behavior and the art it reflected, was just part of his showmanship (i.e., an \\"act\\"). The author also does not address how Dali was able to survive in post-Franco Spain, especially considering how \\"subversive\\", Dadaist and anti-establishment his art was as viewed by both Franco and the Catholic Church."},{"Title":"Dali","review":"I am a huge Dali fan and this is another one of those books that gives a great insight into the man's thoughts and feelings."},{"Title":"Dali","review":"I used to have this book, and my ex-wife took it.

Also, the cartoons (which are not drawn very well) get a tad dry with the never-ending &quot;Cena Parata est!&quot;"},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Course, Part II, Second Edition","review":"This book is rather bipolar in its usefullness. It is nice (though often annoying) that it does make things easy on the user by using easy stories. &quot;Quintus goes to the pub&quot; will allow you to concentrate on the language and not the complex meaning of the story. Furthermore, it allows for a sort of &quot;catch up&quot; phase in that every four chapters or so there is a chapter in which nothing new is introduced. A time to really concentrate on what you are suppose to have learned. These are its good points.This will sound trivial but still bothers me a year after having finished this book...the art is wretched. Who drew these pictures? People often are drawn without arms or legs and switch shades of colors between images that are directly beside on another. And never (NEVER) look into the background. Whoever did draw these books not only had little skill in art, but had no knowledge of Roman life. Secondly, the book has this &quot;tell you later&quot; aspect. They allow little things to pop up here and ther and then explain them in the next chapter. Sure, some will say that this is a good way to slowly move into the grammer, but it does you no good to see a word and have no idea whatsoever to do with it. Beyond this, often when they do explain things they do so in a small context. &quot;A&quot; is used for 1. And you shall go on like that for some time before they tell you &quot;A&quot; is used also for 2 &amp; 4, which up until this point we have been using &quot;B.&quot; Later, we learn that &quot;B&quot; is the exact same but they cared not to let us in on that little fact. Of course, maybe they don't want to push too much on us, which is a fair argument. But, then, they should put annotations to further chapters so that if we want to we may look further ahead to gain, no understanding, but context. The book also, has its fair share of mistakes, which you will may not realize and which then may really hinder your learning.So, the book has its good and bad points. Overall I think it is a good book to learn with, but it definately could be revised and some of these problems fixed."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Course, Part II, Second Edition","review":"These four books make a great introductory course. They many not be the easiest, by any means, but they are far and away one of the best and most rewarding. While on one level it is definitely a \\"reading course\\" (i.e., it has you reading extended narrative prose from the very beginning) it really does combine the best of the modern and traditional approaches. The course develops reading skills as much as any \\"inductive\\" textbook (even one at the end of the spectrum like Cambridge Latin Course), and yet it teaches grammar explicitly and from the very beginning. Furthermore the grammar is presented in manageable amounts (though not in dribs and drabs), and authors tend to present things in a more sensible sequence than a strictly traditional textbook. Thus someone who finishes this course will have very strong reading skills and yet will have as solid an understanding of grammar and syntax as someone who has used an old-fashioned grammar-translation textbook like Wheelock.The premise of the course, which follows the life of the Roman poet Horace, is absolutely brilliant. We know a fair amount about the personal life of Horace through his Satires and Odes, and Horace lived through (and was even an active participant in) some of the most interesting events in Roman history. Hence, the entire course breaths Roman history. Also, the Latin of the narrative passages -- almost from the very beginning -- feels like real Latin (much more so than almost any beginning Latin book), and at times can be quite lovely. Book III (the last third of course that presents basic Latin grammar and syntax) introduces extended excerpts from the poetry of Horace and Vergil. This is a bit of a stretch for the beginner, but it's well worth the effort. Someone who has completed this course, unlike most other textbook, will have had some significant contact with the grandeur of Roman literature.The Reader (the fourth book in the series) is a bit of a stretch for beginning students. There are no long marks (though an argument can be made that this is a good time to dispense with them), and the selection of authors, on whole, is a bit tough (Caesar being by far the easiest). An easier author like Eutropius or Nepos might have been a good addition to this reader (of course, it could be supplemented withWar with Hannibal: Authentic Latin Prose for the Beginning StudentorCornelius Nepos: Three Lives -- Alcibiades, Dion, Atticus, or the like). On the other hand, perhaps the students' exposure to Horace and Vergil in Book III prepares them for the tougher literature.There is also a very good teacher's manual that gives both historical background to each chapter (remember this course is absolutely saturated with Roman history!) as well as a full answer key to the exercises and reading passages.

Chapters Five through Eleven describe those elements of the law enforcement profession that cause stress, low morale, and eventual job burnout. Helpful methods of surviving the stress and trauma of police duties are offered. This information is not only directed toward prospective officers, it is also invaluable for experienced officers. The book will never be outdated. Similar requirements and problems that exist for cops today, existed in the 1960s, and will continue to be relevant for generations to come.

He demolishes many theories of modern finance by showing their impossible contradictions, and replaces them with an elegant theory which explains so much of what is happening: the significance of Bretton Woods, the new role of the IMF, the cause of the Asian currency crisis, LTCM, and the dot-bomb, and the massive credit bubble that continues to build.Until I read this book, I never really understood what globalization actually is, or why many governments are so fixated on fighting inflation (rather than other issues like unemployment), or why the Fed is keeping interest rates so low.The world makes a lot more sense now.A word of warning: Saber comes across as an iconoclast, delighting in destroying dearly-held (but ultimately flawed) theories of modern finance. If you spent years acquiring a knowledge of modern finance, you may be dismayed to learn how much your professors led you astray."},{"Title":"Speculative Capital","review":"Nasser Saber does well to explain the fine details of speculative forces. Chapter four, on Arbitrage and the South Eastern monetary crisis is especially well written."},{"Title":"Speculative Capital","review":"This is, at bottom, an attempt to work out a Marxist interpretation of Black-Scholes. Black-Scholes gets the numbers right, and so can't be written off as 'wrong' in any predictive sense.Yet it certainly wasn't the work of Marxists or anyone working from their premises, so for some one who is, the work must have been wrong in some sense.This is the situation Nasser Saber seeks to address. He does so with some ingenuity, but those of us who don't share the premises need not follow the windings of their application.Here's a very short course, though. He doesn't believe in \\"time preference,\\" i.e. the idea that even aside from the interest of risk we prefer a dollar today to a dollar tomorrow, and have to be bribed to wait a day for our dollar. That bribe is known to mainstream economics as the risk-free interest rate, and it is crucial to the reasoning that led to Black-Scholes.Mr. Saber, though, treats interest rates as the arbitrary edict of banks, under the direction of a central bank. He claims that the mainstream theory would require is to believe that when \\"in 1998 and then again in early 1999, the Bank of Japan pushed the interest rates to zero, it did so because 120 million Japanese had lost their time preference.\\"That's wrong, though, What such economists might say, rather, is that the Japanese continued to have a time preference, so there continued to be a risk-free interest rate, expressible in positive numbers, but that the Bank lent money at below this rate, at zero, in hopes of jump-starting a stalled economy. Gravity didn't disappear--the bank simply sought to create a hot air balloon to negate, if only briefly, its effects on certain masses."},{"Title":"Union With God: Including 22 of Madam Guyon's Poems (Library of Spiritual Classics)","review":"For those of you who desire a oneness with Jesus, this is a must-read.

But where my heart really goes is intuitively and blindly and recklessly abandoning myself to His guidance. Guyon validates those of us who end up feeling like we are going backwards when really God is taking us truly forward in leaps and bounds.

The joys include - being freed from outward distractions to gaze constantly at our Saviour. The pains comprise - the unavoidable denial of self, worked by His dispensing the cross in our lives. As she says: \\"The cross you encounter is not a cross which you will choose, but a cross which you receive by His sovereignty over your life.\\"In other words, not a self-inflicted cross, which would lead us to pride, but a submission under the cross He's destined for us.True, there is much in this book which can be difficult to grasp. Therefore I recommend to lay a foundation with the first two books in this series (Experiencing the Depths of Jesus Christ and Practicing His Presence). I personally read the first two books about six times in total, and each time my hunger for a more qualitative experience with Jesus was awaken. This third book cannot be digested as it could be without the foretaste presented in these two books.

In this book, Madame Guyon speaks to Christians about contemplative prayer and its various stages, including its advanced development.

She was imprisoned from 1695 to 1703 after publishingThe Song of Songs: CommentaryandExperiencing the Depths of Jesus Christ (Library of Spiritual Classics, Volume 2); she wrote an autobiography (Madame Guyon) while in prison. She then went to live with her son, and spent her remaining years writing poetry and avoiding controversy. Ironically, though she never had any intention of separating herself from the Catholic Church, her warmest admirers today are found among Protestants.She admits, \\"True, the way of faith is not as self-gratifying nor as exciting as the way of intellectual illumination. In fact, the way of faith is sometimes very dry. Your thoughts wander far more and have nothing to fix them.\\" (Pg. 23) Later, she adds, \\"as the enjoyment of the Lord deepens, it also becomes less perceptible... The trials which a Christian might expect to encounter at this point in his spiritual growth are trials of alternating dryness and enjoyment.\\" (Pg. 26-27)She suggests, \\"When you are engaged in action and devotion, however simple they may be, you are also putting into action some outward, undesirable habits of the soul. Therefore, turn inward.\\" (Pg. 34) She reveals, \\"These little traces of God's grace, when revealed to my heart, have often overwhelmed me with ecstasy.\\" (Pg. 46) She observes, \\"That believer who thinks he is attached to nothing is actually bound by a thousand things unknown to himself.\\" (Pg. 56)She concludes, \\"I am giving you here only a general sketch, an outline, of what it is you may wish to know about what awaits the pilgrim in his future journey.

She deals with the very worst of sin, but within the context of God's redemptive solution. I also appreciate her listing of Scriptural references (on pages other than in the story) to give the reader the option to verify her Biblical accuracy, and to have an easy way to study those passages.

Only caution I have are to the new believers to wait awhile or just trust that God can be trusted for He loves you. There's lots of scripture twisting by one of the characters and shocking occult descriptions throughout.

Each character goes through some burden testing his/her faith. Some see the light, some fall to darkness.The most important thing that the writer wanted to represent is the fact that some people are false witnesses. They twist words from the scripture and apply them to satisfy their wants which could be greed, a longing for suffering of others to show their own limitation of power, or deprivation of humanity.The author in this book bestows conflicts upon conflicts upon her characters. She raises questions in a reader that it's hard to put the book down. It will captivate you from the beginning to the end.Also, people who look for romance might be leading to the next book of the series to see if a girl who was taken to Joshua's house will captivate his heart. Will the book unravel many unanswered questions?It was a really good read that I've lost myself in it. The tone slightly felt childish due to being too close to the characters and a very fast pace. So much has happened in 320 pages."},{"Title":"Faith of My Fathers (Chronicles of the Kings #4)","review":"This book was great. All 5 of them are excellent.

The author takes an Old Testament story and brings to life the events and people who shaped them. We wonder sometimes how people can act the way they do or why their lesson wasn't learned. In this series, it takes you down the path they walked and shows you how easy it is to get trapped into personal compromises.

I found myself continously resisting the temptation to open my Bible to II Kings or II Chronicles to find out the end of the story.

Lynn Austin's books, Chronicles of the Kings were different. Once I discovered them, I read one after another as quickly as I could. I just finished Faith of our Fathers, and will soon begin #5. Lynn Austin brings the Bible stories to life in an exciting and griping way. Well written and very thought provoking, they illustrate the power of God and the influence of evil in humanity. It's an age old battle that has not changed over the centuries."},{"Title":"Faith of My Fathers (Chronicles of the Kings #4)","review":"Faith of my Fathers is the 4th book in Lynn Austin's Chronicles of the Kings series. After King Hezekiah's death, his son Mannasseh becomes king at age 12. Fear grips Mannasseh's heart as he begins to question God as to why his father died when he faithfully served God. Years later, as he goes to visit his mother's grave in the cemetry he comes upon a man who calls himself a \\"priest\\" and begins to accuse everything Mannasseh has grown up with and had been taught. The accussations make Mannessah call upon the prophet Isaiah and his palace adminstrator Eliakim--Mannessah's boyhood friend Joshua's father. During their conforntation King Mannessah accuses Eliakim and Isaiah of conspiring aganist him, using Isaiah's own prophecies aganist him. Eventually Eliakim and Isaiah are executed leaving Eliakim's family in great danger. Joshua and Mannasseh, once best friends have become bitter rivals. Joshua must now find a way to flee Mannasseh's terror while keeping his family safe.I found this book to be the best out of the first four. And since they keep getting better and better I am guessing the fifth and last book to be more amazing! Lynn Austin does a wonderful job depciting the terror of Mannaseh's reign. He is simply insecure and believes everyone is plotting aganist him. Instead of turning to Yahweh he starts turning to the stars, mediums, etc. for answers. He even begins promoting orgies for worship and sets up Asherah poles and places for women to \\"offer\\" themselves to the idol goddess. I have never shed a tear in the first 3 books of this series but the beginning of the book when Eliakim and Isaiah were being falsely accussed and then executed drew a tear from me. It's amazing to see how even when confined to the darkness of a prison and facing death the next morning, these two men trusted God to the very end. I also found it exciting to read about Joshua's plans and such for smuggling himself and his family out of the country. Especially near the end he decides to smuggle the ark of the covenant and Mannasseh's brother--Prince Amariah to Eqypt.With a host of new characters and some old ones as well this is definatly worth the read. I'm looking forward to reading \\"Among the Gods\\" and hope Lynn Austin decides to write more biblical fiction in the future. :-)"},{"Title":"Faith of My Fathers (Chronicles of the Kings #4)","review":"I've been nothing less then impressed with this series since book #1. And after book #4, \\"Faith of My Fathers,\\" I'm still highly impressed. Taking the story of Manasseh, Lynn Austin seemingly took it, and split it into two parts. And she was quite clever with the delivery. Some might assume that this came to an abrupt ending, leaving the reader clueless. If you know your Bible, there's nothing clueless about it. This is what I'd call the II Kings version of the story. Yet in The Bible, Manasseh's story continues in II Chronicles. And it worked that way with a lot of the kings. In a lot of cases, most of the kings we read about in The Bible concerning The Northern and Southern Kingdoms were split into two different sections, II Kings, and II Chronicles. From Jehoshaphat, to Joash, to Amaziah, to Jotham, to Hezekiah, to Manasseh! ALL THESE KINGS and more were split up into the two sections. Ok, there's the Bible history lesson! What about this story? Read on!Ahaz, Manasseh's great-grandfather, was one of the most worthless kings in all of the history. And Manasseh wasn't too far behind him. He was the son of one of the greatest kings to ever reign, Hezekiah. If you don't know the whole story and read this, you'll wonder if anything good ever came out of Manasseh. Lynn Austin, being the author, and better yet, the voice of reason, gives Manasseh a reason to be bitter, and to do what he did. But Austin gives Manasseh a childhood friend in Joshua, who's as clumsy as an Ox! His nickname is Ox. But something happens. And from nicknames to nonsense, there is a reason that these two former best friends are now bitter enemies. King Manasseh is nothing but a master of disaster, and he raises hell throughout the land! He has people executed, and he destroys what he father put together. Joshua wants nothing more then to get even.If you're wondering if some of the things in this are extreme, they are indeed. What's worse, they really happened. But the good news is that certain people didn't forget the faith their fathers held so dear. I think that's where the title comes from. Because when times get so tough, the question is simple. Are we going to run to God, or run away from God? I'd personally suggest not running away from the great Yahweh! But I think when things get tough, you want to be a rebel just as much as Manasseh. But what do you do? Where do you turn? And for the record, by the time THIS story comes to a close, he still has a chip on his shoulder.But there is one final installment, and it happens to be \\"Among The Gods.\\" I think it should be pretty good. That's probably going to be Lynn Austin's II Chronicles part of this story. I already know the end, but I can't wait to read her novelization of it! She's a great storyteller. So far, I have yet to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Faith of My Fathers (Chronicles of the Kings #4)","review":"ms austin is the first female author i,ve ever read, but after reading this series on the kings of judah it's completely opened my mind to all writers;the only regret is she didn't continue on with more books in the series."},{"Title":"Faith of My Fathers (Chronicles of the Kings #4)","review":"This series makes Bible history come alive.

But Ms. Austin pulled it off, and I was intrigued. Her method of storytelling was an inspiration to go back and re-read the various books of the Old Testament.To be honest I did read all 5 of Lynn's books. I was engrossed with the first one and it was free. Amazon's marketing technique is a wonderful thing!"},{"Title":"Faith of My Fathers (Chronicles of the Kings #4)","review":"I loved the first three books in this series. I am giving the final two books a 3-star rating because I feel the story really lost steam. Both books will share this review because I felt exactly the same about both of them. The change in characters left me with no previous attachments. Because of that, by the 5th book, I didn't even care what happened to the annoying characters. Several of them I wanted to slap, and others I wanted to get lost in the wilderness.I enjoyed portions of the story but hated others. Honestly, there were moments I was moved to tears. There was excitement, bravery, and moments I couldn't put the book down. However, I really hated reading about King Manasseh's wickedness. A few times I wanted to throw the books out a window. I hated how easy King Manasseh got off. I wanted more from his suffering. I wanted true sorrow. I wanted to reach into the depths of his soul. I wanted his change to be something so tangible that I could feel it. If the author had given me that, I might have loved these as much the first. Additionally, I wanted more at the end. The ending did nothing to satisfy me. It was a \\"you have got to be kidding\\" moment!Zerah was a character to truly hate. However, I didn't need to read that he was cross-eyed a half dozen times. I hate redundancy. Tell me once, perhaps twice, but after that I am going to bristle every time. Additionally, disruption to the story's flow is guaranteed."},{"Title":"Faith of My Fathers (Chronicles of the Kings #4)","review":"I really love the way she intertwines Bible fact with fiction. Kept going back to my Bible to check facts. Although this was non-fiction it gave me a better understanding of the kings which was very boring to me before. Could hardly put the book down."},{"Title":"Faith of My Fathers (Chronicles of the Kings #4)","review":"Story Description:Constant companions in their youth, Manasseh, son of King Hezekiah, and Joshua, son of the palace administrator, have been primed for leadership of Judah.

Fearing a conspiracy, he lashes out at the leaders of his father's regime.As the mayhem of Manasseh's reign begins to unfold, Joshua and his family suffer devastating loss. The battle lines are drawn as Joshua seeks revenge against his boyhood friend. And with the future of god's faithful remnant at stake, Joshua struggles with whether to run from Yahweh...or to Him.My Review:Another wonderfully written novel by the very talented Lynn Austin. The Chronicles of the Kings series has been a magnificent read. I'm about to begin Book #5 which is the last in the series titled: Among the Gods."},{"Title":"Faith of My Fathers (Chronicles of the Kings #4)","review":"This series is absolutely fantastic, and I highly recommend reading every book in the series!
