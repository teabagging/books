Most of my students were not sociology majors, but most enjoyed the readings from this book. It is not a textbook! I suggest either covering more introductory and general material in lectures or pairing with a textbook and using the readings in this anthology to flesh out specific issues and topics in the study of family sociology. I found that it included topics, such as gay and lesbian parenting or absentee parenting, that were difficult to find in other readers. As another reviewer already touched on, I also appreciated the integration of race, gender, class and sexuality throughout the book, rather than a special chapter at the end of a general section on each topic. A few drawbacks: (1) I found that I had to supplement with outside readings for my section on abuse - the readings included were too specialized/not what I was looking for in this topic; (2) there were no readings with a more international or transnational focus; and (3) unlike, for example, Andrew Cherlin's reader, this one did not include samples of what conservative perspectives on family diversity and trends look like. Otherwise, I found this to be an excellent reader."},{"Title":"Shifting the Center: Understanding Contemporary Families","review":"I have used this book in my 200 level Sociology of Families courses.

This review refers to the 2005 hardcover from Creative Editions. This is a revised version, first published in 1998, this edition features a new translation of the full, unabridged text, more lyrical than some older translations, and quite faithful to the original Italian text. Also, this edition has several additional illustrations, and has been handsomely re-designed. Altogether, I find this to be my absolute favorite edition of Pinnocchio, and I even bought it again, to replace my much-loved earlier edition. I prefer the new translation to the older translation used before, and the addition of more illustrations and the re-design make this a superior edition.I first found this book in a thrift store, and the inscription indicated it was a misguided gift to a young child from his grand-parents... Don't make this mistake, this version of Pinocchio is definitely not intended for young children. Parents may want to look elsewhere if they are expecting a tame children's book. This is a sophisticated and somewhat graphically illustrated edition, and it is not the Disney-fied version of Pinocchio that many people expect. If you are unfamiliar with the differences between the original story, and the popular sanitized versions, you might be shocked at first. The story is actually very dark, brutal, & surreal, and the illustrations of, say, Pinocchio getting hung in a tree, are really too dark for very young children.That being said, I still whole-heartedly recommend this edition for older readers wanting an artistic and unexpurgated version of this incredible tale. This is one of the best modern translations of the text I've read, so I would recommend it to literature students and people interested in Italian folklore over most of the other versions available.The artwork is what drew me to this book when I first saw it. You simply must see these illustrations to appreciate them. The detailed, large-scale, and subtlely colored drawings are a moody and perfect accompaniment to this version of the text. I pick this book up often, just to look at the amazing pictures and re-read some of my favorite parts.Overall, I am thrilled with this revised edition of a book I already considered a classic among illustrated books. I recommend it to scholars of folklore, lovers of sophisticated illustrated books, and curious readers looking for a dark, surreal and wondrous book."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio ( Travel and Adventure Library for Young Folks )","review":"I grew up in Italy and this is the real Macoy. Every Italian grows up reading Collodi's masterpiece while looking at Attilio Mussino's illustrations. This is the Pinocchio we imagine. When I first saw Disney's Pinocchio, I was shocked! So cute and kind... there is nothing to learn from the Disney video. Collodi's Pinocchio, on the other hand, is a child who lacks every sense of altruism, who needs to be educated. Collodi wrote various children's books, always with a pedagogical intent.This is a book for parents to read with their children. It helps remind parents that an apple needn't be peeled, and it helps kids eat the apple with the peel. If you're having problems with your first grader, this is a pedagogical and fun book for all the family."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio ( Travel and Adventure Library for Young Folks )","review":"I own several copies of Pinocchio both English and Italian texts, and this is one of my favorite translations as Ms. Lucas takes great care with conveying the original intent of Collodi's story and characters -- (even down to the translated names used for the characters). I'm not sure what the previous reviewer was referencing, (it may be the review from the library school journal--which may have been an abridgement for grade-schoolers, no longer in print)(???). If you find a copy of this book, I'd recommend buying it. It has the full 36 chapters, the original illustrations by Mazzanti, and extensive notes at the end. A lot of care went into this project, better than most other unabridged translations currnently available."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio ( Travel and Adventure Library for Young Folks )","review":"Carolo Colloid is the pseudonym of Carlo Lorenzini (1826-1890), an Italian journalist whose translations of French fairy tales in the late 1870s became so popular that he wrote his own, \\"Le Avventure di Pinocchio\\" (The Adventures of Pinocchio) in 1881 which went on to become a children's classic around the world and in 1940 was the basis for the animated film by Walt Disney. Now a new edition of this magnificent and imaginative fairy tale has been superbly illustrated by Roberto Innocenti with intricate artwork of museum gallery quality. This is the original story that includes all of Pinocchio's travels including getting ambushed by vile assassins, strung up in a tree, drowned in the sea, nursed back to health by a beautiful blue-haired fairy, slaying a large serpent through laughter, chained up as a dog to catch thieving weasels, arrested for fighting with classmates, almost eaten by a ravenous fisherman, saving a great mastiff and being saved by the mastiff in return, morphing into a performing donkey, flying on the back of a pigeon, getting swallowed by a gigantic shark, saving Geppetto's life, and so much more that most readers will be completely unaware of if the only contact they've had with this sophisticated story is the Disney movie and the abbreviated children's picture book versions. This simply outstanding and enthusiastically recommended edition of The Adventures Of Pinocchio does full and complete justice to the wonder and storytelling skills that originally made the life and travails of a wooden puppet brought to life so universally beloved."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio ( Travel and Adventure Library for Young Folks )","review":"My children and I have just completed this book, with beautiful illustrations by Innocenti, as a read-aloud. I have never been acquainted with any Pinocchio other than the anemic, sanitized Disney versions reflected also in the Little Golden Books. The cautions by others to be careful with young children are worthy of consideration, for this book has terrors aplenty, both in words and illustrations, but I find both words and illustrations to be marvelous.I am beginning to \\"open the door\\" to the difficult realities of the world for my children, and find beautiful allegorical literature to be just the ticket. The illustrations are beautifully rendered, but some are also quite scarey. Frequently, a following page will have a small cameo of a detail from the full illustration of a preceding page which draws the attention to that moral heart of a complex picture. I prefer this introduction to the reality of wickedness in the world (in words and illustrations) to the soul-numbing introductions to wickedness rampant in television and movies which give no time for concern for reflection.Some of my favorite themes are emphasized also - the redeeming power of love and forgiveness, the association of both forgiveness AND repentance prior to the resolution of relationship, the surpassing value of wisdom and the often difficult trials that must come before the heart is ready to embrace it.I am especially struck by Pinocchio's occasional recounting of his adventures as the tale unfolds. In the beginning of the tale, his recounting is filled with blaring examples of falsehood and complete lack of self-examination or evaluation. Everything that happens to him is someone else's fault and there is little association of cause and event. As the tale unfolds, however, Pinocchio's self-examination increases in accuracy, and his self-examination also becomes more accurate.I think this allegorical tale has much value for young children, as does Hinds' Feet on High Places and The Pilgrim's Progress."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio ( Travel and Adventure Library for Young Folks )","review":"Collodi knew how mischievous children can be.He was one himself when he went to school in Flroence.In his later years,he was a school reforms official,and wrote many textbooks.He believed the best way to teach is by entertaining as well.This certainly shows in Pinocchio.The little Blockhead gets into all kinds of scrapes because he rushes into things with little consideration.Pinocchio is tricked by the Fox&amp;Cat, advised by the Talking-Cricket,helped by the Fairy with Blue Hair-and ultimately realizes that if he wants to become a real boy,his inner self must be transformed first.The final chapter is a true indication of how Pinocchio has fully become a son to Gepetto.Collodi's story has many film-television-stage versions,but the original is a true classic."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio ( Travel and Adventure Library for Young Folks )","review":"!!WOW!!

The older editions are much better."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio ( Travel and Adventure Library for Young Folks )","review":"This review is for the hardcover, Illustrated Junior Library edition, ISBN 0448060019, translated by M. A. Murray and illustrated by Fritz Kredel, and published by Grosset and Dunlap. Since Amazon elects to combine the reviews of several different versions of 'Pinocchio' under each of the product pages, it is sometimes difficult to tell exactly which version goes with which review. To the best of my knowledge, this version is not abridged nor edited, and was first published in 1946.Well, here's another read-aloud-before-bedtime book, though truth be told, it didn't rise to the same level as some of our other attempts. I enjoyed reading it, with its variety of characters, which gives me an opportunity to indulge in some limited stagecraft, but I think my daughter was only semi-enthusiastic. She seemed to respond well to some passages, though some others were surely a little beyond her.(She's almost nine)'Pinocchio', as translated here, should not glibly be assumed to be suitable for all ages - some children may be bothered by its images, such as when Pinnocchio is hanged by the Fox and Cat, or when the puppets friend, Candlewick, after being transformed into a donkey, is literally worked to death. Other times, the writing is geared more toward an adult's understanding, and the humor is a trifle more complex than what I would assume most young children are capable of - several scenes were clearly over my daughter's head. I don't want to scare anyone away - I never thought there was anything inappropriate in the book for us, but everyone has different opinions on that matter. If you feel your children are especially sensitive, you may want to preview beforehand, and then make your own judgment.Still, 'Pinocchio' has many things going for it. The movie follows the high points of storyline fairly well - if you've seen it then you know the basic plot here as well - but the difference is how it reflects its times as opposed to the sanitized film sixty years later. Carlo Collodi's version may be a little too gritty for some parents - unless they are ready to explore more textured worlds with their kids - but it still toes a moral line. And I believe the exposure to the oddness of Pinocchio's world - which would have been fantastic, but not odd in Collodi's time - is enriching in our too-homogeneous world.Well worthwhile, but like many classics, it is a product of its time. Some respond better than others to that - for my daughter, it ended up as an 'I like it' rather than 'I love it'.A quick note on the edition: This is a very nice book for a youngster, sturdy, and with slightly larger print than usual. That last fact is also nice for an oldster like me. The illustrations by Kredel are mostly black-and-white, studded throughout the text, with a few full color plates taking up an entire page. Without other translations to compare it to, I can only say that I didn't notice anything that sounded too peculiar, other than a decision to translate the puppet theater owner's name from Mangiafuoco to the literal Fire Eater. Altogether an attractive addition for a child's bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio ( Travel and Adventure Library for Young Folks )","review":"Pinocchio is one of the most beloved and recognizable of all children stories characters. The story of Pinocchio, written by Carol Collodi and originally published in 1881, has been published, republished, retold, and adapted countless times over the last 130 years.

It is nonetheless always instructive and worthwhile to go to the original story because, in my opinion, most attempts to \\"improve\\" any given story inevitably end up subtracting rather than adding to its value.This is an inexpensive, short and very readable edition of the Pinocchio story. It is an excellent opportunity for anyone to get reacquainted with this talking marionette, and an even better chance for all those who have never read or seen the story in the first place. The original story is much more colorful, but also darker, than the more recent adaptations. Pinocchio, Geppetto and other characters often get into physical confrontations.

This is the French fairytale that I read first, the book that was handed down to me from my Grandparents and given as a gift to them by a family friend; the illustrator Charles Mozley- who knew my Grandparents intimately. The personal description from (as my mother called him \`Uncle Charles') was touching, and the stunning hand drawn illustrations, add that real special element that makes this book so unique.*unlike the first edition that is listed on Amazon, the copy that I own is the first one made and hand-illustrated by the artist before being put into print*The tale is about love, friendship, loyalty and honesty and which certainly is memorable as to remain with you throughout childhood and into adulthood with its clear message. Heartwarming, affecting and so powerful this emotive narrative will have you in tears, as you experience such a rollercoaster of events within this compelling read. The love between flesh and blood, father and son is quite remarkable and like most family's it is something that can never be quite equaled to. Nor is the value of knowing right from wrong and understanding the importance of selflessness, thoughtfulness and how in life one should put others first. At times this book I found scary as a young child (around 5 yrs old when my mother first read it to me at bedtime), especially when the young boys who were corrupted were transformed into Donkey's! It is a journey of a lifetime, a character-driven tale with some distinctive characters (i.e. Cricket), dramatic and full of intensity that has you glued to the pages - this is something truly astonishing and heartwarming.Pinocchio is a young boy and whose egotistical mannerisms and lying, has the most severe consequences; such as being turned into wood and his nose growing longer and longer... His father loves his son so much and only wishes that he could become flesh and blood again, but for this to transpire Pinocchio must learn to be a good boy. As he leaves home and embarks on the most extraordinary, horrendous and unexpected of adventures where he almost looses his life this young boy takes note of the depths of his father's kind heart and the power of love.This particular edition, 1959, is so special and which is something that shall remain within my family for generations to come. Complete with such stunning illustrations by an artist who was a close friend of my Grandparents (who were also well-known artists themselves), this is something to treasure and which one cannot compare to the printed, contemporary editions of today. The story is something quite unforgettable and outstanding, that which is loved by generations both young and old and which reminds all of us the important things in life. I would recommend this as a first book to read to your children, to your nieces and nephews and for your own personal pleasure...For when you wish upon a star, dreams really DO come true!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio ( Travel and Adventure Library for Young Folks )","review":"No other Pinocchio would do for my six year-old grandson, who hung on the conclusion of each chapter like his life depended on it. I bought him a paperback edition to take home with him until I could order this version, illustrated by Roberto Innocenti, so he could have his own copy of the one I was reading to him.My grandson agonized over Pinocchio's conflicts between his sincere desire to be good and his stray impulses. Whoknew the tale of a little woodenhead becoming a real boy could be such a cliffhanger! Innocenti's illustrations are outstanding."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio ( Travel and Adventure Library for Young Folks )","review":"Pinocchio is a classic story, and a very different one than the saccharine Disney version most Americans are familiar with. Carlo Collodi's 1882 book lays out the story of a wooden puppet come to awkward life, who proceeds to act out on every selfish, crude and obnoxious impulse ever known to childhood. Each bad decision brings sorrow to his \\"father\\" Gepetto and his \\"mother\\" the Blue Fairy, and brings a terrifying consequence to the puppet -- in the course of the book his feet are burned off, he nearly starves, he is attacked by robbers, he is sent to prison, he's nearly fried as a fish, and he's transformed into a donkey to be sold for money.With each consequence, his penitence for foolish behavior is more real. At the beginning of the book he's the kind of child who sells his schoolbook, purchased by his father's sacrifice of his winter coat, to go to a marionette show. By the end of the story, Pinocchio is the kind of boy who leaps into the sea, risking his life to save his father from a monstrous fish. This gradual transformation culminates in Pinocchio dreaming one night that the Blue Fairy comes to him saying,In return for your good heart, I forgive you all your past misdeeds. Children who love their parents, and help them when they are sick and poor, are worthy of praise and love, even if they are not models of obedience and good behavior. Be good in future, and you will be happy.He wakes in the morning to find that he has become a real boy, with the old wooden puppet limp in the corner.This wasn't originally a children's story, but it is a story about childhood and the taming of childish, reckless impulses. It's a deeply moral tale, often reiterating the importance of working hard, being responsible, and telling the truth. It may open up a discussion about what it means to be a slave to sinful impulses (Romans 6:16-18; Romans 7:21-24), and it confirms the Biblical teaching that \\"folly is bound up in the heart of a child\\" (Proverbs 22:15).It isn't, however, a Christian story, and it lacks the Christian quality of grace which transforms undeserving sinners. The moralism is sometimes quite heavy-handed, and penalties for disobedience are often gruesome. Pinocchio's redemption ultimately comes, not from a power outside himself, but from his own resolve to change when he sees the consequences of his behavior for himself and others. Because of this moral self-reliance, this story may not be a good match for children who are prone to self-righteousness.If you do decide to go with Pinocchio, please avoid the many uninteresting illustrated versions available, and check out Roberto Innocenti's rendition. His surreal, dramatic, and often funny pictures perfectly complement Collodi's vivid style."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio ( Travel and Adventure Library for Young Folks )","review":"I had this same book as a child and am so happy to have my childhood memories back again.

It's worth every penny spent, to me. The illustrations are priceless!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio ( Travel and Adventure Library for Young Folks )","review":"Most everyone is generally familiar with the story of Pinocchio, although this familiarity is usually the result of the Walt Disney animated film. Actually, the movie does a reasonably good job of following the book, although it leaves a lot out and makes quite a few changes. A master carpenter named Anthony, whom everyone calls Maestro Cherry, comes across a piece of magic wood. He gives it to his friend Geppetto, a puppeteer who fashions a puppet whom he names Pinocchio. The puppet immediately runs off. Geppetto chases him and is put in jail when he tries to punish his wayward puppet. When Pinocchio returns home, the Talking Cricket tries to warn him about the error of his ways, but he kills it with a hammer, though it reappears two or three times later as a ghost.Geppetto gets out of jail, but instead of going to school Pinocchio wanders off again to see a puppet show and is taken by the puppeteer Swallowfire who eventually releases him and sends him back to Geppetto with five coins. However, Pinocchio meets the Fox and the Cat, who talk him into going to the Field of Miracles in the land of Boobies where they tell him he can plant his five coins and they will grow into thousands. The two swindle him out of one coin for dinner and then leave him at an inn. When Pinocchio goes out to find them, they disguise themselves, try to rob him, and eventually hang him. He is saved by a little girl who turns out to be \\"the fairy with the blue hair.\\" She invites him to live with her and even sends for Geppetto, but he follows the Fox and Cat again and loses his coins to them. Later, after several other adventures, he returns to find that the little girl has died and shortly after that learns that Geppetto went to sea in search of him and was lost, perhaps swallowed by the great shark (not Monstro the whale) swimming in that area. He even ends up with his friend Candle-Wick in \\"The Land of Toys\\" and turns into a donkey. Will Pinocchio ever make it home? Will he find his Papa? Will he see the Blue Fairy again?It appears that Collodi, penname for Carlo Lorenzini, originally had not intended the novel as children's literature. However, the first fifteen chapters, at the unhappy ending of which Pinocchio dies a gruesome death by hanging, were serialized in a children's magazine between 1881 and 1883. At the request of his editor, Collodi added chapters 16-36, in which the Fairy rescues Pinocchio and eventually transforms him into a real boy. The entire story then was published as a book for children in February, 1883. Thus, it allegorically deals with some serious themes but in the end Pinocchio acquires a deeper understanding of himself, making the story suitable for children. The original English translation was made in 1892 by Mary E. Murray and is used in the Penguin Classics edition (2002). The Puffin Classics edition (1996) uses a translation by E. Harden. New York Review Books published a new translation in 2008 by Geoffrey Brock. The Oxford University Press edition that I bought has \\"an authoritative new translation\\" by Ann Lawson Lucas. I suppose that Lucas's translation is all right, but instead of leaving Gepetto's name as it is, she translates it as \\"Old Joe.\\" Personally, I think that I would have rather read Murray's translation. All in all, I enjoyed reading the book. Though a little grim at times, it does teach some important lessons."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio ( Travel and Adventure Library for Young Folks )","review":"This is a classic and deserves to be on everyone's book shelf, young and old. Carlo Collodi wrote the Pinnochio story in 1881 and in book form in 1883. Over the 127 years since then there have been many versions published with several different illustrators but to me the best is the original, illustrated by Attilo Mussino. His 300 color illustrations are wonderful depictions of Italy of that time. He goes beyond mere illustrations. It's art! The Adventures of Pinnochio was published in the U.S. in 1925. There have been several reissues since. I missed out on a 1928 copy of this book at an auction but was so impressed with the contents I looked for it on Amazon and was fortunate to find a seller offering a 1989 hardcover at a good price and in like new condition!

Slowly they will crumble (or be vandalised) and eventually just be a pile of wood, plaster and rusty metal of the kitchen appliances. Oddly, the weather preserves and destroys these poignant remains, the scorching summer sun preserves but once the elements get inside, the wind, rain and heavy snowfalls gradually weaken the structure and the less well made will eventually collapse.The seventy photos are all interiors, mostly homes but also schools and amazingly a bar in Gascoyne, North Dakota. The first was taken in 1991 and the latest 2001, one of these, a bedroom in Grassy Butte, North Dakota, only recently abandoned but looks like it could still be occupied because the elements and creatures haven't taken over yet. Many of these homes seem to have been vandalised, nature is clearly not so untidy as humans. Several reveal building techniques, with their floorboards and plasterwork ripped away. Strangely many of these left homes still contain the personal effects of the folks who lived in them.Fitch wisely concentrates on the interesting interiors, making his photos a record as well as interesting compositions. Most other photographers tend to capture abandonment in relation to the wider landscape, capturing hard edge man-made decay resting in the natural softness of the outside. Another book I recently reviewed, the excellentGhosts in the Wilderness: Abandoned Americaby Tony and Eva Worobiec, covers the same theme but their book had as many exterior landscape photos as interiors.Both books are full of stunning photographs (the Worobiec's is definitely the coffee table one) that capture a part of America that deserves recording before it slowly vanishes.***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover."},{"Title":"Gone: Photographs of Abandonment on the High Plains","review":"This photography captures places that have been abandoned in the High Plains of the American West. Even for those who live in the United States, there is so much more to this country that we rarely see. Steve Fitch finds these places, and shows us how beautiful they truly are. His photos remind me of music by the Band, essays by William Agee, and novels by Steinbeck, which transport us to places forgotten, yet full of memories. These memories are not nostalgic &quot;wishful thinking.&quot; They are honest reflections of the quiet spirit that resides in harsh reality. The thoughtful essay that accompanies the text is alone worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"Gone: Photographs of Abandonment on the High Plains","review":"Although I do not have this book, I just recently saw a collection of the same photos in an art museum at Kansas State University. They are so beautiful and yet so sad. Absolutely amazing though. I highly recommend Steve Fitch after seeing his work. If you're the kind of person who drives by an abandoned house and takes interest in it, wondering about the family and what happened to it, these photographs will amaze you."},{"Title":"Gone: Photographs of Abandonment on the High Plains","review":"Take equal parts Dusseldorf School large-format aesthetic, social consciousness, heart, and some Walker Evans and you have Steve Fitch's wonderful \\"Gone.\\" Very moving. Nacio Jan Brown, Berkeley CA"},{"Title":"Gone: Photographs of Abandonment on the High Plains","review":"Originally posted at my blog, antarcticiana (dot) blogspot (dot) com, I've cross posted most of my thoughts on this book here, because more people are likely to read it, and because this is a great book that deserves as much attention as it can get.Photography remains obsessed with time, and with the telling of stories. If a photograph cannot tell its own story and requires assistance, its use is restricted to illustration, to the role of assistant in some other kind of story, usually a written one. Hence one aspect of the inferiority complex that plagues the medium. This is why disuse, decay and collapse have always been fertile ground for photographers, because refuse and abandoned places are inhabited by the ghost images of their former owners. They carry the weight of time in their DNA, and a photograph of a rusting tool or a collapsing building implies a narrative. The house was built, and lived in--imagine all the things that went on here--and it slowly declined, became unlivable. Now it will gradually return to dust. The right photograph conveys all that.It may be that we are entering a particularly fertile time for this tendency in photography. Wandering through Lemon City in Miami a month ago (in October '08), it felt as if every other house was vacant. Foreclosed and abandoned, with locks punched out and sheriff's chains securing them, it was impossible not to imagine the ups and downs in the lives of the families who had once lived there.I first came to appreciate some of the possible relationships between narrative and photography in the work of Steve Fitch. At Princeton, where I studied, photography was taught by two people. Emmet Gowin taught black and white, and for decades brought into the classroom, with a zen-like combination of intensity and tranquility, his captivating and infectious lifelong quest for aesthetic purity. From him I learned that photography, and by extension artmaking in general, are simply tools for demonstrating a way of being in the world. The images resulting from his process were objects in their own right, to be valued and appreciated, and he resisted commenting on their implicit narratives, even when choosing, for example, to make a series of aerial images of strip mines. Color was taught by a rotating roster of invited guest artists, who came for one year, or perhaps two, and then went away again. Color photography was a different species, a different medium, really.While I was at school one of these transient color photographers appeared, with a stack of prints of campfires in the desert, his exquisite hand-made frames for cyanotype printing, and a disregard for archivism born out of his comprehension of time. Steve Fitch's capturing an entire night in front of the timeless bluffs of the southwest, on one very long exposure, was among other things a representation of man's inconsequentiality in the face of geologic eternity. (Maybe I'm projecting, but I must have come to understand this somewhere along the line). In any case, it seemed clear that worrying about whether a nice color print would still be around in a hundred years for others to look at was sort of beside the point.I hadn't thought of Steve Fitch in some time, until I went to Santa Fe last spring, and saw his book in a shop window. Gone: Photographs of Abandonment on the High Plains is a chronicle of the contemporary ghost town, or at least the ghost homestead. It's an archaeology of contemporary loss. As Evelyn Schlatter puts it in an introductory essay, the story of the West is \\"come and go, boom and bust.\\" The photographs in Gone are of the interiors of abandoned houses, churches and schools. He made the work in that great swath of chilly, windy plains, striping down through the country, border to border, from eastern Montana to west Texas. Fitch's narratives here are on a more human scale. In the contemporary economic climate, these images look like templates for the broader collapse dawning on us today.Fitch, however, has not abandoned geology. Some of the same stories, of an evanescent man passing in front of a campfire, are to be read in these pictures. The gutted couch, a flyswatter still hanging off the wall, a lonely piano: these suggest human stories of a different, happier time, but there is an architectural revelation here too, something that shares elements with Eduardo del Valle and Mirta G&oacute;mez's work in the Yucatan. Paint peels and reveals in its layers the many generations that inhabited these walls. One house appears to have been entirely constructed out of beer cans and straw. The crumbling adobe and the peeling masonite ceilings show us how these buildings were built. It's a cycle, the process of their erection revealed by their gradual collapse, and in these quite remarkable photographs the passage of time is marked by the radiating, tannic stains on the peeling wallpaper, the reversion of what once was a wall into a pile of mud, and by the accumulated height of a pile of swallow droppings on a kitchen counter."},{"Title":"Gone: Photographs of Abandonment on the High Plains","review":"I'm glad I got a good price on this book because frankly it was a bit of a letdown. There was more talk about the taking of the pictures in the earlier sections than there was actual pictures. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of pictures and very good ones, but somehow the book didn't give me the feeling of 'being there' at these abandoned places the way I'd hoped. For example, the book \\"Ghostly Ruins - America's Forgotten Architecture\\" really did a better job of that. I'd have a look at this book in person if possible before buying it. Maybe it's just what you want, maybe not. I'd have probably taken a pass."},{"Title":"Zee's Way (Orca Soundings)","review":"Zee is a man with a mission. He plans to win the war between him and his friends and the shopkeepers at the new mall. The shopkeepers think him and his friends are bad news just because they are teenagers and like to dress a bit differently than most people. Danny has blue hair, Horace has none, Benny's lip is pierced, Mike likes leather and studs, and who can live without a few tattoos, or ten? Zee's plan is to get the message out to these old curmudgeons. They will hear what he has to say about the injustice of their treatment towards Zee and the others, whether they want to or not. Since Zee is a painter, he decides to use his best method of communication to do this. He spray paints graffiti on the white wall of the hardware store. But each time he does this, Mr. Feniuk just paints over it again, and life continues on as if nothing has happened. Zee's dad makes a comment about how people who put graffiti on walls are a disgrace and have no real talent, so Zee decides to do something differently the next time he paints the wall, he paints a closed door. It's not just any door. It's a good door. It's a work of art. Mr. Feniuk must think so too because he doesn't paint over it. But when Zee pays a nighttime call upon the wall for the second night in a row, intent on changing the door so that the shopkeeper will not want it anymore, he gets caught. Feniuk makes him a deal, cover up the graffiti and paint the rest of the picture and he won't tell Zee's dad what he's been up to. Zee takes him up on the offer. After all, what other choice does he have? As Zee works on the mural he and Mr. Feniuk begin a tenuous understanding which \\"paints\\" the way for the rest of the shopkeepers and Zee's friends to learn trust and respect for each other's differences."},{"Title":"Zee's Way (Orca Soundings)","review":"The book was alright.

The author says he hopes the book will give readers insight into these systems and their impact on innocent citizens.The book begins on 9/11 and then picks up six weeks later when CIA agent Michael Stone is assigned to the FBI's Strategic Information Operations Center (SIOC) at the heart of the war on terror. On his first day, he receives a mysterious top-secret Echelon message and begins an investigation into a global money laundering operation and a possible terrorist threat.The book is informative, giving descriptions of SIOC, the Patriot Act, In-Q-Tel - a CIA-controlled venture capital firm - and the surveillance system which also serves as the title: Echelon. These are all real aspects of intelligence-gathering currently used by U.S. agencies, which compete for the upper hand in ongoing investigations.It is this basis in reality that makes the book so chilling. As one is reading, caught up in the story and the characters, it is hauntingly realistic and easy to imagine as headline news. Although none of us want to believe we will ever be caught up in the middle of such circumstances, there are far too many people in this world who have been personally touched by acts of terror and crime.While O'Neill writes in such a way that the technology is used to eavesdrop on potential terrorists and the people who have found themselves involved through no fault of their own, it is also easy to imagine this technology becoming an invasion of privacy, used by a power-hungry government to know far too much about its citizens. O'Neill points out the usefulness of the technology when it is utilized in a purposeful investigation by honest law enforcement personnel who have decent motivations to do their job. The debate continues into where these organizations need to draw the line and it is one which should not be ignored."},{"Title":"Echelon, Somebody's Listening","review":"Echelon, Somebody's Listening, by Jack O'Neill,is a gripping and timely story dealing with how our various governmental agencies receive and process covert information, and the red tape that can hamper them.

I'll give you three reasons:1. It's Factual fiction. Clearly Jack O'Neill is not only a gifted writer, but knows his subject. And the facts about which \\"Echelon\\" is based are things every informed American must know.2. Energy. This book, unlike most books, is not just a pile of words, but a gripping story so well-written that you'll likely call in sick to work to find out what happens to Michael Stone next.3. This will be a movie. There's no doubt about it. Jack O'Neill's writing is that good.

I picked it up because I am interested about government eavesdropping: echelon, carnivore Magic Lantern, Rapid Start. However, there are too many unnecessary scenes and dialogues (such that in Chapter 14) that took away from what could have been a very good story; too many characters that I didn't care about; too many names to remember. I got to know Carolyn and Janet more than I would like and I thought they are behaving like little girls. Sarah's behavior, the wife of Michael Stone (the main character) just makes me mad. I wish she has more compassion and trust to her CIA husband. Again, this story has a very good and promising plot.

The characters are visual and \\"real\\", especially the disarming Nichole and Freddie. The CIA-FBI antagonism is real. Global eavesdropping is chillingly real and everyone is doing it.

Michael Stone, a CIA agent working at the FBI, uses Echelon intercepts and other electronic surveillance techniques to detect and track criminal, and possibly terrorist, activities. O'Neill's book puts us in touch with the real world of eavesdropping that surrounds everyone, and explains how its all done. The characters are vivid and intriguing, especially two women, Janet and Carolyn, who become ensnarled in the eavesdropping world. It makes you wonder: Is somebody listening to you?

But, as a former big city police officer, federal agent, and intelligence officer, I found that his story so perfectly captures the environment of real life law enforcement efforts that he might have served with me on some of the same joint task forces. Resarch alone could not provide the insights and details of the fast moving, hard hitting, and exciting story. And, with all the current news on the subject, his timing of the theme of eavesdropping couldn't be better. Most of all, Jack is a born story teller and his book has the depth and breadth of a good film.I particularly related to the interaction between Detective Taro Okada and FBI agent Alan Dickie on page 143. As a former drug agent, I worked a case jointly with the US Customs. My partner sketched a raging bull as I \\"educated\\" my Customs counterpart on how things should be done in a cooperative and honest manner. My words at the time were almost exactly like those of Okada-specifically the \\"Listen you son-of-a-bitch.....\\" While that case also involved a large sailboat, unfortunately we didn't encounter any naked women."},{"Title":"Echelon, Somebody's Listening","review":"Echelon: Somebody's ListeningJack O'NeillThis fast-paced novel is told with an insider's eye to detail. Its depiction of inter-agency wrangling within the U.S. Government rings true to anyone who has witnessed the petty bickering that sometimes interferes in tracking down bad guys and putting them behind bars or eliminating the mischief they inflict on the country. By illuminating this dangerous predilection within our Government, Jack O'Neill has served a public good. The fact that the book is entertaining as well makes it a worthy addition to anyone's summer reading list.The book's appearance is timely. With some members of the public expressing concerns about privacy rights and the ability of federal agency to eavesdrop on the conversations of U.S. citizens, Jack O'Neill helps focus on the safeguards in place to protect those privacy rights. At the same time, he details the technical ability of the Government to monitor, track, translate, and detect relevant conversations from among the hundreds of thousands of phone calls and internet conversations that take place daily.The story tells the story of Michael Stone, a CIA agent on loan to an FBI intelligence-gathering center in downtown Washington, D.C. O'Neill depicts the hard work that hundreds of U.S. Government employees engage in daily in pursuing threats to our security. In this case, Stone manages to come upon an international money-laundering scheme that uses the illicit gains from drug-trafficking. He uses his analytical skills - and the serendipitous luck that often marks breakthroughs - to put the pieces together and ultimately bring down the miscreants.In the course of telling the story, O'Neill illuminates the strains on Michael Stone's marriage that his pursuit of the bad guys inflicts. Dedicated civil servants, Foreign Service Officers, intelligence officers, military service members and others routinely pursue the national interest at a cost to their personal lives and that story is seldom told. O'Neill serves the public good by spotlighting this aspect of public service.O'Neill provides wonderful detail to the story and the inner-workings of intelligence gathering and electronic eavesdropping as only a veteran of the business can. The language that he uses to tell the story is vivid and the tale itself is well constructed.In short, Echelon is a great read. I, for one, look forward to the further adventures of agent Michael Stone."},{"Title":"Echelon, Somebody's Listening","review":"I was given this book by a U.S. Naval Academy classmate who knows the author personally. I could not put it down. In fact, I was reading a book for Lenten bible study at the time and totally put it aside to read Echelon cover-to-cover in a matter of days. It is extremely timely, considering all the controversey over tapping phone lines and warrants and such related to the Patriot's Act. It showed in spades why it is so important for agencies to cooperate, and why they need unfettered access to sources, without having to waste time getting warrants before they can follow a path. The book is spell-binding as the author paints vivid pictures of characters and then moves from one to another in rapid-fire style. You won't be bored reading this incredibly interesting book. It is a glimpse into the world of cyber intrigue and the author clearly knows all about it. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Echelon, Somebody's Listening","review":"I bought this book because Amazon 'suggested' I would like it after looking up Daemon by Leinad Zeraus. As an aside, Daemon is a great/highly entertaining book. This however is not. I am half way through and am forcing myself to swallow the medicine to finish. I may not. The characters are two dimensional/cookie cutters that could be found left on the floors of a choose your own adventure chop shop. The plot had promise, but too many boring character background deviations have pulled away from what seemed interesting - the government's abilities, technologies, and abuses with eavesdropping of any kind. That is sadly a sidenote to a high school level writing exercise. I may be a bit harsh - if I had picked this up out of the blue, it would probably have gotten 3 stars.

I bought the book thinking it would tell me about Echelon, the ambitious signals intelligent program that sucks up virtually all electronic communications in the world. But the book only hints at that. The rest of the time it's one chase scene after another. I got two-thirds of the way through the book and tossed it.

Hert"},{"Title":"The Wright Brothers: A Biography (Dover Transportation)","review":"Kelly wrote the \\"official\\" story, as \\"authorized\\" and sanitized by Orville Wright, of the brothers' Wright. As a devotee of the Wrights, it is unfortunate that Kelly filled his book with deficiencies and erroneous claims made on Orville's behalf. A careful reading of the entire Wright papers and material still unpublished, reveals that Wilbur was the \\"brains\\" behind the discovery of flight; it was Orville who added his mechanical expertise in the building of the flyer. It is so unfortunate that so much that continues to be written about the Wrights is merely a reshuffling of old facts and surmises, with the result of a perpetuation of errors and distortions.It was John R. McMahon who told the real story based on his revision of an original manuscript by Earl Findley. Orville had turned to Findley to write the biography; but it was too near the truth; too personal; and he nixed it.But the truth came out, when McMahon wrote a series of articles on the Wright Brothers in \\"Popular Science,\\" January 1929. When he came to write his book, still based on the Finley manuscript, Orville protested and was able to get several passages, on threat of court action, changed in the book. For example, Orville didn't want the years Wilbur spent at home as an invalid, revealed. Orville also has himself elevated above Wilbur, as the creative driving force in the airplane's invention.If you want to investigate the real story, take the Kelly book with a grain of salt, and read instead, John Evangelist Walsh' \\"One Day at Kitty Hawk,\\" published by Thomas Y. Crowell Company, 1975. Even better, wouldn't it be good to have the unpublished Finley manuscript published, instead of suppressed.But don't look for the Walsh book at the Wright Brothers Memorial National Park Service Visitor's Center. In a recent interview with a National Park Service Ranger there, he told me the Park Service regularly reviews all books before being put on sale in their facility, and the Walsh book was not one they would put out for sale. After I explained to him my credentials, he freely admitted that the information in the Kelly book was Orville's attempt to \\"re-write\\" history. But he stated that the Park Service didn't want to ruffle feathers of Wright family members, by putting out the more correct John Walsh biography, which he admitted, was more accurate.I had always wondered why Orville, the more out-going of the two, would, in later life, say very little...he refused to give speeches, interviews, and said next to nothing at celebrations in honor of the Brothers.Kelly, to say the least, gives less paragraph space to Wilbur's achievements, and more events of consequence, in numbers of paragraphs, to Orville. There are so many myths perpetuated by the Kelly book, too numerous to enumerate here in this review. I have heard Park Rangers at the Wright Brothers Memorial in Kitty Hawk, still repeating them as fact. Suffice to say, if the reader will look at the Walsh book, one will find the myths revealed in a conclusive way."},{"Title":"The Wright Brothers: A Biography (Dover Transportation)","review":"Fred Kelly has written the definitive biography of the Wright Brothers, with special emphasis on the 10 years after the first flight. During this time, the brothers worked diligently to explain the benefits of aviation to an unbelieving public and uninterested leaders of military and commercial concerns.Kelly starts at the beginning, with tales of the brothers as young children and schoolboys, ultimately moving into the world of commerce as circus impressarios, printers, and bicycle builders and repairmen.By the late 1890's they had selected aviation as a hobby, and started their annual pilgrimages to Kitty Hawk for several months each year to perform experiments. Only after 4 or 5 years of gliding and kite flying, was manned flight considered. By working long hours in the bicycle shop and minimizing all expenses, they were able to pursue this unusual hobby for several weeks each fall.The obstacles were legendary, but the brothers persevered, usually by arguing (in a friendly way) between themselves, then reading every book on the subject in the Dayton public library, and then, developing new theories and experimental methods. In this way, they broke new ground in fluid dynamics, control and stability, motor construction, and propeller design. For example, they discovered that published tables of data on wind dynamics were wrong, so they built a wind tunnel to generate better data. The brothers had a unique ability to solve problems by applying a sound scientific approach and by going about it in an honest midwestern approach.Those of us who were at the centennial did not hear the story of how little publicity the 1903 flight received. The press and public were either unbelieving, or unable to distinguish between flying dirigibles and heavier than air self propelled planes. Only after several public demonstrations with flights exceeding one hour did the popular press come to understand the importance of this development.Kelly's book is unique in its access to Orville Wright, as they were old friends and Kelly consulted extensively with him, writing this book in the 1940's. After Wilbur died, Orville focused on building the various Wright companies around the world, fighting patent infringement suits (including Curtis), and endless battles with the Smithsonian Institute.The Smithsonian story is told here in great detail, as Orville still sought for the historical record to reflect his view, now universally accepted. The Langely plane (Langely was the director of the Smithsonian) never flew; in fact, it crashed several times in the Potomac in 1902-03, and had obvious design flaws.Amazingly, Glen Curtis was allowed to attempt experiments years later with the Langely plane, while he had litigation pending over the Wright patents. Curtis made major modifications to the plane, and got it to briefly fly, thus attempting to weaken the Wright patent claims. For years, the Smithsonian stubbornly insisted that the Langely plane was historically significant, and snubbed the Wright brothers, who retaliated by displaying their planes in other museums."},{"Title":"The Wright Brothers: A Biography (Dover Transportation)","review":"Fred Kelly did a wonderful job in bringing the story of the Wright Brothers to the public in this birgraphy. He starts us off by showing us the environment that the brothers grew up in and how the two had a curious and experimential nature about them. We are then shown the methods they had used in their experimentations for developing their flying machine. We can even feel the edge of competition as Samual Langly makes his attempt at manned powered flight only a day before the brothers and is met with failure.It has been 100 years since that magical day on the North Carolina Outter Banks, and Kelly manages to bring the experience back to us to relive. This is also an excellent book for children to read. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Wright Brothers: A Biography (Dover Transportation)","review":"A great little book. A must read for every airplane nut!! Wilbur and Orvill Wright show that common sense, Perseverance, and an unshaking belief in the scientific method overcame all obstacles to prove that man could fly while others with more funding and education failed completely. A true American Success Story"},{"Title":"The Wright Brothers: A Biography (Dover Transportation)","review":"Considering that Fred Kelly's biography was first published in 1943, the text has a surprisingly contemporary style and its underlying research is up to today's high biographical standards. There is little hint in the reading that the book is so dated. What will never get old is the fantastic story of the Wright Brothers.Kelly begins with a brief history of the brothers' childhood, with parents who nurtured creativity and the quest for knowledge. They were the kind of kids who were fascinated with how things worked. Their interest in flight began when their father bought them a small rubber-band-powered toy kite. That interest slowly grew to a sideline obsession as they matured and began earning a living with their Dayton bicycle shop. They gathered and studied everything they could on the science of flight, including the works of Langley, Chanute, and Lilienthal. This led to the construction of gliders capable of holding a human passenger, with which they began methodical testing to understand aerodynamics and the nature of pressure on wing surfaces. To accomplish this in more efficient manner they invented the world's first wind tunnel, and patented wing warping and ailerons.Eventually satisfied with their glider, the Wrights graduated to attempts at powered flight. When their motor didn't seem up to the task, they scratch-built their own. The culmination--after years of tinkering and learning--was the successful and historic flights at Kitty Hawk in 1903. The Wrights had ushered in a reasoned, scientific approach to the quest for man-flight. They had accomplished the impossible in virtual isolation, without financing or institutional support. They embody the can-do American ideal of independence and ingenuity.What is almost equally fascinating about their story is what Kelly chronicles after the 1903 flights. The patriotic Wrights immediately foresaw the military potential for the flying machine and wanted America to benefit from their invention. But in 1903 man-flight was considered impossible. It took four years to convince the War Department that they weren't crackpots. It was nearly five years before the general public caught on to their accomplishment. And after others, such as Glenn Curtiss, began building their own planes--and infringing the Wright patent--it seemed to consume the rest of Orville' and Wilbur's lives to prevent history from being rewritten. They became embroiled in nasty feuds with Curtiss and the Smithsonian Institute over credit for their inventions and the right to claim first to fly.While Kelly does an excellent job at presenting the case in favor of the Wrights, who undoubtedly deserve the admiration and gratitude of mankind--he was a personal friend of the Wrights and I'd like to read other viewpoints on the legal aspects of their later battles. Kelly may have been too close to render an objective and balanced picture of them. The brilliant brothers did seem to be a couple of characters. Oddly, there is no mention in the book of involvement with women. Were they a couple of male spinsters? --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of BIG ICE and WAKE UP DEAD."},{"Title":"The Wright Brothers: A Biography (Dover Transportation)","review":"This is one of those books that anyone interested in the Wright Bros. must read.

I have admired and respected Rev. Billy Graham all of my life, therefore I chose his book since I trust him. Rev. Graham's book is excellent, because he gives numerous scriptures for references from the Bible to back up what he is saying. This is always Rev.

I am not just singeling our Mr. Graham, i feel like he has had a wonderful lifetime sharing the Lords words and helping millions to come the Lord, but are these people that believe his teachings realy saved? Only God knows the answer to that question. The bible is very clear on what happens at death. No one goes right to heaven or hell. If this were so there would be no uise in having the judgement. I\`m sure Mr Graham knows this, he1s been reading his bible over 75 years now, just as the Sabbath is on saturday not sunday. He was once asked if he knew what the real Sabbath day was, his answer was yes, it\`s on saturday, then why do you teach it to be on sunday insted, his reply, if i told my congeration that the Sabbath was on saturday the seventh day insted of sunday the first it would destroy my congreation. Mr Graham should know by now that it is more important to save one person than to have millions that have been decieved by their minister. You can find the answer about death in Job chapter 14 verses 10-14. Also in Eccleasiastes chapter 12 verses 6-7. and many many more verses pertaining to death. If the dead went right to hell or heaven then why does it tell us in 1st Thessalonians chapter 4 verses 13-17. that the dead in Christ will arise first?

But he didn't die right away. And he spoke before he was gone. It was obvious by what he said and how he said it that he was telling us what he could see: what lies ahead.Billy Graham, a man who has presided over many deathbeds in his long career as a preacher, writes of his experiences at such moments. And it was stunning to me to read of the similarities.I've read several of Dr. Graham's book and I've been struck at the depth and complexity of his writings. As an evangelist, he keeps his messages simple and straightforward, but as a writer, he can delve into his subjects more deeply and more thoughtfully.It's a great book that gives you so much to think about.And find comfort in."},{"Title":"Death and the Life After","review":"This book is not about the hereafter in the sense that it doesn't go into extreme detail as to what life will be like in the hereafter and then from there, to the New Heavens and the New Earth. For that sort of details account and examination, always within a literal Biblical point of view, I would suggest Alcorn's Heaven. This book, another masterfully explored book by Billy Graham, focuses on the here and now in such a way as to examining out outlook toward that day when we die (or even better, thank the Lord, when He comes and Raptures the church). What does it mean in this, now, 21st century to live and to die? What are we to make of the culture of death that we see in the media and across the United States--from the tragedy of the late Ms. Shiavo to abortion on demand and on to euthanasia for our elderly for any old cause or reason? Basically such deaths come about because they are convenient, not based on literal Christian point of view toward the meaning of life and the dignity of dying and death. Graham asks and uses the Bible to answer questions such as \\"what does it mean to die as a Christian\\" verses \\"what does it mean to die without hope\\" (i.e. without Jesus Christ in your life as your Savior and King). For those who are dying with Jesus as the Savior, as examined by Graham, there is peace even if the death is in the face of persecution by those who do not see the light. For those who are dying without, well, there is only a slow decline into darkness, as Graham explains using the truth of the Bible. Thus, Mr. Graham is not afraid to ask questions nor is he afraid to look for answers through the written words of the Lord and through those He has touched through the ages to be His messengers, great and small. I would suggest anyone to take this book and seriously read it, examine what it has to say about death, dying, and eternity...work it into reading such books as Deadline and Heaven by Randy Alcorn...and really then falling on your hands and knees for a true talk with the Lord. Here and now you need to understand the eternal truths of living and dying and eternity. Graham points the way for the reader to go on and to use the Bible so that it shows the reader the foundations of truth and of forever."},{"Title":"Death and the Life After","review":"Billy Graham takes a gentle yet uplifting look at death, loss and the afterlife, offering biblical advice and insight into this process we all must face at one point. Sadly I have had to face it sooner than I ever ever thought I would have to when I lost my wife of twelve years to liver failure in September of 2003. Reading this book after the fact offers little help or solace with my grief and one should really read it before facing the supposed Great Unknown. This is an ounce of prevention, what I am in need of is a few pounds of cure. Perhaps a re-reading of A Grief Observed by C.S. Lewis is in order. Nonetheless, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Death and the Life After","review":"Billy Graham is the one writer I have found who can distill the wisdom of the Bible into words I understand.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone who dares explore the topic of death and dying, something we will all do sooner or later.

At the time the wreck was happening, I remember saying to myself, \\"So this is the day I will get to see Jesus face to face.\\" No, it was the day my husband got to see Jesus face to face. As I got stronger, I wondered exactly what he and my other loved ones are doing in Heaven. I just ached for more knowledge.One thing I enjoyed from this book was the part discussing the beauty of the surroundings and sounds in Heaven and how the description of the streets of gold isn't as inviting to some of us who prefer the natural beauty of mountains and countryside. This is one of my books on Heaven that I'm glad I read. I still ache to know more, of course."},{"Title":"Les Belles Soeurs : A Play","review":"I would rate the book slightly higher. Four and a half stars is closer to the actual mark I would give it, but between &quot;perfect&quot; (five stars) and &quot;great&quot; I would say the book is great (four stars). I just finished this book today in French class; each member of the class each read a different part. It is not a book I would pick for myself, but now that I have read it, I am glad it was in the itinerary. Tremblay's style of writing is keen and neat; he intersperses tragedy with comedy cleverly and without seeming to do so deliberately. He is able to make the characters sound real and each has their own manner of speaking. It seems like they are actually having a conversation that isn't scripted like a movie; the French the characters use is slangy and familiar, leaning toward the absurd at times. It is a humorous absurd though; it makes you laugh as well as think about the nuances of speech. Some people say that French books are boring; I've seen books in French that seem to have a more interesting story than this one. That is only at first glance. This story is deeper and more human, thus it is universal. I recommend this book to anyone who can read French, and I am surprised that I am the first to review this book. It is well-written and saturated with character and personality. It's a good example of what you should be looking for if you are broadening your horizons and are reading more French."},{"Title":"Les Belles Soeurs : A Play","review":"Billed as representing French-speaking Quebec, with their own working-class culture being stamped on the play, I really was quite intrigued. I can't say that I've read anything that was said to represent that culture, nor do I know much about it. In short, this was a pleasure to branch out and give a go.Germaine seems like an image of a 1950's housewife, with her desire to redecorate her home and do it all on the trading stamps she won from the local department store. I suppose that I imposed my own cultural image on the play, as I pictured my own grandmothers and their green stamp coupon books. In fact, I would bet that we could find a half-filled book or two stashed in boxes or somewhere in their homes. Those stamps offered a payback to their loyal customers, and my grandmothers kept their own stash.The one thing that I found interesting about this play, however, was the way that Tremblay gave a wider snapshot of these working-class women and their little neighborhood through the captured scene around the table as they filled books with stamps. When one or another made a little dig or put on airs above their peers, that's when the passive-aggressive claws came out. In the airs they put on, you could see the truths they were hiding of regret, misfortune, and unmet desires. You had to feel for all of the characters. And really, how cruel was it to ask these women to help her, Germaine, to fill all her coupon books with her mass winnings. Of course they would be jealous and catty.This was a fun, quick, and interesting little play. It is deceptively light on the surface, with plenty of depth to keep you thinking. If you haven't read a play in awhile, I definitely recommend you give this one a try."},{"Title":"Les Belles Soeurs : A Play","review":"A play between book covers rarely measure-up to the \\"live happening\\" itself. This is particularly evident with \\"Les Belles Soeurs\\" as one must hear the vivid rhythmic lamentations recited by the sisters, in unison without expression, like a requiem for the lost hope of a meaningful life, to feel their dark despair and appreciate the innovative signature of the author. Nonetheless, while waiting for an opportunity to see the play, the written word also succeeds in conveying the forceful message. To be read in the original Quebecois slang version if at all possible."},{"Title":"False Albacore: A Comprehensive Guide to Fly Fishing's Hottest Fish","review":"Tom Gilmore has caught the essence of angling for these inedible rocket-fish in his well-crafted book on the species, False Albacore , devoting more than 200 pages to a fishery that has emerged as the top Atlantic coast challenge. Fast, powerful, and maddening to catch, false albacore represent an addiction that surpasses the romance of the striped bass, the bulldoggedness of the bluefish, or the tropical hunt of the bonefish with its manic habits, its pulse quickening attacks, and its well-deserved reputation for trashing gear and making otherwise sane fishermen somewhat nutty.Gilmore, who is president and CEO of the New Jersey Audubon Society, is a good writer who gets right down to business, and wastes little time in delving into the details of what tackle, flies, and technique is needed to nail an albie on the fly rod. While the book assumes some fly fishing experience, and doesn't attempt to teach too many basics, it is a perfect starting point for a beginning and intermediate saltwater angler looking to diversify his or her catch list from the usual stripers and blues to something with an exotic punch.The book is well illustrated, includes an excellent set of color photographs of top fly patterns as tied by their originators, and is divided between a comprehensive how-to section in the first-halt and a guide to false albacore hot spots from Massachusetts to Florida. Gilmore interviewed more than 50 guides and other experts in researching False Albacore , collecting the kind of hard won experience from a broad group that yields some nuggets and tricks that even the most experienced false albacore angler can appreciate.Having a bit of a false albacore \\"problem\\" myself, and having devoted far too many hours and tanks of gas in pursuit of the fish, I consider myself a capable, if not experienced fisherman when it comes to albies. Yet on multiple occasions throughout the book I found myself taking note of some insights that while intuitively I may have picked up on the water, I had never really consciously considered until reading Gilmore.As any one can attest, finding then casting, and finally hooking and landing a false albacore can seem like an extremely daunting prospect at first. Gilmore cuts away at a lot of the uncertainty by emphasizing tide, structure, the prevalent baitfish, small patterns over large, slow sinking lines over floaters (in most circumstances), blind casting, and preparation. With the added bonus of some specific directions to some well-known albacore spots, this is an essential book for someone setting out to find a tiny tuna for the first time.David Churbuck, Reel-Time: The Internet Journal of Saltwater Fly Fishing"},{"Title":"False Albacore: A Comprehensive Guide to Fly Fishing's Hottest Fish","review":"A very good read, I look foward to catching some on my fly rod.I attended a presentation by Tom Gilmore and that prompted me to buy."},{"Title":"False Albacore: A Comprehensive Guide to Fly Fishing's Hottest Fish","review":"For Many years Tom Gilmore has been a well respected authority on chasing and landing Northeast species on a flyrod. Hispublic seminars for fishing clubs throughout the east often pack a full house to Enlightened Longrodders.His Knowledge and Practical Expierience come through in this well researched book, making this comprehensive guide perfectly clear to fishermen of all skill levels who read it.This book was extremely helpful offering all pertinent information from tackle to seasonal Hotspots. If you are not yet an Albie angler read this book and you'll soon be!"},{"Title":"False Albacore: A Comprehensive Guide to Fly Fishing's Hottest Fish","review":"If your chasing Albies this book is a must to read. Increased my catch rate and put me in some good areas in the northeast to catch fish.Highly recommend."},{"Title":"False Albacore: A Comprehensive Guide to Fly Fishing's Hottest Fish","review":"Although Albies have gotten little space in other more general Northeast Fishing Classics, like Inshore Fly Fishing and Fly Rodding the Coast, I'm not sure that we have enough information about our quarry for an entire book dedicated to the hottest long rod gamefish. I would have said the same about Dick Brown's Fly Fishing for Bonefish and Lou Tabory's Stripers on the Fly, but they were much more comprehensive and the techniques have been develped for many years. Fishing for Albies is a very new game. The Deceiver was on a postage stamp before people started targeting Albies with a long rod.If you've caught one Albie, most of this book won't be that helpful. Most of Gilmore's insights are anecdotal, based solely on his experience and guide interviews, but it's not his fault. What scientist would be interested in studying a \\"trash\\" fish? The locale guide and guide directory will save you a lot of research time. One thing to note is that Montauk and Harkers are great Albie fisheries, but on a weekends are a mess with boats everywhere. You can easily hook someone in another boat with your back cast.I'd also would have loved to see more photos of smiling anglers with a fish. I look forward to the second edition with more substance. Despite the it's flaws, this book will probably become a classic."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Many years ago, I read this book, which thoroughly captivated me. Before earning a worldwide reputation as a writer of exciting and wildly imaginative children's books, Dahl had served as a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. Here he relates his experiences of undergoing flight training in Southern Africa. He conveys with touching clarity the stresses, joys, and pain any pilot trainee experiences in coming to grips with flying. As someone who is fascinated with aviation, I almost felt as if I were in the cockpit with Dahl as he advanced through the various levels of training.Dahl went on to serve with a fighter squadron in Libya, which, in the wake of the German blitzkrieg in the Balkans in April 1941, was later sent to Greece. It proved to be a fruitless undertaking as Dahl's squadron sustained heavy losses and Dahl himself was greviously wounded. This book is a testament to one man's love for flying and his efforts to pick up the pieces and resume a full life again."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"If you see the classic Roald Dahl cover illustration you might think this is an appropriate book for young children. It's definitely a book for 6th or 7th grade and up. Scroll around and you'll find some excellent reviews written by teenagers. I just gave it to my dad who is a WWII buff--he loved it. Adults, particularly those interested in Africa and WWII, will enjoy it so don't think you're going to read a children's book. It's really a classic memoir. The great British actor, Derek Jacobi, has recorded a fantastic unabridged audio version (and a fine one of Dahl's \\"Boy\\")"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"What an entertaining read this proves--not surprisingly--by the author of the children's classic, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. Continuing the autobiographical expose of British boarding schools as revealed in BOY, Dahl opens this meant-for-adults book with a delightfully wacky view of his fellow Englishmen en route to work in Africa. Scornful of the repeated falls from stoic grace by so many of his predecessors, this young Empire Builder is at first shocked by the sight of so many decent chaps who have Gone Native--a result of prolonged absence from the UK and intense heat exposure. Can an idealistic youth rise above heat, humidity and British bravado to maintain his unflappable equanimity, or will he too succumb to the national trend?Most of this book, however, consists of Dahl's serious account of his contribution to the Allied air war in Africa's western desert, followed by a long recuperation from head trauma. Before he returns safely to England, he describes the deadly action in Greece where German planes far outnumbered the intrepid RAF pilots. Interspersed among the reports of the air war are his own b/w photos and letters (self-censored) to his beloved Norwegian mother in England. This account will easily capture the reader's interest as Dahl translates the global struggle by bringing it down to an intensely human level. With his treasured possessions--pilot's Log Book and his 2nd camera--we leave him when he is reunited safely with his mother. A fast read--well worth the effort even if you are not a war buff."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Going Solo is the great story that Roald Dahl adventured throughout his young life. Roald Dahl accomplished many things once he was able to do things on his own. Mainly the book is about himself traveling all over Europe and Africa just trying to experience as much as he could. He travels all over the bottom of Europe and works way down and around Africa staying at many non civilized villages and getting to know many natives. At the time he is working for the Shell Oil Company until he finally quits. In East Africa he also is endangered with a near fatal death with a Green Mamba , one of the most deadly snakes. Roald also has a passion for the air force, and ends up joining the RAF. Going Solo is one of the most adventurous books that I have ever read, with the nonstop climax's and so many near death experiences. This is a very descriptive book with so many heroic twist that can keep anyone's attention. Roald Dahl is very famous for most of his work such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but this book is amazing because this all actually happened to writer in real life. The greatest part about the Roald Dahl in Going Solo is that he never gave up, even after a plane crash that he should not have been able to live after. He was told that he would be blind for the rest of his life, but about a month later he started to gain his sight back. I feel that this book is a miracle."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"WOW! Going Solo, by Roald Dahl is an amazing and heart capturing book. Read this book if you love war stories. These stories are serious, funny, and keep you wanting more. I found the book almost impossible to believe during some points in the amazing novel.Dahl's biography tells about his survival in the dated war planes without experience (while outnumbered 100 to 1) and on the ground as commander with no experience again. Dahl uses great language and thought to describe things and to progress the novel with amazing simplicity. To me, simplicity and straight-forwardness makes a book enjoyable (not school like), and pretty easy to read. It is not a \\"piece of cake\\" reading, but it isn't unbelievably hard. His survival in the air of Greece and Africa come down to one thing, instincts. I believe Going Solo shows how most humans would act during a war; very scared, rather excited, nervous, and filled with heart pumping adrenaline. As I read, my eyes read faster than my brain could keep up with. I felt I was flying right next Dahl, watching him struggle to survive the most horrid war of history, World War II. What I also love about Roald Dahl's story is that he has a perfect balance of humor and exploding action. There was never one seriously boring dead place.This is one of the best books I have ever read. I love Going Solo because I always want to read more. Most of the time I do not wish to put it down. These are the types of books I love to read. Astonishingly, the novel feels like a movie. At the last second when all hope seems to be lost, Dahl shows his intelligence by giving you a story you will remember for a long time. That is why I recommend this book.Do not read Going Solo if you hate adventurous, unbelievably true World War II stories. Trust me; read Going Solo if you want a great read with amazing plot.The novel builds and builds with drama and action, then the unfathomable happens...read Going Solo to find a great ending with a great last word."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Going SoloGoing Solo by Roald Dahl is an action-packed adventure full of laughs and frights. Dahl uses up-front, to the point explanations that provide detailed and somewhat sudden images of events from his life. The book itself, Going Solo, is based on Dahl's experience in Africa and in the air force. Dahl starts his tale as a young man headed to an African coastal city where he will help in the management of a Shell public relations group. Dahl encounters much more than he bargained for and provides readers with a great bed-time reader. I wouldn't however suggest it for bed-time reading, because you won't be able to put it down.I typically read books that fall under the Fantasy genre because the author has the ability to constantly fill the characters with excitement as opposed to a biography in which the author may only use real events, which are not always as fast-paced. Dahl, however, has had a life that really has very few dull moments. I had no problem keeping the movie in my mind going. He transitioned well from event to event without stopping the action. I was drawn in at first by the experience Dahl had on the ship. He explains that the ship taking him to Africa was occupied by men who were somewhat mentally unstable. His colorful imagery of all his situations and scenes makes for a compelling and intriguing story-line.In addition to detail through words, Dahl has pictures in his book. This is not a critical component of literature, but it allowed me to complete my mental images. His photographs depict people he met and things he encountered. These pictures aided in my idea of the time period and culture of the setting. This book is by no means a picture book, but it has several images throughout the book.The book also drew me in because it was Dahl reflecting on his life. As I read the book I felt as though it was the first time since his war experience that he had looked back on the events. I felt as though he was developing his opinions of his decisions throughout the war as he was writing the book. In a sense, it felt like I was the first person to here his reflection on his life. This display of a relationship between author and reader further demonstrates Dahl's mastery of literature.I would recommend this work to anyone seeking a short-term commitment as far as reading goes. This book can easily be finished within a few devoted days. The book is not a very high reading level, but leaves the door open for deep thought and role-playing. I enjoyed this piece and through it's creativity it compelled me to read another of Dahl's pieces. For those who choose to try this book, I invite you to spend equal time reading and reflecting to get the most out of the book. Enjoy this piece.-Jess13KY"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"tHIS BOOK IS GREAT!!!Roald dahls bio is actually like a story!Instead of writing boring stuff about life, Roald Dahl will make u very intrest and will make want to read moreYou would n't put the book down until you finish itAnd even after finishing, you would dream of it and want to read it againAnother book reccomende is Boy, tales of childhood"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"This thrilling, true-life adventure stands on its own as a great read. In fact, I read it to my 8-year old son before we read &quot;Boy&quot;, and turned to &quot;Boy&quot; only because &quot;Going Solo&quot; is so wonderful. Although the story is filled with action, what makes this book a classic - and one you won't want to put down - is Dahl's magical use of the English language."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"If you want to show your kid or student that an biography is fun to read, well, in \\"Going Solo\\" Roald Dahl describes every fun and depression of his experience as a teenager to adulthood. It is just as fun reading \\"Matilda\\" and \\"The Witches\\". The language is easy to read, lots of photographs took by Roald Dahl himself, and the ending is satisfying.The story is about Roald Dahl's first career in Africa (Sudan) working for the Shell Oil company. When the second world war broke up he joined the royal airforce throughout middle east and the coast of Greece.Throughout the book you follow a period of his life, experiencing both the positives and negatives of his adventure. You also get to find out how he begins to build ideas, and these ideas become great children books that are unforgettable to this day.This is not just a great read for the Roald Dahl fans, but everyone who loves for adventures and wild creativities. Go get it and start reading!"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Going Solo Review by Samuel WOne of the characters I most enjoyed was David Coke, pronounced Cook. David is extraordinarily kind even throughout hard times of the war. When Roald Dahl first arrived at the Greece airbase the CO greets Roald with, \\"You can find yourself a bunk in one of the tents. You'll start flying tomorrow like the rest of them.\\" The CO doesn't greet him with, \\"I'm glad you made it,\\" or \\"How are you?\\" David gives Roald a good greeting and trys to help Roald by teaching him tips on combat.An aspect of the book that I liked was that the story is true. The experiences that Roald endured are amazing and surreal. He joins the Greece air force of fifteen, up against hundreds of German fighters, with no combat experience, and alone. It's survival. There story of survival can be scaled to the part after the Battle of Athens when both Roald and David get back to their base. \\"I think were going to get killed,\\" Roald said. \\"So do I, said David. \\"you can have the basin in a moment. I left a bit of water in the jug in case you happen to come back.\\" Both pilots thought they were going to die.I chose to read this book because I knew it was a flying book and it was titled \\"Going Solo.\\" Though I have never been in a fight like that, I felt a slight connection. As does any pilot when they hear the word solo. To some degree the word solo to a pilot is the same as survival. I recommend this book to all adventure seekers."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"This book talks about Roald Dahl when he was young. He took part in the Second World War and this book deals with the time he went flying with the RAF in the war. Everyone dislikes going on wars but Roald Dahl enjoyed it. He thought that it was a free travel and it was interesting. He described all the interesting and exciting events happening to him. After three years of fighting and flying, due to the severe head injuries he had received when his Gladiator crashed in the Western Desert, he must on no account fly a fighter plane again and so went back home. I do not enjoy the story because I do not like wars. Wars are terrible and Roald Dahl described how he helped the others fight and how the others were shot and died. I felt upset when I read this book. I think this book is thick. The plot goes slowly and it makes the story boring."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"I read the fantastic book named Going Solo by Roald Dahl. This book was an autobiography of Roald Dahl's life prior to and during World War II. The book explained many of his encounters with the enemy as a pilot for the Royal Air Force in Roald Dahl's personal view. There are an uncountable number of fascinating events that occur when he is a pilot. Some of them include when he receives a life threatening injury, going into a hardcore battle with no experience at fighting enemies, and getting out of a long-lasting dogfight where he was outnumbered 200 to 12. The other half of the book explained his thrilling adventures prior to the war when he worked for the Shell Company. Some of his experiences while working for the Shell Company included chasing a lion, saving a man from a deadly Black Mamba, and sighting a deadly Green Mamba enter his friends house. Every page of the book was full of plot and adventure, and I could not put this book down.In the beginning of the book Roald Dahl is on a ship, which was taking him from England to Africa for a job with the Shell Company. He ended up in a beautiful tropic town named Dar es Salaam, located in Tanzania, which is on the coast of Africa. Once there, he was given a personal \`boy' named Mdisho, which back then was like an unpaid worker. Mdisho and Roald form a very close father-son relationship, Roald being the father and Mdisho being the son. Roald teaches Mdisho many things, while Mdisho goes out and works for him. After a while, Roald decides to join the army as a Pilot Officer. He began his journey in flight training for six months. Then, he was given directions to join up with the 80 Squadron, who were fighting in the middle of the Sahara desert. The directions were incorrect and he ended up crashing and getting a life-threatening injury. Once he recovered, he was to meet up with the 80 Squadron again, who were now located in Greece. He finds himself fighting in Greece with only 12 planes in the whole of Greece. The Germans had thousands of planes located in Greece, so they fought as best they could. Once it was getting too dangerous, the 80 Squadron left and went on to a place named Argos, which was another fifty miles along the coast. After that, they went along to Palestine and Syria, and fought off more Nazis. He then was experiencing major headaches when flying and had to be sent home. This is a brief overview of the book, and as you can see it's full of suspense.This book was an awesome book, because I learned a lot about how life was during World War II through the eyes of a magnificent writer. It was so good that I read it the first day I started reading it. Roald Dahl draws out a scene for you each battle, so you can imagine like you are there with him, in his Hurricane airplane fighting off the Nazis. This book is for the sort of person that enjoys reading fast-paced books and loves to read about history. Also, if you like the author Roald Dahl, I would suggest reading it because it tells a lot about him, and his personal history. If this book sounds interesting to you then I definitely recommend it and suggest you check it out, or maybe you might want to check out the prequel to Going Solo titled Boy."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"I read this in one sitting, so you can see it is pretty interesting. I get the feeling Dahl was a really honest person. His account of how he learned to fly and was dumped right into fighting German airplanes without any fighter pilot training is amazing and rather frightening. He mentions several times the number of young lives lost because of the lack of training and support. One of the grim aspects of war. The accounts of living in Africa, black mambos and lions, pretty strong stuff too."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Como siempre desde hace a&ntilde;os Amazon sigue enviando los libros y los discos con rapidez y eficacia. Me parece incre&iacute;ble que los env&iacute;os sean tan veloces."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"'Going Solo' is the second part of Roald Dahl's sort-of-autobiography, covering Dahl's experiences in Africa and the Mediterranean, initially as part of his work for Shell, and later on as a fighter pilot in the Second World War. Although it is designed to be read by those who have just finished 'Boy', the tone is more serious, and themes such as warfare are somewhat weightier than Great Mouse Plots and chocolate sampling. Whereas 'Boy' can be enjoyed by children of any age, 'Going Solo' is probably best suited to slightly older children, and even adults.The first half of the book picks up right where \`Boy' leaves off, with Dahl beginning his travels out to East Africa. This part of the book is the more light-hearted and closest in style to \`Boy', with its discussion of snake handlers, warrior servants, and especially the eccentric people who inhabit the farthest reaches of the Empire. Dahl's description of the oddballs who travel out on the ship with him (including a man who fakes having dandruff to disguise his wig, an elderly couple who run around the deck without a stitch of clothing on, and a woman who will only eat oranges with a fork) is hilarious.The tone gets more serious with the outbreak of the war, with Dahl forced to round up German civilians fleeing the country, and following this he enlists in the RAF. The remainder of the book focuses on his wartime training and service, in Africa, Greece, and later on in the Middle East. I've always regarded this as the most interesting part of the book, and Dahl does an excellent job of describing what it is like to be a fighter pilot; crashing in the desert, shooting down enemy planes, being strafed, diving and banking to avoid being shot down, and especially the appalling loss of life among his fellow pilots. This part of the book also provides a fascinating insight into parts of WW2 that don't get much publicity, such as the hopeless against-the-odds Grecian campaign. In many ways it's a miracle Dahl and several others survived to fight another day. The final chapter sees Dahl invalidated home, and offers some insights into the Home Front during the war.In all, I found \`Going Solo' to be just as good, and probably better, than \`Boy'. Dahl's humourous and engaging style is still present, but the book covers more serious and (in my opinion) interesting issues than the child-like fascinations of \`Boy'. As I say, it may be more suitable for slightly older children and adolescents, but this is a must-read for fans of Dahl's work, children and adult alike."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"My 10 years old Boy is reading this book and it kept his attencion!he enjoy Dahl sotries but this one seems to be one of the bests for him!The WW2 is the scenario but imagining that you are a pilot there is amazing!excellent book!"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Going Solo by Roald Dahl is a fantastic adventurous book about Roald's experience as a WW2 fighter pilot. He talks about his other stories from Hatia and Marigua. His friends like David Coke and other squad mates give him more stories to tell. He tells about his journey to England and how he felt during the stress and pressure of the war. Roald describes this book like pie if you use clear details.Roald Dahl gets sent from Norway to England to enlist in the British air force to fight for the allies in WW2. When Roald flies in air battles it has a lot of action because air battles are always epic. His word choice excels in telling the story. The action comes from the intense and complicated words he uses. Here is an example of him using action in Going Solo: \\"As I swerved through explosions and planes, the bullets looked like orange fiery sticks flying at me.\\"The book also has a suspense cliff-hanger technique that wants you to keep reading. All of Roald's books all have this trait that makes it fun but full of suspense. It feels like it's giving you hunger to play the story out. You can almost imagine it because it is so intense. An example of suspense in Going Solo is \\"The blow to my head smashed my face in. I was blind. Who knows what shall happen to Roald Dahl?Another reason this book is entirely awesome is because this book is written by Roald Dahl. Roald Dahl is a great author and has interesting topics from Friendly Giants, to chocolate factories, medicine to shrink people. He is a great author because he loves to write children's books in a way that grabs the reader's attention. Roald tells autobiographies in every story and loves writing which makes him a clear detail-telling story teller/writer.Going Solo by Roald Dahl is a great story overall. It is action-packed, full of suspense, and is written by a great author, Roald Dahl. It is kind of boring in the beginning, but it progresses when Roald really tells his stories during air battles. His dangers were growing, and accidents were fatal. Roald Dahl talks about how his adventure as a WW2 pilot is really amazing and glorious when he was going solo.-- B. Lee"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"I think this is a great coming of age book and one of the more memorable ones that I have read. I think it would have had even more of an effect on me if I had read it again after I graduated high-school. Come to think of it, this would be an excellent graduation gift. As it is I've used the rice and banana recipe many times. I loved the stories of him in his fighter airplane and I liked the story of the nurse where he fell in love with her voice but when he actually went on a date with her, he found out she wasn't his type. He leaves it as a mystery to why, but someone who doesn't facilitate communication, respect, honesty, and trust in a relationship is a throwback no matter how pretty the person is. I think it's a very important lesson that Roald Dahl introduces. This book is an excellent coming of age story with a responsible, confident healthy protagonist."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"This is the best book I have read in a long time. My third grade son recommended it to me, so I can say it's good for both kids and adults. His stories of his life as a young man working in East Africa and flying for the RAF in WW II are compelling and, as always with Dahl, so well-written. His stories of human encounters with snakes and lions are entertaining. I look forward to sharing this great book with friends. His autobiography \\"Boy\\" about his childhood was also very good and worth reading also."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"This is one of the most interesting and interestingly written books in recent memory. I devoured it,It was a delightful, personal description of Dahl's journey to East Africa, his work there in an outpost of the far flung British Empire -- a world that would never again be seen. He describes with engaging candor his role in how the British \\"muddled through\\" WWII -- just.The Brits would have one believe that all went \\"according\\" to plan -- that the issue was never in doubt -- but Dahl's charming account of how he learned to fly the Tiger Moth for the RAF and how he became an \\"instant\\" Hurricane fighter pilot in Greece were convincing evidence to the contrary.Easy reading!! Highly recommended!!Fritz Steiner"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Very exciting autobiography of his time in Africa working for an oil company, then he joined the RAF as a pilot. Great gift for a pilot or a WWII buff."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"In this sequel to Boy, Roald Dahl writes about his life as a young adult. After leaving Repton, his boarding school, he signed on with the Shell Oil Company and was sent to East Africa, which is now called Tanzania. While Dahl was serving in Tanzania, World War II happened and he signed up with the Royal Air Force. He chronicles in detail his work for Shell, and his experiences as an RAF pilot.In East Africa, Roald Dahl had a near-fatal encounter with a deadly black mamba, whose poison can kill you in about two seconds. Right after the war broke out Roald's servant, a descendant of warrior tribesman, decided to become a warrior himself and killed a civillian. Roald had to spirit him away before the murder was discovered. And just to show how dangerous flying with the RAF was, one day when Roald returned from a mission his tent-mate told him, \\"I boiled enough tea for two, just in case you happened to come back.\\" He was eventually shot down, but survived. While recuperating in the hospital, he fell in love with his nurse.Going Solo was, like all of Dahl's books, wonderful. I only wish he'd have written a third about his later adulthood. Pity he died before he could do that."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"As a 17 year old boy who spent my childhood in Norway, with roalds books, I was really surprised when I found at that he wrote books for adults as well. This is the kind of book which it is hard to put down when youre reading, but unfortunately after sitting for hours in my stressless I was out of pages. This book continues the story begun in boy, where dahl tells us about his highlights in life, from the point where he worked for Shell until he has finished his service in the RAF, and he returns back to a war raged Brittain . I would just wish that roald had written more about his life because I found it very entertaining"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"I'm German so I'm sorry for all the mistakes I will surely make. This book is humorous, it's easy to understand and it tells a good story. I've never read a book written this way, but I loved it. It's simply Roald Dahl's way to retell his own life. He tells about accidents very dry, however, it was funny. So everybody reading this: you should buy this book, I can't tell you the story and how great she is but you're able to read."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"It's a pity that amazon.com descibes this book as &quot;Reading level: Young adult,&quot; because it really should be classified among Dahl's adult literature, along with &quot;Boy,&quot; &quot;Switch Bitch.&quot; and my personal favorite, &quot;My Uncle Oswald.&quot;This is a beautifully written, exciting and fascinating story that will rivet the attention of readers of any age. I sent a copy to my uncle, a former Marine pilot during World War II now in his eighties, and he couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"This a great book. It is very discreptive it tells everything about his life and is very well done. Before you read this book read Boy tales of a childhood."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Going Solo (the sequel to Boy) is a collection of Roald Dahl's most interesting stories of his time in Africa. These include: meeting a man you gives himself dandruff, teaching an African boy to read and write, seeing a lion attack a cook, learning to fly without a teacher, crashing in the African desert, leading a unit of R.A.F. soldiers to stop a caravan of German people from leaving Dar es Salaam, becoming temporarily blind, meeting the girl of his dreams then falling out of love when he sees her and living on a Greek airfield soon before he was grounded. Roald Dahl's style of writing changes each time slightly changes to fit the story. Basically, you get the idea that you have known Roald for years and he is just telling you an amusing story. Going Solo was not as interesting as some of his other fiction stories. For some readers it may not be interesting enough to keep you in the book; but it is not boring, thrills and adventure are always happening. To compare this to Boy would be a little difficult because even though they are the same writer, Boy is about his childhood and is for younger readers. Going Solo is probably for older readers. Even it you do not like one of the chapters the next will bring you back in. So if you want a lot of good anecdotes to read then or if you really liked Boy, you should pick up Going Solo."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"This gem of a book is surprising in many ways. The whimsical cover suggests tongue-in-cheek, and, indeed, there is some of that, but mostly it is a book that sneaks up on you, grabs you, and astonishes. \`Going Solo' is the story of Roald Dahl's World War 2 experiences, and is divided roughly into two main themes. The first part records the experiences he had while he was stationed in East Africa before the war, when excitement meant such things as dealing with green mambas. I know virtually nothing about Africa, but resolved to learn more after reading this part of the book. There are many charming stories here: watch for the one taking place on his voyage out when Dahl discovers that his roommate is simulating dandruff on his dinner jacket with talcum powder!The second half of the book records his RAF exploits, many of which would not be believed had this been a work of fiction. Dahl's descriptions of such things as plane crashes are charmingly low-key and understated, an unusual way to depict danger and hardship, but one that succeeds brilliantly in this book.Adding to the charm of the book are pictures of letters, postcards, photographs, maps and the like - visuals that make the lively text come even more alive. This is one war story women who steer away from the usual blood-and-guts stereotype war novels will absolutely enjoy. It is a touching and interesting portrayal of courage and amazing happenings in the life of a very unassuming gentleman."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"In the book \\"Going Solo\\" Roald Dahl describes every fun and depressing part of his experience as a teenager to adulthood. Its in his hilarious style where no word is boring, and the language is easy to read, lots of photographs took by Roald Dahl himself, and the ending is satisfying.Everyone dislikes going on wars but Roald Dahl enjoyed it. He thought that it was a free travel and it was interesting. The story is about Roald Dahl's first career in Africa (Sudan) working for the Shell Oil company. When the second world war broke up he joined the royal airforce throughout middle east and the coast of Greece. some of the things he gets himself into and out of are incredible...like when he captures the war's first prisoners, or crash-lands in the desert, or flys in the Battle of Athens...the list goes on and on.Throughout the book you follow a period of his life, experiencing both the positives and negatives sides of his adventure. You also get to find out how he begins to build ideas, and these ideas become great children books that are so memorable today.Best parts: all the flying missions, of which Dahl writes so enthusiastically, by a 6'6\\" pilot crammed into the tiny cockpit of a Hurricane.Worst: I cannot believe how the RAF could send so many practically untrained flyers into combat in aircraft they had never even flown beforeGoing Solo was, like all of Dahl's books, wonderful. I only wish he'd have written a third about his later adulthood. unfortunately he died before he could do that."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"&quot;Going Solo&quot; is a continuation of Dahl's autobiography &quot;Boy.&quot; Once started, one will not be able to put it down. It is a page turner. This should be required reading for all men above the age of 16.

It's a real page-turner; I couldn't wait to read the next chapter!As always, his style of writing is a pleasure to read, and although most younger readers prefer his macabre tales of fantasy, this is well worth adding to their Dahl Library.Both \`Boy' and \`Going Solo' are the perfect way to introduce the developing younger reader to biographical/true-life stories, rather than remaining forever stuck in the magical realms of fantasy fiction.

The book details the narrator's life as a pilot in the Navy. When the book starts, the narrator tells about his great adventures from Africa to the Mediterranean. One of his many adventures occured, when he almost gets killed by one of the most dangerous snakes in Tanganyika, called the Green Mamba. Then later on in the story he starts his life as a pilot in 1939. dahl's first challenge was trying to learn how to fly a plane. This would usually consist of just the basic's, flying, and landing. After he had learned to master this skill it was on to the next. The narrator tells about the six months he went through constant flight training, in learning how to attack enemies in different situations. Towards the end of his training, Dahl crashes in the middle of the desert and is stranded. With no plane to fly, and his body badly injured, there was nothing he could do but just hope for someone to help him. An hour passed and Roald was put in the nearest hospital. The doctors told him he could never fly again, but Roald refused to accept that. With alot of recuperation he was able to meet up with his squadron and be ready to fly again. As soon as he got to Egypt, his capton leader said he was going up in battle against some of the best German pilots tomorrow morning. What do you think will happen when he has to battle the Germans? You better read this book to find out."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Dahl is the author of some of the most imaginative works of fiction ever created and this tends to overshadow his personal accomplishments, which are considerable. This book is an autobiography of his early adulthood, starting from the time he traveled to east Africa to work for the Shell Company through the first years of World War II.Dahl was one of the people that left the British Isles to work in and administer a colony in the British Empire. His descriptions of that group of people are amusing and accurate, for they were simultaneously a tough group of people although a bit daffy. Dahl's descriptions of the Major and his wife making several rounds on the deck in the nude every morning followed by the strict rule of everyone formally dressing for dinner were very amusing.Dahl volunteered for the Royal Air Force (R. A. F.), received his initial training in Kenya and flew fighter planes. He crash-landed in North Africa and after his recovery; Dahl was transferred to Greece as the Germans were moving in. It was a hopeless battle, at one time six fighter planes was all the R. A. F. could put in the air against hundreds of German planes. This installment of Dahl's amazing life ends with his flying a plane in the British campaign to take Syria from the forces of Vichy France.Dahl cheated death many times in this book; he was a true war hero of the first magnitude. Some of that was skill, but as he repeatedly admits, luck also had a great deal to do with it. In many ways, his life story is more amazing than his fiction, this is a great book for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"I'm trying to imagine the kind of person who would not enjoy this book, and quite frankly I'm failing. If you can read this review, you will enjoy the book.It tells the story of Roald Dahl from his journey out to Dar-es-Salaam at the age of 18, to start working for Shell, to his being invalided home as a fighter pilot from the Middle East in 1941. Throughout he makes it sound as if it's all a bit of fun, but in reality the odds against his surviving the events in the book must have been 50 to 1.It's all told in a lovely deadpan voice that clearly shows up the utter absurdity what he was going through, from his servant killing a local German with a 17th century antique sword to being one of 15 fighter pilots in all of Greece to take on 1000 Luftwaffe planes. It's to his everlasting credit that he manages to do this in such a straightforward way. Of course, events speak for themselves, but it requires a skillful author to let them do so, and Dahl is more than skillful. This is a work of genius."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"\\"I must learn to fly a Hurricane and then I must take it to Greece and rejoin the squadron.When I got this news I was in Ismailia, a large RAF aerodrome on the Suez Canal. A Flight-Lieutenant said, 'You can have a couple of days to learn how to fly it, then you take it to Greece.''Fly that to Greece?' I said.'Of course.''Where do I stop to refuel?''You don't.' he said. 'You go non-stop.''How long will that take?''About four and a half hours,' he said.Even I knew that a Hurricane had fuel for only one and a half hours' flying, and I pointed that out to the Flight-Lieutenant. 'Don't worry about that,' he said. 'We're fitting extra fuel tanks under the wings.''Do they work?''Sometimes they work,' he said smirking. 'You press a little button and if you're lucky a pump pumps petrol from the wing-tanks into the main tank.''What happens if the pump doesn't work?''You bale out into the Med and swim,' he said.'No,' I said. 'Be serious. Who picks me up?'Nobody.' he said. 'It's a chance you have to take.'\\"- Roald Dahl (GOING SOLO p. 119)In this marvelous autobiographical sequel to BOY: TALES OF CHILDHOOD, Roald Dahl entertains and delights by recalling his experiences just prior to and during WW2 writing of the many adventures he had: traveling by ship from England to Dar-es-Salaam, Tanganyika (aboard the SS Mantola) and observing the bizarre habits of his fellow-British-passengers while on his way to work for the Shell Oil Company there, avoiding certain death from the venom of the Green Mamba, joining the Royal Air Force at the start of the war, learning to fly at an RAF airbase in Nairobi, Kenya, and crashing a Gladiator bi-plane in the Western Desert of Egypt, finally winning his wings and becoming a fighter pilot with the RAF in Africa and Greece, and then surviving dog-fights in the skies above Greece against German ME 109s. While many of Dahl's adventures were harrowing, others were very humorous.I won't spoil the fun for anyone in this brief review by writing too much. Pick up a copy of this wonderful little book and enjoy! You'll just have to take my word for it that you won't be bored or disappointed. Several maps and quite a few photos are included.As another reviewer wrote, it's a shame Mr. Dahl didn't write another autobiographical sketch about his life as a writer of children's books before he died in 1990. That, I'm sure, would have been an absolute pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Another writer once told me that one of the most important elements to be found in a memoir is a \\"likeable\\" narrator. Roald Dahl is perhaps one of the MOST likeable of narrators. Modest to a fault and blessed with a very sly and subtle sense of humor, the story Dahl tells in GOING SOLO, his sequel to BOY, is perhaps one of the most readable memoirs of modern times. His story of the quick and almost informal training he received at a flying school in Africa shortly after Great Britain entered WWII, is hair-raising and nearly impossible to believe, except you do believe, because you trust this man. At six foot six inches tall, Dahl was physically quite unsuited to be a fighter pilot, noting that when seated in the various planes he flew, his knees were nearly under his chin and he had to hunch over to fit beneath the plane's canopy. But fly he did, even after surviving one horrific crash in the desert early on in his career as an RAF pilot. He sustained a very bad concussion (which was to come back to haunt him and finally \\"invalid\\" him out of service nearly two years later) and had his face bashed in. As he explained to his mother in a letter: \\"My nose was bashed in ... and the ear nose and throat man pulled my nose out of the back of my head and shaped it and now it looks just as before except that it's a little bent about ...\\" Dahl went on to fly many combat missions in North Africa and Greece, usually against vastly superior odds, but somehow he managed to survive until the middle of 1941, when the migraine headaches caused by the aforementioned crash made him unfit for further flying. Dahl's nearly laconic and completely unself-conscious manner of writing about the things he did - absolutely heroic things - made me think of Sam Hynes's WWII memoir of his missions in the Pacific theater. Both writers downplay the importance of their roles. They never speak of heroics or derring-do, only about the importance of their comrades, doing the jobs they were trained to do and trying their best to simply stay alive. This was an enormously satisfying, moving and often hilarious tale. After reading these two slim volumes of memoirs by Dahl, I do wish he had written another. I have ordered his slim collection of stories about WWII already. What a wonderful writer - and gentleman - Roald Dahl was. - Tim Bazzett, author of SOLDIER BOY and LOVE, WAR & POLIO"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Excellent life story, adventure. Bought because of its aviation aspect and personal Greek attraction with the Battle of Athens during the last war. Having served on 84 Sqn RAF in Cyprus it was really interesting to review first hand flying activities during these times of conflict. A really nice short story."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Roald Dahl's memories about his time in World War II, many letters to his mother from the war. Secrets he didn't know if could disclose to her and time he spent in the Gypsy House. All of this is in this book.I found this book in my college library in the resources section so I could not even check it out. There may be very few copies of it."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"I've always enjoyed Dahl's children's books, and so I was curious to see what he might write about his own life. To say that his early adult years were exciting might understate the matter a bit. This book opens with Dahl embarking on a ship for East Africa, to start his first job as a representative of the Shell Oil Company, and follows him through his career as a RAF fighter pilot in the Eastern Mediterranean theater during WWII. Many of his tales are so over the top that it would be tempting to believe that he has embelished the stories. But even if he did, the result is an thoroughly enjoyable read, full of adventure and the excitement of youth. We also get a glimpse of the last hurrah of the British Empire, the epic struggle of the second World War, and just the barest idea of the conditions he found in war torn England upon his return. Very entertaining."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"i must say, this book was incredibly hard to put down!having read the previous roald dahl biography \\"boy,\\" i was eager to read this book. i wasn't disappointed at all. i was absolutely fascinated by the things that this man has gone through. i feel like a coward indeed after reading about roald dahl's trip to africa and his terrifying wartime experiences! it's magnetic!this book is written in a very straightforward style, and anyone and everyone should read it, i believe! there is a lot to be learned from this book. it shows the true insanity of war. people lose their minds in the kind of situations described in this book!it has a happy ending, though. this, you can look forward to!"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Going Solo, by Roald Dahl is the epic sequel to his early age biography, Boy.In this book, Dahl is a grown man, just graduated out of Repton Boys School and is now working for the Shell Company. This book takes place during World War II, and Dahl starts in East Africa, and ends up in the places that you would least expect.Roald Dahl begins his new job in the small village of Dur es Salaam, Tanzania.Just as he wishes, he drives through the African jungles, delivering oil to people who live quite far from civilization. In Dur es Salaam Dahl encountered one of natures deadliest creatures; the black mamba. This particular snake's venom has no known cure, and its poison will kill its victim in no more then an hour. Dahl got the thrill of saving a person's life, by merely looking, out a window and screaming, \\"Salimu! Salimu! Beware huge snake! Behind You! Quickly quickly!\\" The boy, Salimu, quickly killed the snake off with a pitchfork, but owed his life to Dahl. Roald Dahl had many other adventures in Dur es Salaam, such as having a green mamba in his friend's house and having to call the \`snake man.' And seeing the cook's wife being carried off by a lion, but came back without a scratch!When war was announced, Dahl went off to be a Navy pilot. He leaves the Shell Company, and goes to Iraq, to be trained to be a pilot. Finally, when his training is complete, he is given coordinates of Squadron 80 (the Navy squad he's assigned to). While flying towards his squadron, Dahl realized that he was given the wrong coordinates! Nearly out of fuel, he attempts to land his plane on the bumpy terrain, but crashes, and barely escapes death!Squadron 80's assignment was to patrol Greece, and keep it safe from the Germans. There was only one minor problem; Squadron 80 had fifteen nice, well built Hurricane airplanes, while the German army had hundreds of planes that were the newest models. So no wonder Squadron 80 eventually fled, and Greece was captured by the Germans.He and his remaining squad go to Haifa Egypt, to once again protect it. Due to head injury's from Dahl's big crash, he becomes an invalid pilot, and begins his long journey home.I enjoyed this book, because it kept you on your toes at all times. There was never a moment that I wasn't enthralled in Roald Dahl's exquisite description, that put you right there in a Hurricane, dodging enemy blasts. I rate this book an 8 out of 10 because, even though its action packed, it sometimes gets a bit repetitive. If you enjoyed Boy, and are looking for a book that you won't ever want to put down, then choose Going Solo, and you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"And nowhere near as good as his fiction, GOING SOLO almost seems as though it was written as therapy. It's a professional job, don't get me wrong, but you can almost see Dahl working overtime to make his stories more exciting and gripping than they probably really were. The book begins with young Roald travelling to Tanzania on a boat under orders from Shell Oil, where he hopes to begin a career. Almost instantly the war breaks out and Dahl is ordered to round up the war's first prisoners. Then he's sent to flying school and taught to master a plane in a few months. Were planes simpler to learn back then? Well, for one thing, the RAF was educating its young men at assembly line pace, and the objective was to get up and come down; nothing fancier needed.It's sort of comical, especially because Roald felt himself to be abnormally tall (six and a half feet, a good foot taller than several of his instructors) so he really had to wedge his butt into the tiny Piper seat and fold his long legs like a heron to be able to play the pedals properly. The book peters out after a terrible crash results in awful head injuries, wounds that impacted his whole life way down the pike and narrowed his Swiftian vision into the refined cruelty that sparked his great masterpieces for children.No, I would not say this book is for kids, but on the other hand children love reading about flying, and they enjoy identifying with the \\"fish out of water.\\" Children feel a bond to outsiders of all descriptions, because everyone feels picked on. For Dahl it was a feeling that never went away, no matter how close he came to the stars."},{"Title":"Mountain Flying Bible & Flight Operations Handbook Expanded","review":"Best book you can get on mountain flying. Sparky takes a complex subject and breaks it down into a few simple rules that will keep you out of trouble in the mountains. Now he does give comprehensive coverage and doesn't oversimplify, but his plain talk has proven to be a real lifesaver for me. For any pilot who plans the fly mountains, this read is a must."},{"Title":"Come In Spinner (Angus & Robertson Classics)","review":"A fascinating story of Sydney at the end of the Second World War. Well written, although you may need a dictionary of Australian slang at times. The whole story unfolds in just 5 days, showing the lives and loves of women in a society changed by war. The authors show life as they observed it, not the romantic touristic style but reality: fun for some, tragedy for others. The characters are well developed, just towards the end some of the dialogues were getting a bit tiring. I mean, how many times can you take reading 'jeepers' on just one page? Still, it's a great book, worth reading."},{"Title":"Come In Spinner (Angus & Robertson Classics)","review":"I love this book and I can't belive I am writting the first review for this well loved classic. This fast paced story revolves around a week in the lives of the girls who work in the Marie Antionette beauty salon in the Hotel South Pacific, Sydney during WWII. It lifted way more than a few brows when it was published by those who preferred not to remember the prostitution, black marketing and gambling that flourished along with the war. The writting is lively, funny and it is unbelivebly easy to lose yourself in this novel."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"Maybe it's because I'm an old f**t, but I think a lot of reviewers have missed a key theme of this book.I'll quickly mention points made by others before I center in on the immortality &amp; &quot;meaning of life&quot; themes I've found here.First, this is hard science fiction, but if like me you're no scientist, there is a way to read it and get the gist of the science without getting hopelessly confused.Secondly, while the second half of the book is more serious with bad things happening, there's a playful perspective to the entire book that can be compared to fairy tales, or to &quot;Tom Swift&quot; solutions, or to glorious &quot;pulp&quot; science-fiction of the '30's and '40's. This might put off some readers and charm others.However you react to the hard science and/or the allusions tomore faniful genres, don't overlook what is being said about immortality.The novel's protagonist and antagonist are both among the first to embark into immortal life and are reacting to such a life's implications. As if immortality isn't enough to deal with, there's also the faxing of people creating copies of individuals who have the memories and personalities of the originals but go into divergent paths.The principal character, after a long period of being the Queen's &quot;Philander&quot;, has become a hermit buried in endless scientific research which will hopefully enable him to see the end of time. His opposite number, also for a time the Queen's &quot;Philander&quot;, has a similar goal, but due to his immortality has become what could be thought of as a souless entity, with little regard for humanity. We're also given glimpses at other characters, each of whom attempt to deal with the prospect of immortality and the challenge to make unending life meaningful.The question of God, of religion, or of lack of either is also looked at. In fact, it seems to me that contemporary science-fiction as a whole is giving religion and its impact on society much more consideration than it once did. Either that, or I'm noticing it more.At any rate, if you bear in mind that this book does have a serious philosophical theme along with the &quot;technobabble&quot; and is framed in a pulpish, Tom Swiftian, fairy-tale like mold, you should find it well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"This is a story with fabulous science, easily the equal of anything Larry Niven or Stephen Baxter have served up, or better. You can't swing a dead cat in this book without hitting another mind-blowing concept. Yet McCarthy's style is not the stiff deadpan of a NASA flight controller (which he is), but the romping satire of a Neal Stephenson or Salman Rushdie. It's an eerie combination. The language is deceptively simpler and more casual than &quot;Bloom&quot; or &quot;Murder in the Solid State&quot;, but hiding behind it are layers of technical and human detail that lend this book the feel of a genuine classic.The world and characters are quirky and compelling. Never mind that the sun is going to be crushed into a black hole, I wanted to live here anyway. The author's love of the place is obvious and infectious. The story moves from court politics to murder to battles in space, heady sf fare with a hard strange twist, but the opening and closing scenes which bookend this action set it apart, as a work of genuine thought and depth. I've read it twice in six months, and still want more."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"The Collapsium is McCarthy's best story to date. The story is lively and entertaining, with lots of new technology adequately explained for us non-physicists. I found the main character, Bruno, to be a more human and likeable protagonist than McCarthy's prior protagonists. All in all, an excellent story for readers who enjoy hard science fiction."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"Collapsium is the start of a series of novels that follow in its wake. Curiously, the opening act is actually far worse than what is to follow: \\"Wellstone,\\" \\"Lost in Translation,\\" and \\"To Crush the Moon\\" provide both better entertainment and better exploration of the implications of the marvelous technology that Maccarthy dreams up. So let us be clear on what Collapsium is and what it is not:1) It IS a great appendix to reading the aforementioned novels. Besides having a scientific (sci-fi) appendix of its own that explains the (hypothetical) physics behind the technology, Collapsium is really kind of an appendix in its own right, and a decent enough reference to backgrounds of characters that are more fully developed in later novels.2) It IS a book full of imaginative ideas. Sometimes overly so. Maccarthy's physics is solid, while his speculations on future physics span the full range of plausibility, from \\"maybe\\" to \\"no way!\\" - but all of it is imaginative, interesting, and good fun to think about.3) It is NOT a particularly good novel in its own right. Really, the book consists of three somewhat independent and weak novellas: though ordered chronologically they do not share the coherence of ordinary chapters in a single book, and each presents an adventure of its own. The plot (or plots) are not all that engrossing, mainly because they all have a very simple \\"hero vs disaster\\" or \\"hero vs villain + disaster\\" linearity to them. And since these types of plotlines invariably end with a triumph of our hero, the intrigue is, for the most part, not there. Finally, as other reviewers have mentioned, the character development is somewhat lackluster.The main raison d'etre for this book, as I see it, is that ideas in it have great POTENTIAL for a full-fledged development. Chief among these is not programmable matter or instant comminication afforded by the collapsiter grids, but the achievement of immorbidity. From this novel alone, it is hard to say what the author makes of it, but the promise is there.So let me conclude with a recommendation. Skip this one and go straight for \\"Wellstone.\\" If you enjoy it (which you should), but find yourself wanting details on the background of the Queendom of Sol, its historical figures, and its technological marvels, THEN read Collapsium."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"In the 24th century, mankind has elected a queen and a fascination with a scientist who fears social entanglements so much he creates his own private planet to work alone.

Take your time with this one and it may well repay the investment."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"This is one of the most original works of SF that I have seen in a while. Of all the stories that deal with the subject of black holes, I don't think it ever occured to anyone before that they can be mere tools in the hands of humans. What would that mean for human endeavors and history?McCarthy creates a world where this does happen, and it so happens that a public works project goes awry, the consequence would be the death of the sun! Oops. It would be a spoiler to tell you what happens.There are some disturbing aspects to this world that arises from very specualtive technology. For example, they have &quot;fax&quot; machines that can transmit a human from one place to another, a form of travel. But the device can also be used to create a complete duplicate of that person. With memories and everything, the duplicate has no idea that they are not the original. The problem is that the law is that the duplicate does not have any legal rights whatsoever. Imagine an enemy being able to steal a copy of you and torture that copy for their own amusement, then dispose of and then go get another. Would that bother you? Yikes.Very much worth it."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"This one really took me away from the humdrum of 21st century earth. McCarthy takes you on a wild ride where physics is almost magic. I had a great time with this one!"},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"______________________________________Rating: science \\"A+\\", fiction \\"B-\\" -- a dazzling hard-SF opening fades to melodrama. Worth reading for the opener and the bleeding-edge sci-tech.The Collapsium opens with a wonderful novella,\\"Once Upon a Matter Crushed\\" (first published in SF Age 5/99). In the late 25th century, in the eighth decade of the Queendom of Sol, gravitation and the zero-point field are pretty well understood. \\"Neubles,\\" diamond-clad neutronium spheres, are in everyday use -- a standard industrial neuble masses a billion tonnes, and has a radius of 2.67 cm. Our Hero, superscientist Bruno de Towaji, is experimenting with collapsium, a dangerous, metastable material made of proton-size black holes, when he receives a Royal Summons: the new near-solar collapsiter ring is unstable, and will fall into the sun (and eat it) unless Something is Done....The book is written in an engaging neo-Victorian style -- McCarthy's first experiment with literary Style, vs. his previous 'transparent' prose. I liked it. Witty repartee, amusing pratfalls and shrewd insights abound. Bruno meets a well-married couple at a celebrity fund-raiser on Maxwell Montes, Venus: \\"The love, shyness and exasperation between them radiated out in invisible rays, like infrared. Warming.\\" Befuddled by a bottomless beer mug, Bruno warms to the pitch: \\"Would, ah, would a hundred trillion dollars be enough?\\"McCarthy's sci-tech extrapolation is exotic, fun and reasonably plausible. He's clearly done his homework -- the book includes 30 pages of appendices, a glossary, technical notes (including the working equations to synthesize neubles), and respectable references. Fun stuff (really!), one of the highlights of the book.The range and depth of McCarthy's imagined technologies are dazzling -- I'm reminded of Drexler's pioneering \\"Engines of Creation,\\" and I hope McCarthy (or someone) does a speculative-science article on the technological implications, if the zero-point field explanation for gravity turns out to be correct. (If you've seen one, I'd appreciate hearing about it.) Lots more neat SF ideas where these came from....So I was really pumped, reading the first hundred pages -- cool science, nice Style, nifty characters, a big-screen space-opera storyline. What's not to like?Well, the rest of the book? The first thud comes when Bruno is recalled to the inner system -- to fix the same problem again! Then he has to fix it a *third* time, with even sillier, pulpier results. His scientific competitor, and rival for the Queen's affection, turns out to be a really Horrid Villain.... And the characters are hard to kill, because they have backups, except when they don't -- but wait, maybe they do, after all.... And characters start acting, well, out of character. And there's a pointless, dangling subplot, among other loose ends. I suppose McCarthy intended to write a good old-fashioned super-science melodrama, except with real science -- but the last two-thirds of the book just didn't work, for me anyway. Dammit.Which is a pity, because \\"Crushed\\" is brilliant, and the science is so cool. Oh well -- I'd rather read an ambitious failure than a potboiler. If you're already a McCarthy fan, or crave bleeding-edge hard SF, you won't want to miss The Collapsium -- the good parts anyway. And who knows, your tolerance for melodrama may be higher than mine -- other reviewers have been more generous.But if you're new to McCarthy, I'd start with Bloom or another, earlier book -- and you should try him, he's very good. Usually. Maybe next time he should coast a little on the science -- both the Bloom and Collapsium universes have plenty of room for more stories -- and work harder on the fiction.review copyright 2000 by Peter D.

But I'm glad they published it again.Like one of the reviews says, this book's really a fairy tale.No, seriously, it's a scifi told in a very fairy-tale-y style. Even the ending ends like a fairy tale! But I loved it!The hero is a bit too whiny, but it works well with the story, so the effect is Ok overall. I love the queen and the Queendom. I know she's not supposed to be European as she came from one of the pacific islands, but the image that always seem to come to mind is that of Natalie Portman as Amydalla.I also love the appendix and glossary! So unique! It's not creative, mind you - since technical papers do that a lot - but it *is* a good way to remove the clutter of back-stories and technical discussions that seem to get in the way of the main story (a feature especially prominent in scifi novels). The glossary/appendix also works well to enhance the equally novel super-science concepts of the book.Overall, a wonderful novel with a unique story-telling style that has a \\"fresh\\" feel to it. I'm definitely looking forward to the next book \\"The Wellstone\\"."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"'Light' on the science and heavy on fiction but fun to read and that the most important part."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"I need to preface this review by stating that I have no scientific background. I've never studied physics and have little to no interest in hard science fiction. That being said, I really enjoyed this book.My lack of scientific background helped me to enjoy this book much more than previous reviewers did. Many of the previous reviewers pointed out the scientific impossiblities (or implausibilities). My scientific ignorance allowed me to sit back and enjoy the ride. And a great ride it is. 'The Collapsium' is a great ride, much like the previous reviewer noted, in the tradition of the old SF pulps.The book is exciting, well-written with compelling characters. I enjoyed the main character's brilliance and his reclusive nature. Also the name, Bruno de Towaji, is tremendously fun to roll around in the mind. McCarthy seems to have a knack for creating interesting character names.I enjoyed everything about this book. If you're like me with little to no scientific background, you'll probably enjoy this one. If you are a quantum physicist who simply cannot get past scientific irregularities, you may want to stay away."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"This is the kind of book you can read to discuss with (and impress) your scientifically intellectual friends.Timewise, the story is set sometime in the next century or two, it is full of some cool \\"scientific breakthroughs\\", with detailed (and usually pretty interesting) theoretical explanations. A lot of the science is quite unique; like the Wellstone material that can quickly form into almost any other imaginable material, or the anti-gravityish \\"ertial\\" (opposite of inertial) technology Bruno(the main character) invents that helps to propel his \\"rescue ship\\" to near lightspeed.I wasn't used to the author's method of writing, so it felt a little odd reading the first chapter or so - but once I got used to it, the odd feeling wore off, and I found the book quite enjoyable, if not a quick read.In addition to the science, the reluctant-hero plight of most of the main characters is fairly interesting; but there could have been a bit more variety to these characters, with too many having the same traits.I got this book as part of the SFBC MONARCHS OF SOL anthology, and I'm moving on to the 2nd book of the set - THE WELLSTONE."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"&quot;The Collapsium&quot; is the kind of book that gets written when the character development nazis get hold of a good conceptual writer and convince him to turn his sf into a soap opera. This is an incredibly unballanced book. On the one hand it tries VERY hard to engage the reader on a social/character development level that reads like an adolescent fairytale (it also borrows HEAVILY from Michael Moorcock's Victorian writing style). Collapsium wants to be cute but ends up being tedious and umbelievable. I never once bought this story took place in a society of &quot;hundreds of billions&quot; as the story suggests. The depth just isn't there. On the other hand you have some very challenging and original scientific concepts which I, sf veteran though I am, had to read slowly and repeatedly to comprehend--including footnotes that direct the reader to the back of the book for more complete explanations. I like this, and I liked his earlier book, &quot;Bloom&quot;, for its straighforward, hard sf concepts. Mr. McCarthy is clearly at his best writing as an idea guy--something sf desperately needs more of! Readers like me will comb the shelves looking for new concepts like &quot;neubles&quot;, but we won't wade through a bunch of cutesy garbage."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"Don't get me wrong--this was a good book, I enjoyed reading it, and savored it up until the end. But apparently there are more books in this storyline, and I'm just not interested. That about sums up how I felt about this one.For this one, I want to contrast some pros and cons point-by-point.Pro: The characters are (mostly) interesting, and I wanted to see what happened with them. It's certainly outside my experience to come across a collapsium engineer, a madman who keeps cloned copies of his rivals to torture them, or a queen of the solar system.Con: The characters are kind of ridiculous. Bruno is just too smart and perfect to take seriously, and the few attempts to make him human (like getting drunk at a formal dinner through technology advanced enough to perform any sort of alchemy, but not keep dinner guests from getting drunk--give me a break!) just come across as something added on after the novel was written in a weak attempt to make him human.Pro: There are some neat technology ideas in this book, and they certainly play a part in the plot.Con: The ideas are really nothing novel. There's nothing here that hasn't been explored, and probably better, by other fiction authors. The author's book Hacking Matter is probably more interesting from a science (or sci-fi) point of view. It's not hard to read this book and say 'Why, oh why if they had this sort of technology would they still do things this way??' If people had the kind of technology this book proposes, they wouldn't be living like they do--their world would be very different. The book tries to cover for that in several ways, playing into the queendom conceit and pushing certain things off into the world of the insane, like making the bad guy the only one who makes major biological changes to people. Why wouldn't people do this to themselves if they could? I mean, people already get tattoos, which are permanent and have no tangible benefits. People don't have a history of avoiding body modifications, and if they have an economic advantage....Pro: The writing is pretty good, and the book was obviously edited and vetted by competent people. It was never painful to read, and many places were quite well written.Con: The style is totally contrived, though this is not unintentional. I assume the style is based on the Queendom setting of the book, and how the author thinks people in such an environment might behave, think, and write. It mostly works, but not until you're well into the book. By the end, I really didn't notice it, but it can be awkward at times. In the end, I can appreciate it, but I'm not sure if it totally worked.Overall, this was a pretty good sci-fi story, but not a book I'll remember a year from now."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"This truly is hard science fiction. Its good stuff. None of this Lois Mcmaster Bujold garbage, this guy actually understands what sci fi is.Only complaint is that there was not enough action, most the plot is a psychological/scientific battle between two supergenius' about who can solve a problem the fastest and in the most ingenious fashion."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"Decent book. The plus side is that it is readable, but there are some serious flaws as well. First of, the book starts off like a collection of short stories but when it finally settles into the main plot it is pretty good reading for a while.Writing of a future where absolute death is almost unheard of is difficult, because there is so little to care about. As Orson Scott Card cleverly showed in The Worthing Saga, there is no greatness or heroism if nothing bad can happen to a person. So it takes careful writing to keep the world interesting in these times. And Wil is able to do that for the most part with threats to all of humanity and interesting characters.But then there's the ending...Very lame. Without giving too much away, a main character dies, is grieved for, and then comes back to life for a \\"happily ever after\\" ending.Don't kill the character for impact if you are going to magically ressurect the character at the end of the book. That is lame.P.S. One other thing - I keep seeing \\"hard sci-fi\\" bandied around in these reviews. I think that is by people who don't have a scientific background because I do and I didn't see Wil's \\"science\\" as hard. It is more akin to the relationship between \\"hard witchcraft\\" and \\"Harry Potter witchcraft.\\" This is fantasy sci-fi, not hard sci-fi. It is clever and it is logical enough to carry the story forward, but it isn't based on much in the way of real science."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"Let's, see, in _The Collapsium_ we have two mad scientists -- one malevolent, the other merely socially retarded -- vying for the affections of the Queen of the Solar System. In their final confrontation each one pulls out his super-weapons, one of them invented on the spot, to foil each other's advanced technologies. Oh, and the fate of both the sun and the human race are at stake.Haven't we seen SCORES of stories like that already?Still, I found myself entertained, despite my observation that if you've read a couple dozen science fiction novels, you've pretty much read them all. I liked McCarthy's description of how the characters deal with the existence of multiple copies of themselves made possible with their matter-faxing technology, and how said gadget keeps them &quot;immorbid,&quot; that is, no longer vulnerable to disease and the programmed deterioration we call aging. And his description of the protean &quot;wellstone&quot; technology just barely sounds plausible, since as I recall from my college chemistry, the chemical properties of matter depend entirely on what the outermost electrons are doing. By manipulating the quantum states of electrons using advanced silicon chips, you could conceivably have a programmable sort of matter like wellstone that can assume the chemical characteristics of most physically possible solids, if not the physically impossible ones McCarthy alludes to.Despite the recycling of very old science-fictional ideas, this novel is worth a read, though I recommend waiting for the paperback."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"I *really* wanted to love this book. I was excited when it came out because of the author's background as a *real* rocket scientist. But, after spending hours trying to understand the first two pages with the science of Collapsiums and such, and frantically flipping to the apendices, I must say the science is too much. I am a Software Engineer with a BSEE and I can't understand a word of the science. One must come equipped with an advanced physics degree it seems. However, it isn't all a total loss. The story is a typical but nice fantasy story. The theory of fax transfer of people is intriguing."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"This is a strange and confusing book.

The science was too incredulous for my taste. The characters were not developed well. I didn't sympathize with Bruno when he lost his love Tamra. The ending was trite. It was more of a magical fairy tale with confusing science."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"Wil McCarthy's new novel, The Collapsium, is built around such scientific speculations based on &quot;edge science&quot; ideas like using black holes as elementary particles. McCarthy plays happily with these ideas, treating them in almost a Tom-Swift fashion, which makes for an implausible but fun SF novel.The book is set several centuries in the future, or, as the opening line declares, &quot;in the eighth decade of the Queendom of Sol&quot;. The social setting for McCarthy's baroque scientific speculations is thus appropriately baroque. The Solar System is united under a monarchy, and the ruler is the heir to the only monarchy that has survived to this time: the Queen of Tonga, Tamra Lutui. The central character is Bruno de Towangi, a brilliant scientist from Catalonia, now living a hermit's life in the Kuiper Belt, on an artificial planet, playing with miniature black holes arranged to form the &quot;element&quot; collapsium, trying to see the end of time. Bruno is a Declarant-Philander, a title which reflects both his high scientific achievements, and his status as former official lover of the &quot;Virgin&quot; Queen, Tamra.As the novel begins Bruno is summoned by his Queen back to the inner Solar System to solve a problem with the Ring Collapsiter, a ring of collapsium which his rival Marlon Sykes is building around the Sun. This ring will allow faster than light travel and communications, improving on the current system of &quot;faxes&quot;, by which people travel at light speed anywhere there is a receiving station, making copies of themselves, copies which retain their memories, and which also can be &quot;edited&quot; to correct internal problems. Thus, humans may have also become immortal.The novel has three sections which involve successive efforts by Bruno to save the Sun. McCarthy keeps on multiplying his weird scientific speculations: adding in such ideas as &quot;true vacuum&quot;, elimination of inertia, electromagnetic grapples, and so on. All this is on the one hand pretty fun, but on the other hand not wholly believable. It's not so much the science itself that is unbelievable: sure, it's all speculative, and probably mostly not very likely to be true, but that's all part of the game, and all the weird stuff is pretty well (for some value of &quot;pretty well&quot;) explained in a series of appendices. Rather, Bruno's Tom Swift-like ability to whip up new gadgets base on the new science in quick time becomes somewhat implausible.That said, given the rather light tone of the whole book (albeit a tone which is at odds with any thought for the millions of innocents who die), it all ends up being quite entertaining. The science is larger-than-life, and so are the characters. Neither is quite believable in a realistic fashion, but both are acceptable within the conventions of this book. It's baroque, superscientific, stuff: kind of like bad '30s pulp SF rewritten to be a pretty good new millennium (almost!) take on those old tropes. It's not great SF, but it's good fun, and full of neat and wild ideas."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"This is the story of the future and the people who molded it and lived it.

Although the science is a little fuzzy this led to the creation of the greatest of inventions, \\"The Fax\\", which could not only send a clone of a person to another location but simultaneously fixed all that was wrong with the copy. In other words, it guaranteed imortality.The world of the future is a matriarchy with a Virgin Queen (who just happens to love our hero). An arch-villian, a desolute madman with the charms of a playboy, sets on a course that will destroy the Solar System. It sounds outlandish but the way the future is presented, particularly with well stone and the amazing nano-technology (the descriptions are perfect), is truly amazing. The tone and setting \\"sound\\" plausible. Especially endearing was the way the hero allowed one robot to develop on his own.This was an unlikely hit, mostly underground, the story carried by word of mouth. I'd love to see this on the big screen but shudder at the horror that the editors would do - they would butcher the story, reduce it to a royal affair with about as much seriousness as a Mars candy bar. The success of this book generaged another by the author, a sequeal of sorts. I can't wait to find out what happens!"},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"How would people behave given the ability to &quot;fax&quot; themselves anywhere--incidentally eliminating mortality as if it were a bug in our operating system? What issues would arise that even they wouldn't expect?This is a book of questions, with a hard SF setting. Highly recomended."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"There's a lot of marketing done in the SF publishing world, where the marketing isn't reflecting the book properly. Many marketing departments like to through around the phrase \\"hard sci-fi\\" because they think SF readers will think it's a serious SF novel. When, in reality, it dabbles in some hypothetical physics and that's about it. NOW, when it comes to The Collapsium, the marketing department completely left out the phrase \\"hard sci-fi\\" for reasons I'm unaware of. The Collapsium is pinnacle of hard SF with enough physics, appendices, definitions and scientific dialogue to easily last you through til the end.Basically, the book is VERY much like George O' Smith's 1947 Venus Equilateral short stories which a group of communication scientists think up crackpot solutions to crackpot problems using vacuum tube technology. Here in Collapsium, Bruno (the main character and hermit scientist extraordinaire) is consulted by the Queen of the Queendom to help them solve some massively erroneous problems involving the fate the of the sun and Her resulting Queendom. The first problem-solution story takes up the first 25% of the book while the second problem-solution story takes up an equal amount of pages. The last story isn't so much problem-solution as it is a culmination of characters and plot details into one large grand finale.In between this wilderness of hard SF and plot rummaging is a wide spread of wry humor, which McCarthy expertly sprinkles into the lapses of the plot. A reoccurring joke involves a \\"freed\\" robot, which Bruno cut from the House AI so it could it could experience a sense of freedom even though, in itself, has no ambitions. Instead, the robot occasionally says \\"Mewl\\" in random scenes.All in all, a great book except for the predictable plot-flow of a problem-solution-style format."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"Easily one of the most enchanting, touching, books I have read in a long time. Do yourself a favor: just read the first few pages. You'll be immediately hooked!"},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"The Collapsium is one of the best books I've read. It has a style that is reminescent of earlier pulp sci-fi stories, and yet all its own. This is the first book by Wil McCarthy I've read, and I was impressed. McCarthy's writing style in this book is quite entertaining and laden with wry humor, and is intelligent throughout.I won't go through what the story's about; the book description does a good enough job of that. I must admit that at first it failed to really capture my interest, but once the element of sabotage came in, the plot really started gathering momentum and I was drawn in. The storyline is well-concieved, and I really liked the characters in this book - especially the endearing robot, Hugo. I found that idea interesting. The lighthearted tone that seems to pervade most of this book is dashed to pieces around the beginning of the third section, where the cataclysmic peril comes into play and people actually get killed. The world McCarthy created in The Collapsium is really intriguing. Even I'd like to live there. This book is, in my opinion, a terriffic read."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"The Collapsium is a novel of the intermediate future. Many years from now, at least a century and probably more, mankind has machines that can build anything from a pattern, including the human body. Moreover, these facsimile (or fax) machines can be connected to transmitters and receivers to send one or more copies of someone's body pattern to other locations on the planets or in space and then to merge the copies back to a single individual. All illness, injuries, and aging are filtered out of the body pattern during transmission, thereby ensuring effective immorbidity and extreme longevity for everyone.Now that everyone is planning on living forever and has all the wealth that they can possibly use, mankind has become tired of democracy and individual responsibility, so they have created the Queendom of Sol. Fortunately, one royal personage remains after all the years of slaughtering monarchs to obtain liberty: Princess Tamatra Litui of the tiny kingdom of Tonga. Without asking her opinion on the matter, mankind has elected her Queen of Sol with an overwhelming majority and has carefully ensured that she has responsibilities, obligations and moral authority, but no real power. Furthermore, mankind has decided that she should be the Virgin Queen, but her first official act as Queen was to Censure all involved in forcing the position upon her, then her second act was to ensure that her virginity would be renewed as needed, and her third act was to call for suitors.In this novel, Bruno de Towaji is a Declarant-Philander; that is, he has been granted the highest honor in the Kingdom for his construction of the Iscog (Inner-System Collapsiter Grid) linking the inner planets and he has been further honored as one of the Queen's consorts. He is also unbelievably rich from his royalties from Iscog; for example, he donates a hundred trillion dollars to the Venus terraforming effort. Bruno has spent the last eleven years alone on his tiny world with its miniature mountains, low-flying clouds, and neubles to provide gravity. He is attempting to build an Arc de Fin, to see the light at the end of the universe. However, trouble comes knocking in the form of the Queen herself.While Bruno has been away, Declarant-Philander Marlon Sykes has started a giant project to build a bypass collapsiter ring around Sol to speed messages and matter patterns through the inner-system. However, a solar flare has knocked many grapple stations offline and the incomplete ring is dropping inward. Although Marlon and others have tried everything that they can conceive to slow or reverse the fall, nothing has worked and they are running out of time. Tamra asks that Bruno come to assist in the recovery and he agrees.In this novel, Bruno and Marlon are understandably uneasy around each other. Both are Declarants, an elite group of only twenty-nine persons in the entire history of the Queendom. Moreover, they are both former consorts of the Queen and both are still deeply enamored with her, although she is partial to Bruno. Nevertheless, they are both genius-level scientists, far superior to any other person in the Queendom, and neither has any other peers, so they can only really talk shop with each other.Bruno has problems fitting into Queendom society, yet the public seems to lionize him. He keeps making faux pas in conversation and behavior, but the people forgive him. He can't understand what they want from him and it deeply embarrasses him that he doesn't know how to meet their expectations. Moreover, they cut into his think time, so he goes off to his little world and works.This story is mostly about the maturation of Bruno. Although he is continually being asked to solve complicated problems, they present no real difficulties, at least not as much as his relationships with Tamra and others whom he meets and likes.This story is also full of wonders, scientific and technological marvels based on bleeding edge speculations in contemporary Physics. While many similar ideas have been around for some time, current speculations in science and technology have provided new rationales for such notions. Much of this future technology is based on collapsium, particle sized structures constructed from synthetic black holes. Another technology of the future is wellstone, artificial atoms constructed from semiconductor chips, that can be programmed to emulate any kind of matter.Overall, this novel has almost everything a hard science fiction story should have. Maybe Bruno makes the solutions seem too easy, but he IS a supergenius. While the plot is fantastic and old-fashioned, it is not improbable. The characters are unusual, yet consistent with their histories. The dialogue is flamboyant, but so are the times. A very enjoyable read.Highly recommended for McCarthy fans and anyone else who enjoys hard science fiction stories with decent plots and good characterization."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"This is a sweet little gem of a book that combines good storytelling with wild science that really hangs together quite well.Since I see so many glowing reviews (and really agree with most of them), let me just tell you what disappointed me about the Collapsium: the story is brilliant and witty as it begins and seems to become less so as it progresses, until at ending (despite saving the solar system several times) our protagonists are roughed up and punished with imposed roles as &quot;fitting rewards&quot; to their efforts.An interesting comment on the culture created here, but a bit of a downer for this reader.I enjoyed the craft and storytelling, loved the characters and science, but found an entertaining read becoming too suddenly grim and sad."},{"Title":"The Collapsium","review":"McCarthy builds a world that continues to surprise throughout the entire book.

Just without the heartburn. The characters are more well developed than in some hard scifi, the science side of it was well presented. Bruno was so easy to relate to he made a great lens for the challenges that would be faced by an immorbid society.i want to call what i loved about this book its realism. Most other scifi involving grand feats of engineering just describe the physics and then everything works perfectly and the thing is built. As if, in the future, murphy's law no longer exists. In this book people begin enormous enterprises and then are suddenly in danger of destroying everything because the thing didn't work the way in reality that it did on paper. Maybe sometimes the flashes of insight are a little better-timed than in real life, but it's fiction, that's okay. The characters make good sense, and certain parts of the story that you think will be forgotten are nicely pulled in throughout. I was so in love with Bruno and with Hugo. I could really identify with Bruno's hermit-ting, and think McCarthy did an excellent job conveying the personality and lifestyle of this character. If you know anyone with a great big brain you might relate. The rest of the series leaves much to be desired, but this book really shines.The second book in this series was by comparison totally dreadful. I didn't read the third out of the fear that it would ruin the series for me. The fourth (to crush the moon) redeemed the second somewhat but was still less well organized than the this.

Dealing with the restructuring of troubled companies, an insider's view is provided on the methods and complexities of this fascinating area of investment banking. It demystifies what investment bankers really do and conveys difficult concepts in easily understandable terms. Particular focus is directed to unconflicted advice to boards of directors interested in recoveries of shareholders. Attorneys, accountants, crisis mangers, business students, judges, and investment bankers--as well as management and directors of distressed companies--all will find this book of interest.From the Beard Books press release:No company sets out to become financially distressed. Yet, every year, many public and private companies default on their indebtedness. Almost invariably, the company loses value as a result of the ensuing damage: shareholder value erodes, competitors encroach as they perceive financial weakness, key employees leave, management is distracted by financial crises, and boards of directors are faced with new challenges, duties and potential liabilities. Once this vicious cycle starts, it is critical to stop the erosion of value. Henry F. Owsley and Peter S. Kaufman are highly respected leaders in the field of distressed investment banking. As founding partner and managing director, respectively, for New York-based investment bank Gordian Group, LLC, Owsley and Kaufman are experts at overcoming the complex financial challenges that befall companies in distress.In Distressed Investment Banking: To The Abyss and Back, Owsley and Kaufman provide an insider's viewpoint on the methods and complexities of restructuring troubled companies in this fascinating area of investment banking. Distressed Investment Banking demystifies what investment bankers really do and conveys difficult concepts in easily understandable terms. The authors take readers through the general processes associated with consummating a distressed M&A; transaction, as well as internal financial restructuring and beyond. They reveal the typical mindset of the different parties involved (such as the senior lender, subordinated debt holder, and vulture investor) and explore their respective goals and game plans in a financial restructuring. As Owsley and Kaufman explain, because they face a broad array of issues within the narrow field of distressed investment banking, the tools of the trade comprise a working expertise and conversance with finance, valuation, law, taxes, capital markets and the trading of securities, as well as old-fashioned horse-trading sense. Precisely because all of these skills are needed, there is no substitute for experience and seasoned judgment. They reveal and explain the skills most critical to be effective, including: How to impose order onto chaos How to gain the confidence of boards of directors Tips for advising courses of action, in the midst of great uncertainty Understanding valuation as precisely as possible How to design and implement effective financial strategies, with the legal and tax implications of each in mind How to negotiate effectively with creditors and financing sources How to run a competitive merger processes in the face of incredible adversity.They also delve deep into such complex areas of restructuring as equity and enterprise valuation, debt capacity, valuation third-party options and internal plans of reorganization. As Owsley and Kaufman attest, they have long been aware that the financial literature is bereft of thoughtful reflection and insights on distressed investment banking. Determined to fill that void, they present in Distressed Investment Banking the lessons they've learned in their years of practice to shine some light on the dark world of distressed companies and provide illumination for those who, by choice or of necessity, journey into these parts.Distressed Investment Banking is a book every distressed market professional will want in their bookcase.From Barry Ridings, Co-Head of Lazard Freres & Co.

Briggs also revised Chapter 8 of Oliver Elton's translation of Yevgeny Onegin, which he describes in the Introduction as, \\"A few stanzas from the end of the novel are included here in order to give a general impression of how the novel works.\\" (p. xvii).

The first paragraph on page xvi attempts to show how the poems \\"are grouped roughly thematically,\\" into the order in which the themes are encountered in the first poem in this book, \\"Winter. What shall we do out in the country?\\" Pushkin's major themes are identified as the personal, the natural world, poetry, love, some poems of ideas, and his poems on those topics comprise the first half of the book. The longer works in the final portion of the book include the concluding stanzas of YEVGENY ONEGIN (which has 366 stanzas altogether), Chapter 8, Stanzas 33-51.The poems \\"Remembrance\\" and \\"Elegy\\" are mentioned as examples of a Pushkinian philosophy of life. Thoughts \\"Settle in limpid twilight languidly distilled,\\" as the third line of the poem \\"Remembrance\\" puts it. Pushkin is capable of other feats, and the introduction observes that one long poem, \\"(known in Russian as \`Gavriiliada' after the angel Gabriel) is an overtly sacreligious re-enactment of several Bible stories (Adam and Eve, Joseph and Mary, the Annunciation, etc.) run together into an extended sexual romp.\\" (p. xviii). This kind of thing is usually considered a catastrophe, as far as serious philosophy is concerned, and \\"In its day Pushkin could not acknowledge authorship; neither could Russian criticism until recently.\\" (p. xviii). It reminds me of the poem, \\"the boys i mean are not refined,\\" by e. e. cummings, which was only included in a limited edition of nine copies of his book, NO THANKS, in 1935, but was dropped in subsequent editions until after his death in 1962. Similarly, the introduction by A. D. P. Briggs notices Pushkin's use of \\"swearwords in \`The Waggon of Life',\\" (p. xix) which Briggs called, \\"language unusable until recent times in both Russia and England.\\" (p. xvii). Anything that I might say about such language might be considered totally off the subject here, but a revisionist view of the relationship between poetry and philosophy might make some personal comments appropriate here.As author of the unpublished, unedited, and largely unwritten MY VIETNAM WAR JOKE BOOK, any claim that I might make to knowledge of philosophy is highly suspect, similarly to the status achieved by Martin Heidegger when he is considered the Nazi philosopher. In my case, the must dubious aspect of convergence might be expressed by using the phrase *peace with honor* instead of any swearword that might appear. This could be catastrophic for the poetic values involved, but purely for philosophical reasons, I would like to insert *peace with honor* in place of the swearwords in Pushkin's poem, \\"The Waggon of Life.\\" The second and third stanza become:We climb aboard the boards at dawnFull of wild devilment and crowing;Spurning the lanquid life with scorn,We cry, \`Go on, get *peace with honor* going!'But by midday we've lost that boldness,Feeling the wagon shake and judder.Dread are the heights and dizzy gorges,We cry, \`Slow down you silly *peace with honor*!'A few things about this book seemed British to me.

However, I was somewhat disappointed in this book. It definitely has beautiful pictures, many inspiring projects, and offers alternative ways of doing the projects, for example, alternative wefts. But the long chapter on how to warp a loom was, in my opinion, not necessary, as that topic is covered in many other weaving books. I think a few hints about her special techniques would have sufficed.I would have preferred more coverage of block theory to provide a broader basis for understanding the structure of rep weave. The chapter on designing your own rep weave projects was particularly disappointing since there was no discussion of blocks or how to design block weavings. It is basically a list of rules which are somewhat helpful but very thin in explanation.A major problem I encountered is typos in the project notes. The project I am doing (the blue and white table runner) has a typo in the profile draft and the shafts are reversed in the treadle tie up.I would still buy this book, and I would suggest anyone interested in rep weave consider buying it, mainly because I can't find any other books on rep weave. However, in my opinion, it is incomplete and doesn't serve up its promise.A weaver."},{"Title":"Rep Weave and Beyond (The Weaver's Studio series)","review":"Rep Weave and Beyond is a joy to look at and read. As a weaver of many years, this is at the top of my list of inspirational books. First of all, it's visually beautiful, being filled with full-color photographs of the author's work, which is gorgeous. Ms. Tallarovic lives in Arizona, and she draws inspiration for her elegant color ways from the hues of the southwest: ecru, gold, bronze, terra cotta, reds, greens, dusky purples, and turquoise. She seems to be comfortable using both earth tones as well as more vibrant colors. She has based many of her designs on Native American weavings and pottery patterns. These are sensitive interpretations done with respect for the traditions she borrows from, and her incorporation of the patterns into a European weave structure works very well aesthetically.Second, the book is filled with projects which are clearly explained down to the last minute detail, along with color photos of each finished piece. The author lays a good foundation for these project recipes in the first section of the book, where she outlines her method of winding a warp, dressing the loom, tying on, weaving a heading, in short--all the preliminaries every weaver should know. Beginner weavers should find the instructions manageable.Ms. Tallarovic wrote this book for weavers who want to explore rep weave, but for whom the traditional Scandinavian technique might be out of reach. Due to the very close warp setts used in the traditional version of this weave, getting a good shed on a jack loom can be a problem. In addition, weaving rugs with setts of 90 ends per inch might be beyond the patience level of many people.To make rep weave more \\"weaver friendly,\\" the author has spent years experimenting with using thicker threads at lower setts. All of the projects in this book can be woven using Maysville cotton carpet warp, which comes in over 40 colors. Using the Maysville cotton, her designs can be warped using setts of between 16 and 40 ends per inch. These warps do not completely cover the weft, which ends up, as she notes, \\"producing a livelier, more dynamic surface.\\" From what I could see in the photographs, she is correct in that regard.Also, as she uses printed fabric for many of her thick wefts, a layered effect happens when the block patterning of the warp threads floats over the printed pattern of the woven fabric strips. A further innovation she has come up with is using many colors in the pattern warp, rather than the traditional two colors.Perhaps what I like most about this book is seeing how someone can bring a traditional weave forward into the present. Ms. Tallarovic has furthered the evolution of this ancient weaving form. She has added to its visual excitement, made it more accessible to the average weaver, and shown how patient experimentation can add new life to a tried and true technique. There are so many directions each individual weaver can go with this method of weaving once s/he has mastered what the author offers in the book. I can envision using painted warps and/or hand-dyed or painted wefts. I can also see using oriental papers as wefts as well. That would be only a beginning."},{"Title":"Rep Weave and Beyond (The Weaver's Studio series)","review":"I bought this book with high hopes of learning the finer details of rep weave, but was dissappointed.

But O'Pray writes in a clear, accessible style, and though he analyzes few of the films at length or in depth, this kind of analysis can be filled in by the instructor's supplementary handouts and by class discussion.Overall, a highly recommended text for film instructors who teach undergraduate classes in experimental film."},{"Title":"Avant-Garde Film: Forms, Themes and Passions (Short Cuts)","review":"One of the major stumbling blocks for people first starting out on the winding road into the world of avant-garde film, is not so much the films, but the theory. The films are perfectly understandable if one is well versed in the techniques of cinema, in identifying those aspects of film form that oppose the mainstream and therefore can be broadly classified as avant-garde. The films are often playful, a complex game between audience and filmmaker is often played out and generally, to be just able to say what you see is enough to get by in terms of academic study. However most avant-garde filmmakers are not content with putting their theories onto screen, they also put them into print. The writing is a lot more complicated and dare I say it on occasion indecipherable than the films themselves. This is understandable when these artists clearly feel they have a cultural hierarchy to maintain. This makes Michael O'Pray's introduction to the major issues, figures and debates in avant-garde all the more enjoyable. It is accessible and readable and doesn't assume any pre-knowledge of the reader. It sets it stall out as a simple introduction and takes an historical approach to the development of avant-garde film. For those seeking something more deeper and more in depth, this slim tome will offer nothing new, but for film students and the casual reader this is an excellent starting point on this subject."},{"Title":"Equality (Halley Stewart lectures)","review":"A wonderful book that questions the equality and liberty of Britains pre-WWII.

Thank goodness it isn't! There are plenty of New England cookbooks and restaurant guides, but *this* book isn't meant to be either. Instead, it's a travel guide centered around local foods. &quot;Eating New England&quot; directs you to places where people make and sell good food and don't mind putting the process on display, from farmstands to factories, so that you can not only get something tasty and locally produced but also learn a little something about where food comes from. The book is a good resource for planning road trips, or for checking out what local food producers you can visit in a given area.If you live in New England, you probably already know where in your area you can pick your own berries or apples, or where you can find the closest place to eat lobster caught in sight of your table, or where you can buy goat cheese and pet the goats that helped make it, but if you're even an hour away from home and care about this sort of thing then you'll want this book.I should point out that there are a few restaurants which seem to have been included because they showcase local foods, but they're not the focus of the book. There are also a couple of recipes as a bonus, but if they'd included more recipes and restaurants there wouldn't have been room for the more interesting stuff you can't find easily elsewhere."},{"Title":"Eating New England: A Food Lover's Guide to Eating Locally","review":"A must for all food lovers traveling to New England.

As Mumon has observed in the _Gateless Gate_, &quot;Joshu's tongue has no bone, so he can speak freely.&quot; That freedom is exactly what is communicated by these aphorism. Admittedly, some are hard too understand, but other strike the soul like lightning. These are the words of a man who underwent the shattering experience of enlightenment, and the book conveys that sense of power and transcendence."},{"Title":"The Recorded Sayings of Zen Master Joshu (Sacred Literature Series)","review":"As Korean Zen master Seung Sahn often described koans as fish hooks-Joshu's sayings are much the same way. This book is nearly impossible to approach via the intellect, the entire work is a koan. This book is much like &quot;The Zen Teachings of Master Lin-Chi&quot;, also published by Shambhala, very esoteric and highly engaging. If you want a book that is more &quot;entertaining&quot; in the conventional sense, try a book of any modern master. If you are looking for what Zen sounded like and meant to our earliest of lineages long ago, then this book is just for you.Zen master Joshu was a VERY influential master in Zen history, accredited with 5 koans in The Gateless Gate &amp; 12 koans in the Blue Cliff Record. The book is not an easy read, and at first it may even bore you. This is true. But through the years your curiousity will peak now and then, forcing you to pick the book up again and dust it off a bit. It's as if Joshu must marinate you for a bit, before your mind can open to what he is saying. Read this book attentively and try not to think too much while pouring over it, this alone may be your most baffling rival. Your own thinking. Listen to Joshu, not you! I hope you get through the tough process of reading it once, and come back to it over and over again-because it is so confusing. In essence, I hope you find Joshu to be a crazy old friend.Enjoy:)"},{"Title":"The Recorded Sayings of Zen Master Joshu (Sacred Literature Series)","review":"This is one of those enigmatic works that's definitely not easy to figure out. Joshu, of course was one of the great Zen masters of Ancient China. He's especially known for his Mu answer in response to the question does a dog have a Buddha nature. This work expounds on the collected sayings of Joshu. It's only 180 or so pages and divided into small stanzas and what-not. However, it takes a while for this stuff to sink in because you can't really understand it by using your intellectual mind. My suggestion is to read the book through the first time without letting yourself get caught up in trying to decipher it. Let it settle into your mind like a pebble settling onto the bottom of a body of water and then come back to it. It's definitely not an introductory work for the novice wanting to learn about Zen or something like that. These are ancient collected sayings which are really one large koan. I do recommend the book for people seriously interested in Zen study, but I won't suggest this for anyone just wanting to learn a general knowledge about Zen. This book wasn't quite as rich as I expected and therefore I was a little disappointed but I suppose there is still some merit in it."},{"Title":"3D Contrast MR Angiography","review":"Clearly written and concise.

Exploring the wartime experiences of Mary Kimoto, a young Nisei (second generation Japanese American) from rural California who travels to Japan and is subsequently trapped in that country during World War II, the letters in this book give tremendous voice to the experiences of this Kibei woman. Kibei were Japanese Americans partially educated in Japan before returning to the US to reside permanently. While the exact number of Kibei is unknown, they are estimated to have numbered into the thousands. While many Nisei went abroad for study tours (kengakudan) sponsored by local immigrant newspapers, an relatively smaller group went to Japan for long-term study or work. Full of warmth, humor, and pain, Tomita's letters to her best friend Miye betray the somber realities of being a minority among the Japanese. It adds a unique chapter to the history of American racism, the wartime incarceration of Japanese Americans, and Japanese history. All this, and so much more. This was a wonderfully crafted, expertly edited text that should be on the shelves of anyone interested in issues of biculturalism, racism, and Japanese American history. I cannot recommend this book enough, and will be sure to assign it in my university courses."},{"Title":"Dear Miye: Letters Home from Japan, 1939-1946","review":"bought this for a college class back at Mills in '06.

Screaming With Joy gives a brief overview of the life of the poet from his birth to his death, focusing primarily on his experiences and the social and political environments that made him what he was. If you do not know much about this incredible man and powerful poet this book is an excellent starting point; if you are familiar with Ginsberg you will definitely want to check out the over one hundred photographs and the quotations and anecdotes from his contemporaries that the book offers. All in all, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Screaming with Joy: The Life of Allen Ginsberg","review":"This isn't an in-depth look at Mr. Ginsberg's life by any means.

Ramesh's work is now on the short list of books that I will read every year. God blessed his labor as he wrote this life changing book."},{"Title":"Soul Passion: Embracing Your Life's Ultimate Purpose (The Intentional Life Trilogy)","review":"What do you love enough to die for?That's the question professor and philosopher Ramesh Richard asks in his latest book, SOUL PASSION. The first installment in The Intentional Life Trilogy, SOUL PASSION encourages the Christian reader to restructure his or her personal existence from aimless, random living to what Richard calls &quot;intentional&quot; living. The author envisions Christians who eschew mediocre, unexamined lives and consciously seek to do God's will. And the first step is identifying one's passion.&quot;Passion and intentionality are verbal and existential synonyms. Nobody follows passion unintentionally, or it wouldn't be passion. The first constituent of the intentional life, of the supreme purpose, is passion, for one chooses the ultimate object of his love. People choose what they are willing to live and die for, suffer and sacrifice for ... True passion considers the cost but still pursues the object passionately. That kind of passion launches intentional living with core love permeating every part of life. Your passion gives you convictions about what is ultra-important to you, the criteria by which all of life is driven, gains energy, and continues.&quot;This passion is the foundation of the metaphorical building that is an intentional life and Richard goes on to describe its components, encourage its wise development, and offer reminders to nurture it. As in Scripture, Richard emphasizes that it is Christ who should be our foundation --- our true passion.The author's insights are at their most keen when they expose our tendency to mistake activity for purpose, motion for intentionality. His lengthy introduction systematically attempts to create purpose apart from Christ, and he spends a great deal of time describing what an intentional life is not before delving into what an intentional life is.&quot;Systematic&quot; is an apt description of SOUL PASSION. While Richard offers many illustrations of his ideas, the book's outline is in clear view and can at times feel like a primer for a fill-in-the-blank exam. The author, an internationally known professor and doctor of philosophy, has obviously tried to write in an accessible manner, but there are inadvertent flexes of his academic muscle reflected in his systematic format and some vocabulary (nomenclature, ontological, etc.). The tradeoff is a more comprehensive look at the philosophical and biblical understanding of different approaches to life than most books in the genre offer.These characteristics of the book may be strengths or weaknesses depending on the proclivities of the individual reader, but they do little to obscure what is a fundamentally sound approach to building a personal foundation for the Christian life. The final two books in The Intentional Life Trilogy, SOUL MISSION (due out in February) and SOUL VISION, promise to continue Richard's &quot;life as a building&quot; metaphor and provide guidance for developing a thriving ground floor (mission) and defining the superstructure (vision).So, what is your passion? What do you love enough to die for? These are questions worth answering, and Richard has authored a tool to help fill in the blanks.--- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel"},{"Title":"Christianity Through the Centuries: A History of the Christian Church","review":"Earle Cairns take the reader on an epic journey of the history of the church from the day of Pentecost to the middle of the last decade of the 20th Century. The 560-page volume gives the reader an overview of the people, events, movements, doctrines, and cultures that sometimes shaped the church and that the church often shaped. The author shares little known details (Charlemagne was 7 foot tall), while presenting the broad-brush stroke of two thousand years of history.The book was written from a conservative, nondenominational perspective. Though the author is from the Reformed tradition, I thought the book was thoughtful, fair, and balanced. It is easy to read and contains an abundance of pictures, photographs, maps and charts. Christianity Through the Centuries is an outstanding introductory presentation of Church history that I would heartily recommend.Earle E. Cairns is professor emeritus at Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois. He is a member of the American Society of Church History, the American Historical Association, and the Conference on Faith and History."},{"Title":"Christianity Through the Centuries: A History of the Christian Church","review":"What is good about this book is its clarity and readability. It also contains many maps and charts.Although I am myself Protestant I am ashamed of the strong calvinist bias of this book. Very little is said of the Catholic Thomas Aquinas, although he is probably the greatest philosopher and theologian of all times. Worse: the little that is said about Aquinas is false (accusing him of creating a two contradictories realms of knowledge, truths, whereas it is on the contrary Aquinas who solved this problem). The views of Augustine are also misrepresented (Cairns follows the common protestant myth that Augustine believed that faith was prior to reason, p. 229), this just to name a few examples. Some Catholic major thinkers of the 20th century (Maritain, Gilson) are simply ignored. All what is Catholic is under- and misrepresented. Calvinists thinkers are on the contrary over-represented, and too well spoken of.Concerning Christian movements, the book contains also many mistakes (e. g. that Darby founded the Brethren movement! He never did, only joined them later; when he had become influential he created a schism and took full control of a large fraction, the &quot;exclusive&quot; brethren). Or for example there is no mention that the montanist heretics were charismatic.The auithor is very (too) enthousiast about some charismatic ideas such as the (short term) growth movement of the third charismatic wave. It is a pity that he never speaks of the authentic spiritual revival happening through the work of Norman Geisler and J. P. Moreland. Although I am also an evangelical, I must say that I find the author much too uncritical of the evangelical movement (there is no mention of the scandal of the evangelical mind, and the emphasis on experiences and emotions)."},{"Title":"Christianity Through the Centuries: A History of the Christian Church","review":"I believe this fine work by Dr. Cairns is in process of becoming a conservative evangelical classic. Almost everyone I have talked with who has gone through a seminary or Bible College survey of Church History course has used this text in some capacity.It is very accurate and surprisingly readable. Cairns does a great job of showing Church History in the context of world history, and the interdependencies of the two. Although a strong Christian world-view is evident, Cairns objectively analyzes various movements and events and does not bless or condemn in wholesale fashion.The purchase price is a bargain for the wealth of information and this is a keeper for the library. You'll refer to it again and again. I do hope that the publisher will continue to update it, as the decade which has passed since the last edition has been ripe with significant events and movements."},{"Title":"Christianity Through the Centuries: A History of the Christian Church","review":"This book is a good introduction to the history of Christianity. Cairns was a former professor of history at Wheaton College several decades ago. As such he writes from a conservative, evangelical perspective. The book has several benefits to recommend it:* It is written as a simple introduction to the history of Christianity, and so one can read it without having a background in church history.* The book does as good a job as can be expected integrating the history of Christianity with general history. The history of Christianity is shown in its broader historical context.* The book is written as a textbook. As such, it is clearly organized with an explicit outline. The whole scope of the history of Christianity is divided and subdivided into periods; each chapter is further outlined.* The book has several helpful charts.* The style of the book is clear, informative, and engaging.* Many books are recommended at the end of each chapter as guides for further study.The book has a few drawbacks, but they aren't very significant. Cairns can get a bit preachy in a few places. The chapters about recent history read like a descriptive lists of groups and movements rather than an analysis of the relationships between groups and broader movements, but the earlier chapters are much better. On the whole, this is the book that I would recommend to anyone who either wanted to read just one book on church history or who is beginning the study of church history."},{"Title":"Christianity Through the Centuries: A History of the Christian Church","review":"In my humble opinion, Cairns has written and excellent title on the spread of Christianity over the centuries.The book is divided into 3 main periods:1. Ancient Church History (5 B.C. - A.D. 590).2. Medieval Church History (590 - 1517).3. Modern Church History (1517 and After).In all, the book contains 42 chapters roughly divded into the three periods. The writing style is interesting, easy to follow and is supported by several charts and maps.I was required to read the book for a class and thoroughly enjoyed the title and have referred to it often when teaching a Bible study lesson.An excellent source of information, I highly recommend the book. Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Christianity Through the Centuries: A History of the Christian Church","review":"I learned a lot from reading this book. It filled in many gaps in my knowledge and is in general a useful book. I should point out, however, that it IS a scholarly textbook, and does not read like other books with more popular appeal (Da Vinci Code, etc).2000 years of church history is compressed into 560 pages, covering from the Pentecost to 1995. It does have a Western and American slant, and if I were to suggest a subtitle for the book, it would be \\"How the Christian Church in America Came to Be.\\" With such a scope, some topics (such as the Crusades, the Vatican II Council) are not covered in satisfactory detail, although other topics (Calvinism, Evangelicalism) are discussed in too much detail.I thought many of the maps and graphs were minimally helpful, and soon skipped them entirely. I also noticed many redundancies of the information, which is part of the textbook nature of the book.Controversial issues are handled in a (mostly) even-handed fashion, although the author does lean towards supporting his personal views (e.g. \\"the early church was right to oppose this dangerous idea\\").I think someone who is already familiar with much of church history will not gain much from this book, but for the novice it is a good resource."},{"Title":"Christianity Through the Centuries: A History of the Christian Church","review":"Cairns' work, though not necessarily monumental, is powerful, insightful, and scholarly. I have used several excellent church histories and in my experience, Cairns is certainly among the best. Contrary to what one reviewer said, Cairns takes neither an overly Calvanistic approach to theological anthropology nor does he appear to prefer any one form of Christianity over another. However, he does go to great lengths to present an unbiased, scholarly view of how the Holy Spirit guided church leaders and the historical developments of the church over time. I strongly recommend this book as an introduction to church history for anyone in church leadership who desires a history of the Christian church that pulls no punches and tells it like it was."},{"Title":"Christianity Through the Centuries: A History of the Christian Church","review":"This book seemed biased from its earliest chapters. I was discouraged to discover that balanced history was so easily and rapidly replaced by denominational agenda promotion. Granted, a large subject in a small volume, but isn't it time we point out the elephant in the room...\\"Reformed\\" is not a faith; it's a tradition and \\"evangelical\\" is a condition of commission and not an association!Without adequate space to properly discuss points of theological distinction it seems irresponsible to posit ideological biases camouflaged in historical objectivity.This is especially dangerous for those seeking an introductory text. An effective argument in favor of evangelical considerations would acknowledge and address criticisms of the broader movement in American Christianity.This book has served wonderfully as a summary and accessible text for decades and should certainly be praised for its continuity of message and longevity, yet I fear its usefullness has passed. Today's interested student in Christian History need not be shortchanged."},{"Title":"Christianity Through the Centuries: A History of the Christian Church","review":"Great book!

Used in a class room setting it complimented Church History very well."},{"Title":"Christianity Through the Centuries: A History of the Christian Church","review":"This book is great for the student that has no familiarity with Church History, like me when I first started reading it. Cairns starts you from the beginning with the ministry of Jesus and lays out history for you in a way to bring it to life. His structure is very effective. Each chapter is outlined according to event or idea to keep the concise focus on topic. This book is a great resource to start with when beginning study of Church History!"},{"Title":"Christianity Through the Centuries: A History of the Christian Church","review":"Cairns isn't subtle in conveying his theological opinions in his book. It is clear from the beginning that he is a card carrying, five point following Calvinist. Which is great, except that this leads him to do the following: to embarrassingly limit his history of the Christian church and to bash anyone in church history who disagreed with Calvinism in any way. Sadly, Cairns' dislike of anything Catholic that is prevalent throughout the book is almost mean spirited. He also doesn't even devote any print at all to the Orthodox Church. There has to be a Christian book that more objectively reviews the history of the church."},{"Title":"Christianity Through the Centuries: A History of the Christian Church","review":"This is a text book; but unlike some classroom texts which are boring, the readers of this book will find it insightful and written in a style that is engaging.

Truly only touches the surface, but provides the highlights as well as analysis as to what the various moves of the church has meant. You will definitely want to delve into some of the topics in more depth through other sources. Very interesting history when looking at today's debate about the separation of church and state. It truly puts the issue in perspective when you see what those who came to America were running away from where a true state church ruled."},{"Title":"Christianity Through the Centuries: A History of the Christian Church","review":"The only reason I bought the book is b/c it was required for a college course.

This is exactly what I expected. I look forward to purchasing from this retailer again."},{"Title":"Christianity Through the Centuries: A History of the Christian Church","review":"In this book Dr. Cairns has skillfully crafted a brilliant and accessible survey of the history of the Christian Church from it's inception all the way up to the present day (latest ed. 1996). His writing is engaging, helpful, and honest.Obviously with a survey book, no one can include all the details of any significant person, event, or movement. But Dr. Cairns does a wonderful job (as any historian would do) of selecting which things to include and which things the reader can do without.The book is very well divided into 42 chapters from 11 sections in 3 major periods. The text alone is enough for the price of the book, both in content and lucidity; but there are also great pictures, maps, and charts along the way.While many don't understand the importance of knowing church history, if you are someone with the remotest interest in the subject (and even if you're not), I highly recommend this work. There is not one better survey I know of in this field.

Numerous errors, typos; Syntax that frequently defies interpretation. Frequent use of terms that are never defined. Poor maps; Useless diagrams. A real test. The editor must have been asleep on this one. What was Zondervan thinking?"},{"Title":"Christianity Through the Centuries: A History of the Christian Church","review":"Let me start by saying that I grew up in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (the Mormons) and I know for a fact that they teach that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior! However, on page 435 of this book the author says \\"...do not give Christ His rightful place as Lord and Savior in their theology.\\" In all fairness the author indicates that this is from another source, but that does not excuse using a blatant lie. If you doubt what I am saying then ask yourself why would a church name themselves after Jesus Christ if they did not feel he was lord and savior? For me that means the author has a very slanted view and the rest of the book can not be counted on to speak truthfully of the facts.If you need to read about early Christianity then watch the biblical shows that pop up on the history channel. Another source to check out are the Gnostic teachings and/or some of Sylvia Browne's books.New Addition...I obtained this book for free, and I over paid. Always- Question what you are told, and take nothing for granted. Examples - Is it possible that only Adam and Eve created humanity? Maybe Noah's flood was a local event based on an actual event?- Answer your questions. Go out and search for the answers no matter where it takes you, but be warned your answers might challenge your beliefs (that's a good thing), and lead to even more questions. From a purely scientific point of view Adam and Eve could not have been the sole parents of everyone...unless Cain and Abel married their sisters then had kids. Why is it that only cultures that came from the around the Indian ocean have a mythology of a world flood? Perhaps the basin of the Indian Ocean had a massive earthquake that caused a Tsunami, or an asteroid hit the ocean. Both events would cause massive flooding in all coastal areas around the Indian Ocean but not in the rest of the world.- Repeat the above steps."},{"Title":"The Mercifully Brief, Real World Guide to Raising $1,000 Gifts By Mail","review":"As someone who has been raising money for many years, I was dubious that this book would tell me something I didn't already know. I was right and wrong. Much of what Mal says in his latest book on fundraising is not new to fundraising professionals. BUT, the book presents everything you know in a new and useful way that is focused on high dollar fundraising. It is well written, easy to follow, and provides great examples and techniques that will challenge even the long-time fundraising professionals to rethink their fundraising programs. I'm making it madatory reading for my fundraising staff!"},{"Title":"The Mercifully Brief, Real World Guide to Raising $1,000 Gifts By Mail","review":"Fundraising is an art and a science, and Mal Warwick is a master of both. Warwick has been helping non-profit organizations, charities and political parties raise, collectively, billions of dollars for more than 40 years. As Founder and Chairman of Mal Warwick & Associates, in Berkeley, California, Warwick helps clients raise money by mail and, through his other companies, by phone and the internet. He has authored 17 books on fundraising, and his most recent, The Mercifully Brief, Real World Guide to . . . Raising $1000 Gifts by Mail gives up the secret he has known since he started his company in 1979: charities can raisegifts of $1000 or more through the mail.Warwick stresses his methods are different than those of typical direct mail fundraising. High-dollar donors, as Warwick calls them, are well-educated, wealthy, rational thinkers who want to invest in solutions. Warwick has crafted direct mail packages for them that are masterfully written, with personalized proposals akin to those used in major gift fundraising. He invites donors to invest at a level that's higher than their previous gifts, in special projects that will have a significant impact on advancing the charity's mission.He insists that charities, in turn, must do their part in adequately acknowledging, informing and engaging the donor in the cause. This special treatment and the initial higher investment in the smaller print runs of more specialized direct mail packages and information pieces pays off, big time, according to Warwick's results. The effort creates long-term, loyal donors, who will be ready and willing to make more generous major gifts and planned gifts in the future.Raising $1000 Gifts by Mail is indeed mercifully brief - and non-technical. It is a must-read for fundraisers who know their donors deserve more than the standard ask that arrives in the mailbox. Warwick has done philanthropy and the charitable sector a great service by sharing the art and science of high-dollar fundraising my mail."},{"Title":"The Mercifully Brief, Real World Guide to Raising $1,000 Gifts By Mail","review":"This book was a little shocking, to be honest. I raise money through the mail practically every day, but this book lays out a completely different approach that I am definitely going to try. It takes a lot more work, and I think it should only be used for very special programs, but it sounds like the high-dollar approach promoted in this book could work for just about any organization.The book, unlike most fundraising books, is very easy to digest and written in a breezy style that makes it easy to get through. You can finish it in one sitting, easily. There are a lot of illustrated ideas from successful campaigns, and the author makes it sound easy. It's not, I don't think, but the book certainly encourages you to try."},{"Title":"The Mercifully Brief, Real World Guide to Raising $1,000 Gifts By Mail","review":"Today we are inundated with so many ads and appeals by unknown non-profits (usually on the phone during dinner time), that it is remarkable that any fund raising efforts are successful.This book, written by a professional fund raiser and head of his own fundraising and marketing agency since 1979, gives several examples fund raising efforts that have not only been profitable, but have raised large amounts of money from relatively few doners.The book is a combination of tutorial with descriptions of various campaigns that have been successful. The techniques of raising high dollar amounts from few contributors requires a different mind set, different techniques than the standard #10 envelope, bulk rate, and mass mailings. Instead the appeal package is usually more expensive ($5 each - no not a typo), and the mailing list is very selective.Not every organization is ready, or even capable of raising money in these kinds of appeals. But when the right appeal is made to the right audience, the rewards can be great."},{"Title":"The Mercifully Brief, Real World Guide to Raising $1,000 Gifts By Mail","review":"This book didn't quite hit the mark. I ordered this based upon my high opinion of Mal Warwick's other book, How to Write Successful Fundraising Letters. This book is very thin and a bit overpriced for the information it espouses. This book mainly addresses those fundraisers with big budgets, not your average small town, small organization fundraiser. I don't have thousands to spend on the \\"package.\\" On the other hand, I highly recommend Mal's other book on successful fundraising letters.

It is mostly generalizations about synchronicities and anecdotes about people noticing synchronicities. It doesn't get to techniques of initiating synchronous flow like meditation techniques, sadhana, etc. The authors just don't seem to have any privileged knowledge of the topic and nothing is really substantiated, it's just broad and elementary.

What's needed is some correlation between Professor Csikszenthmihalyi's steps to achieving a flow described and based on more scientific observations and accurate explanations of being in &quot;flow&quot; than found in this work and, in turn, this work's survey of &quot;flowmasters&quot; and their various methods for finding flow.

If you cannot figure out why sometimes everything just clicks into place and why sometimes roadblocks show up at every turn AND you are willing to accept responsibility for the way your fears, prejudices, hopes, beliefs, experiences and dreams control the flow of your life, then this is the book for you. This book shows you how to assimilate key principles of self-awareness, self-love, trust, acceptance, gratitude, and responsiblity in very practical ways. If the exercises are done correctly they begin a very intense, honest, and ongoing self-examination of everything you hold dear or fear in this life. If you are ready to take the risk of coming face to face with who you truly are as a person, then buy this book. The benefit is that you become much surer of who you are, clearer on what you want from life and more directed on how you need to accomplish it. This book rates as one of the most valuable books I've ever purchased.March 1, 2011: I am re-reading this book as I have done periodically over the years. I just noticed something today on page 24 that I just wanted to note. There is a partial quote at the bottom of page 24 (softcover) that reads \\"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.' This quote in the book is incorrectly attributed to Nelson Mandela but is in fact a quote from US author Marianne Williamson. The full quote can be found in Marianne Williamson's book \\"A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of A Course in Miracles (1992)\\". This small error aside (which can be verified on WikiQuotes) I still rate this book as one of the most valuable I have ever purchased."},{"Title":"The Power of Flow: Practical Ways to Transform Your Life with Meaningful Coincidence","review":"It is about time someone wrote about synchronicity and flow in clear, lucid language, that can be used by anyone. The authors use great, funny (and sometimes) exhilirating examples of individuals who experience flow and synchronicity in day-to-day life. What is neat is that these examples come from their own research and interviews with &quot;FlowMasters.&quot; In comparison to other books I have read on the topic (Jung, Csikszentmihalyi, Jaworksi), this is the most accessible.

But the whole flow/synchronicity angle is questionable, at best, and as the authors present it, it has about as much credibility as \\"crystal power,\\" or pick-your-new-age-pabulum. Perhaps my problem is that I was expecting something less fluffy and new-agey.The book relies heavily on anecdotes to show the power of flow, but they seem--to me--little more than the sort of fortuitous coincidences that we all occasionally experience. Many of the anecdotes illustrate coincidences that are similar, but beyond that similarity apparently meaningless. The authors' suggestion that we can make meaning out of anything we want to is, of course, silly.I tried some of the exercises, and did not find them particularly effective. Nor did I notice fewer or more synchronicities in my life...coincidences happen, whether I will them to or not.Some of the sections of this book are so empty of substance that I wonder how they got past an editor. The chapter on divination, for instance--there is nothing there but the broadest imagineable survey of different divination systems like astrology, tarot, I Ching...nothing about how to use them, of course.Your mileage may vary. If you dig the whole new age angle in your self-improvement books, you might love this."},{"Title":"The Power of Flow: Practical Ways to Transform Your Life with Meaningful Coincidence","review":"Despite the attendant new agey inclinations, I would like to say that most of the stuff in this book are really worth exploring. There are fourteen practical techniques based on indepth interviews with fifty people who had lived at high levels of flow.Personally, and through adaptation and experimentation, I have played with varied forms of most of the techniques.To read this book, and apply the stuff, one must approach it with an open and curious mind. A sense of discovery and anticipation certainly helps. As an engineer trained with a logical and analytical mindset, I can well understand the fears and apprehension of many readers, as well as the cynicism of some early reviewers.Synchronicity is hard to explain. It's also hard to prove its existence but it exists, whether you like it or not. To me, sometimes it's better not to intellectualise it. Just go with the flow.Over the many years running my own business, and doing what I love and loving what I do, I have personally \\"engineered\\" the many flow moments described in this book.

And on top of that it's a good something. This \\"flow\\" is something I wish everyone had. It makes people happier and it adds something magical to your life. The book does a good job explaining this and it includes some good techniques to induce the \\"flow\\".

Contrary to medical advice, after her mastectomy, she immediately resumed running and refused treatments of chemotherapy and radiation. Instead, she chose to work with Dr. John McDougall on in experimental diet program. One of the first changes she noticed after starting a vegan diet was improved race times. She soon added biking and swimming to her regimen and in four years, she completed her first half marathon. Ruth's health and fitness level only went up from there to find her today as one the world's most impressive athletes. She completes an unbelievable four triathlons a year (for a total of over 60 races annually!), was inducted into the Gold's Gym Hall of Fame and, in 1999 was included in Living Fit Magazine's list of the 10 fittest women in America. Ruth is in her 60's now, and she's in better shape physically and emotionally than most people half her age. She travels the world today, running races, speaking, and inspiring young and old to take food and fitness seriously. She is a glowing example of the healing power of the human body when it is treated with the utmost respect."},{"Title":"A Race for Life -","review":"I found the start of this book, which is a brief story of the author's life and healing from cancer through diet and natural means to be very inspiring. What she has gone through, what she has learned, and then what she has accomplished is truly inspirational and something we can each learn from and use in our lives.The rest of the book discusses various items of health and training, perhaps written more for the person new to the search for answers about health, training, and cancer in this confusing culture. I have been involved with triathlon for a couple of years now, and been on a plant based vegetarian diet for about six. And definitely sold on both of them for improving the quality of one's life.I would also like to recommend a couple related books on health and the prevention/curing of cancer. Those would be John Robbins books &quot;The Food Revolution&quot; and &quot;Reclaiming Our Health&quot;.A couple recommendations for the athelete would be &quot;The Inner Athlete&quot; by Dan Millman and Dave Scott's &quot;Triathlon Training&quot;. Dave's book is a little outdated, but inspirational as well since he has won 6 Ironman championships on a vegetarian diet, and also took 2nd by mere minutes when coming out of retirement in his 40's!"},{"Title":"A Race for Life -","review":"This book had a lot of hype. The book was not what I expected. This is really more of how to triathlon book than anything else.The cancer and the food changes are mentioned but exercise is really the main focus. I think the regular reader would definitely have trouble relating to this book."},{"Title":"The Story of Coal and Iron in Alabama","review":"I could write this review in just a few sentences, barely enough to call a paragraph (but I won't, as it would take all the fun out of it for me). It would go something like this: A book on as arcane a subject as the development of the coal and iron industry in a little backwater state like Alabama that is still in print over a hundred years after it was first published must be a quite remarkable book. And so it is. Ethel Armes is a gifted writer, dogged researcher and insightful historian. This is simply one of the very best history books I have ever read, and as anyone who regularly reads my blog [...] well knows, I read lots and lots of history books. But I will admit bias. Armes' wrote the history of the place where I was born and bred, so it resonated with me personally. But still, even accounting as best I can for my personal biases, the book is a gem.The paperback version of the book is available on Amazon.com for $48.50. It may seem a bit pricey, but don't be penny-wise and pound foolish. If you hail from Alabama, or are a new transplant (like all the pioneers in the coal and iron industry were), or simply love well-written history, the money will be well spent. I plan to buy the book for my mother-in-law's husband (he's her second husband, and not my wife's father, so I suppose he's not really a father-in-law, or maybe he is, I really don't know what to call him, as I've never much bothered keeping up with relationship rules as relationship rules can't seem to keep up with relationship reality), who is an Alabama native and bit of a history buff, and worked as an engineer in the state's power industry (tangentially related to the subject matter of the book) for most of his life. He is the one who gave me Bill O'Reilly's Killing Lincoln last year, which I more or less excoriated as not much more than dogmatic drivel in a review published about a year ago. I'd say my sort-of father-in-law will definitely be getting the better end of the deal in the trade.But it's not really fair to compare the O'Reilly book with Armes'. Armes was a gifted writer with a keen understanding of the giddy creatures known as human beings and the forces driving them, who took great and humble care to research and capably relate the people and the technologies powering the development of the coal and steel industries in Alabama. O'Reilly on the other hand is a political gadfly and talk show host who coyly disguises his biases and beliefs, except when he thinks an overwhelming majority of people might, or should, agree with him. Thus in Killing Lincoln, the assassination of Lincoln was an unremittingly bad thing in O'Reilly's version of history, though there were a great many alive at the time who felt just the opposite, and it really isn't much of a hard sell today to claim that Lincoln's assassination represents the \\"evil that can destroy us\\". But in The Story of Coal and Iron in Alabama, there are no dogmatically good or evil things, just things that worked and things that failed, and people who sometimes succeeded and sometimes didn't. Though the history of coal and iron in Alabama is not a morality tale, the development of the coal and iron industries in Alabama surely held moral, i.e., survival, relevance for a great many people (moral considerations, arising as they do, from survival and propagation imperatives), perhaps even more than were personally affected by Lincoln's assassination. By the time of Lincoln's assassination, the social die was cast; the Union had been preserved and slavery abolished. The exploitation of Alabama's mineral wealth was hardly so inevitable, and became particularly uncertain after Wilson's Union raiders burned to the ground during the waning days of the Confederacy pretty much every standing blast furnace and forge in Alabama.The AuthorEthel Armes was born in 1876 in Washington, D.C., the daughter of a US Army officer who had enlisted from his home state of Massachusetts during the Civil War, and who later rose through the ranks to become a regular Army colonel, serving the balance of his career at several frontier outposts. Ms. Armes and her mother often accompanied the Colonel on extended tours in the western wilderness, so it can be assumed that Armes experienced first-hand something of the rigors faced by the early pioneers in the Alabama coal and iron industry; from hostile natives, to disease, droughts, floods and famine, to economic crashes rendering the output of even the most successfully run enterprise worthless. It must have been on the frontier where she developed her keen eye for identifying and understanding men of action and resolve; men almost fanatically driven to bend nature to their will through their ingenuity and determination.Ms. Armes was a graduate of Columbia College, now known as George Washington University, and held a series of jobs writing feature articles for various newspapers, including the Washington Post and Chicago Chronicle, before coming to Alabama to join the staff of the Birmingham Age-Herald in 1905. The Birmingham Chamber of Commerce commissioned her to write what became The Story of Coal and Iron in Alabama in 1907. Like many of the coal and iron pioneers of whom she wrote, Ms. Armes spent only a brief passage in the state, about fifteen years in her case, but through her research for the book project, and her keen and insightful wit, she perhaps understood the state as well as anyone who has written about it ever has or ever will.Alabama geology and geographyReading The Story of Coal and Iron in Alabama without at least some rudimentary knowledge of Alabama's history and geography would probably make the plot tedious and a bit difficult to follow (though Armes' telling of it would still be sublime). I was born and bred in the heart of Alabama's mineral region, so know firsthand a great many of the places to which Armes refers. But a non-native, or someone without much knowledge of Alabama's history or geography, should keep a topographic map of the state, i.e., one which indicates geologic features (along with the ordinary political ones), handy while reading. Get one with state park and historic notations, and virtually every last antebellum site, and a great many post-bellum sites mentioned by Armes will be indicated for the visualization. For the northeast and north central one-third or so of the state, the story of coal and iron is its history, and seemingly every historically prominent forge or mine or furnace works that ever existed there is now a state park or historical site.Alabama was carved out of the Mississippi Territory and granted statehood in 1819, becoming the 21st state admitted to the Union, mainly on the strength of its southern and southwestern quarters, in which had arisen some measure of plantation agriculture. The mineral wealth of its northeast and north central quarters had only barely been realized by the time of statehood, and had not been exploited much at all.Upon examining a map of Alabama, the state appears as an upright rectangle, a left foot perhaps, with all appendages but the big toe lopped off, and seems to teeters a bit unbalanced on its lone toe as it tests the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Mobile Bay could be imagined as the toenail on its Gulf-dipping toe. The foot is a little over two hundred miles wide at its widest point, and about three hundred miles long at its most lengthy (if the toe is excluded). The mineral region drapes across the state like a hundred mile-wide sash, from the northeast corner of the state, centered around where the Tennessee River makes its entrance, southwesterly to the upper edge of the Black Belt region, the limits of which run from Tuscaloosa in the West, to Selma in nearly the dead center of the state, to Montgomery, just east of center.If geological forces moved the earth at humanly perceptible speeds, it would be easy to see how this area became Alabama's mineral region (and why the Black Belt of deep, dark, rich soil borders it). The great Appalachian mountain range peters out in north and central Alabama, the last vestiges of its ancient peaks dwindling to meager ridge lines as it crosses the upper third of the state, northeast to southwest. Taken in aggregate, the Appalachians look like the edge of a cold front sweeping, like so many weather systems do, across the country in southeastwardly direction. The ridgelines dipping into Alabama appear to be the remnants of gradually dissipating storms, of the Appalachian system's weak outer bands. Imagined from the idea that north and central Alabama is where the southeastwardly sweeping system that is the Appalachian Mountains lose their energy and dissipate, it is hardly surprising that a great measure of the mountains' mineral wealth precipitated out of solution there. The Appalachian Mountains deposited minerals in Alabama like the ocean deposits flotsam and jetsam into the nooks and crannies of protected harbors. The heavier stuff--the iron ore, coal and limestone needed for making steel--stayed nearer to its origins, in the Appalachian foothills, which comprise Alabama's mineral region. The lighter stuff, the stuff making up the soil of the Black Belt, dribbled further down, to the flattening land that had just escaped the fury of the Appalachian storm.Early prospecting and developmentHaving fixed our place in Alabama's mineral region, we must properly fix ourselves in time, beginning the story by turning the clock back about two hundred years (a blink in the geological, or even historical, eye) to a time when there existed little more than the occasional blacksmith's shop in Alabama. The ridges and valleys of the mineral region were covered then in dense hardwood forests. Water plentifully fell from the sky, to the tune of over fifty-five inches or so per year on average, but it quickly drained to the sea. There wasn't a significant natural lake or pond to be found. Rivers and streams, some navigable, most not, flowed through every valley, each in turn was fed by countless clear mountain stream and creek tributaries (the abundance of which was reflected in the name \\"Creeks\\" given to one of the more prominent of Native American nations populating the area).The mineral region was sparsely populated with native tribes and nations at the time, by then mostly the Cherokee, who were mainly allied with the federal government against the Creeks, particular factions of which were occasionally hostile to pioneering settlers (the Red Sticks, for example), but who presented no significant obstacle after Colonel (later General, and then President) Jackson's victory at Horseshoe Bend in 1814.Upon arrival in Alabama's mineral region a bit less than two centuries ago, the prospecting pioneer had a number of challenges to overcome to make a go of mining coal or iron ore. For starters, he had no motive power, other than horses and mules and water. Obviously, there was no electricity. Nor steam. The ability to do work--to lift things and put them down-came solely from muscle power, man or beast, or the energy of the sun stored in the evaporation and elevation of water droplets. Since horses and mules and man all need water, and the elevation drops along the rivers, streams and creeks of the region were sufficient to be harnessed as power sources, all of the original coal mines, forges and blast furnaces were located alongside running water, not generally the major rivers, but the streams and creeks feeding into them which were robust enough to flow year \`round. The reason for avoiding the main rivers presumably included the propensity and magnitude of flooding along main river channels, the lazier flow of water making it harder to harness for power, and the competition with planters for the river bottom lands which were ideal for agriculture.The prospector needed to provide his own food supply. There were no corner groceries, or much in the way of trading opportunities whatsoever. He therefore had to laboriously clear enough land to grow crops sufficient to feed himself, his draft animals, and his workers. This wasn't quite as bad as it seems. Clearing land of its forests was a part of any blast furnace or forge operation of the time, as the abundant forests initially provided the fuel (charcoal) for the forge and furnaces. Forest clearing killed two birds with one stone--providing fuel for the furnaces with the felled trees, and for the humans and animals that worked it with the land cleared for agriculture.(It is often observed, as an explanation for the growth of the coal and iron industry in Alabama, that Alabama's mineral region is one of the few places where all three ingredients--iron ore, coal and limestone-for the making of iron and steel can be found in close proximity and abundance. Which is true, but the observation leaves off two ingredients which were critical to the industry at its inception--abundantly flowing water, and vast tracts of forest suitable for cutting and curing into charcoal. All the early blast furnaces and forges were charcoal fueled, and all the early bellows and hammers were water powered.)If everything went well, and the prospector got his furnace in \\"blast\\" and started producing iron, there still was the problem of selling it--to whom and for how much and where. All the pig iron in the world is useless without which it can be sold at a price exceeding its cost of manufacture. Until settlement of the wilderness had reached a critical mass, pig iron (iron that had not been forged into a useful implement of some sort) was of little value locally, requiring transport over non-existent rails and roads, or down treacherous rivers and streams. It took a hardy determination to make a go of exploiting Alabama's minerals in the early days.A bit of historical context for the challenges faced by nineteenth century coal and iron pioneersToday's pioneering heroes staked their claims in a digital domain. They are the internet and computer giants like Jobs and Gates and Brin and Ellison and Zuckerberg, guys who found ways to shuffle around information and connections in a manner that would make themselves rich (you didn't really think they did it for the good of mankind, did you?). The computer and internet pioneers worked from cushy Ivy League dorm rooms, or in parent's garages, applying their formidable brain power to the impetus of gaining power, prestige and wealth by facilitating and controlling information flow, but risked nothing of the continuation of their physical existence in the process. They toiled in relative safety and security along the way to technological \\"revolutions\\" carefully metered to benefit them. The coal and iron pioneers risked life and limb every single day. They had to apply their every sinew of physical strength and mental aptitude to the challenges they faced. One slip, or just a turn of bad luck, and all was permanently lost. Safety nets, social or otherwise, did not exist. There was no garage to incubate their ideas. There was no steady and readily obtainable food supply to nourish them. For the coal and iron pioneers, failing at any of the myriad challenges they daily faced almost certainly meant death.Every age believes itself superior to those that came before, and extends that belief to the recognition of its leaders and heroes as superior to all who preceded them. But was Steve Jobs really a more capable and important man than say, Daniel Pratt? Pratt was a New Hampshire native who left his home at age twenty to head South, carrying nothing but his wits and a Puritan work ethic to hold him. After a few years in Georgia, he had built up a strong business manufacturing cotton gins and other such implements from iron, and in 1838 he decided to relocate his mills and factories down in the piney woods and marshes of Autauga County, Alabama, along a bend in the Alabama River, with the specific object in mind of \\"build[ing] a village dignifying labor in the South, and to give the laboring class not only an opportunity to make independent living, but to train up workmen who could give dignity to labor...\\". What, aside from slaking his thirst for recognition and esteem and power, could be imagined was the purpose and object of Jobs' professional life? Pratt eventually became heavily involved in the coal and iron industry in the Birmingham District (Prattville, the town Pratt founded in Autauga County, lies about a hundred miles south of Birmingham), helping rebuild, improve and expand what Wilson's raiders had destroyed. The town that grew up around the Birmingham District's greatest coal mining operation, Pratt City, also bore his name, as his son-in-law, Henry F. DeBardeleben, was one of its early promoters and named it in his honor (the town was later absorbed into Birmingham's city limits). While it is difficult to compare iconic people and personalities across the ages, understanding a bit of history should help temper the fervor with which the present age (like all others) indulges its vanity as the pinnacle of progress, ability, sacrifice and intellect of all time. All ages are possessed of greatness. Being the latest does not make one the greatest.Steve Jobs was, and is, often described as visionary (I pick on Jobs just because he's conveniently well-known and he's dead; whatever were his contributions, he is now through with actively adding to them). Jobs' vision ultimately yielded a phone irritatingly capable of verbally nagging its owners. When John T Milner, riding north on horseback in the 1850's, crested Red Mountain on the southern edge of Jones Valley near the center of Jefferson County, he envisioned a day would come when the valley would be populated by a mighty city drawing its wealth from the vast seams of red iron ore (the red ore provided the name for the ridgeline upon which his mount stood, but had not yet been exploited). A few years later, in 1871, he founded a city there, calling it Birmingham, after England's second city and industrial giant. Only a few decades later and Milner's city would \\"magically\\" grow, along with its iron, steel and coal industries, to become the largest city in the state, and would be informally referred to variously as the \\"Magic City\\" because of its explosive growth, or the \\"Pittsburgh of the South\\" because of its importance nationally to the coal, iron and steel industries. The specter of a nagging phone pales in comparison to Milner's vision of a thriving city in a peaceful valley. Yet both visions came to pass. Milner's city thrives, with over a million people in its greater metropolitan area. And a great many of them suffer incessant nagging by computerized voice messages on the phones Jobs envisioned.A thumbnail sketch of the development of the coal and iron industries in AlabamaIron generally came first, and the first iron working facilities were usually forges and/or blacksmith shops. Blast furnaces came later; coal mining, later still. The first blast furnace to commence operations opened in the far northwestern corner of the state, on a bend in Cedar Creek, a Tennessee River tributary, in Franklin County in 1818, a year before statehood. The great Warrior Coal Field in western Jefferson, eastern Walker, and eastern Tuscaloosa counties was first mined in 1827. At first, coal \\"mining\\" was a matter of scooping coal off of riverbeds during times when the rivers ran low, and floating it downstream to markets when the flow returned. The first blast furnaces in Jefferson County (the eventual site of Birmingham) commenced operations at Oxmoor and Irondale in the early 1860's. The Civil War brought an immense expansion in the coal and iron industry in Alabama's mineral region, not least in Selma, where General Gorgas, head of Confederate logistics, located the Confederate Naval Foundry. But it was all destroyed by the end of the war. Everything had then to be rebuilt from scratch.The focus gradually turned to the Birmingham District after the war. Though the city of Birmingham was incorporated only a few years after the Civil War, the District did not rise to prominence as an iron and steel-making center until the 1880's, after which growth exploded. By the early 1900's, its coal, iron and steel industries were thriving, and it was heralded as potentially the future capital of manufacturing for all the world, probably explaining the commissioning of the Armes book by the Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber doubtlessly wanted to chronicle the rise to future greatness of the city and District. But greatness never really came to pass. The city and District became an important center of manufacturing and industry, particularly of iron and steel products, but it never achieved the manufacturing prominence of Pittsburgh or Detroit, perhaps not even of its early rival, Chattanooga, and certainly not of its namesake. Alas, the demand for the products of its mineral wealth played out long before the coal and ore did. The last of the District's furnaces devoted to smelting pig and foundry iron from local ore shut down in the early 1970's, shortly after racial strife had earned the city the derisive moniker \\"Bombingham\\", which, being an earned, rather than self-anointed nickname, seems to have stuck rather more prominently than either \\"Magic City\\" or \\"Pittsburgh of the South\\" in the public consciousness.What's left of the iron and steel industry today is mainly pipe manufacturing, either ductile or rolled, or steel machining. Coal mining still carries on in the hinterlands of the District, mainly in the Warrior Coal Field, either deep underground or in strip pits, but employs a very small number of people. Three major automobile manufacturers have located car-building operations in Alabama's mineral region--Mercedes near Tuscaloosa; Honda near Lincoln in Talladega County, and Hyundai near Montgomery. They didn't come to take advantage of the minerals, but came because of the generally favorable climate for manufacturers of their sort, including the excellent transportation facilities, abundant water, cheap energy (in the main, because of the abundant water), low taxes, and a dependable, conscientious local workforce. It could readily be imagined that these advantages arose from the generally conducive environment to manufacturing that was established in the area around the turn of the century.Snippets of personal insights gleaned from The Story of Coal and Iron in AlabamaI realized about halfway through the book that I had somehow managed to negotiate a half-century of living, four-fifths of it in Birmingham, without knowing much of anything about the history of where I was born and bred.I have always somewhat instinctively understood why the Civil Rights history of Birmingham was verboten in the integrated schools I attended. The episode had cut too close to the quick, and too recently, for things to have had a chance to sufficiently heal. So it wasn't until I reached adulthood, and left Birmingham and Alabama, that I found out what had happened to those four little girls, and the other atrocities that took place, all while I was just an ignorant little white child growing up on the trashy side of town. I was almost thirty before I heard anyone refer to the city as \\"Bombingham\\", but I know why. I wasn't taught Birmingham's Civil Rights history because it was still painfully scabbed over while I was coming up.But, neither did I get much of anything of Birmingham's pre-Civil Rights era history, except the general idea that Birmingham owed its existence to the fact that those three ingredients necessary for making steel--iron ore, coal and limestone--were located in abundance close by. And, as I was repeatedly informed, if you wanted to see what all the fuss was over, all you had to do was walk up to the Twentieth Street cut through Red Mountain and you could distinctly see the seam of red ore that had made Birmingham magical. It was all a part of Birmingham mythology by the time I arrived on the scene, but it wasn't necessarily true, or at least, as Armes' book made clear, there was much more to it than simply having three ingredients for making steel in close proximity.My lack of education could hardly have been unique, which is why I would especially recommend Armes' book to anyone who grew up in Birmingham. Familiarity with the book ought to be required of anyone graduating from a high school in Alabama's mineral region.Red mountain was indeed red because of its iron (and still is, as a trip along practically any of the trails at the recently-opened Red Mountain Park will quite durably stain the soles of the shoes a deep red hue.) All the early settlers and natives knew this, but nobody could much figure out what to do with the information (excepting the natives, who used the ore for dying their breeches and making war paint, but not for making iron or steel). Most of the iron ore in Alabama's mineral region (except Red Mountain in the Birmingham District) was of the \\"brown\\" variety, and therefore readily exploitable with existing technology. Red ore, such as was found on Red Mountain, had too much phosphorous, and was therefore too brittle after smelting to be of much use, or was, until processes were discovered through which the impurities could be economically removed. Milner's dream of a Jones Valley metropolis getting rich because of the red ore in the hills to their south depended, like Jobs' dream of a phone that could carry on a conversation with its owner, on technological prowess that did not then exist.Even so, the main reason Birmingham's ore was so late in being exploited was far less complicated than the technological challenges of high phosphorous ore. Milner's little town in Jones Valley was too isolated to take much advantage of its natural resources, or was, until a railroad finally pushed through in 1872. Birmingham has no navigable waterways, sitting as it does near the headwaters of three river systems. And even when the Louisville and Nashville arrived, the railroad practically failed for lack of business, until the Pratt coal seam, which was discovered in 1874, finally began producing a few years later. When Birmingham's first blast furnace came on line about 1880, the table was finally set. Technology had advanced sufficiently to allow exploitation of Birmingham's red ore; railroads were in place to get the product to market, and the three ingredients necessary for making iron and steel, which had all along been patiently waiting just below the surface of the soil, were still there for the taking.I recognized a few names in the story, but was more surprised at how many I had never heard of. There is nothing in Birmingham of which I am aware that is named DeBardeleben, but Henry F., Daniel Pratt's son-in-law, was arguably the father of the steel industry in Birmingham. I knew of the name because my grandfather made his living running a lathe in a DeBardeleben machine shop, but it was called Steward Machine Company. The DeBardeleben clan shows up in the social registers occasionally, but not as much as might be imagined of a so illustrious an ancestor. Perhaps the clan is publicity shy. I actually met a great, great, great (etc.) grandson of Henry F Debardeleben doing a residential real estate closing one day. He had worked for a time at Steward as a manager. Except for his name, he was a rather ordinary fellow.Pratt City and Prattville, already noted, were named after Daniel Pratt, but John T Milner, the founder of Birmingham so far as Armes is concerned, hasn't so much as a lamppost named after him. I was completely ignorant of him until reading Armes' book.It was somewhat remarkable to me how many of the coal, iron and steel pioneers in Alabama were of Welsh origin. DeBardeleben was Hessian; Pratt's people were New Hampshire Welsh; there were a great many others who were Welsh, which makes sense, as the mining industry in England was centered in Wales, but I had always figured most Alabamians of UK descent were Irish or Scotch. There were also quite a few South Carolinians, which isn't so surprising, because of all the states in the Union, Alabama has always resembled South Carolina the most in its stiff-necked opposition to federal imperatives.Coal and Iron and Race RelationsArmes' observation that, at least until the railroad came, Alabama was really two places--an industrial North and an agricultural South--each having little in common with the other, is despairingly true even today, long after railroads and interstates. Except that the mineral region was put to work making munitions for the Confederacy, which caused the whole area to blossom, if only briefly, it is hard to see where the rapidly industrializing area had anything in common with the cause of the South at the time of the Civil War. Indeed, there were slave holders in the mineral region, but the slave relationship was generally quite different than it was for planters. Armes relates the story of a pioneer who cross-trained all his slaves to do any job necessary in his forge and blast furnace. Planters needed slaves for basically one reason--their ability to work long hours at manual labor under miserable conditions. But a coal and iron pioneer slave owner who trains slaves to do essentially what he does is inherently, if not expressly, recognizing the slave's innate humanity and equality.Had the mineral regions of Alabama been further developed by the time of the war, there is some question (at least to my mind) whether the mineral regions would have seceded, along with the rest of Alabama, to save the Southern, slave-holding way of life. There actually was one rather large, yet sparsely populated county (Winston, in the northwest quarter of the state) in the mineral region that formally opposed secession, wishing to remain a part of the Union. The mineral regions of Alabama might very well have done just as the mineral regions of Virginia did during the war, and calve a new state that was more economically and politically aligned with the North in its rapid industrialization. West Virginia was carved out of the northwest corner of Virginia when Virginia seceded from the Union, as the innate economic differences between the two areas had become by then too great a burden for the politics to bear. West Virginia's politics followed its economics (like politics everywhere) and it sought admission to the Union as an independent state, which Lincoln granted in 1863. It's not hard to imagine had Alabama been settled and developed at about the same time as Virginia, instead of some two hundred years later, that her north/south divisions might have been more pronounced by the time of the Civil War, and the industrialized mineral regions might have scoffed at secession.It might therefore seem ironic that Birmingham would later become a focal point of race relations and the Civil Rights movement. But not really. It was actually because Birmingham had no, or very little, history of antebellum agriculture and slave holding that its race relations became particularly incendiary. Whites and blacks came to Birmingham from the hinterlands with the same expectations. They wanted to make a living in the rapidly expanding industrial economy. And it became quickly obvious that the coal, iron and steel being turned to gold had no concern over the color of the hands working it. Birmingham's rapid industrialization revealed in quick time, like it had in the North by the time of the Civil War, the lie of racial inequality. Anyone with wits, drive and determination could make a meaningful contribution. The old feudal organization of life represented by the remaining vestiges of antebellum agriculture would eventually be swept away, at least in part by the rolling mills, blast furnaces and coal mines of Birmingham, but not without upheaval as violent as the hammering of iron in a forge.A significant cohort of Birmingham's lower class whites resented economic equivalency with blacks, falling back on old notions of racial superiority to make their case that economic spoils should flow their way, regardless of merit. And a significant number of industrialists took advantage, once their organizations reached a critical mass which required hordes of unskilled labor, of social hierarchies formed in antebellum days.

Without giving much of the plot away, we have an uppity/angsty vampire (Ivy Tamwood/Lestat/Asher cross), a way-too serious sorcerer (Harry Dresden meets Gandalf meets the druid dude from Terry Brooks first Shanara series), a witch who is smart-sexy (Rachel Mariana Morgan down to the red hair), a shapeshifter (LKH's Richard without the pathos and with a sword and an extra shape or two), and a queen to be who would rather read a book than fight a vampire (this character had elements of bunches of other characters too numerous to mention.) Huh...I think I have met all these characters before. And when the last character shows up, all I could think of was early Anita Blake meets the chick from Underworld or from Van Helsing.The storyline is predictable, the characters were the same. At times, I had a hard time wrapping my mind around some of the sentence structures. It was like the sentences were delibrately re-worked to cut back on the word count.Will I read the other two? Yeah, probably, but I probably won't pay full-price for them."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have read Nora Roberts books for years and got used to her romantic novels. So while on vacation in Mexico and having finished all the books that I bought, I wondered to a local shop that had some American paperbacks. I picked up the \\"Dance of the God's\\" because I knew her name, not realizing that it was book 2 of a trilogy. Expecting the usual romance from Roberts, I was shocked to find myself in the middle of a magical and brutal war between humans and vampires. I read the \\"Dance\\" probably in 1-2 days and couldn't wait to get my hands on the 1st and 3rd books which proved to be just as good.I sooooo wish there was a movie made from these books because I could see it all in my head. The time travel, the magic, the love, the great battles. I'm surprised that no studios picked it up as the next big trilogy to produce. It begs for it and has the substance to back it up.Love Nora's writing style and how she really dives into the ancient rituals and mythology of old Ireland. She also ensures that the reader gets a good understanding of how each of the character's talents are valuable, despite their varying backgrounds and fears. I could see the movie in my mind while reading her books which is a true sign of a good author. I really wish that I had a production company to put this trilogy into theaters. I think it would beat Lord of the Rings!!!"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I wouldn't call myself a Nora Roberts expert, or a huge fan. But I like her books, especially the ones with mystical elements. One night out, when I couldn't sleep but was too tired to do anything else, I grabbed this book. My husband bought it for me and said that it was good. I read the back, saw something about a vampire, and immediately started reading sitting on the floor in front of the book shelf. It's an amazing story about an vampire queen bent on taking over all the worlds. Several people are called. All of them representing the worlds. Three, from different worlds and different times. Love is formed and bonded. The kind that lasts, not the kind that is formed out of desperation. True and endless love. The Goddess's will no doubt. What man or woman could die when they have love and another person to live for?"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is my first review so it may not be as detailed as the others but I needed to let everyone know that this was my favorite trilogy of Nora Roberts. When Nora comes out with a trilogy I won't buy them until all three books are released because I want to read them all at once and this one was no exception. I couldn't put them down and had all three books read in two weeks! Working full time with three kids...this feat is a challenge and needless to say the laundry didn't get done. The magic, the dark side, the love, the war and the erotic sex made this her best yet! I downloaded these books to my Kindle but will now purchase them in hard copy so that I can share them with my friends and family."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I typically love Nora Robert's trilogies when in the mood for \\"comfort\\" reading. It's predictable in a fun way when not wanting to tax my brain too much and wanting to be entertained. I typically read a book of this size in about two days but this one took me four. The reason being - it was not particularly interesting. The first half of the book drug along at a snail's pace but (fortunately) it picked up in the latter half and moved much more quickly.This first of three vampire books involves time travel, romance and reminds me of \\"Twilight\\" for adults. I am not a huge vampire book fan though have read the occasionally. This had some fun/interesting moments but much of it was all about the six main characters preparing for battle with the vampires wishing to wipe out mankind. A little more action and a little less preparation (and preparation and preparation) would have caught my interest and provided a better read.I bought all three of the books already so I will go ahead and read the next two, but at this point I'm fairly lukewarm about the series and hope it perks up."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I was so incredibly pleased with this trilogy, that I think it is by far my favorite Nora Roberts trilogy. I don't like to go into details as to what the book is about because I think that the author can do that best on the back cover (and the summary posted here), but I can only tell you that it is a very creative trilogy. And maybe because of all of the vampire hype lately (yes, there is a vampire), I think it just made the series that much more enjoyable and current (even though it was written a while ago). Books like this remind me why I enjoy Nora Roberts' books so much."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I was surprised to find that Nora, one of my favorite novelists wrote a paranormal romance. Will all the mixed reviews I first rented the books from the local library (not a bad idea for some of us who regularly get buyers remorse over books). But I have the books on order at Amazon, because I can't live without these on my shelf. I'm recommending them to all my friends that are Twilight fans.**spoilers**By the time Hoyt makes it to the big city and decides not to kill his brother the alleged Vampire still living hundreds of hears later, the story had my attention and I was hooked. And ladies, hold out for Cian. Everyone loves a hot misunderstood vampire with a good heart--albeit cold. Cian takes a more predominant role in later books. By book three, I couldn't give two straws about Hoyt. Enjoy! If you have any doubts, stop by your local library first, but I guarantee that you'll be back to Amazon soon purchasing the copies for yourself!"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Morrigan's Cross is the first in a three book series.

I will continue to read this series.Melissa[...]"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I am not a huge Nora Roberts fan but the concept of Vampire, wizards/witches and dragons good vs evil sounded like fun. And it was, she did a good job with the characters and the time travel seemed possible. It has a romance but not so much that it would be a romance novel I would put it more in the fantasy classification. I felt it was worth reading the rest of the trilogy"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I think that this was a very good read. I really enjoyed the characters and the plot. However, I think that for a story that took three books to get to the \\"battle\\", the battle should have lasted longer than a chapter. But, while I agree that some of her early stuff wasn't as seasoned as her newer books, I really did like this book. In the Garden is still the best by far!"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Whoever said this book is unimaginative is CRAZy! This trilogy is probably the best I ever read. It has everything you could want, fantasy, love, war and a lot more. It ends just perfect. You are missing out if you don't read this series! The first book kindof focuses on two of the main characters but you will hear of the others a lot more in the following books. They are perfect. Nora Roberts is Fabulous!"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I just love Nora Roberts, but I have to say she has truly outdone herself with the latest The Circle Trilogy. They are hard to put down. Great reading!"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I don't understand the negative reviews...I thoroughly enjoyed this entire series (just finished the final book in the trilogy). I even went out and paid full price for the 3rd book because I couldn't wait to read it! Sure, it's your classic good vs. evil (very evil!!) and classic man meets woman and falls in love, but in my opinion, it was just told so well. I laughed in parts and cried in others. I cringed when reading some of the more graphic parts...but those just made you root for the heroes all the more.The 'Circle of Six' consists of a witch, a sorcerer, a demon hunter, a scholar (with powers of her own), a shapeshifter and the sorcerer's brother who was changed into a vampire himself. There's magic, time travel and witty exchanges between the main characters. They fall in love and fight to save the world..what more could you want?!!Of the 3, I would say the love story in the final book was my favorite as I fell love with Cian (the vampire) in book one and was pleased with the way it ended for him in the final book.I could clearly picture the character and the locations as Nora Roberts writing takes you there. When the shapeshifter changes into a dragon..it was vivid in my mind...as were the other scenes as well.This was definitely one of my favorite trilogies!"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Similar to other readers, I had contemplated not reading this trilogy thinking it would have a silly story-line, but I was wrong.I purchased this book at an airport waiting to board my plane. I was immediately swept into the fantasy world and captivated by each of the six main characters. There were several unexpected twists, which kept me in anticipation of every turned page. Even my fiancee was reading over my shoulder to a point where I told him to buy his own book!Now the two of us are patiently awaiting the third in the series!"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"If you can get through the first 2 chapters I think you will really enjoy this book. It just starts out a little slow, introducing everyone and the plot. It is about a circle of 6 who are being brought together from different worlds and times to destroy the Vampire Queen Lilith. Even if you don't like Vampire Fiction, Nora has a way of making this plot seem very plausible and beleivable. I'm a big Nora fan and the only reason why I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars was because of the slow start and the character development. Usually I fall in love with her characters right from the start, I just wasn't that attached to Hoyt and Glenna. By the end I enjoyed them and the story. But I knew I was going to like book's 2 and three better. Give it a chance, I think you'll be surprised."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I love Nora Roberts books and have read them for many years. However, this extremely violent and sexual \\"tale\\" is being told by an old man to a group of children!!!

Why was the audience a group of kids?"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I've read just about every one of her books and was disgusted at the turn she's taken. Instead of real life stories, this ventures off into the truly dark side of fiction and is so unlike her usually uplifting stories. I sent it back and cancelled the other two. I really can't believe she's gone this route - she's a tremendous writer - I just wish she'd stick to real life."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Nearly a thousand years ago in Ireland, Hoyt's family was irrevocably damaged when his twin, Cian, was taken by the vampire queen, Lilith. However, Hoyt is given a chance by Morrigan to defeat Lilith, though it will mean leaving behind all he knows. After ensuring his family's protection from the vampires, Hoyt goes forward in time to modern New York where he is reunited with his twin. By this time, Cian has lost all love of his maker and is willing to join forces with his brother. Morrigan has instructed Hoyt to gather a circle of six and ready them for a battle to take place on Halloween. At that time, the fate of the world will rest in their hands. If Lilith and her demons win, everything is lost. Their first allies are Glenna, a lovely witch, and King, Cian's loyal human servant, who they believe to be the warrior Morrigan has called. They are soon joined by Larkin, a shapeshifter, and Moira, a scholar from a distant time. Lilith has no intention of waiting for Samhain to begin the war. Not all of the heroes will survive her early assaults, but will be replaced with someone more suited to the task than they could have hoped for. Even in the midst of darkness and battle, love blossoms, as Glenna and Hoyt discover a passion that can span centuries, if they survive the next month.***** From the first words, I was hooked. Each of the protagonists is compellingly vibrant, making you care about their fates. Particularly interesting is Cian, a man who definitely has more layers than your average hero. The climatic scens are explosive. The word pictures are as vivid as if they were on dvd. I look forward to finding out how all six reach a happy ending. *****"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I started to read Nora Roberts 'Morrigan's Cross' which is the first book of 'The Circle Trilogy' and found it to be a very disappointing book. I did not like Nora Roberts's selected style for this book which contained witches, vampires, sorcerers and related Gods of some kind. She lost my ability to concentrate on the story by including too much trash therefore I immediately took all three books to a local used book store and traded them for three other books. I therefore am, as the title of this review indicates, DISAPPOINTED."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book has been summarized often enough that I don't think it will be necessary for me to give yet another summary.I have to say that I am very surprised by so many negative to luke-warm reviews for this book. I loved it! I found the \\"Key\\" trilogy unreadable, but the first book in this series was simply fantastic! I think that the problem that people are having is that this book blends a couple of genres, notably urban fantasy/fantasy with romance. Therefore, this book is neither an urban fantasy nor a romance, but a story that contains elements of both.I loved Hoyt and Glenna as characters, but really other than the \\"bad\\" guys most of the people in this book are really well drawn characters with likable characteristics. The introduction to the world and the characters was well done without being simply an \\"intro\\" book. A story complete in itself, this book drew me in and was impossible to put down!I say that you should ignore the bad reviews, unless you are romance purist or a fantasy purist that expects all of the conventions of those genres to be adhered to strictly. If you like a great story with great characters, action, and romance then read this fantastic addition to Nora Roberts' already outstanding booklist."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I cannot wait for the next two installments of this trilogy. Morrigan's Cross was yet another terrific work by Nora Roberts. I am already reading to book again just to see if I missed anything the first time. I read it so fast just dying to see what would happen next. I highly reccomend this book for anyone who loves to pick up a book and get completely lost in the magic of the story. This one definitely works."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have read most of Nora's novels and this is quite a change of pace but one I really appreciate. I have read all three of this series and could not wait to read the next in line. I am an avid reader of all different kinds of fiction my favorite being Steven King followed by Dean Koonz then the Dirk Pitt series and Dr. Cross series of serial killers. Nora is very good at building strong characters, ones you can relate to later on if it takes you a long time in between to finish the series. Moira was weak at first but finishes 1st in the last book and the vampire killer Blair reminded me a lot of Buffy the vampire killer except she wasn't a teeny bopper. I am a total dragon fan and was enchanted by Larkins ability to shift-change into a beautiful golden dragon{not sure this was in the 1st book or the last}. The battle scenes were worthy of ancient warrior battles of Ireland and kept me on the edge of my seat.All in all, finish this book and continue on, you won't regret it and you will be surprised at the end of the 3rd book. As a final note, the series was written as a story about vampires but when I was recalling the story from memory (since I read it months ago}, that was the weakest part in the book except where Cian was concerned and Lilith. The best parts were the romances, shift-changing, time traveling back and forth and the battles."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Our story starts back in the 12th century in Ireland following the disappearance of twin.

It is full of romance, sparing, suspense, and a lot of magic."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I wonder if Nora let one of her children try their hand at writing. This book was a great disappointment to me. I have most every book she has ever written but this one is not a keeper. The three books in this series could have been condensed into one book. I hope she does not start writing books like this all the time because I just think the story was weak."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I was given all three of the books in this trilogy and started reading the first one eagerly looking forward to getting to know the characters. For me, there was too much needless dialogue throughout all three books. The story could have been told in one book if edited properly. It was simply boring reading through all of the arguments by the main characters. In the first two books, the main female characters were just plain nasty and rude most of the time. I only enjoyed the last book a little because the female lead character actually acted like a woman in love and not like Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"It was hard to understand the reader in the beginning, however, eventually I got used to his strong accent and became immersed in the story. Some of my friends could not take the accent and resorted to reading the book, and then became immersed, however, not everyone can handle this content with plenty of blood and immorality, vampires and such. However, it is a strong novel of the battle of good against evil and the good definitely outweighs the bad for me. I heard all 3 books and hated for them to end. I wish Nora would write a 4th book - I loved it!!!"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"In Morrigan's Cross, Nora Roberts sets a tale about a man on his journey to fight evil of epic proportions. Hoyt is one of a set of twins. Recently his brother had been turned into a creature of the night by the oldest living vampire in existence, Lilith. In order to save all he loves as well as the human race, he is visited by the Goddess Morrigan. She tells him he must set out on a trek and collect five very specific people with qualities complementary to his own for the battle to end all battles. Each of the five has been visited by the goddess, now all he must do is find them and lead them to the location for this great war. It will take all the wisdom he has to learn who he can and cannot trust, and all of his strength to find a way to work together.Morrigan's Cross while a good read, is below par for an author with the talents we have seen by Nora Roberts. This amazing author has given us many tales that have become instant favorites, and as such it is a bit of a disappointment to read book one of The Circle trilogy. Hope is not lost however while waiting for the second book, in the past Nora has been able to pull her series books full circle. Morrigan's Cross may only be the setup of something greater. So for this reviewer I will give it another chance in Dance of the Gods next month before reaching a verdict, keeping in mind this is her first dabbling in vampire fiction. But as far as book one on its own it will maintain a satisfactory rating in this fan's eyes.Reviewed by JoyceCopyright 2006 CK2S Kwips and Kritiques.

This one stars the Circle of Six, who must fight an apocalyptic battle against vampires in order to save the worlds. The story begins on a fateful night when Hoyt MacCionaoith battles his newly-formed vampire brother Cian on a cliff in twelfth century Ireland. Hoyt is a sorcerer who is soon after called upon by the goddess Morrigan to form a circle of six, an army to do battle against Lilith, queen of the vampires, and her underlings. Hoyt travels nearly a thousand years into the future through the Dance of the Gods, landing in his vampire brother's living room in present day Manhattan. Cian has been a vampire for nearly a thousand years now, and has acquired wealth and properties around the world. One of these is Eternity, the nightclub under his apartment. Cian quit feasting on humans several hundred years back and now dines on frozen packets of blood he heats in the microwave. He and Hoyt are soon joined by Glenna, a witch who healed Hoyt in his dreams. Cian's friend, a huge black man named King, offers to join the three when they travel to Ireland to begin readying themselves for battle. After settling in at Cian's home, which happens to be his ancestral family residence from the twelfth century, two more travelers from the land of Geall arrive, the scholar Moira and her shape-shifting cousin Larkin.As the six train for battle, they learn about each other and begin forming a deep friendship. Hoyt and Glenna also fall in love while they work on magic spells together. Though the group faces stark tragedy and often skirmish amongst themselves, they nonetheless form a cohesive unit. Nora's deft hand with interpersonal relationships shines through, between battles with vampires and sorcery. The romance between Hoyt and Glenna is a minor part of the story, more of an excuse to write the book in a familiar genre than anything, but even that is skillfully woven into the rest of the story. I would expect nothing less. With this trilogy and her last, Nora has made the books almost incomplete without each other. The romance between Hoyt and Glenna reaches resolution, but the main, driving story has just begun.I'm not much of a reader of fantasy or vampire novels and can't give an accurate judgment of the \\"realism\\" of those aspects, but as a general work of imaginative fiction, it flows nicely and fuses its elements well. It also stars a diverse cast of characters, all of whom we get to know somewhat. Nora went out on a limb with this trilogy, treading new ground and giving her fans something a little different, and it was a success. Most importantly, the book left me wanting more, eager to pick up the next. For a satisfying taste of the unusual, the first third of the Circle Trilogy is a success."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I was very reluctant to read this book after I read the cover in the store because vampires have never really been my thing and I was wondering what Nora was thinking with this foray into the realm of fantasy like this. Boy am I glad I bought it anyway!! I found myself immediately drawn in to a world where six strangers from different times and worlds must come together to save the world from the forces of evil. I don't know what it is about Nora's writing but I just couldn't put this book down! Not to sound totally cliched or anything but this book made me laugh and cry and count the days until the second book came out. Slainte, Nora on yet another creative, enjoyable novel!"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I've read the first two books of this series and I have to say, its better than I expected. If you've read other NR, you can recognize some of the characterizations, but over all, the characters are good, if a bit cliched. Otherwise, I'm looking forward to the last book, because the most interesting characters star in the 3rd. The plot is more well worked than in some of her other series. Morrigan's Cross takes a little bit to get going, but I thought the effort was worth it. After reading the reviews, I was hesitant, but, combined, the series will be one of her better ones."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"If you are a Nora Roberts fan then you will most likely enjoy this book. Although it is a bit predictable, it still offers new characters (from my knowledge NR has not wrote of vampires, witches and the like before) with new circumstances. Buy this book if you enjoy her method of storytelling and you'll be happy.This story is about 6 people with some sort of gift of their own, brought together to fight the Queen of the Damned Lilith in an end -of-the-world battle. The circle of 6 were appointed by the goddess Morrigan and she began the circle with the sorceror Hoyt and his first recruit is his brother-turned-vampire Cian. This first book introduces us to the circle and focuses on the tale of Hoyt and Glenna the witch and their battle to love each other as well as fight the evil vampires.I really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the next in the series."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I just finished listening to the Circle Trilogy of which \\"Morrigan's Cross\\" is the first book. I don't write reviews on all books I read, but felt compelled to do so for this series. I have been a Nora Roberts/JD Robb fan for several years and have read most of her publishings. I was actually hesitant to read this series because I had read comments that it was so \\"dark\\". But I put my trust in my appreciation of Nora Roberts, and I am very glad that I decided to read the series. I didn't find it to be as \\"dark\\" as I anticipated; the story is basically \\"good against evil\\", and not as dark as some thrillers I've read. True to Nora's storytelling, the underlying romance in each book brings valuable payback for the Nora fan. There was also enough \\"action\\" that even my husband enjoyed listening to it. I felt Dick Hill did a fabulous narration performance, with the Gaelic accents and inflections. Though the \\"ups and downs\\" of voice sometimes makes it necessary to adjust the volume, it's necessary to the story. The culmination and action in the final battle in Book #3 is well written, and my husband, who reads a lot of action stories, said he'd even rate it a \\"7\\". Book #3 will bring rewards, but I was not bored with the story escalating through Books #1 and #2. Nora again shines as she builds the characters through a series, and helps us to \\"fall in love\\" with them. And it's been a long time since the final ending of a story has brought me to tears! Well done, Nora! And thanks again for continuing to provide us with very enjoyable \\"escapes\\"."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"A different writing style for Ms. Roberts and at times I wasn't sure if the words on paper were her own, or given over to a ghostwriter. The style is different from how she normally writes, but just the same, the story, in parts was intriguing.I found some of the dialogue redundant and the arguments mundane. The romance was sudden and unbelievable leaving the reader feeling they missed a chapter or two.I felt the book needed another edit--the language choice was poor and repetitive. Just the same, the change in style is a good attempt and I hope the next books in the trilogy bring the characters together. The book in some parts is engaging and others, flat."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I've read most of Nora Roberts books and I have to say this entire series was somewhat disappointing. There are lots of ingredients for a great paranormal romance story here - witches, vampires, sorcerers, shapeshifters, dragons, time travel, but it's put together poorly and was hard to follow and envision.Book 1 of the trilogy is based on mostly 2 of the circle of 6, however Ms. Roberts is forced to spend a lot of time and energy on the other characters in order to set the stage for the coming books. That detracted from the story of these two and all of the voices were hard to follow. I found myself really anticipating the next book though, as it was clear the stage was being set.All in all, there was a story and it was told, but with all of the elements, it could have been done better. I look for more from Nora Roberts and hope to see it in the next book of hers I read, because it wasn't here as strongly as it has been in other books and trilogies."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"In general I am a huge fan of Nora Roberts, having been sucked in with her characters in her J.D. Robb series and enjoyed many other works as well. I am generally pleased with her character development, as I am a reader who appreciates good characters. Also, I love the use of magic and psychic \\"powers\\" and generally have enjoyed books of that nature. This is just the sort of book (as I also like historical novels) that I should have been thrilled with.Unfortunately, I found the premise interesting but not compelling and, sadly, the characters less than her best. The story is not terrible and, but it isn't exceptional and, for the most part, entirely predictable (which it should not have been in this type of romance). At this moment, her protagonist vampire is the most lifelike of the characters and that's probably a pity.It isn't a horrible book and I own it so I shall likely read it again some day, but I wouldn't feel compelled to buy it (or the followons I preordered at the same time) if I had read it in the library first. It's OK if you're used to lesser authors and in love with fantasy romances. It isn't, however, up to par with Roberts' best work in my opinion. I prefer her Key series, her In the Garden series or even her Donovan Legacy."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The first book in Nora Robert's new Circle Trilogy is entertaining, like all of her work, but her trilogies are beginning to feel quite formulaic. The heroines' personalities in this trilogy often feel like mix and match from her earlier works, and Glenna in this book definely feels like a rehash. The first book, luckily, is not the best of the trilogy, but it does set the stage for later books. Roberts is still on her supernatural other worlds, gods, etc. trend and the new twist here is vampires. It is still worth reading, and will help you happily pass the hours of a flight or in a waiting room, but if you are one of the few people who haven't read Nora Roberts, start with her superior Ardmore trilogy (starts with Jewels of the Sun, perhaps her best trilogy romance) or with her very interesting futuristic detective novels she writes as J.D. Robb."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I am not a Romance fan and have only heard of Nora Roberts. I am a fantasy fan so I picked this book up while on vacation and needed something to read. At first the book started out cheesy and predictable, with all the typical fantasy cliches. I kept reading though and found myself sucked in. The character development was pretty good and now I want to know what happens to them, so I will be ordering the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Speaking as someone who prefers Nora Roberts when she writes as J.D.Robb - I thought the story was fine but it didn't leave me with a burning need to go out and get the second book.Part of this might be down to the fact that it's the first in a trilogy, so the story has a lot to do - we need to be introduced to the characters, to the world they live in and the circumstances they find themselves. I thought the set-up was interesting and the circle of 6 a clever idea. I very much liked the poetry of it - (the sorcerer), \\"the witch, the warrior, the scholar, the one of many forms and the one you've lost\\". However, I found the characters (with the exception of Cian) didn't hold my interest. One of the problems with an ensemble cast, is that some characters are neglected.There are moments where the dialogue sparkles - Cian especially, has an acerbic wit. And some of the set pieces are beautifully written, for example - Glenna's arrival at the club and her first (proper) meeting with Cian, Hoyt and King.In the second half of the book following Blair's arrival there are scenes reminiscent of what the group already experienced in the first half before she turned up. I ended up with the feeling that the characters should have learnt these lessons already.If this had been the first paranormal romance I'd ever read I think I would have been impressed with the world building and story structure, though the characters would still have left me slightly disappointed."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I think anyone expecting a typical Nora Roberts is destined to be disppointed. I, personally, am a fantasy fan so this one was right up my alley. (I'm also a huge fan of her JD Robb work.)This is not the type of book for a casual read. This is TV off, lights up full, nothing else on your plate type of book. You have to work and think and remember while reading this book. (I appreciated the glossary.) There is a level of violence that some may find disturbing, but to me, the most disturbing part was the glee that the creatures took in the violence. Keep you awake type of glee, at least for me.I have nearly everything she has ever written, and some I re-read over and over. Will I with this series? I don't know, I'm reserving judgement until I read the other two, at least I don't have to wait long for them."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"It's no surprise to me that I enjoyed this book; I'm a big fan of Nora's books and her style of writing. But I don't necessarily think it's the best she's ever written. Much as it pains me to do so, I'd have to rate this book no higher than 3 stars.First books in series or trilogies have the important role of laying out the general purpose of the series and also providing a sturdy anchorage for what's to come. While this one succeeded in holding my interest and making me eager for the other books in the trilogy, I didn't feel that it was as strong a \\"first book\\" as it could have been. After reading it, I didn't feel excited about THIS book so much as I felt excited about the books to come. The weakness of Morrigan's Cross seems to lie with the characters. They're all quite likable, but none of them except for Cian has struck me as particularly memorable so far. Mostly I felt that I never truly got to know the Circle of Six well -- even in the case of Hoyt and Glenna, who are the two \\"main\\" characters of this first story -- perhaps because the focus of Morrigan's Cross seems to be more on worldbuilding than character development.Nora writes romances, and I read her books for the romance. But I felt that I got a little short-shifted in the romance department with Morrigan's Cross. Hoyt and Glenna get their HEA at the end of the book -- well, as happy as it can be, considering they've got two more books and an ultimate showdown with evil still to go -- but I didn't feel that their relationship was particularly compelling. They've got common ground in that they're both magical -- Hoyt's a sorcerer and Glenna's a witch -- and both are caught up in the same fight against a common enemy, but other than that I just didn't see what drew each to the other. They didn't seem to me to have any real passion -- at least, not for each other -- and I have a feeling that the most passionate romance is not going to make an appearance until the third book, when the vampire Cian and the young queen Moira sort through their feelings for one another.There were certain aspects about the book that seemed unfinished or unexplored or unexplained. Like...Hoyt travels 1000 years into the future, to the present time, and hardly seems fazed by the modern world around him. Something about that just didn't ring true to me. Where was the astonishment, the confusion, the amazement, the frustration? And Moira and her cousin Larkin travel from another world, for crying out loud, but also seem unimpressed by the enormity of that feat. There are no language barriers. No struggles to relate to others from different times and different worlds. No lingering bemusement. On the one hand, I'm glad that Nora didn't go into a whole \\"Initiation to Modern Ireland 101\\" because she had other aspects of the story that had to get down on paper. But on the other hand it was difficult for me to buy into the idea that this Circle of Six had originated from such disparate locales and times when they all seemed so alike and had so little difficulty relating to one another and the world around them.I've gotten the feeling that a lot of folks out there have gotten caught up in the idea that Nora is jumping on the \\"vampire fiction\\" bandwagon with this trilogy. If that's what you're expecting, you'll probably be disappointed. But if you like the books and writing of Nora Roberts and can go into this trilogy expecting it to be something more along the lines of the Key trilogy, you'll probably be much happier with Morrigan's cross. It reads well and has a fast pace and a likable cast of characters. It leaves you ready for the next book. I certainly didn't think that it was a bad book. My knee-jerk is to give it 4 stars instead of 3. But to me it felt more like a long prologue than a well-crafted first book in a trilogy."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I love Nora. I have everything she's ever written, and I re-read my favorites regularly. However, some of her early stuff is BAD. No character development, people who fall in love immediately and get married in 2 weeks, that kind of garbage. I think maybe she wrote this book in 1982 and put it in a file someplace because it was too bad to publish. Now that she's superstar, she could sneeze on a page, print it, and sell 100 million copies.Starting with the recent \\"Key\\" trilogy and continuing on here in Morrigan's Cross, Nora has either fallen back on those old habits, or just ceased to care about the quality of her romance novels. I suspect the latter, because the JD Robb \\"In Death\\" books are still great.\\"Morrigan's Cross\\" is totally insipid. Every character and plot-line is borrowed from someplace else where it was done better. I really had a hard time even finishing it.I wish Nora would go back to writing about people in more realistic situations. She's not good at this type of fantasy.[And as a side note, I'm sure the real Morrigan, who is a kick-butt Irish battle goddess, would impale \\"The Six\\" on spears and then dance naked around their bleeding corpses!]"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I read Nora Roberts all the time, and was definitely not disappointed in this book.

Consumed by grief, guilt and anger over the loss of his brother, Hoyt confronts Lilith and is lucky to survive. The next morning, Morrigan, a goddess, comes to Hoyt and tells him of an upcoming battle between good and evil; battle for evil being led by Lilith. A battle Morrigan charges Hoyt to win for the sake of mankind.Hoyt, a sorcerer, is told that he will be joined by others to form a circle of six to defeat Lilith and her minions and winning is not guaranteed. If they should fail, all will be lost. Hoyt learns he will transverse time to join a warrior, a scholar, a witch, a shape-shifter and a lost soul to wage war against evil.When I heard that Nora Roberts had a new trilogy coming out, I was hoping it would rival the Sister's Trilogy--my all time favorite Nora Roberts books. After the first chapter of Morrigan's Cross I knew that I was hooked. I loved this first installment in the Circle Trilogy. The fighting against evil is intense; the characters have captured my imagination and the love story between Hoyt and Glenna was both amusing and tender.I have already picked my favorite couple. If I am wrong about these two, I'll be cross-eyed with angst. So, it goes without saying I am salivating for the next book in this trilogy.

I do not normally like contemporary romance fiction, and thus do not usually read Nora Roberts (I like the futuristic In Death series better). However, I picked it up as soon as I saw this was about the ultimate good vs evil battle involving sorcerers, witches, vampires, shape shifters, etc.Granted if you're looking for your everyday run-of-the mill romance novel, this isn't it.

If I had known that there was no closure whatsoever at the end of the book then I wouldn't have bought it. I know it is a trilogy and I've read books like this before but the ending was just like an end to a chapter -- no satisfaction at all when I finished the book.

This trilogy has it all. Humor, romance, and suspense! Reading this was (as always) an absolute pleasure."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"While being a fan of Nora Roberts's books, this book was definitely not on my list of \\"need to read\\" books. Compared to her other stories, this one did not live up to my expectations.Morrigan's Cross starts with a grandfather telling a story of a sorcerer to his little nieces and nephews. The story beings with the sorcerer, Hoyt, on cliffs in Ireland in 1128 fighting the demon queen, Lilith, who has turned his brother, Cian, into a vampire. Wanting to avenge his brother, he tries to battle Lilith, but is not strong enough yet. So for now, he goes on his own path to try and become stronger. Later on in the story he meets Morrigan who takes him to the Dance of the Gods, where he is to meet his fate. He is told he must gather the six warriors: The witch, the warrior, the scholar, that one of many forms, and the one he's lost. Then he is thrust from the mythical town of Eire, in the region of Chiarrai, to modern day New York, in the year 2006. Once there, he meets Glenna, the fiery Witch with red hair. He immediately falls in love with her; creating a romance between the two for the rest of the novel. Together they search for the remaining 4 and protect the world from the evil vampire, Lilith, who is bent on world domination.While the characters were well developed, the story lacked uniqueness for me. This book seemed like every other vampire book I've read. The romance between the two main characters developed way too fast, and they did not explain about vampires and the other warlocks as much as I wish the book did. The plot could have also been more compelling; the author spent too much time on writing the love story and describing the characters. So when it came to the action scenes, she seemed to sloppily put it together just so she could move on with the romance. I remember it being so boring at times that I would fall asleep and forget where I left off. If you are into romance novels, then this book would be compelling to you, but for those of you looking for more serious vampire slaying books, I wouldn't recommend this to make your list.~Sam"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"While not a romance fan, I did find this book entertaining. I enjoyed the storyline and characters, but my wife and I found ourselves laughing at the repetitive and continuous \\"plunging in and out\\" as the narrator spoke through the car speakers.

First, I have to say that I absolutely loved this entire trilogy so much....with that being said, Morrigan's Cross (book 1) is definitely a \\"slow burn\\" and takes some patience to get through. A word of advice is not to give up on it because the second book really takes off and the third is like an intense explosion which wraps this trilogy up beautifully. Morrigan's Cross combines medieval fantasy, action, and romance in one which Robert's is so easily able to do. This first book sets the stage very nicely for the others to ignite and eventually explode with intensity, love, romance, action, time-travel, magic and so much more. Give it a try. You will love it too !!"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Interesting story based on Celtic mythology. I really liked how the characters were an odd assortment from different generations. There are vampires, sorcerers and witches...appearing effectively around a fascinating tale.While the mythology is strong, the story has a slow start and is repetitive at times.

I'll be continuing the series as I became invested in the characters and the outcome of the mythology."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Different,but I loved this book!!!

I liked the plot, it's just there are so many characters and so much going on at once, that I think the characterization is lacking a bit. I got a good feel for Hoyt and Glenna, the main characters, but I think Ms. Roberts spent too much time on the other characters in this book that should have been focused on in the second and third in the trilogy.Too many POV's... we were in each character's point of view at one point in time and while that's a useful tool in letting us know about each character, I truly think this book would have been way better if Ms. Roberts had simply focused on Hoyt and Glenna, but that's just one reader's take."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"If you are new to Nora Roberts, I can pretty much guarantee you will like this trilogy. If you are a long-time fan (as I am), you might just get the feeling you've read this story before.Nora Roberts is an unusually prolific writer, which is both a good thing, and a not so good thing. On the plus side, you don't have to wait forever for a trilogy to finish, you get all three one month after the other, and every book has a professional finish. On the negative side, there is the very real possibility that you are pretty much burned out, and your eyes are glazing over by the middle of the second book (or sooner). Her female characters are always exactly the same in looks and personalities, so are her male characters. The theme is always the same \\"love is the greatest magic of all\\", you know who is going to be the sacrificial good guy, you know which male will end up with which female. There are times when I think she goes into one of her older books, changes the names, changes the location, changes the plot devices (vampires are popular, I'll do that!), then lets the computer edit the updates and Voila! New (sort of) story.The Circle Trilogy is nothing more or less than an update of The Gallaghers of Ardmore Trilogy, Born In Trilogy, Dream Trilogy, Three Sisters Island Trilogy (my personal favorite), Key Trilogy, The Donovan Legacy, and In the Garden Trilogy. All good, all the same, mix and match."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"didn't think I would after reading other reviews, but I liked it.

Then I picked it up again about 10 days later and had to re-read the prologue. This time I must have been in a different frame of mind as once I began I did not want to put it down. I devoured the first book, did the same for the second one and half way through the third I slowed down on purpose because I really did not want it to end. This was my introduction to Nora Roberts - recommended by a friend. I enjoyed it so much that I am probably going to be disapointed in the next book I pick up by her. If you enjoy interesting characters and fantasy, this is a delicious read with romance to garnish it."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm a guy who from time to time likes to read chick-lit. And Nora Roberts is the master, from her characterizations to her chin-nibblings. Usually, most of her works are without any real plot, falling into simple \\"girl meets boy, boy motivates girl to be the best she can be, girl falls madly in love with boy.\\" Nora does this by way of the trilogy format, in which #1 boy/girl pair are the main thrust of book one, etc.Now, with the Circle Trilogy, Nora has added a story line of good triumphing over evil! Sure, it's a fantasy with vampires, sorcerers, witches, shape shifters, vampire hunters and a wise princess. Because of these characters, it may be dismissed by the realists in our midst. This series is nothing more than the good old fashioned Passion Play but in combining Roberts' strength of characterization and scene-setting, it is completely enjoyable.Roberts is a formula-writer, who writes approximately 105,000 words and stops. Her trademark chin-nibbling scenes are not there. In the Circle Trilogy, she simply didn't have room for the story and foreplay, too.She sticks with her usual three heroine/three volume format but unlike her other trilogies, all the characters are active in all three books while the storyline marches from one volume into the next. In actuality, it is a single 900 page book masquerading as three books. And I like it that way.This series is the best of all worlds: people I can root for (or against), emotional entanglements and a solid storyline."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This was the first book of Nora Roberts that I was really disappointed in. It was extremely slow and very hard to get through. The next two books in the Circle Trilogy were much better"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I've read many Nora Roberts books and I like her earlier works better. Her more recent works seem to repeat themselves. The same character types are seen over and over, while the careers and the locations change. So, I wanted to read this trilogy to see what she would do with new material. And this first book was again, somewhat repetitive.We've seen magic quite a bit from her and two magicians get together in this novel. There's the strong, agressive, twenty-first century woman and the stoic, macho, twelfth-century man. The romance was pretty lacking. The two get together and then all of a sudden they both can't live without each other, without any kind of build-up. When they would make grand declarations to each other, I couldn't help but wonder, \\"When did that happen? Did I miss something?\\" It was as if, because they were both people of magic, we were just supposed to understand that they understood that they were meant to be together, which is not the way I like to read.The idea of a circle of people from different times and different worlds banding together to fight evil is a nice concept though, and I like that everyone has their own specialty, well, except for the two magic people. Despite the somewhat disappointing, but not unexpected start, I will read the rest of the trilogy to see what happens."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I finished this book quickly one weekend, and it was a lot of fun. With typical Nora Roberts attention to detail, and with plenty of lyrical descriptions throughout, I had fun spending time in the worlds that Nora created in this book. For those who find fault with how quickly the plot moved and two of the characters fell in love, they need to recognize the limitations of the trilogy format. A single-title romance could have been longer, and spent more time on the twists and turns and misunderstandings that go into forming a romantic relationship. But here, as the first of three books in the trilogy, there is only so much romance that makes sense in the context of preparing for the final showdown with Lilith and her minions. We are treated to a sweet romance between two of the group members, but I found the entire group dynamic and the fantasy worlds of vampyres and goddesses to be the central driving force of the book, and it is those aspects that make me eager to finish the second and third books of the triology. I imagine in the next two books, we will enjoy romances between the other four of the six main characters at a similar fast pace given the relative shortness of the books, but again, a trilogy is more about an adventure and telling a full story that happens to have three main stages (the first, the second, and the third). I don't consider its length or the speed with which the plot turns a fault with this novel, and recommend it to other readers as a quick, fun, fantastical read for those who enjoy romance and occasionally enjoy forays into the mystical and the adventurous realms."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I've been a Nora Roberts fan for years...but originally was turned off by a review I'd read for this book. You see, while I can deal with sorcery, witches and the like as in the Key Trilogy and the Island Trilogy...I have a hard time with fantasy worlds. Tell me we're in Scotland, and I have an appropriate mental image...but, tell me we're in Geall...and, well, I'm really lost.Vampires...or should we say vampyres. I read \\"Interview with a Vampire\\" when it was originally published...years before other people seemed to discover Anne Rice. So, I'm okay with vampires, too.And the fantasy world thing...don't want to be a spoiler, here...but in this first book of the trilogy, not much time was spent in Geall.I loved this book. In fact, I read it pretty much in one sitting. I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews. Glenna, Hoyt, Larkin, Moira, Cian, King and Blair...what an army! I instantly liked them and think their characters were well conceived and presented.Okay...so, maybe the romance was a bit on the quick side...but, it is fiction, after all...and given the types of men we're talking about here (I was thinking McSteamy)...I think we can all believe in love at first sight!Only thing that could have made this book better, is if I'd known there was a glossary in the back...before I finished!I have the next two books in the series tucked away in a drawer...can't decide whether or not to continue on, now, or wait a while. Actually, I think what we have here is a 1,000 page novel...so maybe I'll end this review here...and go get \\"Dance of the Gods\\" and settle in for a long afternoon of reading...in a fantasy world!"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is book one of the Circle TrilogyHoyt Mac Cionaoith is a wizard that has failed to kill Lilith, a vampire queen that has turned his twin brother Cian into one of her demons.The goddess, Morrigan appears to Hoyt, telling him this was only the beginning and that he will have to find the five others that will help him with his quest to destroy Lilith and her demons from taking over all the worlds.

Because Nora Roberts is my favorite author, I kept coming back to it. Once I got into the second chapter, I'm glad I did. Time travel, and vampires are not my ususal choice to read. Hoyt, a sorcerer has to try to save his twin, Cian from a queen vampire. He fails, then his journey begins to kill all vampires. He travels fron the 12th century [with the help of a witch] to present day in New York, where he meets with his brother, the vampire, once again.Cian isn't your usual vampire of course, he doesn't drink from humans. He gets his bag of blood from a frig, pops it into the microwave, and has lunch. Foolishness ? No so. It fits right in with the plot.We meet a circle of six, who with others [I assume to come in the Dance of God's, the second in the trilogy]The relationships that form in this first book, are great Nora.She manages to always pull it together with complete opposites.I don't want to give too much of the story away, so I'll just say that you'll love this unusual book.It has romance, a fast moving pace, some violence, you can't have vampires without that !I can't wait for the other two books to come out. If you're a Roberts fan, or even if you aren't, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is the first time I have read a roberts book. I thought it might be interesting seeing that I have never read a romance before and have mostly studied and read fantasies.When I first picked up morrigans cross I had no idead what it was about, all I knew was that nora roberts wrote it and ishe is a romance novelist.So I gave it a chance.I was very surprised to see this was a vampire, magic, romance fantasy. And as a fantasy reader I liked the general story and basis.But there we're some things missing, some characters appeared superficial and not very well developed, but I guess that will be cleared out in the next installments.The romance was a little....Well it wanst terrible, I still enjoyed it.I am anxiously awaiting the next books because it is an intereting story and it does catch your attention.As far as characters are concerned, the lead Hoyt was intereting at first and then sort of started to dull down, I guess because he was outstaged by Glenna his love interest.But again, I suppose that will be further explained in the later books.The one thing that stood out the most in the entire book was Cian, hoyts brother and 1000 year old modern day vampire.He absolutly stole the show.His character is complex, interesting, tragic yet he has a big heart that he hardly ever shows.This character has so many complex levels to him and so many secrets he is not revealing, especially when it comes with his relationship with lilith and the other vampires. And the things that have happen to him over the 1000 years of his immortal life.You just want to see what comes next, how will his relationship change with Hoyt, his brother who he obviously still cared about.How will his relationship be with Glenna, who seems to be one of the few of the group who doesn't judge him right away and accepts him for who he is.And how will his relationship be with Moira. Who he obviously has a thing for, but will most likely take some time in expressing his true self, because he is the tormented, mysterious tragic loner, who longs for companionship and love but cannot show any real softness or emotions to anybody.If there is no other reason to read this book, then let Cian be the reason. He steals every scene he is in.Sometimes you can't wait to turn the page to see if something more is going to be revealed.The fact that Cian is this interesting is what drives the story and makes you want to know more about him."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I loved this book, I think it's wonderful.It is both romantic, funny and scary as hell. This is a new direction for Nora Roberts, but it's one that i'm sure peaople will enjoy."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan and this book certainly did not disappoint. I greatly enjoyed it and am looking forward to reading the next two books in the trilogy."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"As a Nora Roberts fan, I of course look forward to new books by her. However, this one totally missed in terms of a worthwhile read. That said, I would personally have preferred that she had made Angels Falls a paperback and taken this trilogy and put more effort into it and made it a hardcover. Books one and two of the trilogy were rather boring in my humble opinion. You could see a relationship building between the tortured Cian and the future queen Moira--the development made the third book satisfying, but one and two were not. The pairings (Hoyt/Glenna, Larkin/Blair) seemed forced and there wasn't enough foundation to want to see these folks succeed as couples. The teasers were there to make the pairings powerful, but the reality was that the books were too short, too much of a fluff adventure to allow it to happen.I also would have liked to have seen more information about vampires--historical and \\"factual\\" (whatever that means). It seemed like Ms. Roberts was trying to combine the vampire, time travel, romance and general fiction genres all in this trilogy.If you gave up the series at this book, my advice would be to read all three with your focus on Cian and Moira. Both characters develop well in the trilogy. The other two pairings do not. You can see glimpses of development, but suddenly Hoyt and Glenna are a pair and you think \\"Did I miss something here?\\" How and why did they suddenly with weeks fall madly in love in the \\"I can't live without you as you complete me\\" framework. Just wasn't enough information in the book.Again, I think this would have made a far better hardcover with some additional writing and depth in it and a focus on Cian and Moira who to me are the most interesting of the six major characters."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"First book in Roberts' new Circle Trilogy, we enter the world of ancient Celtic magic and vampires. When his twin brother is made into a vampire, powerful sorcerer Hoyt Mac Cionaoith is sent on a quest by the goddess Morrigan, to save the world from vampires - but not in his own time. He is to find Cian, his brother, and form a band of 6 warriors to start the war against Lilith, the vampire who turned Cian. Glenna is the witch in the group, and they are then joined by two cousins from Gael who were victims of vampires in their own world. They travel back to Ireland, present day, to prepare for the coming battle, in the Mac Cionaoith ancestral home which Cian has bought and maintained. The circle of six is completed there, and the magic between Hoyt and Glenna is more than just out of this world. I kind of had a hard time with Roberts' writing this type of magic - I am more accustomed to her other type of paranormal abilities, and vampires didn't quite sit with me. Other than that it is a genuinely interesting story with a lot of humor and action."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm a devoted Nora Roberts fan and have bought and read nearly every thing she writes. If it has her name on it, I only stop to check to make sure I don't already have it before I buy it.I'm rarely disappointed. Her characters, particularly in the trilogies, are well developed and make you want to root for them. Her descriptions are evocative and poetic.But Morrigan's Cross just didn't delight me as most of her books do. The characters were not engaging, the plot was predictable, the prose was so-so.I enjoy her forays into fastasy and sorcery, but maybe it was the vampyre which turned me off.I've had to force myself to continue to read (eventhough I stopped in the middle to re-read Chesapeake Blue!) and I'm still not done. I usually stay up all night to finish a NR book, but it's been nearly a week and I still haven't finished this one.I'm not sure if I'll buy the rest of this trilogy. We'll have to see."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Other than her J.D. Robb books, I don't normally read Nora Robert books because I find them hard to get into. I picked up Morrigan's Cross because it had vampires, sorcerers, and witches in it.The story was indeed dry and almost like a basic guideline to a Dungeons and Dragons storyline. Hero is assigned a task to fight evil and he has to gather his band of heros that are each different and have their own skills to form a team to defeat the villain. There is the sorceror, vampire, witch, buffy-like vampire slayer, shape changer, and an archer. All strangers who band together and train for several months to fight the big Bad.Most of the story line just has them learning each other and training. The worst part of the story is that the overall plot of fighting the villain isn't even in the conclusion. Instead, you get one small battle, and the next book will continue w/ their training and maybe another battle, before dipping into a 3rd book that will tie up the big bad war plot.I bought this book when it first released, and it took me until now to finally open up the book and finish it from beginning to end. I had a difficult time getting in the mood to read the book.I don't believe I would recommend this book. Nor will I buy the followup books. I may just skim it in the store if I'm so inclined to find out what happens in the end. But it really isn't that interesting. Nora Roberts attempt to cash in to the paranormal world of Vampires, witches and buffy-like vampire slayers is just another so-so paranormal book that is flooding the IT market."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"A friends suggested that I read this as it's along the lines of what I enjoy. Romance, vampires and mythology. All three things are there, but not in the best of stories ever told. This is average and not one I think you'll read again.I'm a slow reader. I know this and accept it. Even though I read word for work except when I skip over lots of details, when I'm reading I'm not seeing the words, but am seeing everything in movie. Yes, I'm sure my pictures are not the same as the descriptions on the page and I'm OK with that. To me, the story isn't the surface stuff so much as the essence of what is going on. This it not to say I am a passive reader. I'm not. I'm constantly thinking of what's going on, where the story is going, what's going to happen to the characters, how did the characters get to this point. All these things I feel are very important to a good epic story series which this was trying to be. As I'm reading, there are things that will catch my eye and I'll hold on to until the story clears up my question or concern, such as Hoyt being told by description of who is to be part of his team or of Nola, his youngest sister who has the \\"sight\\" telling Hoyt that she will be the last to complete the circle.The description of the people who complete the circle weren't something that Hoyt really held onto or questioned over and over as he was looking. Though told by the Goddess that some he would find, others would have to find him--those words indicate more of a search than what really happened. I don't understand why Hoyt never really acknowledges that his brother fulfilled one of the descriptions. Perhaps because there wasn't much of a search for the 5 other people was why the descriptions of these people fell flat for me.I'm still trying to figure out how Moria was the scholar. I understand how Larkin was the person of many shapes but when he is introduced in this book, he is such a weak character that his skill isn't appreciated or explained.Glenna the witch, is a witch, even though she does witchy things her patron goddess is Hecatae and Hecatate isn't called on, only Morrigan.Hoyt, the sorcerer the brother to Cian, who is turned into a Vampire which starts this trilogy, starts out as a strong character is quickly overshadowed by his \\"love\\" Glenna.Cian, our vampire that when Hoyt sees him again has lived 1000 years and drinks pigs blood and has accumulated quite a lot of knowledge and wealth. He's sarcastic and he says bored and that is why he joins this circle.Back to the other thing that I held onto, Nola completing the circle. Technically I guess through her progeny Blair, who is the warrior, completes the circle but when Nola throws out her prediction it says she will complete the circle. Blair and Nola are not the same person. For Blair we find out she was the first to be called and the last to be joined. This statement was not explained to my satisfaction.There you have the characters that complete the circle part of the story has the couples pairing off so that love is also part of the circle.Other than the clich&eacute; of love making everything stronger, which when done well I can totally live with, however in this series the love doesn't enhance the characters it's really just another character. The flow of the words didn't flow. I can't tell you how many times my movie was interrupted by poor dialog and I had to rewind to figure out what was really being said. The writer has to remember that as a reader I'm just not going to hold onto the full conversation. When something in the conversation is over, to revfer back to that bit of converstation again during something that is totally different because the character is supposedly being witty and making some point -- as does happen in real life, it doesn't work here. I lose the whole thread and stupidly I go back to try and find out if I missed something important that I will need for the future. Never was it important.There was also the choice of words in some situations that just threw me. In the second book, Blair and Larkin are having pillow talk and Blair calls Larkin's penis \\"Mighty\\". God, that was such a bad word and once again cut into the flow and I had to make sure I understood what she was getting at.For the series overall, the breaking up of the story by the pairing off of the couples was a bad choice. The first book had to set up the entire series and we see Glenna and Hoyt come together. Because of the series set up you also got more interaction of the characters, not as much as I would have liked, but more. Each character has a voice at one point or another, however, the males are so completely overshadowed by the women's voice, that when they do talk they don't add as much value to the story.This book starts off with Hoyt and Cian. Hoyt trying to save his brother's soul and killing the one who turned him and Cian just being a new Vampire. After the failed fight with Lilith Hoyt is given a choice to fight a bigger battle that will not only save the world but will get him the revenge against Lillith. To me this should be Hoyt's story. When Hoyt reaches New York he looses control of his journey. He meets Glenna and she's the one that takes the charge and when they get to Ireland she's the one who comes up with most of the magical solutions. Sorcerer's because of how they work with energy are not as hindered by ritual so should be stronger. After Glenna came on board he lost not only the voice and the lead of this journey, but a lot of what should have been his contribution. Celtic religion and live is very much into balance and there wasn't a good balance for the pairs of this story. Hoyt, you still knew he was strong and intelligent, he just wasn't provided the words and viewpoint that went to the women.Bottom line: if you're a Nora Roberts fan, borrow the books, don't buy them. They are not worth it."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"What an incredibly bad and BORING book. I usually trust Roberts to tell a good story, but this book raised serious doubts for me. These characters are underdeveloped, BORING and I didn't care about any of them at all. \\"End of the world\\" - YAWN. I am not even tempted to buy the rest of the trilogy. And Roberts' habit of big, bloated speeches was bad in the last \\"Red\\" flower books; I'm assuming that no editor's curtailed her because it's just awful here. I just wanted everyone to shut UP with the big, long-winded declarations. And I'm annoyed that the person that, ah, not ends up not being part of the group, is that person. Talk about the final cliche in a book chock full of them."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who are criticizing this novel for being shallow and poorly worded in places. The characters seem like they're taken out of a playbook: one isolated sorceror, one sexy earth mama redhead, one overgrown kid off the streets, etc. The plot and setting are nothing special. Furthermore, Nora Roberts seems to have picked up Stephanie Laurens's bad habit of writing sentences that are missing a subject. And does it often; and it's ineffective.Nora Roberts can write better than this. The most recent trilogy--Red Lily, Black Rose, and Blue Dahlia--was far more vividly imagined. I wonder if she churned out this new trilogy in a month or two, skating through an unwanted homework assignment from her publisher to put out a vampire series now that they're so popular."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesPlease Note: I had the audio version of this book and not the paperback book. Therefore, I am not promising that all of my spellings are correct.Hoyt MacCionaoith is a 12th century sorcerer tasked by the Goddess Morrigan with forming an army to fight the vampire queen Lilith and her legions of undead, of which his twin brother unwillingly became a member. Glenna is a modern day witch who finds Hoyt when he comes forward in time to find the people destined to become part of The Circle.Hoyt and Glenna must prepare for the arrival of the rest of the Circle of Six and help everyone train for the biggest challenge of their lives, a battle to the death against Lilith on Samhain. As they learn to work together, neither Glenna nor Hoyt expected the love that develops between them.While the concept of this vampire/fantasy trilogy appealed to me so much I actually bought the books in audio instead of waiting for it to arrive at the library, I was not overly impressed with Morrigan's Cross. This is a decent start, but is your typical Roberts fare, right down to her formulaic character appearances and personalities. We always find the exact same kinds of heroines and for me I don't even have the challenge of guessing who fits what Nora archetype since it's always glaringly obvious the moment they are introduced.I do like the unique story idea behind The Circle and look forward to seeing where their adventures will take them, even though it's wasn't very hard to figure out who all the couples would be. It is apparent from the first page that Morrigan's Cross is the introduction to a storyline overarching all three books and as such, much time is spent setting up the world and introducing the players. The pacing fluctuates between slow and steady where information is being revealed and high intensity action when the battles rage. For the bulk of the story though, it falls somewhere in the middle, smooth enough to keep me reading but not fast enough to make me want to stay up late listening for what is next to come.Hoyt is a medieval man with medieval beliefs of a woman's place in the world. Glenna is a thoroughly modern city woman who is not one to sit on the sidelines for a big strong man to protect her. As a result, the fireworks between these two are incendiary as they learn to accept each other's strengths. One especially amusing aspect of their relationship is that Hoyt has such a low opinion of witches who need such complicated rituals to get anything done. This opinion of his adds a touch more conflict to their growing relationship as he has to learn that complicated rituals aside, Glenna is every bit as powerful as he is. The fact they are preparing for a war at the same time they are nursing a growing love adds a sense of immediacy and makes their passion more intense.While I enjoyed Dick Hill's performance in Morrigan's Cross, I did struggle a bit with his interpretation. He has a tendency to overdo the female voices, making them sound a little too wimpy. There were also some inconsistencies in the voices he gives to each character. Several times the voices were so similar, I think he forgot whose lines he was reading and as a result, I had a hard time figuring out who was talking. Even so, I enjoyed him enough to want to see how he does in the next two books of The Circle and I caught enough of his intonations that I know I would recognize him immediately in other books I choose to listen to in the future.Kelley A.

My first hint that the writing wouldn't be great was that the entire back cover of the book was a portrait of Ms. Roberts. I opened the front cover to see the list of prior publications, and it covered two entire pages in a tiny font. The story is compelling - but it suffers by lack of attention to the craft of writing. If you aren't bothered by clumsy constructions or overused words and phrases, then you will probably find the story engaging and not even notice these. But if these little details grate on your nerves, then I recommend passing on this trilogy. I won't be reading the other two books in the trilogy."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have already cancelled my order for the second book in this trilogy. I don't know what else to say except the whole book is trash. Nora Roberts has always been one of my favorites, but this book has no direction - nothing to hold your interest. I felt this from the first page of the book and kept thinking it would get better - it didn't. What a shame."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"[The following is a review of the entire trilogy and contains spoilers to plot elements for all three books.]We start this trilogy with \\"Morrigan's Cross\\" and I suppose it must be a coincidence that the titular character is a goddess because she doesn't resemble the Irish mythology I'm familiar with. This particular goddess is the one who sets this whole story in motion by throwing Hoyt, a sorcerer, into a quest to rally five others to stop an impending vampire war. This comes after Hoyt has an unsuccessful battle with Lilith, the vampire who turned his identical twin brother Cian and is the Big Bad setting up the war. Since all he manages to do aside from royally piss her off is brand her with a pentagram scar, I'm left wondering why he was chosen to lead this fight in a so epic that it endangers the very existence of multiple words. Oh, by the way, it's going down in three months. Well, plus a thousand years because you see Hoyt's in the Middle Ages. This makes about as much sense as his being a sorcerer. At least so much in that either point is explained with any detail through three books, which is a recurring issue throughout the trilogy.Anyway, Morrigan ships him off to present day New York City because that's where all the cool vampires hang out what with the ease one can blend in given the eclectic population and the sun. Within moments he runs into his brother who during his century of unlife has shunned the evil vampire ways. He's still harboring some angst at his brother, though since being tossed off a cliff before Hoyt went after Lilith. I guess the fact that he was trying to kill him right back escaped Cian's vast memory. Rather begrudgingly and through absolutely no sense of obligation he agrees to tag along for this fight. They also get themselves two other followers in King, Cian's modern day Renfield in Michael Clarke Duncan's body, and Glenna who's a witch. Again the magic element is strangely just accepted as is King's complete devotion to his undead boss. But at this point we've jumped 1,000 years in time so I don't know why I'm bothered by little things like the complete lack of world building or more accurately the exposition of the non-world building.From here we fly off to Ireland for no specific reason other than it's a nice backdrop for Glenna and Hoyt to fall in love. Eventually, the last three members of the \\"circle\\" find their way, supposedly via Morrigan, to round out the cast and make a nice even number to pair up the love interests. We're introduced to Moira, who is a scholar (read: avid reader), Larkin the shape-shifter and Blair a demon hunter/descendant of Hoyt and Cian's. The majority of the book is then interspersed with the unfolding love story, a tremendous amount of fight training and some random skirmishes with vampires. Also, introduced in this book is the running theme for the rest of the love stories in that the couple fall in love within a matter of weeks and because they can't possibly be together they fight it constantly until about the last chapter or so when they conveniently realize that they can compromise and have a happy ending. In Roberts defense, the three couples are at least not able to be together for different reasons.Dance of the Godscontinues the tale eventually bringing the six characters over to the alternate world of Geall, which seems to be a piece of Ireland stuck in the Middle Ages with some magic thrown in. During this Blair seemingly falls for Larkin and develops an almost bestiality type obsession with his dragon form. Still that's far less creepy than the child molestation going on inValley of Silencebetween Lilith and her six-year-old vampire prince. Thankfully, that's also the conclusion of the story in that they spend 19 chapters preparing for the war, a chapter fighting it, and two wrapping up the love story between Cian and Moira. I only wish I were kidding.What I find the most confounding is how little of the trilogy focuses on the battle itself or even the threat of the enemy. This is only solidified by the fact that through their endless talking about the war the characters remind the reader constantly that it's a plot that's not forgotten but just hanging out in the background. There are a few fights with vampires and they really are sprinkled in with no rhyme or reason, but they are all victories for the good guys and because Glenna's a whiz at her magicks everyone is all stitched up and better before the next wave. Actually, usually several minutes after the fight. The only menace that seems to remind everyone of the horrible war to come is Lilith gives everyone nightmares, though not at the same time. And only because Glenna doesn't think to ward everyone from the nightmares at the same time, but only after the person begrudgingly complains of their freaky dream. More time is spent on training the circle, and eventually citizens of Geall, in vampire combat. Because they only have three months to prepare, they are not only victorious but they all become slaying experts. I say that because the character who ends up beaten almost to her death is the demon slayer who supposedly was born into possessing powers a la Buffy to help her combat vampires.A shaky plot I could handle if the writing weren't so overwrought and inconsistent to the point of being jarring. What's more is that the point of view changes so frequently as to be confusing and annoying. The most baffling thing is the reveal that Cian's the one narrating the story as a whole. A fact that would be fine if he was actually the voice through the entire trilogy. I would even have accepted that each book centered on a specific parring if they were the only heads we visited. But the POV changes constantly amongst all six of the main cast. Sometimes paragraph by paragraph.What really sucks the enjoyment out of these books for me is the complete and total lack of it needing to be a trilogy. This is a fundamental issue I have with Roberts' books because she's essentially telling one overarching plot in her novels by splitting them in three parts. That's all well and good if the focus is to tell three separate romances, but especially in this case that is not how the story is presented. So, while the focus should have been the war and its impending threat, that's the part of the books that feels tacked on. This makes it really hard to justify dragging out for three books and the love stories are so thrown together that they don't give any credence to the length either.The sad thing is I think Roberts has an interesting grasp of the supernatural and if given the time she probably could write a nice epic paranormal romance or true urban fantasy. Having never read a straight romance of hers I can't say how strongly she writes those, but this mesh of the two is definitely not something she does well even though the potential was there in great abundance."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Nora Roberts stuff is usually fun, if nothing else. Her work is of course of the formulaic flavor but at the same time satisfying solid. This was the first fantasy Nora Roberts book that I had come in contact with. I've only read her more realistically modern pieces up until now.I felt as though this book was a fluffy version of The Stand in some ways + romance. A lot of the same themes apply: Armageddon, battle vs good and evil, god or gods appointing a rag-tag resistance to save the world. But in this case it seems that the love story between Hoyt and Glenna got in the way of the bigger battle at foot. There are scenes devoted to what the characters are fighting, how they are going to do it, etc, but in a very general way. I would have liked more exposition on Lilith and her \\"army\\" of evil. It seemed a bit disproportionate. The majority of the novel details the main characters lounging around Cian's Ireland home, reading, eating soup, doing katas?, and above all Glenna and Hoyt's constant love making. Their actual skirmishes with the enemy were brief at best and spottily narrated.I had ALOT of problems with Glenna's character. Her forced toughness fell flat with me as it seemed all she did was write checks with her mouth that her butt couldn't cash. She constantly touts her steely reserve while the first time she encounters Lilith her response is to run naked into Hoyt's bedroom for comforting. Her romantic development with Hoyt was predictable and uninteresting. I did really like Hoyt's character, but that may have been solely due to the fact that I kept imagining Gerard Butler in my head when he spoke, so who knows.Nonetheless, the supporting characters are wholly more intriguing than the central folks, but I suppose that they are more focused on in the sequential novels of the trilogy.I suspect that Cian and Moira will have a romantic entanglement in the sequel, that will be a lot more interesting to see played out in comparison to that of Hoyt and Glenna's."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Step 1...In a small bowl mix oh so gently a tad of sorcery with a dab of shapeshifter...Step 2...Fluff lightly with a glamorous red headed witch...Step 3...

I read the reviews, hoping something will click, but either I'm the only one it affects this way, or nobody else can figure it out either. Or at least those who have, haven't written reviews explaining it. A lot of people put it down to just not liking paranormal. Click around here a little bit--you'll see nothing could be further from the truth.Oh. Note to Publisher's Weekly: this isn't her first paranormal series. Not even close. There are the Donovans, the time travel duo, the 3 Sisters Island books, the Gallaghers, the Key trilogy, all those novellas in the Once Upon A... series, not to mention paranormal elements in the MacKades, Born in Shame, the Dream trilogy, the Night series (mmmm... Nemesis...), Carolina Moon, Midnight Bayou... and others I've forgotten to mention.Anyway. Morrigan's Cross is the first book in a trilogy about a group of six who have to battle the ancient vampire Lilith and her demons, who are out to take over the world. \\"Morrigan\\" comes from the Celt goddess Morrigan, who appears to 12th-century sorceror Hoyt. He's angry and dismayed at his failure to save his twin brother Cian from being turned by Lilith, and she tasks him with putting together the group of 6 to defeat the vampires, first giving him the magical oomph to make the crosses that will protect his family, then whisking him away to the future, our present, New York.There he meets his long-lost brother Cian and his right-hand man King, contemporary witch Glenna, Larkin & Moira from Gealle (another time, another place), and they begin training for the fight ahead.There are some good scenes between the brothers, and Cian in particular is well-drawn. He's now over 900 years old, and it shows in his character. He'd said good-bye to his family centuries ago, and now here's his brother, his twin, offering love and asking for help.There are also some amusing scenes as Hoyt comes to terms with the 21st century--in particular, the driving lessons.But... It starts very slow. It starts back in the 12th century, and I found myself losing interest and skimming, waiting for the story to start. And Hoyt and Glenna as a couple seems more of a given than a romance. We're asked to just accept that because they've seen each other in dreams and they have similar magical powers, that they've fallen in love--we don't see it happen. Or I didn't.And, as usual, the spells drove me nuts. Glenna's were the rhyming type where the rhythm doesn't always work--it drives me nuts. But Hoyt's were worse. They didn't rhyme, but they were long, and seemed like they ought to rhyme. I really, really wished that he'd just used single words or brief chants instead. The point was made, several times, that Hoyt's approach to magic was different from Glenna's, but the only difference in their spells were that hers rhymed and his didn't. Nails on the chalkboard, every time.If you accept that Hoyt and Glenna are in love (and you pretty much have to, otherwise, you just spend the last half of the book complaining), their road to Happy-Ever-After-Land was good--they had some serious complications to overcome: they're in the middle of saving the world, and Hoyt's fully expecting to be whisked back to the 12th century afterward.Other than Cian (and King), the secondary characters were fairly bland and uninteresting, and to tell you the truth, if it were any other author besides Nora, I'd be reconsidering reading the rest of the trilogy. A latecomer to the book, demon hunter Blair, showed promise, but Moira seemed mousy and ineffectual, and Larkin, the shapechanger, seemed mostly talented at blending into walls (not literally--I'm apparently still thinking about Nemesis). It's been explained to me that secondary characters, even ones who are supposed to star in their own future books, have to take a back seat, but, well, I disagree. Not if it makes me not want to read the next book. It's also been explained that they perk up in the next book, Dance of the Gods. I certainly hope so."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have never before read a novel by Nora Roberts. I am 19 years old and my mother is a fan of her work. It never interested me to read the same books as my mom. However, since one of my roomates here at college talked me into it, I gave them a try. As a follow up to the Twilight Saga which was the last series I read, I was glad to be reading another book with vampires in it. But it went above and beyond vampires, incorporating witches, sorcerers, dragons, shape-shifters, a goddess, and time-travel. All these fantasy traits I loved, but it was the characters that made this trilogy such a success. I was hooked from the first book and read all three straight through. I only wish there was more! This trilogy did not leave me disappointed and has made me interested to see what else Nora Roberts may have to offer."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This one, and the other two in this trilogy pleasantly surprised me. I had no idea Nora Roberts wrote fantasy or paranormal romance. I'm an avid reader in this genre, and not into straight romance, so I've never picked up any of her books before. These caught my eye, and I'm glad they did. Very nice!"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'll start out by saying, I am not a fan of Vampire Romance. I do love and read romance, but this particular flavor of the genre is definitely not my cup of tea.I've read Vampire horror fiction by some of the best - 'They Thirst' by Robert R. McCammon; 'Salem's Lot' by Stephen King; 'The Vampire Lestat' by Anne Rice - and was entertained as well as scared witless.When the Vampire Romance craze began sweeping the publishing industry, I tried on a few for size and didn't care for them. It has now snow-balled to include werewolves, ghosts, demons, and all manner of creatures that \\"go bump in the night\\". We now have romantic monsters, smart-aleck monsters, erotic monsters and even kinky monsters. Frankly, I don't \\"get it\\" as there is nothing even remotely romantic about any of them. But that's just my opinion.However...When I saw that Nora Roberts was having a crack at it, I decided, \\"Why not?\\" I have yet to read one of her suspense novels that I didn't thoroughly enjoy and I have liked a few of her trilogies. So, I decided to read her Circle Trilogy. I should probably note here, this series is actually a blend of Vampire/Monster romance with Fantasy.The first novel is Hoyt and Glenna's story. While it begins in 12th century Ireland, it takes place predominately in modern day. For the most part, this book sets the stage. We are introduced to the main characters, the mission, and the goal. Hoyt is a sorcerer and Glenna is a white-witch. Roughly the first third of the book is fairly bland, but stick with it. The pace starts to pick up as you get deeper into the story.The second book is Larkin and Blair's story. Here we get to know the world of Geall where the final battle will take place. This is a magical place where dragons are as common as birds. Larkin is a shape-shifter and Blair a demon-hunter. While Blair's profile might remind some of \\"Buffy\\", the resemblance is remote. Nora definitely made this character into her own. The pace of this book is fairly even and fast. I never found myself struggling to get through it. This was my favorite book of the three.The third and last book is Cian and Moira's story. I was impressed with Cian. Nora actually made me care about a vampire, I didn't think it was possible. He is truly a tortured hero. The final battle in this book, while predictable, was still intense and rapidly paced. I found myself reading it so fast, I had to go back to pick up things I missed. There are some deranged, disturbing, twisted moments in this book. I almost stopped reading it a couple times. The only thing that kept me glued to it was my investment in Cian. This was my least favorite of the three books.Overall, I have to say I enjoyed the series, which surprised me. Her main characters are vividly detailed, the worlds she shows us are rich and vibrant. As you read the series, you can \\"see\\" it all in brilliant technicolor. You can \\"smell\\" the grass, the flowers, the sweat, the sulfur. You \\"hear\\" the birds and the clanging of the swords. You \\"feel\\" everything the characters are feeling. But then again, this is Nora. Overall, I'd give the series 3 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I was really putting off picking up this series and only started to read it because I got it practically free. In the past few years, I have been underwhelmed by NR's work, but this first book of the Circle trilogy really engaged me and pulled me into the story and the characters' lives.It begins in the 12th Century with Hoyt the Sorcerer (Irish last name is waaaay too long to remember but I know it's pronounced mac-KEE-nee and is the old form of MacKenna). His twin brother Cian has been transformed by the vampire queen Lilith into one of her minions, and Hoyt calls her to find his vengeance. Things go off course, though, when his fresh-from-the-grave brother attacks him. Hoyt sends him off the side of a cliff, scars the vampire queen and heads for home to recuperate. On the way, he's visited by Morrigan, a goddess, and is given his task: he must gather the circle of six and defeat Lilith by Samhain (Halloween) or all worlds would be destroyed. So he seeks a witch, a warrior, a scholar, one of many shapes, and one who is lost.The story is moved then as Hoyt is pulled into modern-day NYC and his millenia-old brother's club, Eternity. Cian, still a vampire but now bitter and hard with it, reluctantly puts his brother up. It is here that they find Gwenna, a 21st century witch and the three of them, along with Cian's friend King, head for Ireland. Soon enough two more join them, and they believe the circle is complete as Moira, queen of Geall, is a scholar, and Larkin (her cousin) is a shape-shifter.I was a little leary of how NR would pull off a vampire story, as I am a loyal fan of JR Ward and Sherrilyn Kenyon, but this was shockingly good. Though, like stated above, the romance isn't the key to this plot, the action and backstory are compelling and very well put together.Hoyt and Gwenna, as a couple, are very compatible, but it felt a little rushed and at the end I was frustrated along with Cian that, oh hey, the world's about to end, but let's take some time to plan a wedding. If they had wanted to to a handfasting ceremony, well okay do it, you don't have to spend precious time online shopping and throwing a ceremony. Also the character of Gwenna felt as if she wasn't completely fleshed out. At first it seemed as if she tried to come across very experienced and forward, but by the time she and Hoyt were intimate, she sounded a little more sentimental about the whole deal, and it was confusing to me. Hoyt was a good character and obviously the star of this show, but it seemed to me, sorcerer or no, that he adjusted mighty quickly to the 21st century.All in all, if you're a loyal Nora fan, this might be worth a look, but don't go in expecting romance, when it's paranormal with strong romantic elements."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I can't wait to read the rest of this series.

First let me preface this brief review by saying I never can buy/borrow the first book in a NR trilogy. I waited till all 3 books were at my local library and borrowed them since I know how masterful NR can spin a tale.The introduction is a elderly man telling a chilling story to wide eyed kids. NR is incomparable in setting a stage and her descriptions in the prologue are wonderful.The barest summary I can give is this- the queen of the vampyres is wanting to destroy the world as we know it. Many centuries ago, (12 century Ireland to be exact) she turned a carefee young man into her kind. His serious and magely twin brother vowed revenge and in doing so encounters Morrigan (battle goddess?) who says there is a chosen circle of six to defeat the Queen of the Vampyres (Lilith by the way)This book begins to step for he circle to be formed. It is an excellent foundation, and promised a great story to tell.Enter Glenna , headstrong sassy witch who in true NR fashion is paired up with Hoyt (aforementioned serious mage, out to save the world and avenge his brother). Did I mention Glenna is in 21st century NYC? As is carefree twin turned vampyre Cian?Very interesting (IMO) storyline throughout, Hoyt and Glenna's romance is believable, and Glenna is the most likeable among the three heroines. The relationship between Cian and the mousy Moira had me anticipating their story (alas, I massively dissapointed)All in all, I think this was a well written book."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book is the first in a trilogy that I am eagerly anticipating.

A lot of negative stuff has been said as far as the author, that she's recycling the characters. But she sticks with what works. A good base to build on.

Ms. Roberts has dabbled in the paranormal before with great success. And while I loved Buffy, the vampire theme seemed too much for Ms. Roberts.I was wrong.No matter how \\"out there\\" the storyline may seem, this is Ms. Roberts' story and it is great. The characters are written so real, you come to care about them even when you don't necessarily like or trust them. Ms. Roberts' gift for description is showcased yet again, with the reader able to experience each of the chosen circle's reaction as they discover their new purpose. This is a book about destiny. And the funny thing with destiny is that it isn't always as comforting as one would imagine.I read \\"Morrigan's Cross\\" in two days and thoroughly enjoyed the story. I am so glad i don't have to wait long for the second novel in the series.Doubters, give this story a chance. You may be surprised. And if you aren't, at least you didn't shell out the money for a hardback book. :-)"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Morrigan's Cross was the worst book I've read by Nora Roberts, and having really enjoyed both the 'Born In' trilogy and the 'Gallaghers' trilogy, I expected more. Much more. The plot was rushed and totally unoriginal (think Buffy meets Diana Gabaldon); the dialogue was conventional and cliched; the female protagonist was barely likeable; and the love scenes were forced, incredibly brief, and not at all imaginative. I'm convinced that an aspiring and dreadfully untalented apprentice of Ms. Roberts wrote this book and published it in her name."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have read pretty much everything Nora Roberts has written, some of it several times over, and I have not been disappointed, until now. I was not even able to get through the book. It is so unlike her previous Trilogies that I'm questioning whether she is the sole author or if she co-wrote it with someone. I was told that it is much more like her J.D. Robb series than her normal Nora Roberts writing. I was so looking forward to a new Trilogy and now, I am very disappointed. Sorry Nora, but this one, in my opinion, is a looser."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book was so dismal and dark, it doesnt even matter that Nora Roberts wrote it. I read only 75 pages, skimmed the rest and left it on the plane.

Waiting for \\"Born in Death\\"."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I was very hesitant to read this, so I got it from the library. I refuse to read vampire stories, especially if it supposed to be romantic vampires - isn't that an oxymoron? Then throw in all the other fantasy characters and wouldn't it just be over the top? But it's Nora Roberts and I will read anything she writes. So I tried it, thinking I would surely quit partly through it and return it. Boy was I surprised! The story grabbed me immediately and the pace was fast and action-packed. The reader is drawn to Hoyt right off and Cian, even though he is unhuman and a demon, is interesting and one can care about him. Though the scenes where he drank blood from a glass just gave me the creeps.It doesn't rate 5 stars because the romance/relationship between Hoyt and Glenna is rushed and seems superficial. Glenna's character development and their relationship were not thorough or deep enough to \\"feel\\" their growing love for each other. I suppose it is because there is so much going on and the other characters are being developed also that there just wasn't enough room in the book to devote to Hoyt/Glenna well. On the other hand, because the other characters were being developed in book 1, I am guessing, hoping, their romances will be much more believable and satisfying in books 2 and 3.Another reason it doesn't rate 5 stars, and this is nitpicking, is Roberts' recent habit of having her characters speak in incomplete sentences. i.e. \\"Good to know.\\" \\"You two paired up?\\"\\"You doing a veil, a headpiece?\\" etc. Granted, the character most guilty of this is Blair, instead of all the characters. But, the characters in Angels Fall spent the whole book in incomplete sentences (did anyone else find this annoying?) and it was very distracting to me and it got to the point of no longer being witty, but more like a gimmick. So, I was looking for that here. So, I am to assume, since Blair is so modern that that is how modern people speak?That said, I am very much looking forward to reading books 2 and 3. I'm still not a vampire book reader, but Nora Roberts carried it off well. I am anxious to see how NR brings sweet Moira and undead/unalive Cian together. I still have my doubts there."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I am delighted by Nora Roberts's foray into the fantasy/vampire subgenre. She has crafted a wonderful world of witches, wizards, warriors, and magic borrowing deeply from Irish mythology, classic vampire tales, and her own fertile imagination. Yet she doesn't abandon her romance roots in the process. Although the book is first and foremost fantasy, the romance between Glenna and Hoyt remained central to the storyline throughout.This is a great book, so why only four stars?Well, the action is fast-paced, but I never really felt gripped by tension or excitement as I was reading the various battle scenes. The plot of this book is fairly predictable (the cover tells us the chosen six will come together and they do) but forgivable as this is a set up book for the rest of the trilogy. And there were a few times when characters acted differently than they probably should have for the sake of moving the plot. But that's about it for the criticisms.I really have no trouble recommending this to anyone who enjoys fantasy romances. While I can't judge an entire trilogy by the first book, it looks like this one is going to be a good one. I love the plot, I love the characters, and of course I love the author. I'm looking forward to the next two."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"While reading some of the reviews of this book (which is Book 1 of an exceptional trilogy) it became apparent to me that many of its detractors had no clue what a good Paranormal Romance (PNR) should be, this is not your typical Nora Roberts novel, it is a piece of an epic story that is probably one of the best (if not THE best) things she has ever written. While Book 1 may be a bit slower it is because in any PNR you have to take time to do \\"world building\\" and set the stage for things that are going to be out of the ordinary. She accomplishes this admirably I thought and this trilogy is still one of my personal \\"Top 5\\" of all time. I highly recommend buying the whole trilogy and reading it before making any reckless claims as some of the other reviewers did without really knowing what they were looking at, this is excellent epic romance and action. 5 Stars easy ..."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"For those of us who listen to the Audio version, all three books in this Trilogy are read by the same narrator, which makes for good continuity. That said, I find fault with deep-voiced men who try to 'lighten up' to do the women's voices; it's very annoying. It makes the women seem shallow and childish. But Dick Hill did a great job with the general narrating and the men's voices, and overall I found the story to be engaging. An earlier reviewer stated that the major battle isn't until the third installment, but isn't that what we expect with a trilogy?I do recommend this series to fans of Nora Roberts and those who enjoy the paranormal."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm not entirely certain what to say about this book. Others have apparently had some of the same issues I had with it - the characters didn't grow on me, it seemed slow and round about in moving anywhere, the way the various forms of fantasy were stitched together just didn't quite work.I don't mind the liberties she took with Cian - honestly, I'm a bit tired of the traditional take on them. I see no reason why all vampires must be mired in the era of their own creation, why they must all wear frills and appreciate only classical or ancient music, and all be soooo terribly sexy and erotic that men and women alike want to jump their bones despite the vampires being cold and rubbery to the touch (excpet, of course, an erotic vampire wouldn't feel rubbery, eh?).In as much as the story didn't grip me, and the romance and relationships didn't spark much interest in me, I'd have to say that my biggest problem with this book (and probably the only lasting memory I'll keep with me about it) is the fact that she included a token minority character, and treated him like the unnamed ensign in Star Trek.If you've read more than 5 books by Nora Roberts, or 2 of her trilogies, you'll discover that there's a very heavy pattern. For every \\"interesting\\" and fleshed out male, there is an equally \\"interesting\\" and fleshed out female. In this book, throughout most of the tale, we have 4 males and 2 females. None of the men are remotely homosexual, and gays and lesbians don't exist in any of the universes I've read by her. So which of these characters breaks the pattern - or, as they sang in Sesame Street, \\"One of these things is not like the others, one of these things doesn't belong.\\" Since most of NR's characters are either of Irish or Gypsy descent, it's a safe bet that the lovable black guy isn't going to remain an important character throughout the series.I've read authors who, while being caucasian, are able to include minorities in their stories. Minorities who provide a believable addition to a tale, without needing to take center stage to make the author seem so very hip and culturally aware. Minorities... who aren't killed off in a very patronizing, insulting manner. (Hair doesn't move the way it is described in the pivotal moment - either someone was WAY too close to the threshold and deserved King's fate, or longer hair had a fan under it to get it to fly that far)King, and the readers of this book, should have been treated with more respect. My respect for Nora Roberts has taken a steep nosedive through this single tale, purely for the treatment of a single character.I appreciate what she may have been trying to do - meld modern fantasy (modern \\"witchcraft\\" and the angsty vampire/slayer), old fashioned sorcery, and romantic generic magic fantasy. But gathering so many different backgrounds meant the book was devoted to introducing all of the characters.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. At least not as a stand alone, because this seemed more long a very long winded prologue than anything else. Again, her treatment of King was horrible. His fate did nothing to draw me closer to any of the characters, but instead made me cheer for the bad guys.On a slightly different note, the use of the name Lilith as the antagonist's name annoyed me as well. Delilah would have been equally cliched in some ways, but at least less abused."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have read many of Nora Robert's books. This book one is great. I love that she has taken and brought characters from present time and from the past and put them together to defeat Lilith. It is a typical book of hers by bringing in the battle for love and for each other. The characters she has created are wonderful and come to life as you read this book. Each are so different, yet she created them in a way that each compliment each other and made a great read!I read this book within 2 days and I am on the edge of my seat waiting until October 3rd when the 2nd book in this series becomes available. If you like her other books, you will enjoy this one. If you liked the Key Trilogy or the Three Sisters Island trilogy, this book is right down your alley."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Any new book from popular novelist Nora Roberts causes a buzz but her first in a fantasy trilogy has really had readers turning pages. Now, in audio form as read by the incredible Dick Hill, dubbed a Golden Voice by AudioFile, listeners will be intrigued, engrossed and entertained.Vampiress Lilith is evil with a capitol E. She has spent centuries seducing men with her kiss, turning them into soldiers in her dark army. She even lured Cian, twin brother of sorcerer Hoyt Mac Cionaoith. It is Ireland in the 12th century and Hoyt rues the day Lilith ever laid her beautiful but devilish eyes on Cian. Hoyt has tried to do battle with Lilith but has found himself almost helpless against her.However, hope appears in the form of the goddess Morrigan who gives him power. She instructs him to form a circle, selecting five others who will then fight Lilith and her army on Samhain in the land of Geall. Hoyt is told that he must do this in order to save not only his brother but also the entire known world.In order to accomplish this Hoyt is projected through time to the future where he meets Glenna Ward, a very modern witch, who not only falls in love with Hoyt but has some ideas of her own as to how Lilith should be brought to her knees.Morrigan's Cross is a fantasy enhanced by the Roberts touch - enjoy!- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Nora Roberts is a great writer, but this book was terrible. I lost interest after the first few chapters. The story line seemed tired - the chosen few fighting a legion of vampires - and there was little character development. I won't be buying the next two installments."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I love reading fantasy and Ms. Roberts has shown in other books that she knows how to do it!! Sure some things are \\"borrowed\\" from other types of magical and paranormal fantasies, but what fantasy doesn't contain elements of others? For me, it is the way she combines these different elements of Ireland, sorcery and magic, vampires and other fantasy elements along with romance, action and adventure into one exciting and couldn't put down until I finished story!!We begin as an old man begins to tell a tale by a fire to a roomfull of children who are hooked on his every word. The tale begins in 12th century Eire with a sorcerer battling a female vampire, Lilith, who has turned his twin brother to the dark. Hoyt, the sorcerer, barely escapes with his life and is wounded. The goddess Morrigan visits him and tells him he is to lead a circle of six to another time and place as Lilith is going to be too strong and try to take over all humankind. She gives him protections for his family and he travels to his family's home.He stops on the way near a magical well where he is visited (?) by a red-haired witch who begins to heal him even as dangerous wolves are forced back by his magical circle of protection. After saying goodbye to his family and giving them their protection and instructing them, he goes to a place with magical stones called Dance of the Gods and is transported to present-day New York and to his brother's apartment.From this point Hoyt has his work really cut out for him to convince his brother to join the fight against Lilith, to gather the six, to protect the six, to travel to Ireland and to begin to strategize how to defeat not just one vampire queen but the vampire queen and her army of thousands.There is so much in this story including other worlds, romance between Hoyt and his witch and some other possible matchups as well plus the exciting battles and sneaky plots of Lilith the vampire.I enjoyed this very much and anxiously await the next installment!!"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm not sure what type of book this is - fantasy? vampire? surreal?, but it's definitely one of the worst Roberts' books ever written. Normally her trilogies are romantic and the thread is easy to identify with and follow. But this story asks a lot of the reader - you need to keep track of weird character names and the convoluted and extremely unrealistic plot. I didn't find this book or the characters interesting at all and thought it was very poorly written and planned. When I finished the book I looked at the front pages that list the other Roberts' triologies, and I found myself longing for something more like the Dream In., Chesapeake.., and Born In.. series. My recommendation is to skip this book and trilogy completely."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm a Nora Roberts fan and have read all of her books.

If I could give it zero stars, I would."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I really wasn't sure I would like this as Roberts has been getting progressively weirder and this seemed very weird, but her characters came through again. She does an excellent job with really making the reader get invested in the characters!The world is coming to an end in 3 months if a small band of fighters can't beat the vampires. The group includes a 12th century sorcerer, a modern day witch, a demon-hunter, a queen from a different world (Geall) and her shape-shifting cousin. They even have one vampire on their side - the 12th century sorcerer's twin brother who was turned into a vampire by the vampire queen, Lilith. This book is the first in a trilogy and focuses on these six coming together as a unit. Then of course, we have to have two of the group fall in love. You can tell who will be next as well:) But that's part of Roberts' charm.Anyway, definitely another winner of a series from Roberts.

If you like vampires and witches this is a series you want to read."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I was recently headed on a long road trip and decided to pick up a book on CD to help with the tedium of driving. CD books can be hit or miss. I enjoy Nora Roberts, so I knew the material would be good, but this was a paranormal book, and so I was a bit wary.Within the first two minutes, I was hooked. Not just on the story, but by the voice coming through the speakers. The reader, Dick Hill, completely transported me into the past with his voice and mannerisms. Ms. Roberts took me there with her stellar characters.This is the first book of a triology that should not be missed, either in written form or by audiobook. (I strongly suggest the audio) Once my trip was complete, I rushed out to purchase the audiobooks of the remaining two, and could not have been happier.There is nothing negative to say about the books or Mr. Hill's performance. Stellar all the way!"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"While I am not a Nora Roberts fan, nor a romance fan, I was intrigued by the plot line outlined for this trilogy, so I bought it. So far, after reading the first book, I am not disappointed that I did so. Sure, there are a few points that are bothersome: for instance, Hoyt - a sorcerer from 12th century Ireland - is brought through time to present-day New York City and somehow has absolutely NO communication problems. Same with Moira and Larkin, who are brought from another dimension. The \\"circle\\" is brought together too easily, overall - I can see where the author probably wanted to get on to the meat of the plot and not be bothered with any problems with bringing the characters together, but working out a more complicated series of events to bring the characters together would not only have been more realistic, but also would have made the rapid \\"bonding\\" of the characters more realistic. Finally, Morrigan - who is the Celtic Goddess of War, Death and Childbirth - is in this book depicted as the goddess of war and queen of faeries.However, despite all that, I did find myself enjoying the story. Although the characters are a bit flat, I could tell as the story progressed that they were rounding out and I hold out hope that in the remaining books they will develop more fully. The plot idea, as I said, is quite intriguing and I am quite enjoying the idea of an elite circle of six people - the witch, the sorcerer, the scholar, the warrior, the one of many shapes and the one who was lost - being brought together to try to save all the worlds from Lilith, an ancient vampire queen, who has been building her vampire army in secret for centuries and now is planning to make a bid to take over all the worlds. Although occasionally getting carried away with it, Nora Roberts has a fine gift for detailed descriptions that helps to create a vivid picture in the mind of what she is describing - the opening scene with Hoyt standing on a cliff with a thunder-storm pounding around him is just amazing, for instance.So, I would recommend this book definitely for people who enjoy Nora Roberts and paranormal romances. For those who are fans of vampire novels with a romantic setting ... well, most of the vampires in this book are portrayed as pretty evil, so you may not like it too much. Anyone looking for accurate portrayals of Celtic/Druidic teachings or witchcraft or magical powers ... well, again, the Morrigan is portrayed as queen of the faeries and if you know anything about Her, you will understand why that is just SO very wrong. But, overall, I would recommend this book to those who enjoy books of this ilk, and I am enjoying it myself."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is a good first book in the trilogy, but I hate to break the news but book 2 isn't as good.

Most of her books become rote in the romance department.This series, however, is captivating in that it's different. It keeps you riveted to the characters and the eventual outcome. It's a real page turner. Nora Roberts writing in \\"The Circle Trilogy\\" is excellent. If you're up to a little diversity in your literary characters, I recommend this series.I also really liked the \\"Three Sisters Trilogy\\" which has some of the same magical element in it.I think Nora knows alittle bit too much of the magic side of life to be a mere bystander in the art."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is a paranormal fantasy - not a standard romance story. Morrigan's Cross is the first of a trilogy and has to set up the background for the whole series. This book started a little slow and I struggled to get into it, but once the main characters are introduced, it starts to move along. Hoyt and Glenna are the hero and heroine and while they are likable enough, they don't really sizzle. Each of the 6 main characters will be featured in one of the books. This is a decent read and I will continue with the next two in the trilogy: Dance with the Gods and Valley of Silence."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I just read this series while away on a vacation. Although Morrigan's Cross is a bit slow as it builds the first set of characters, once the main characters are built the book and the whole series are terrific and very hard to put down.As usual Nora Robert brings a fantasy situation and makes it real through building the characters and the vivid descriptions of the scene and character emotions.I think it takes longer to set the stage than some of the other Nora Robert's series because of the complexity of the foundation. However understanding the characters and their reasons for becoming part of the circle is what makes the book (and the other two) so appealing. So defintely work through the first few chapters for they payout of a good fantasy story."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is a surprising and delightful switch from the suspense novels I've come to know from Nora Roberts. This first in a trilogy of fantasy-based drama unfolded oddly at first, but reliquished its humor and suspense early enough to keep it an interesting read. Listening to the tale with an Irish braugh seeping through the audio speakers entranced me to follow through as Warlock Hoyt struggles with love, family (lost & found), and his challenge to find the others that will become part of his circle destined to fight in the good vs. evil that is elementary for fantasy novels.I enjoyed this book and quickly loaded 'Dance of the Gods' as soon as it was done, hooked and anxious to discover more of the war to come and of those who would risk all to fight in it."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Nora Roberts's books are my escape, and usually a blissful one. I love the magic, character development, strong women overcoming obstacles, and romance found in her novels. Morrigan's Cross disappointed me. Vampires are a little over the edge for me, but what made me close the book was the 10-year-old vampire with the protaganist. I spend my days with children who have been abused in every way imaginable, and reading this put me in a bad mood. King was a comic relief, but he got killed. That was when I did something I've never done with a N.R. book - closed it, put it in the closet, and later sold it. I'm not reading any of the others in the trilogy. Instead, I took out the Three Sisters' trilogy and enjoyed myself."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I love Nora Roberts, I love paranormals and I love romances. I do not love this book. It's like NR reached in a grab-bag of paranormal creatures for her characters - or charicatures, really. One vampire, one sorcerer, one Wiccan witch, one demon-hunter, one shapeshifter, and one \\"King Arthur\\" like queen. Rinse, stir, repeat. None of the characters engaged my imagination and the story and romance was rushed. NR then mixes up Christianity with Celtic religion for a mash-up of neither. I never thought I'd read a Nora Roberts that I didn't love, let alone one I actively dislike, but this is it. I don't know if it's because it's her entry into more mainstream fantasy, but the book ends up trying for so much but succeding in nothing. Save your money and buy one of her other books or other paranormal or paranormal romance authors (Lilith Saintcrow, Kim Harrison, Charlaine Harris, Carrie Vaughn, Laurell K.

I love the ones that she writes with a touch of magick in them, and this time she delivers in a big way -- witches, vampires, shift-shaper, time travelers, and of course, romance.This is the first of a triology centering around Hoyt, a wizard, and his vampire brother Cian. They are brought together by Morrigan, the pagan goddess of war. She gives them a mission -- save the world from Lilith, a 2,000 year old vampire who just happens to be Cian's sire. She tells Hoyt that he must gather four more to complete the circle of heroes who will travel to Geall, another world where they will do battle with Lilith and her army of vampires. They have a very short time to train and prepare for this war which will take place on Samhain, the pagan name for the present day Halloween.Hoyt meets his true love, Glenna, in modern day New York City. She is a witch with tremendous power. Together they prove to be an indomitable foe of the vamps.Usually Roberts centers her stories around the romance, but this time, it is more about the situation that they are in. The first book is mostly about how the group comes together and how they prepare for the mission given them. I grew a little bored when they were training and such, and that is the only reason I gave this book a four instead of five stars. I would have liked a little more character development for each of them. I didn't seem to connect with Hoyt as much as I usually do with the heroes of a Roberts book.I really liked the description of Glenna's spells, and her belief system. She prefers the safety of a circle when casting her spells, and Roberts does a good job of describing her magick and the dangers of mis-using your powers. Being Wiccan and a practicing witch, I am appreciative of how Roberts is careful of how she presents the craft and the old religion.My daughter is reading the second one, and tells me that it is really good, too. Hey, how can you go wrong with a book by Nora Roberts?"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I've read nearly every Nora Roberts book out there - several more than once. Is it just me, or is her writing going down hill in a hurry? What happened to the smart, witty, creative writing with likeable characters and interesting storylines?"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I found Morrigan's Cross to be a refreshing change of pace. As an addicted and avid reader of Nora Robert's romance books, at times I find her predicatable romance formulas a bit tiresome. But Morrigan's Cross had me excited and interested throughout. Morrigan's Cross is one of Mrs. Roberts better examples of her talent for good character development. And the motley assemblage of characters are interesting and diverse, and make for some good conflicts and resolutions. Furthermore, something unique to this book that I have never encountered in any of Mrs. Roberts romance books is-- eek-- a character actaully dies. Ah! finally a book that isn't totally predictable! Furthermore, for a change the love scenes in Morrigan's Cross are not explicit as they have been in many of her prior books (ie- you wouldn't be embarrassed if your 10 year old found you reading this book.) One thing that hasn't changed in this book, however, is Mrs. Robert's uncanny ability to paint such vivid pictures with words that she virtually picks you up and plunks you down physically in on location herself.I read a complaint above that this book leaves you hanging. That is certainly true, but in my case, I'm not complaining. I'm excited because there's more good reading on the way- I'm anxiously awaiting the release of Dance of the Gods!"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Nora Roberts (aka J.D. Robb), as you probably know, is a prolific award-winning (and best-selling) author of romance novels. Not being a romance novel reader, I had never before read any of her work. But, when I found that I could read her fantasy trilogy (The Circle) on audiobook, I decided to give it a try.First, let me say that authors don't get to be award-winning best-sellers for writing poorly, so I'm perfectly willing to believe that Nora Roberts is an excellent romance writer and, if I ever decide to read a romance novel, I won't hesitate to pick up one of her books.However, I couldn't help but get the impression from Morrigan's Cross, the first book in her Circle trilogy, that Nora Roberts is a romance writer trying to attract fantasy readers. And perhaps she couldn't decide which type of fantasy readers she wanted to attract because she threw a bunch of random fantasy clich&eacute;s from several sub-genres of fantasy literature into the pot and stirred. And this is what came out:* Hoyt: The medieval sorcerer who time-travels to the 21st century* Morrigan: The Goddess who commissions Hoyt and the others to fight the vampires, but doesn't help much* Cian: Hoyt's brother -- a centuries-old vampire who listens to Nine Inch Nails while flying his private airplane* Lilith: An ancient vampire queen who's got black hair, red lips, and wants to rule the world* Glenna: A red-headed NYC Wiccan witch in a little black dress* Blair: A kick-butt female vampire hunter who can fell three vampires while changing her tire and says almost nothing that's not sarcastic* Moira: A princess from Gael who must save her people and her land from evil* Larkin: A handsome shape-changer who might have been interesting in another novelWith a cast like that, it sounds like there would be, at least, plenty of action... Not so. Vampires occasionally and suddenly appear out of nowhere, scrap a bit, and retreat. But most of the plot of Morrigan's Cross is focused on the relationship between Hoyt and Glenna who suddenly decide that, after knowing each other for about two weeks, they \\"complete\\" each other and must be married. They spend most of their time making the lights surge while they're in bed, and arguing (a lot) about how Hoyt wants Glenna to stay safe in the house. Occasionally they work on trying to figure out how to fight vampires.There was some other disappointing plot elements. For example, Hoyt has traveled from the 12th century to the 21st and keeps brooding about what's going to happen to him and his family and if he'll succeed in his task to vanquish the vampires. Cian (his brother) tells him that he (Hoyt) becomes a legend in their family history. Basically Hoyt says \\"oh\\" and doesn't think to ask what he's so legendary for. Might there not be a clue there??Most disappointing, though, is the arbitrary nature of the magic. It's as if Ms Roberts doesn't realize that fantasy readers demand a consistent, well-planned system of magic. Hoyt and Jenna show us a few remarkable displays of power (rose petals appear out of nowhere while they're in bed), but then seem to forget who they are at other times. At one point, they have to melt down Hoyt's mother's favorite candle-sticks (now centuries old) to get the silver they need to fashion crosses (I won't even get into the weird religious inconsistencies). Yet Glenna finds a wedding dress at NeimanMarcus.com and says a little charm (\\"As I will, so mote it be\\") which puts the dress directly on her body. When Blair asks (at the end of the novel) if that method might work to acquire the weapons they've been wondering how to get, Glenna says \\"I suppose it would.\\" Aaarrrrggghhhh!Perhaps the strangest thing is that the whole story has a narrator who's telling the tale (filled with explicit sex and blood-drinking vampires) to a bunch of young children sitting around the fire on a rainy day. Weird.I won't be reading the other two books in The Circle Trilogy. And I think Ms Roberts should stick to the romance genre. She's very popular over there. --FanLit.net"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Hey has anyone noticed what they are charging now for a cheap paperback?!

But there is lots and lots of blood and gore pouring out of nearly every page. The plot has a bunch of people training to fight vampyres--cutesy spelling is hers--and barely repelling them. They announce they must train better and get stronger, and more vampyres come and are repelled. They train some more, and more vampyres do battle, with ever more blood gushing. Then the book just stops. The dark side of the author usually enhances her books, but this time it disgusts and bores. I am in mourning--not for the mob of the slain, but for the fun and excitement we have come to expect."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"\\"Morrigan's Cross\\" is supposedly Nora Roberts' first paranormal trilogy, and I can honestly say I wasn't disappointed. Though I won't summarize the book for you, I will say the overall plot and theme of \\"Morrigan's Cross\\" was somewhat incredulous and over-the-top, but it is still action-packed and provides an entertaining read. The romance between the two protagonists, Hoyt and Glenna, was written at a very nice pace, and I found the rest of the characters to be quite warm, funny, and engaging. Larkin especially won my affections, as did his cousin, the meek and \\"mousy\\" Moira, and Cian has just the right amount of mystery to be the dark and moody vampire. The chemistry between Cian the Vampire and Moira the Scholar, combined with the likability of the rest of the characters, will definitely have me looking forward to their next adventures in the trilogy's upcoming two books.However, there was one character I couldn't connect with, and ironically enough, it was with the lead female, Glenna. Compared to the rest of the characters, I thought she seemed too perfect and pretentious, free from vices and overly superior in all her skills. I like the lead female character with the crooked teeth, the lopsided grin, a neurotic personality, little idiosyncracies that make her human...I can't relate to a character that is too pious and perfect.Overall, I give the book 4 out of 5 stars. Definitely worth the money if you're a Nora Roberts fan."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Just not my cup of tea. Well written but as I said not my cup of tea..I will not purchase the others in the series."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I usually buy the newest Nora Robert's book the day it is released, but I hesitated this time around because the premise of \\"Morrigan's Cross\\" seemed too much. Ms. Roberts has dabbled in the paranormal before with great success. And while I loved Buffy, the vampire theme seemed too much for Ms. Roberts.I was wrong.No matter how \\"out there\\" the storyline may seem, this is Ms. Roberts' story and it is great. The characters are written so real, you come to care about them even when you don't necessarily like or trust them. Ms. Roberts' gift for description is showcased yet again, with the reader able to experience each of the chosen circle's reaction as they discover their new purpose. This is a book about destiny. And the funny thing with destiny is that it isn't always as comforting as one would imagine.I read \\"Morrigan's Cross\\" in two days and thoroughly enjoyed the story. I am so glad i don't have to wait long for the second novel in the series.Doubters, give this story a chance. You may be surprised. And if you aren't, at least you didn't shell out the money for a hardback book. :-)"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have to say that MORRIGAN'S CROSS is the very first book of Ms. Roberts' that I didn't care for; didn't, in fact, even finish. It could be my own personal dislike of historical romance, but as this was more in the time travel/paranormal vein, I don't think that's true. The problem, at least for me, was unlikeable characters I couldn't relate to, coupled with too many Irish, Gaelic, and unfamiliar terms that the book's added glossary only complicated.I won't knock Ms. Roberts, because she is an unbelievably talented author who I admire. I'm also the world's largest Eve Dallas (fromJ.D. Robb Box Set (In Death)) fan, and have loved theKey Trilogy Box Setand all of her romantic suspense releases (you can see my review ofAngels Fallby clicking on my profile). Let's just say that, for me, MORRIGAN'S CROSS was a miss, instead of Ms. Roberts' usual hit."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Being a newer Nora Roberts fan( 8 years) i would have to say that the first book of her \\"Circle Trilogy \\" is definitely different than other books of hers that i have read. I personally have a passion for romance novels that take place in different times other than the present. and in this book you definitely get that.In her recent novel Morrigan's Cross she throws together a group of 6 strangers preparing for a battle against the world of the undead and there fearless leader Lillith. The story is enchanting and Roberts spins a fanciful world of magic, witches and of course love and shows us the \\"romantic\\" side of sex. The story takes place in several worlds so at times it gets a little confusing trying to figure out where everyone is from. and the budding romance between the witch and the sorcerer seems a littel rushed and un believeable. i believe in love at first site, but this seems a little too out there. Even so the journey they take is beautiful and makes you wish you had a rugged sexy sorcerer that would talk and look at you like your the last woman on Earth. If your looking for a little escape and the thought that maybe vampires do exist, the Circle Trilogy is for you."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Nora is the most interesting storyteller I have on my bookshelf, and I have alot! I am a fan of trilogies and have really enjoyed this one.Although I am not usually a fan of fairy tales, I found these three books interesting, and fast paced enough that I was never bored.Of course, the best part is that I began to really care about the six main characters, something that doesn't usually happen with many authors but seems to be a constant with most of Roberts' stories.If you want a good love story, plenty of action, and don't mind a surreal fairy-tale like atmostphere, this trilogy is for you."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Unlike most books in this genre, Roberts' books are well written and can stand up to most popular fiction not within the genre. Specifically, Roberts draws the reader into the angst of the protaganists. The character of each protaganist is developed. The story is developed and is interesting. I think even a reader who does not particularly like paranormal stories could enjoy this book (though I would caution that parts of the book are not for the timid). I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have never read any vampire romance books before, but where Nora leads, I'll follow. I think she sets up the trilogy beautifully here, but the romance between Hoyt and Glenna is, by necessity, short-changed. I never got a good sense of him as a character.Cian, otoh, is quite intriguing, so I can't wait for the third book!I like what Nora is doing with this trilogy. She's really telling a sweeping story, and her characterization of Lilith and her crew is really excellent, especially in the second book.You have to read this one to get to the other two. I'm giving the next book five stars and I suspect the last one will get the same rating. And it's no hardship to get through Morrigan's Cross, a little more in-depth character work with the main couple and it would have gotten five stars, too. But it's a quick and compelling read and you'll enjoy it if you like Nora and keep an open mind."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I was also very leery of Nora's latest trilogy. I enjoy Nora Roberts' writings and have read a majority of her novels as well as her trilogies and absolutely love the J.D. Robb series. When I first saw this book on the stands, I read the cover page and put it down immediately thinking this is not my kind of story and a little confused on the direction Nora was going with her recent writing. However a week later, I picked it up again and decided to give it a try figuring I didn't have to go any further than the first book if I wasn't satisfied with a crazy story about vampires. Well to my surprise I got completely absorbed in the characters themselves to the point that I can almost ignore the craziness of some of this vampire stuff and actually laugh at Cian getting his cup of blood from the freezer and heating it up in the microwave. By the conclusion of the book, I was very anxious to continue with the second edition of the trilogy, \\"Dance of the Gods\\" and that is exactly what I did. I say, if you are a true Nora fan like me, give this story a shot - I believe you will get extremely involved with the characters and the romance and even some of the crazy adventures back and forth from the 12th century to present day story lines. I do find that very interesting as well. This first book deals with the romantic entanglement of Hoyt (the sorcerer) from 12th century Ireland and Glenna (the witch) from modern day NYC and their quest to save mankind, gathering the circle of six to fight the vampire, Lilith and her army of bad-doers brought together by the goddess, Morrigan."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Am I the only one who thinks its a little creepy to have the old man tell a story with vivid sexual detail to children? As he was telling the story, I kept seeing him in front of the children he called to listen and it took A LOT away from the story."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm almost afraid to say it - I really enjoyed this book. Not, it's not her standard fare, nor is it as emotionally charged as, say, her Chesapeake Bay series is or even the Dream series, but it's fun and it's got some good dramatic tension and character development. And, Buffy-esque, it also laughs at itself. This book contains all the wit and humour that I'm used to seeing from her and I'm really interested to see where she takes this cast of characters. In some parts, yes, it's predictable, but Ms. Roberts always has a surprise or two. A good read, but I can see where not all of her fans will be willing to go down this path with her. If you're not into vampires, demons, time travel and other worlds, this might be one you want to pass on. Or, since it's Nora, you may just want to give it a try as she always manages to be entertaining."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I started this book and kept thinking it would get better...it didn't, in fact I didn't finish it or the series. What a shame this wonderful author is writing this type of storyline."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm a huge fan of fantasy (Lord of the Rings, Belgariad, Wheel of Time, etc) and I LOVE LOVE LOVE anything celtic. I had recently exhausted the Morgan Llywelyn possibilities at my local book store, so I see a book entitled Morrigun's Cross, and I pick it up. I'd heard good things about Roberts, and I'm not normally into romance, but I decided, why not. Morrigun is my favorite aspect of the Goddess, so I looked at it, wondering what an ancienct Celtic Goddess has to do with a cross. Not only is this book completely inaccurate with the references to the Gods, the plotline is thin and unimaginative, the characters aren't very well developed, and everything moves TOO fast. And yet I continue to read this garbage anyways....... Don't waste your money, I did... I own alll three books because I have a policy about finishing series when I start them.... And it just gave me more Irish names to work with in my own stories.... No I couldn't just go get a book of Celtic names like a normal person.... Alrighty, I'm babbeling so I'm done."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"A very typical Nora Roberts. It was predictable, yet set in a time warp from today to somewhere between the 12th and 16th century. She also had an unusual take on vampires - good and evil vampires. Witches and shape-shifters were also included."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I bought Morrigan's Cross when it first came out but for some reason hadn't been able to make myself read it until today. I thought it was a decent read but not up to the standards of her other books. As others have said, I thought the romance between Hoyt and Glenna was rushed. Glenna seemed to me to be very reminiscent of Maggie in Born in Fire, and one of the things I normally enjoy about Nora Roberts is her ability to create very different characters from book to book. Moira and Larkin are also very weakly developed by the end of this book, but perhaps that will change as the series goes along. I did like the portrayal of Cian very much, though, and also enjoyed Hoyt, more so at the beginning of the book than at the end.What really disturbed me was the part of the storyline involving King. I find it hard to believe that Ms. Roberts wouldn't realize in this day and age how her treatment of the only black character in the book might be taken. I had wondered how she was going to handle his story when I started the book; I couldn't really believe she was going to take the obvious way out of having to pair him up, but she did. I don't want to say more than that, to avoid a spoiler for anyone who hasn't read it yet. My guess is that it just didn't occur to Ms. Roberts that some might be offended by this storyline, but I do think this is something an editor should have caught before the book was published."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"When I heard Nora had written another trilogy, I was excited. Normally I can't wait to finnish them. However, I have only managed to get about halfway through this book. I found it hard to from the past to the present, and vampires just aren't my thing I suppose. Knowing me, I'll leave this for a couple months, then try to read it again.Who knows, I might end up liking the book after all."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Since I am a Nora Robert's fan--I was excited to see a new book on the stands and not a recovered book from her past (that I buy and end up figuring out 2 chapters in that I've already read it.) I just could NOT get going with this book!It wasn't her normal literary faire--although it had its gratuitous sex scenes throughout the book. I applaud her for trying something different (vampyres) and I loved the settings (New York and Ireland).I believe I was halfway through the book before it \\"hooked\\" me. It wasn't until Blair (the demon slayer) came into the story that I read with a bit more excitement.The story ended abruptly, but that is her way to get you to buy the next book in the series (out in October) so you can find out who won the big war between humans and vampyres."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Full disclosure: I have never read any vampire or fantasy books so I do not have any comparisons in that regard. I snatched up this book in the check out aisle solely because of the author's name on the cover. The excitement of beginning another Nora Roberts' trilogy made the drive home painful.My immediate reaction on reading the brief synopsis on the inside cover was, \\"Wow, vampires. Well, if anyone can write this, Nora Roberts can.\\"As I read the book, my view of it jumped around alot. Parts were very entertaining. I enjoyed Hoyt's time in New York. The sections that spoke about the group needing to train and then spent training seemed be quite frequent and boring. It is a little unclear as to when Hoyt and Glenna can use their powers. Maybe I would know this if I read more of the genre. When the bad folks took King, I kept thinking \\"Get him back the same way you moved Glenna's luggage across New York.\\"Cian and Blair were the characters I wanted to see more of. Their personalities were strong and I wanted to know what they were thinking and going to do. I am anxious to see what the other members of the Murphy family (as noted in the glossary) bring to the story.It will take some character development for me to get excited about Moira and Larkin. I felt they were the most bland in this book. As one other reviewer also commented, the first book in the trilogy spends a lot of time introducing the characters and plot. Consequently, I think that Hoyt and Glenna's relationship was sacrificed for the sake of setting the stage for book two and three.The gore was there but it is vampires. I guess some of that is to be expected.Overall, I agree with the comment that these trilogys are often best reviewed after all three have been read. The Three Sisters Trilogy was one of my favorties from Nora Roberts. I think each book got stronger as the series continued. I have faith that the same will be true of this trilogy."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I was very hesitant in reading this book as this is much out of Ms. Roberts norm. Boy, did she prove to me that I had nothing to worry about. She can write ANYTHING! I was enthralled by the first chapter and could not put this book down. I absolutely love the diversity of each character. I will admit that Cian has stolen the show for me in this series and can't wait for the third book and his story. I'm so happy to see that I don't have to wait a year for the next book in the series and will happily count the short days until I can purchase the second in this series. Good job, Ms. Roberts!"},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm a big Nora Robert's fan and I always look forward to her new releases with great anticipation. I like having the opportunity to visit the same characters over the course of a trilogy, but think the quality of the \\"stand alone\\" books sometimes suffers at the expense of the trilogy's over-arching plot. If Nora hold's true to form, \\"Dance of the Gods\\", the second installment of the Circle Trilogy, will be the best. Moreover, I will look at each individual book with greater fondness after having read all three.Putting anticipation aside, I will limit my comment's to \\"Morrigan's Cross\\". The concept is a new one for Nora. Nora has written fantasy before, but I don't remember a plot quite as ambitious as this one. Vampires, shapeshifters, and battles between good and evil populate this book. A previous reviewer mentioned similarities with the Anita Blake series by Laurell K. Hamilton and I'd have to say it's a fair comparison.The romantic couple at the focus of \\"Morrigan's Cross\\" is not as deeply developed as I would have liked. The romance seemed a bit hurried and the characters of Glenna and Hoyt not as richly developed. \\"Cross\\" is more engaging as a fantasy then as a romance.In a Robert's trilogy, there is a different romance at the center. I am anticipating the second book will focus on Larkin and Blair, and the third on Cian and Moira. The compartmentalization of the couples is what earns the criticism of Roberts being formulaic. I have never been not entertained by Roberts writing. She is a gifted, warm and imaginative writer. What I would suggest is for her to develop her couples on parallel tracks instead of sequentially. I think it would add depth to the characters, balance the plot and make readers like me not so dismissive of book number one."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"...Nora's latest is just a little too busy. The moderately sweet story about an earnest medieval sorcerer joining forces with a modern witch from NYC to fight an age-old vampiress is ultimately eclipsed by the sheer variety of supernatural confederates gathered together in one three-hundred odd page novel. There are witches, sorcerers (like witches but without the accessories), a shape shifter, and an overabundance of vampires. And, oh yeah, time travel. Twice.Hoyt, a 12th century sorcerer, has traveled to modern times to stop a vampiric revolution with the help of his brother Cian, a vampire with a heart (figuratively speaking). Hoyt is soon engaged in a torrid affair with Glenna, an American witch, and together they lead a band of characters to a small cottage in Ireland, where they hope to stave off an apocalypse with bow and arrows, swords and some self-defense training (good luck!). The burgeoning romance between the too main characters is cute (though, tell me how a 12th century, conservative kind of guy isn't a little dubious about Glenna's modern attitude towards sex?), but one dares not be distracted by it when every turning page reveals some new supernatural twist. Was it necessary to have not one, not two, but three time-traveling characters? Did they need to travel in time as well as from another dimension? Did we really need vampires AND witches AND sorcerers AND a shape shifter? The most troubling thing about this mixed cast, is that none of these supernatural archetypes bear any relationship to a theme or common plot - they just seem to show up on the scene with an entertaining super power.In the end, the book left me with the impression that instead of developing any one character to any depth, Nora used new supernatural twists to distract the reader from a shallow experience (kind of like watching things blow up in an action movie - it can be entertaining, but it really just serves to keep you from noticing there's no plot). I hold out some hope for the two selections remaining in this series, but was not impressed with this premier."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I too am a fan who jumps around in my likes and dislikes of Ms Roberts' works. This one I like. The other reviews I read were all pretty negative so I felt the need to add my two cents to the contrary. This first of a new trilogy is a more slowly paced and it seems that just doesn't sit well with many readers who want immediate action and resolution to the story in 300 pages. This tale focuses much more on character development especially as scene thru the development of a team who must put aside their very individual personalities, strengths, weaknesses and time periods to be a cohesive unit - and much of it isn't pretty and can be tedious, but then so can we humans - ever try to get five people to agree on anything? But being a Witch myself I enjoyed the very real and true portrayl of how we operate and to the high ethical standards we hold ourselves too - very refreshing and with absolutely no explanations and defensive descriptions - also very nice. In fact, none of the characters had to apologize for who they were, they just were. I have already ordered the second book and will enjoy it as well. If you enjoyed her series of the three sisters - Dance Upon the Air, Face the Fire, etc. You will enjoy this series too."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Morrigan's Cross is the first of a new trilogy by Nora Roberts. Roberts skillfully weaves mythology, magic, time travel, and fantasy into one of her patented three couple series. Couple one deals with the issues of being born nearly a thousand years apart, couple two is worlds apart and couple three is not only worlds apart but one of them is an undead.The wealth of detail, careful building of characters, and conscientious creation of magic rituals, physical environment, and dialog are classic Roberts. While the formula (three couples - three stories - one major story line) has been used before by Roberts, the characters ring true and their adversaries are believable.If you loved the fantasy and magical elements of the \\"Keys\\" trilogy and the romantic plot lines in the \\"Born in\\" trilogy you will love the \\"Circle\\" trilogy."},{"Title":"Morrigan's Cross (The Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I really enjoyed this I could not stop listening to it.

And WHY oh WHY do we have Cian listening to Nine Inch Nails in his cockpit?I'm only 140 pages in, but already I've cringed almost as much as when I read that Nora's Mikhail Stanislaski, darling of the Soho art scene, garners his reputation in one of the most competitive and pretentious art markets in the world by carving tiny figurines of kangaroos and \\"faeries\\" out of wood and then painting them (see, \\"The Stanislaski Brothers\\").I've read the last two trilogies over and over again, amazed at how Nora has taken the romance genre to its peak. She is the BEST working romance novelist period. When I saw that the new trilogy was to be about vampires, I eagerly awaited another inventive, yet focused, romance novel series. The genre requires set boundaries and formulas in order to create tension (this is why Regency romances are so popular) and so that the story doesn't stray too far from it's purpose--the consummation of the main relationship. This book has too many things going on--too many undeveloped plot elements and characters. This is not a romance novel. It's a fantasy novel. Though I am not too familiar with that genre, I am well-read enough to know that there has to be already someone (whoever it is) doing that genre justice. They probably don't need another hack over in the fantasy dept., which is what this book is. Hackish.This book, so far, is just ridiculous, and proves to me, finally, that when Roberts makes cheesy cultural references, it isn't because she's merely tailoring said references for the lowest-common-denominator-audience, it's because she doesn't know jack about what she's choosing to write about. Is there no savvy, NYC-based editor to tell her these things? Mistakes like this are also made with Jude and her \\"psychology degree\\" in \\"Jewels of the Sun.\\"There are plenty of Web sites where Nora could have researched modern day vampires and found out just how CHEESY having one listen to Nine Inch Nails is, but clearly, she didn't do the research.How am I supposed to respect Cian if he's such a stereotypical Goth bore? And why bother including King at all? Oh, I know, to have someone to cook and make coffee. ??? I notice from the reviews refrencing the next two books in this trilogy that HE doesn't have a match.

Got 1/3 of the way threw #2 and into the garbage along with the untouched #3."},{"Title":"Selections from Paroles (The Pocket Poets Series, Number Nine)","review":"In the early 1970's I had a great liking for Jacques Prevert and tried to emulate some of his ways of writing and seeing the ordinary in the world as extraordinary. This little volume from the Penguin Modern European Poets series was a good starter. Lawrence Ferlinghetti's introduction is a good overview of what made Jacques Prevert tick. This is also a bilingual edition which over the years has helped keep my rusty French from oxidising and although I don't go with all the translation-Mr Ferlingetti has done a fine job of turning this into English. Jacques Prevert could skewer the everyday-such as a series of images in the street and immortalise them into a cameo-like socio-drama-each event connected, each person or image unique. He was skilled in seeing what we mostly miss when we switch off in the everyday. He is funny, drolle, surreal and sometimes poignant. His words still last the distance of time and Paroles, from the Second World War era, certainly does. It still makes me chuckle and think."},{"Title":"Where Angels Walk: True Stories of Heavenly Visitors (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I received this book from a friend, then picked it up to read a few years later, after I'd done Scriptural research on angels for a project. I enjoyed the book. It was certainly an easy read, because of the format of many short stories. And I appreciated the whole approach on which it was based -- asking people everywhere for their own true stories of encounters with angels. What we read about angels in the Bible tells us how they quickly move in and out of people's lives, often to carry a message or to help in time of need (Peter's prison scene, one of my favorites!). The accounts in this book seem to jibe with those Biblical accounts. But more than that, angels show how God takes care of us, and that's the message I get from this book."},{"Title":"Where Angels Walk: True Stories of Heavenly Visitors (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"As the past proprietress of an Angel Store, we sold this book by the truck load.

All the stories are true and unbelievably remarkable. God has told us, &quot;Ask and ye shall receive&quot;, and that includes the asking for help for our loved ones and for ourselves.This is a book that will renew your faith and reaffirm God's love for us. It is at the darkest times of our lives, when we feel alone and abandoned, that we are loved the most. Help is there and we just have to ask for it.

He was so impressed with the book he lent it to his cell-mate and he is evangelizing himself. I couldn't be more pleased. Our God is an awesome God who gives proof and help and guidance.

I am someone who has had his interventions many times during times. God in heaven has forewarned me and even sent me an angel that disappered after saving me from drowning. Disappearing after they help is a sign of a heavenly visitor. Funny how the lifeguard ignored me at 7yrs old but God didn't after I prayered to him in the water. I haven't ever forgotten it.

Some of her stories originate from personal experiences, others from those who shared their experiences, only to portray the presence of something, someone special coming into their lives and bringing about a sense of peace.In one of her stories, on a snowy winter day, the rescue of her son comes to light through a mysterious event, and a stranger who brings her son through a nearly catastrophic event. Not that anyone actually saw a winged angelic spirit; it was more of realizing the presence of someone who suddenly came into his life and helped him through a situation.Reading these short stories may touch your heart enough to have you recall an event which seemed hopeless.......until a special happening brought someone close enough for you to feel God's presence in the form of a messenger who bears an angelic character.If you've ever come through a car accident safely, despite damage to the car, or if you've stepped away from something that looked dangerous, perhaps, you, too, were walking with an angel. Maybe, even if you look deeper, someone was in need of help, and you were the angel in their life. Don't be too surprised if you've had several such experiences.Today, these stories are syndicated and featured in several publications. The message is this: You are not alone, and the angels are walking with you!"},{"Title":"Where Angels Walk: True Stories of Heavenly Visitors (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The book has a lot of uplifting and inspiring stories about angels. When reading it I was inspired to research the concept of guardian angels further. A lot of the stories are very convincing, others seem more coincedental and not necessarily the work of angels. But above all there was one aspect I did not like about the book. I was under the impression that this was going to be a more open minded book to different religions and ideas. But throughout the book the author went back to Christianity and especially Catholicism. If that is what people believe then that is great, but I was expecting to see more stories that were not necessarily religious in nature, or at least are not only Christian. Angels are supposed to work miracles in everyone's lives, not just Christians'. I believe the author, being raised a Christian and still being a Christian, chose to only use stories that were Christian in nature. I found that very disappointing and was looking forward to hearing a more open minded look at the angels."},{"Title":"The letters of James and Peter","review":"I have read many commentaries and Barclay and John MacArthur are the best in my opinion.

I was astonished to learn how much important just these three books (James, First Peter, Second Peter) are for the Christian thought and the Christian faith and, equally astonished,at the wealth of information a scholar, the like of William Barclay, can pour in a commentary the size of this one. This is a work of art as far as erudition goes but, most importantly, it is a spring of refreshing and still pertinent Christian thought. I would have loved to make the acquaintance of such a learned and profoundly Christian character as the author of this book, Mr William Barclay.It is a beautifully worded book, highly readable and, also, it is a complete success as far as bringing, what could be termed as highly technical concepts (including etymology and semantics of mostly Greek words) into a lay people level of comprehension. I can not overstate the importance, for us Christians, of books of this nature and relevance. Please, read it."},{"Title":"The letters of James and Peter","review":"William Barclay is an inspiring mentor for our study group.

I especially enjoyed Margaret Paston and the wry humor she managed to express in her letters as she played an important part in both family battles and the land battles that were common in her time.I was also impressed with the small world that medieval England must have been. Chaucer's relatives, a few English kings, Queen Margaret, and Sir John Fastolf (the basis for Shakespeare's Falstaf) all came and went in various roles of importance in the lives of an otherwise everyday middle class family."},{"Title":"The Medieval Family: The Pastons of Fifteenth-Century England","review":"The Pastons were not a likeable bunch. They were ambitious, litigious and acquisitive, embroiled in endless fights (both in and out of court) for diverse manors and lands - and making innocent parties, such as their servants and tenants, suffer as a consequence of these fights. They probably did not think twice about perjuring themselves in issues as sensitive as a man's last will, if it was in their interests to do so. They did not hesitate to change allegiances if the lord they served suddenly fell from favour, as often happened in those politically fraught times. They were snobbish social climbers, not above considering a mercer's daughter as a prospective bride if she happened to have a good dowry, but turning their back on their own daughter and sister when she had the audacity of marrying for love. They are not pleasant people, at least by modern-day standards. And yet (or maybe because of it) their lives are fascinating.We are lucky that this medieval family's letters have been preserved, thus providing us with a priceless window into the late Middle Ages and what England was like at that time. And we are also lucky that there are scholars such as Frances and Joseph Gies, capable of weaving the letters into a gripping narrative that takes us through three generations of a family's life. This book is a real page-turner.There are very few things missing. One oddity, in my opinion, is that the excommunication of one of the Paston patriarchs was passed over in one or two lines. Religion was all-important in the Middle Ages, so I suppose being excommunicated must have had a great impact (both practical and psychological) on this individual and his relatives. However, the issue was not analyzed. Also, I would have enjoyed more info on young Margery Paston's clandestine marriage to Richard Calle, the Paston bailiff. Margery defied her family in marrying a man they considered their social inferior, and was shunned by them for it. No information is given on her or her husband's later lives, except for the fact that apparently they had three surviving children. Margery and Richard are the two most endearing people in this chronicle, and I would have liked to know more about what happened to them (indeed, one hopes that they were happy!).But, all in all, this book was a great read, and a source of important knowledge about the Wars of the Roses, as well as about the lives of a social class whose fortunes were on the rise towards the end of the fifteenth century."},{"Title":"The Medieval Family: The Pastons of Fifteenth-Century England","review":"The Paston family, whose large collection of personal correspondence is the basis for this book, helps us see firsthand the lifestyle and attitudes of the Middle Ages. Although intriguing, I wasn't ready to limit my medieval reading to one family. The sheer volume of information obtained from personal correspondence and legal records makes this a heavy read if you are not a scholar. I read all the other Gies books with great enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Medieval Family: The Pastons of Fifteenth-Century England","review":"Excellent book for medieval history. Richly photagraphed with an excellent reenactment group in authentic settings. The book covers the entire household."},{"Title":"The Medieval Family: The Pastons of Fifteenth-Century England","review":"This book is great source for genealogy research on the Paston family. I bought this as part of my research on the Flegg family (ancestors of Margaret (Mauteby) Paston). It is still an interesting read even if you aren't related. You get very involved in their stories. This is not a general overview of life at this time but includes many wonderful tidbits. Some of the letters are rich with humor and love. Many of the stories that come through are suspenseful. Because it is all from documents it can be frustrating at times as some \\"story lines\\" you are following get dropped. In general it is an interesting read. If you are looking into this book as a genealogical text it is exceptional."},{"Title":"The Medieval Family: The Pastons of Fifteenth-Century England","review":"This is an account of the fortunes of a newly-prosperous family, who had made their fortunes as lawyers, drawn from an unusually complete collection of their correspondence. The correspondence deals with many matters of money and litigation. They were not unusually litigious for their times; it was just a difficult century. Several letter-writers emphasized that it was necessary to be well-versed in law, besides having powerful friends, in order to protect one's fortune.It sounds like it was a wild time to be a lawyer: not that there weren't legal procedures in place, but the problem was enforcing them. Wills, contracts, judgments, and arbitrations could stipulate money to be paid and actions to be taken, but whether these were carried out was quite another matter. Standard procedure when disputing possession of a manor was for the party who was stronger in arms to forcibly take over the place, while litigation was ongoing. And securing judgments in the courts depended very heavily on alliances and money, with bribes flowing freely and machinations to get the disposal of one's affairs in the hands of someone well-inclined.Another matter that receives some discussion is marriage negotiations and kinship relations. All these things are gone into just enough to elucidate the Pastons' affairs, as are historical and national matters that the Pastons played tangential roles in. We also get some information on how they spent their money, at least as far as clothes and luxury goods that they had to order sent up from London.The introduction says, the letters \\"amount to a sort of nonfiction historical novel\\". I don't know if I can quite agree with that: although there are occasional striking details, the outline of events is too sketchy for a novel, and more importantly, the personalities of the people involved remain mostly unknown. The letter writers seem to have stuck to a brief, businesslike tone more often than not, though some individuals were chattier. It is difficult to keep track of the enormous number of people mentioned other than the few main members of the Paston family.A more important criticism lies in the superficial nature of the narration. The Gieses are writers rather than research historians, and the second-hand nature of any analysis they quote shows through. There are many books about the Pastons, and I don't think this one is essential. Nonetheless, it's well and clearly written, and enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"The Medieval Family: The Pastons of Fifteenth-Century England","review":"The Amazon reviewer states that if the Pastons had supported the Earl of Oxford at Bosworth field they would have been ruined.

Since I grew up in East Sacramento in the 1950's and 60's, I was looking forward to this one; however, it seems that the authors & researchers may have been in a hurry, as there are some factual errors, a lot of proofreading errors, and a lot of focus on some areas & nothing on others. It makes me think they scraped together what they could find & didn't spend much time looking for anything else. There are still a lot of older residents in the area who may have been happy to contribute either memories or photographs or both.

As a child I never really expected to see my adulthood, &quot;knowing&quot; that the world would end. Now of course, I see things slightly differently. This book by Edinger is why I really enjoy Jungian psychology. Edinger puts into perspective the beliefs of millions of conservative Christian Americans and helps you see it through psychological eyes. I can now breathe a sigh of relief knowing a bit more about the apocalypse but still a little aprehensive knowing that many unconscious &quot;believers&quot; may create a self fulfilling prophesy by their own projections!"},{"Title":"Archetype of the Apocalypse: Divine Vengeance, Terrorism, and the End of the World","review":"While Jung's model of the mind is both elegant and apt, the master in his own words I find a hard slog. My puny brain can read a paragraph over and over with no more comprehension on the fifth read than on the first. Chalk it up to public education.It is with Jung's disciples that the seeds of his wisdom take root and blossom. Edinger, one of that first (and best) generation, brings a fierce intellect to his task, but keeps it accessible. In today's climate of fear, this psychological analysis of the book of Revelations strikes mighty sparks of relevancy, even for the casually Christian. Most chilling is the belief by this scientist of the subconscious that we Moderns are manifesting the Apocalypse, not perhaps as a fifty-seven headed beast - but as very real collapse and universal agony. How can we avoid it? Probably not possible. But one might survive it by following the Master's advice; become your authentic self. This book provides ample evidence to encourage one along that way."},{"Title":"Archetype of the Apocalypse: Divine Vengeance, Terrorism, and the End of the World","review":"Professor Edward Edinger, Psychiatrist, Jungian scholar, and Jehovah Witness, uses the book of Revelations to draw us into a web that intersects at the vertex of all of his many professional realms of interests and understandings. Once he has captured us there, in his own intellectual corner, he then \\"uses the theme of cultural transition\\" disguised as, and implicit in, the deeply symbolic scriptures taken from the book of Revelations, to advance an unlikely version of a very \\"familiar\\" theory of archetypes: One that turns out to be as much existentialist philosophy and depth psychology as hardcore religiosity.And what a rich \\"mother lode\\" Edinger's mind turns out to be: Erudite and persuasive; inventive and logical, scary and seductive, intense and carefully thought out, meticulous in its details, but all done without a hint of the taint of anti-intellectual religiosity or fanaticism. The author commands his complex ship well through some of the roughest cultural, psychological and existential waters known to modern man, and skillfully brings it safely home to a believable harbor.His theory is: that a psychological analysis of the book of Revelations reveals that the world as we know it will inexorably come to an end. But that the particular book of the bible that foretells the end, is not just literal religious prophesy, or an exercise in allegorical pre-Christian symbolic poetic license, nor even just the scattered images of a schizophrenic mind or worldview, but the rumblings of \\"yet-to-be-deciphered\\" meanings from deep within our collective and historical consciousness: The book of Revelations is \\"content,\\" \\"symbolism,\\" and \\"agency;\\" a living psychic organism, as it were, of rumblings that inhabit and serve the needs of the individual as well as the collective psyche.It is in the analysis of the meaning of these rumblings that underlie the predictions that foreshadow a fundamental shift if not a breakup in the global paradigm of cultural and psychological understanding itself. As a paradigm of deep \\"personal\\" as well as \\"transpersonal\\" or collective psychology, Edinger reveals in these lectures that it is as much the change in the fundamental religious paradigm and the resistance to this change as anything else that represents the \\"moving psychological parts\\" of the archetype of the Apocalypse. For the change will be accompanied by a corresponding collective primal fear and resistance, emanating from a fundamentally \\"religious libido\\" -- a fear and resistance that will trigger a global psychosis and chaos that will cause a breakup in man's current cosmic worldview. It will be a kind of cultural and psychological upheaval that man has not known since the breakup of the Roman Empire and the cosmic worldview that held the Roman world together. We can already begin to see cracks in the paradigm with both domestic and international but always religiously motivated terrorism. The result of this psychological \\"showdown,\\" \\"collective man\\" versus \\"the religious libido of individual man,\\" and \\"individual man's\\" resistance to the change he has invested in the archetypical paradigm will be as real in its consequences as any of the images portrayed of Armageddon.Using psychological evidence from his practice in psychiatry, drawing heavily on his religious background, and his readings of world history and culture, Edinger, convincingly \\"deconstructs\\" and then \\"re-synthesizes\\" the meanings of the scriptures -- verse-by-verse - according to his own archetypical typology, leaving us with the suggestion that it will be the consequences of these meanings functioning out of a deeply religious agency -- rather than out of the economic, social and technical vulnerabilities that continue to grow without bounds - that in the final analysis will represent the \\"showdown\\" at the end of individual man's psychological patience and existence.Edinger proves here that Jungian analysis remains heady intellectual stuff despite its heavy dependence on religious interpretations. It is thus theoretical content, with which any serious intellectual must reckon.Five stars"},{"Title":"Archetype of the Apocalypse: Divine Vengeance, Terrorism, and the End of the World","review":"Edinger interprets the apocalypse myth as an expression of the experience of the conscious becoming aware the unconscious - a loss of innocence. Disillusion is never a pleasant experience. I expect that much of the interpretation of the images is known in theological circles, it was an awakening for me. An excellent book, although, Jungian writing tends to be heavy reading.

This is history through story telling. Most is factual, but the folklore is weaved into the telling of the tale. The descriptions of the life and work of Daniel O'Connell are priceless. As a boy, growing up, I was never certain of what was real and what was fanciful about my Irish heritage. But, isn't that much of the charm of the Irish? I highly recommend this book to the reader who wants to be entertained and disdains dry history books. This is a fun read and a wonderful way to learn of the surprising and incredibly interesting history of an amazing people. I also recommend a new book by Frank Delaney, Ireland, published in 2004. Read it and you will understand why I prefer my history learning to include people like the Shanachies who passed on the oral traditions. But, if you really want to learn about the Irish, go to Ireland, and let the people tell you of their history and culture. I learned more in 16 days in Ireland than anything I have ever read. It is a proud culture of wonderful people. It is important for the reader to know that this was published in 1921 and reflects the attitudes of that time in Ireland."},{"Title":"The Story of the Irish Race: A Popular History of Ireland","review":"A classic work of Irish-American partisan history. This was the Irish history taught at our grandparents knee and stories both whispered and shouted at many an auld shebeen. Unfortunately, much of it is highly exagerated and based more upon cultural politics than verifiable history. There is no doubt that the history of the English occupation has been long and cruel, but that in and of itself does not make all things Irish angelic. According to the poet MacManus, Ireland before 1169 was an idylic wonderland inhabited by saints and scholars and noble warriors. Do not misunderstand: I love this book. I retell these tales to any and all who will listen. But it is not history as much as folklore. His dedication to his deceased bride- the poet Ethna Carberry- is touching and sad, but gets obsessive as she is mentioned in almost every chapter. My old copy - 1921- contains blank pages in the back with the instructions to paste the newsclippings about the Treaty there. This book is perhaps one of the last places one can find the stories of Fin MacCool, St. Patrick, Owen Roe O'Neil, Patrick Sarfield and the Fenians all in one volume, and each capter ws writen by different experts (and Nationalists)."},{"Title":"Understanding the Signs of the Times","review":"This book is a well organized and well written commentary of the Book of Revelation from an LDS perspective.

Even though it encompasses a substantial part of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia, say the word and most people think vaguely of reindeer, and that's about it. This beautifully written, excellently photographed book will change your mind quickly.You will learn that Lapland is one of the last areas of Earth from which the ice sheets retreated. It is also the land of the Midnight Sun, as the striking cover photograph demonstrates. The photos and text will show you dramatic proof, particularly with respect to the lakes of Finland, and Sweden's Sarek National Park, the largest in Europe. To those who have explored Rocky Mountain National Park or the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, these pictures will evoke many pleasant memories.Also discussed in detail is Lapland's varied wildlife, including bear, reindeer, birds, northen pike, and, of course, the fabled lemming. Writer Marsden's narrative of these animals is particularly engrossing. He also investigates the many seabirds, especially in his facinating chapter on the Norwegian Lofoten Islands and the famous Maelstrom whirlpool.&quot;Lapland&quot; also discusses the Lapps, those people who still live by following and guiding the reindeer on their annual migration. The Lapps' ingenuity and perserverance in a severe climate is amazing.I recommend this book very highly, as it is endlessly interesting.

Many of its finest examples have disappeared in all but photos, and others exist only in misshapen form, but the author is able to recall the grace, dignity, pretension and whimsy which went into their original design. This is a book for both new and old residents who may have decided that our &quot;Stumptown&quot; had little adornment in its early years,and proves that Portland was already a place of discernment and competitive display long before the 19th Century turned, when Seattle was a fishing camp and jumping off point to Alaskan gold.

This book is an excellent chance to buy (or even see at all) reproductions of some of his less famous paintings. The reproductions are very nice quality, and many of them also reproduce enlargements of sections of the painting. There is a short description for each that ties it in with Friedrich's life and what he was doing at the time. Also lots of biographical info on the artist (but the writing is kind of dry and not so easy to read). If you are looking for a book on the artist then this is an excellent option.List of some nice color reproductions:On the Sailboat (1818)Sisters on the Harbor view Terrace (1820)Moonrise by the Sea (1821)Morning in the Mountains (1822)The Nets (1830)Swans in the Reeds by Dawns early Light (1832)Evening Landscape with 2 Men (1830)The Dreamer (1835)Those are some of the full page color prints.

Out of the numerous books I have gotten on the subject this is one of the few I've returned. The spells in it are things that you can probably find elsewhere as well."},{"Title":"Book of Spells (Wordsworth Reference) (Wordsworth Collection)","review":"Book of Spells (Wordsworth Reference) (Wordsworth Collection)I thought that this book was excellent!Unlike other books that I have read on the topic that have merely presented reprints of the ancient magical texts (lesser Keys of Solomon, Grimoires etc.), Waite's work is unique in that it takes a critical view of the processes of ritual magical.This book was more scholarly than other books that I have found on spell casting; in that sense it was a revelation of sorts. The Book of Spells reveals the origins of the manuscripts as known to the author and even where to find many of them (most are in Paris) to do further research if one is so inclined! I found the prospect of one day seeing the real manuscripts exciting as I read.Probably the most important questions he addresses are:What arts make up the \\"occult arts\\"?What is the value of each of those arts to the adept?Is ritual magic worth the time spent in its production?What are the true natures of these books that form the core of ritual magic?One thing that you realize as you read the book is that through the entire production of the great magical manuscripts there have been all sorts of plagiarized works, works written under pseudonyms, works that claim outlandish things, mistakes in translation etc. that makes reading any of the works uncritically really an exercise in futility. However, I find that this might be true of most ancient manuscripts.I was glad to have the voice of one of the foremost 19th century mystics guide me through these books and offer his advice/experience.Although The Book of Spells presents many of the most important ritual magic texts in detail, it steers the reader to the books that make up the Zohar as an alternative to ritual magic and promises more can be gained spiritually by this path.En fin, I recommend it fully to anyone who is open minded and trusts in Waite's authority."},{"Title":"Book of Spells (Wordsworth Reference) (Wordsworth Collection)","review":"Okay,what I love about this book is the totally cool magic that everyone wants!

I purchased this shorter volume for our church library and am already saving up the $66 to purchase the longer work for my private library. I eagerly anticipate obtaining Dallimore's more exhaustive look at the life of this great evangelist.This Volume: First of all, the editing and reworking of the original for this edition was done by the author--Arnold Dallimore. This is important due to the terrible chop-jobs professional editors are prone to perform on works such as this one. But since I've yet to read the longer edition of which this volume is a condensation, I cannot draw any helpful comparisons between the two. I can, however, say unreservedly that this is an amazing biography in itself. Most modern readers aren't interested in wading through 1200 pages of historical details, even for a man as great as Whitefield. Far more would be willing to pick up a well-written 200 page paperback concerning a name they might have heard mentioned, but know little about. All in all, I very highly recommend this volume for this sort of reader. But if you are an evangelical Christian (particularly of the \\"Calvinist\\" doctrinal persuasion) or a Church-history buff, then I feel compelled to recommend springing for the full edition. With what this tiny volume contained I cannot but expect great things from the lengthier original work.The Subject Matter: Wow. Simply wow. I mean--who knew? I'd always heard that John Wesley was the sole founder of Methodism. In fact, the only thing I knew about George Whitefield was that he was attributed with a few neat quotes (ie. \\"Let the name of Whitefield perish, but Christ be glorified!\\", \\"I am weary in Thy work, but not weary of it\\", etc.) and that he once spoke at Jonathan Edwards' Northhampton church (at which time he left Edwards in tears). I fully expect that if it were not for this work of Dallimore, the name of Whitefield truly would be lost to persons such as myself. What I expected was another (Calvinistic) Wesley. What I found was a man whose zeal, love, holiness of life and passion for Christ seemed to equal even those I hold in highest regard (among whom are Martin Luther and Charles Spurgeon). Whitefield was a tireless worker for God and his zeal for the gospel was only matched by his selfless compassion for his fellow man. He was the first of the great open-air preachers and nudged both John and Charles Wesley into evangelistic ministry. Whitefield's life is a beautiful illustration of Christian ministry and evangelistic zeal. I cannot recommend this man highly enough.The Author: Dallimore was a Baptist pastor and semi-prolific biographer. The only lack that I see in this work compared with his biography \\"Spurgeon\\" is that it is more lacking in anecdotal stories and pastoral application. This is likely due to the scope of the abbreviated work rather than to a change in style of the author. It is a fast-moving biography and takes you quickly from Whitefield's earliest days into the midst of his phenomenal ministry. Dallimore has done a superb job in this work.The Reader: Who should read this book? I would recommend it most highly to pastors and other evangelical Christians whose zeal for God and spiritual wells have begun to run dry. Evangelical Calvinistic Christians will get the greatest benefit from this read. But it may also prove of great interest to those of the Methodist heritage. Also, all who are called to the ministry of evangelism (teaching and preaching) could not but benefit from this work. Whitefield's zeal is contagious and his meekness humbling. The mere historian might enjoy the factual aspects of the book, but it was written from a distinctively evangelical Christian perspective.\\"Weary in Thy work, but not weary of it.\\" -G. Whitefield"},{"Title":"George Whitefield- 2 volume set","review":"In George Whitefield: God's Anointed Servant in the Great Revival of the Eighteenth Century, Arnold Dallimore gives us a fast moving 200 page version of his 1200 page, two-volume biography of Whitefield.George Whitefield grew up in England and attended Oxford with his friends John and Charles Wesley. These young men shared a passion for the Lord and for Evangelism, but differences in doctrine drove them apart. Whitefield held to the doctrines of grace: \\"I embrace the Calvinistic scheme, not because Calvin, but Jesus Christ has taught it to me.\\" John Wesley, on the other hand, viewed Calvinism as heresy. Despite this, the three maintained a love for each other throughout their lives. Even after bitter controversy, John Wesley preached Whitefield's funeral.Whitefield began preaching in the open air--sometimes to crowds estimated at near 80,000--while still in England. He continued this in North America, where he served as a missionary. While there, he became friends with Benjamin Franklin, and his preaching, along with that of Jonathan Edwards, was instrumental in bringing about the Great Awakening.Dr. Dallimore calls Whitefield \\"the greatest evangelist since the apostle Paul.\\" There is no doubt that he had an extraordinary love and burden for sinners; tears often streamed down his face while he pleaded with them to come to Christ, and he considered himself \\"the servant of all.\\" When he died at 55, he had preached 30,000 sermons. Even when his doctor told him that he had to quit preaching and rest, he kept on. The night of his death, while on his way upstairs to bed, he paused to preach to a small group that had come to the door begging him to share the gospel. He preached until the candle in his hand burned out, and then he went to his final rest.Biographies are often the most interesting, encouraging, and edifying books that I read. I consider this one of the best. It is hard to put down, and it's hard to read without being changed."},{"Title":"George Whitefield- 2 volume set","review":"I read the first few hundred pages of Dallimore's mammoth two volume tour of Whitefield's life and times, and I was loving it. But I got sidetracked and didn't get back to it right away.So I decided to read through this condensation of the two volume set. This little book has a lot of power because it is a tight presentation of the most telling moments in the great evangelist's life. You see his early days at the Bell Inn which was run by his parents. You read briefly of his involvement with the Oxford Holy Club, and his shattering conversion to Christ.After his ordination, he is introduced to field preaching by Howell Harris, and the rest, as we say, is history. He preaches to thousands of miners and workers in the open air in England, then in October of 1739, he sails for the second time to the American colonies, where his powerful preaching wins thousands of people to Christ.You also read of Whitefield's unfortunate doctrinal divisions with John and Charles Wesley involving Calvinism and Arminianism. You will meet Whitefield's wife, and how they spent more time apart than together on account of his itinerant ministry.You also read of his friendship with Benjamin Franklin and of his meeting with Jonathan Edwards.You also read of Whitefield's constant health problems and how his persistent preaching eventually wore him out, and he died early one morning in 1770 of a severe case of asthma.He is quite simply the greatest evangelist since the apostle Paul, and Dallimore's little book catches the highlights of his ministry. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"George Whitefield- 2 volume set","review":"I was impressed with the devotion and energy of George Whitefield. He was the driving force for the early Methodist movement, but his name is lost to most people as John Wesely is now identified as the founder of the church.It is a story telling of the work of the Holy Spirit in a human being, and how it motivated him to tell the story of Jesus in a way that captivated the hearts of people.I was astounded to read of the vast number of people who stood outside to listen to George preach, without the aid of voice amplification.Read it and gain a new sense of history in the Christian faith."},{"Title":"George Whitefield- 2 volume set","review":"This book was my introduction to George Whitefield.

This book is so good you leave it wanting to read more of Whitefield!"},{"Title":"George Whitefield- 2 volume set","review":"The 18th Century produced evangelicalism's greatest theologian (Jonathan Edwards), evangelist (George Whitefield), organizer (John Wesley), and songwriter (Charles Wesley). These four represent evangelicalism at its best: trans-Atlantic cooperation across theological lines, a burning zeal for evangelism, and a concomitant commitment to social reform (especially in John Wesley's case). But they also evince the deepest theological fault line within evangelicalism, between Calvinists and Arminians, and demonstrate the ongoing tensions between the church and parachurch ministries.Edwards, being dead, still speaks through reprints of his works and the veritable cottage industry of explaining and applying them to today's concerns. John Wesley lives on through numerous denominations--Methodist, Wesleyan, Holiness--that trace their origins, in one way or another, to his labors, and through Christian small groups that, wittingly or not, perpetuate aspects of his societies, bands, and classes. And we sing Charles Wesley's hymns, though not often enough--at least for my taste.Whitefield, on the other hand, has been largely neglected. This is odd, for Whitefield arguably did more to promote trans-Atlantic evangelicalism than any of his peers, working with an ecumenical cast of Anglicans, Baptists, Congregationalists, Independents, and Presbyterians. Though a Calvinist--and for a period of time in deep dispute with the Wesleys over their Arminianism--he worked with Arminian evangelicals. He preached as often--if not more often--than John Wesley, and to larger crowds. He pioneered many of the techniques that Wesley perfected--e.g., open-air preaching, circuit riding, religious societies. Indeed, in his own time, he was often referred to as \\"the Founder of Methodism.\\"Over the course of three decades, Arnold A. Dallimore sought to rectify this neglect of Whitefield. In 1970, he published the first volume ofGeorge Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth-Century(Banner of Truth). He publishedthe second volumein 1980. In 1990, Crossway published the one-volume abridgement of the biography under review here. It was reprinted in 2010 with a new cover. Crossway also publishedThe Sermons of George Whitefieldin 2012.I hope to review The Sermons soon, but for now let me say something about Dallimore's abridged biography. It is a self-conscious hagiography of the great evangelist. I use the word hagiography literally, for after reviewing Whitefield's life and labors, Dallimore writes: \\"George Whitefield was a holy man\\" (p. 200). A Christian reader of George Whitefield--at least an evangelical Protestant reader--will likely come to the same conclusion. Whitefield's zeal for evangelism, concern for the poor, personal philanthropy, and courage in the face of mobs mark him out as a deeply Christian man. By outlining the course of his life and ministry, Dallimore has performed a signal service for evangelical readers.By nature, hagiographies are not critical biographies, however. They describe a life in order to inspire emulation. But this description has an apologetic cast to it. Throughout this book, for example, Dallimore compares and contrasts Whitefield and John Wesley, often to the latter's detriment. (Charles Wesley comes out better because he was personally closer to Whitefield than his brother John.) His treatment of Whitefield is defensive, as if he mourns the spotlight historians have shown on John rather than George. He sees faults in Whitefield: emotionalism in his early ministry, not to mention a critique of Christian ministers whom he felt were not personally born again or whose ministries were insufficiently evangelical. \\"His chief fault,\\" Dallimore avers, \\"was his condoning the practice of slavery, the one dark blot on his otherwise spotless record.\\" A critical biography would examine these topics in more detail. If Dallimore does examine them more closely in his two-volume biography, he has chosen not to include the results of that examination here.And there are topics that might interest modern readers. InThe Divine Dramatist, Harry S. Stout explores Whitefield's self-promotion and theatricality. InThe Accidental Revolutionary, Jerome Dean Mahaffey explores the political effects of Whitefield's ministry in the American colonies. How Whitefield innovated the practice of evangelism and what effect those innovations have on contemporary evangelicals is interesting to me, as a church leader. And as an American, I'm interested in the ways religion influenced the cause of revolution. But these topics go unremarked upon (at least in the abridgement).I make these critical remarks of George Whitefield not because I didn't enjoy the book or wouldn't recommend it. I did, and I would. Rather, I make them because readers should know what to expect from Dallimore's work. It will give them a good outline of the chronology and major events in Whitefield's life. And it should inspire readers--at least if they are evangelical--to greater personal holiness, zeal for the lost, and desire to do as much good in this life as God enables one to do. If you profit from this book, by all means read the two-volume version, which explores issues in greater depth. Nonetheless, Dallimore's biography is not the whole picture. If your interest is more broadly historical, you'll need to supplement your reading with critical biographies such as the ones I've mentioned above.P.S. Historian John Fea recommends Frank Lambert's\\"Pedlar in Divinity\\", and Thomas Kidd's forthcoming biography of Whitefield, to be published by Yale University Press."},{"Title":"George Whitefield- 2 volume set","review":"It was amazing to read about George Whitefield and how he taught the masses that God is personal. I like the quote from Mrs. Edwards to the Rev. James Pierrepont \\"...very many persons in Northampton date the beginning of new thoughts, new desires, new purposes and a new life from the day they heard him preach...\\""},{"Title":"George Whitefield- 2 volume set","review":"I have mixed feelings about this work. On the one hand it is a pleasant to read account of an amazing man of God. On the other hand the author needlessly includes attacks on John Wesley in a manner that would not have been acceptable to Whitefield. It offers only a few words about Whitefield's serious flaws, such as his passionate support of black slavery. It reads like a polemic in praise of Whitefield and attacking those whom the author feels disagreed with Whitefield. It does not read like history; the author's theory of Wesley's supposed selfish ambition does not ring true with more serious works of history and Whitefield's own published material. In support of these extraordinary accusations the reader is offered only casual and often curious references. For example he invokes the lightly regarded bibliography by Southey in support of his thesis, but neglects to mention that Southey later recanted his opinion in this regard. In short I am left with a deeper admiration of Whitefield, but the nagging feeling that Whitefield himself would not have appreciated being lionized in this manner, nor would he have appreciated the character assassination of his good friend John Wesley."},{"Title":"George Whitefield- 2 volume set","review":"After reading some of the reviews of this book and knowing of the larger two volume work out there I decided to go for this one first. And I was not let down.There are many great things about this book. It is short, accessible, and cheap! There is a ton of information packed into this volume, but don't let that fool you. It is also a great story. I could hardly put this book down! I learned so many things about Whitfield: his amazing work ethic, his unique relationships (Ben Franklin, John Wesley, etc) and his incredible importance in the First Great Awakening. The fact that he was the first real founder of methodism. It really is amazing how little is known of George Whitfield and how helpful this little volume is in shedding light on his life.Second, this is, as I said, an abridged version of the larger two volume work. The great thing about this one is that the author himself did the abridging. So we get a much more accessible volume from the man who has done all the research and hard work and knows whats most important and how to keep the story flowing.I would highly recommend this book!

Well done!P.S. How can I get the instructor's manual?"},{"Title":"C How To Program 2ND Edition","review":"I have looked at a plethora of C books. This book is the only one which is very suitable for everyone- from people without programming experience to power programmers in other languages. I bought this book without programming experience. Now I make excellent programs and still use this book as a reference. On top of that it also goes into C++ in the later chapters. I call it my C bible"},{"Title":"C How To Program 2ND Edition","review":"This text is an excellent and thorough introduction to ANSI C. Any reader who reads the book and works through the exercises will feel confident that they can program professionally in C.The layout of the book is excellent. The contents are presented in a very logical order and at just the right pace. In addition, this book provides an excellent overview of the C++ language in the later chapters"},{"Title":"C How To Program 2ND Edition","review":"If you're just tinkering and want to learn the basics of C++ quickly - this is not the book for you. If you are a software professional, particularly if you are familiar with C, and want real in-depth training in C++ in a format you are familiar with, this book belongs on your reference shelf. It's not unlike a college level textbook, so if you are used to that you will learn quickly. It uses standard programming excercises and data structures that would be taught in freshman and sophomore level programming classes, so if you've been there, you can relate to the examples easily. It does'nt try to cram down the basics in a few chapters, everything you need is there, with the only major exception is that there is nothing about STL, so the book is getting a little dated in that respect. The book is also a great reference, I have a number of books on C and C++ (and have skimmed through dozens at bookstores here in Austin) and this is the only book other than K&amp;R that I use regularly. This is book is one of the few worth the price, as long as you program in C++, you will no doubt have a use for it"},{"Title":"C How To Program 2ND Edition","review":"I had not programmed at all, in any langauage, before I picked up this book. It is well layed out, the examples make sense, and it gives a very thorough knoweldge of the language itself.

I have easily found information in this book that the &quot;defacto&quot; standard books have not been able to provide or bury deep within their texts. What's equally important is that the authors can be easily reached by email and they DO respond to questions and feedback!! This book is a must have for the novice and professional designer/programmer alike"},{"Title":"C How To Program 2ND Edition","review":"The size of the book is deceiving. Firstly, half of the book is about C++. As for information on C, it contains very little information advanced pointer and array usage; the fundamental power of C. After reading the book once, there very little use of later. As a real-time software engineer, I'd strongly recommend not to buy this book."},{"Title":"C How To Program 2ND Edition","review":"The book is really easy to understand. It is straight forward and to the point. Most of all technical terminology is defined for the beginner.I especially appreciate the fact that the authors have mentioned that they have tried to present C in such a way to be the first computer language for beginners, despite in traditional terms, Pascal being taught as the first programming language because of it's known structured programming discipline.In my lower years of education, I have had experiences with QBasic and a little of Visual Basic. However, as a student, I would think that skipping Pascal is a plus since I tend to ask myself, \\"When am I ever going to use it in life...\\" Students tend to question the applicable use of something that is learned.These days, Pascal is seldom used as C++ predominantly takes the stage.In sum, learning C as a foundation and first language seems to be something that will pay off. This book also includes tips and points out common pitfalls such as common programming errors, good programming practices, performance tips, and software engineering observations, which are all really helpful. If you are new to programming, this book is a must."},{"Title":"C How To Program 2ND Edition","review":"This book not only has in depth explanation of C, but it also covers quite a lot in C++.

That was also a great book"},{"Title":"C How To Program 2ND Edition","review":"Ever the best book on C and programming in general... It tells you every single tiny detail as well as the big picture. I am an Electronic Engineer and had major difficulties in finding a book that gives the real engineering point of view in programming. This book alone made me a professional programmer. I had studied other books that makes you emeorize but this book alone gave me the whole thing about programming. It does not only teach you C but also a superb introduction to C++. I am waiting for these writers to release a book on MFC because I have studies many book with not a bit of information valuable. Wherever I go, I take this book with me."},{"Title":"C How To Program 2ND Edition","review":"When I was in college a few years back, this book was used in our introductory C course. I credit this book for teaching me the correct way of programming. I must confess that I devoted alot of time to the excercises given in the text, many of which I found extremely challenging. For those of you thinking about purchasing the book I strongly advise that you not skip the exercises at the end of each chapter.

Having used and purchased other C references, I have to say this book is outstanding!"},{"Title":"C How To Program 2ND Edition","review":"I love a book that is not afraid to slow down to actually teach you something. The authors have done everything successfully, from grouping the topics, to ordering the flow of the chapters, to the code itself. The tips and pitfalls provide sanity checks for common mistakes, and to the attentive reader should save lots of time.True, this book may not delve deeply into all the obscurities that C/C++ has to offer, but for its purposes as 1) a tutorial, 2) an introduction to programming, and 3) an accessible treatment of 95% of C/C++, it works! (It is probably advisable to avoid the abstruse 5% anyway.) I still reference this book occasionally, so it's an enduring text.Other books, such as the 21 Days series, gloss over the details and give the reader the false notion s/he has achieved some sort of quick mastery. Afterwards, you may as well throw it out because it is useful only once. On the other end of the spectrum, is the C++ Primer, written by Stanley Lippman. That text reeks of loftiness and obscurity. After you've programmed C/C++ for a few years, put that book on your shelf to impress others.But if you like learning and want to experience the fun that is C/C++ programming, go with Deitel &amp; Deitel."},{"Title":"C How To Program 2ND Edition","review":"I am currently using this book for my CS150 class at WSU. A very informative book to say the least but for those beginners out there I would recommend a book more oriented to beginner programmers. I will say that the only way I'm making it through this class is with the help of this book. Many examples, with just enough explanation and you should pick up the concepts in no time."},{"Title":"C How To Program 2ND Edition","review":"This book was designed to be a classroom text, and because of such it contains a great many exercises at the end of each chapter. Which is great for the 'classroom setting.' However, for the person who just buys this book off the shelf to learn on thier own, those exercises are virtually useless because the CD that contains the answers is only available to instructors. To me, this is about like selling someone a car without any tires. This is a great book, and I would have easily given it a 10, but because I'm trying to do this on my own and don't have access to the answers, I'm forced to give it a 5."},{"Title":"C How To Program 2ND Edition","review":"I first read this book during my first course on C programming. In my opinion, this is an excellent introductry book on the subject of programming, not necessary for C alone.It contains a lot of useful hints, pitfalls and common mistake people do in C programming or programming in general. These are necessary (in my opinion) in establishing a good programming practice, though it may not suit those who want a crash course on C programming, or who want to use it as a source of reference. I personally find the section on pointers very helpful.I recommend this book for beginners who really want to become a good programmer, not just programmer."},{"Title":"C How To Program 2ND Edition","review":"I have found this book quite excellent in that it uses clear and understandable language to preach a difficult programming language. I definitely never studied computer in my college(I got two BAs which now I usually find outdated in present 'technologized' world). The book is good, but it does not provide enough exercises with explainations! Many of the exercises are really time-consuming and frustrating, maybe not for classroom learners, but for a dedicated self-learner, it represents quite a bumpy journey. Anyhow, I think I will carry on."},{"Title":"C How To Program 2ND Edition","review":"This is one of the few programming books I own that clearly explains the concepts of the language it's referring to. It explains each example and offers good programming ideas as well as common programming mistakes. Excellent if you wish to learn the important aspects of C without reading a great deal of arduous technical text."},{"Title":"C How To Program 2ND Edition","review":"I used this book to getting started with learning C programming. It's very good for the reasons: 1) the topics and illustrations are well organized; 2) it's very clear and unambiguous; 3) many complete examples and exercises. I really appreciate the last because the only way for someone to master a programming language is to read more and write more.However, merely reading this book can not make you an advanced C programmer. It just gives you very brief introductions on more advanced topics in Chapter 14, i.e. using command-line arguments, working with multiple source files et al. Moreover, as a book for C, I think this book includes too much information for C++, i.e. this book uses 40% total pages for C++.To conclusion. This is a good book for novices, but not for someone who needs advanced skills.

Do not be intimidated by its large size: the first 15 or so chapters are C-oriented, while chapters 16-21 delve into C++.

This book does a great job of explaining every detail of OOP and programming, starting the book off with the basics of computer programming. You don't need to have any programming experience in order to read this book. I was a little disappointed in the actual result of it's claim to teach both C *and* C++ in the same book. It had very little on how to use C-specific things, not even mentioning how to use printf(). Thsi book is also great for those of you who know C and want to learn C++.

Unlike most other authors of programming texts, Deitel &amp; son (and/or their editor) are capable of writing clear, informative standard English. They do not assume any prior programming knowledge. (Be aware that they more or less assume the reader is using a UNIX-based compiler without saying so, but this should not stop you from getting the book if you use a different OS.) One weakness that perhaps will be corrected in a future edition is they do not effectively introduce object-oriented features of C++ at the very beginning (although they do begin explaining the philosophy behind OOP from the start).

Before reading this book, I assumed that 99% of all homeless people were either drug addicts, alcoholics, or people with mental problems. Several ideas here really touched home. Living in DC for most of my life, I have been constantly surrounded by homeless people, and have noticed that each individual seems to come and go at an extraordinarily rapid rate. Joe Homeless explained that this is because most are dead within one to two years.A few questions remain unanswered by the author, however, that continue to burn in my mind. Why do homeless people not on drugs and who are mentally stable remain in the cities. It seems that it would be easy to find work in a McDonalds or related place if given one new pair of clothes and a brief opportunity to clean themselves. Also, the author continually stated that he only needed a place to get himself together for a few days before he could get back on his feet again. Yet, when he finally does recieve a welfare check and this opportunity, he does not find a job. Why not? It seems that there are plenty of temporary or full time positions for untrained workers. Perhaps this did not apply in the 1970s. I hope that the author has the opportunity to read this response and has the opportunity to reply. I really don't expect that many other people have read this socially important work."},{"Title":"My Life on the Street","review":"I found this book fascinating to read.

The first, \\"Feminist Fairy Tales for Young (and Old) Readers,\\" is the selection of stories you want to read aloud to your daughter or son. These stories have sophisticated subjects and good language, but no lengthy exposition of narrative that bogs down a reading out loud. Most set up admirable gender roles, but some, such as \\"Snow White,\\" are explicitly political, and can help you raise good activists.The second section, \\"Feminist Fairy Tales for Old (and Young) Readers,\\" is comprised of more structurally complex stories that invite a silent reader to take time and try to swallow them. Though intended for adult readers, literate children can follow them, and for the most part should be encouraged to do so early and often. Sex roles and social station dominate these stories, but we get glimpses of how these issues are impacted by war, work, and more.The third section, \\"Feminist Literary Criticism,\\" is pretty slow-moving. Most of us are already familiar with the idea that fairy tales have detrimental effects on our children, especially our daughters, and while we may be briefly interested in a scholarly explanation of why this is so, the common reader won't get as much good out of this part as the previous two.Educator, writer, and scholar Jack Zipes has compiled here an excellent antidote to the stultifying fairy tales that molded the minds of most of us when we were young.

The stories captivated me then for their ability to lead my mind into another land more fantastical than my own. Later in life, re-reading this book i was compelled by the issues, thoughts and questions Zipes raised in my mind. It is not feminism that kills you with its anger, it is feminism that makes you think. Sometimes whimsical, sometimes daring, and sometimes blatant, it always stands there to be read and re-read. A constant delight."},{"Title":"Don't Bet on the Prince: Contemporary Feminist Fairy Tales in North America and England","review":"This is such an amazing book. It's part of what lead me into my research into looking at strong female characters in folk tales. This book is a must for people who don't want to read stories about wishy washy princesses waiting for the prince, and scholars alike. I reccomend this book highly."},{"Title":"Don't Bet on the Prince: Contemporary Feminist Fairy Tales in North America and England","review":"In three sections (following a lengthy introduction), editor Zipes compiles three revised, purportedly feminist takes on traditional fairy tales: Feminist Fairy Tales for Young (and Old) Readers and for Old (and Young) Readers, 17 modern fairy tales from authors like Tanith Lee, Jane Yolen, and Anne Sexton among others, and four pieces of feminist literary criticism on fairy tales. That a work purports to be feminist, however, does not necessarily make it so. Or, rather, a work can claim to be feminist, can aim to be feminist, and still fall short of the mark--as is the case here. First, it's Zipes that drags down the anthology. In his overlong introduction and concluding critical essay, he's given to cumbersome academic dialog and bold leaps of reasoning, a tendency towards form (in place of content) which makes for inscrutable, unsubstantiated arguments. Those arguments are promising, but they beg clearer, more thorough address. The anthology's second weakness is the stories themselves. There are some gems--most provided by the authors mentioned above, and Carter's \\"The Donkey Prince\\" and Atwood's \\"Bluebeard's Egg\\" also appear on my list of favorites. But there are many stories which fail to push their feminist premises far enough, leaving them open to worrying commentary.\\"In none of these tales is marriage a necessity or a goal for young women, rather it is a possibility which may or may not enter their plans. [...] In addition, the lives and careers of the young women are not telologically [sic] shaped by marriage (17),\\" writes Zipes in his introduction, yet in a surprising number of Prince's stories marriage is presumed--and in more, female energy is focused on male figures, roles, and relationships. The stories that don't fulfill heteronormative goals of romance, marriage, and childbirth often focus on that failure, mourning the sense of loss that accompanies it. For a purportedly feminist anthology, Prince has a surprisingly strong focus on men (even in the title!), and heteronormative standards are nearly inviolate. Perhaps I aim too high (and take too modern an approach) when I wish that Prince didn't constrain its feminism to heteronormative obligate male/female relationships; the fact that it does not, however, makes it limited in scope and depth. And then there's de Larrabeiti's story \\"Malagan and the Lady of Rascas,\\" in which a husband has his wife made grotesque to force her to remain faithful, and when she does for many years remain faithful--and good, patient, and forgiving--he learns to be a decent human being. A story where men make decisions, women survive ill treatment without complaint or agency, and men reap the rewards of the experience is not feminist--certainly not feminist enough to fit a collection that totes the word so boldly on its cover.Prince is not all bad--many stories are second rate (not just because of their feminist content, but because they are too far divorced from their source material to be effective retellings), Zipes is a constant irritation, but the other essays are thoughtful (if dated and brief) and there are some intriguing stories in the collection. But the volume aims to be more than this, and it's a lofty goal; that it fails to reach that goal makes it a disappointment. There are better feminist takes on fairy tales out there, even if they don't come in such proud packaging. I don't recommend this one."},{"Title":"Don't Bet on the Prince: Contemporary Feminist Fairy Tales in North America and England","review":"The book tells feminist fairy stories that are gentle with the guys too. Jack Zipes, the editor is, after all, a man. I've used the book with students, grandchildren, fellow feminists - all to a warm welcome. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Don't Bet on the Prince: Contemporary Feminist Fairy Tales in North America and England","review":"this is an excellent book.

I rarely write Amazon reviews and the few reviews I have written are related to a completely different genre of book. Plus, I've only recently taken a renewed interest in being in the kitchen - I don't suppose that makes me an \\"expert\\" by any stretch of the imagination.But I wanted to share my opinion of this book with other readers. It's fantastic and the recipes are delicious.Never before have I enjoyed a cookbook so much. Reading through the table of contents was enough to get my palate fired up. At the time of this writing, I've created over a dozen of the recipes in this book, and each one is a sure winner, not one is a reject. I might have tried more recipes by now, but the temptation to go back to a dish I've already tried is just too great. (We've done the Coconut Tofu with Sweet Chili Dipping sauce four times, now.)How about a really wonderful Portobello Wellington with Madeira Sauce? Now THAT was a Thanksgiving dinner! Yam and Mushroom Enchiladas with Smoky Tomato Sauce? Spinach, Mushroom, and Gorgonzola in Puff Pastry with Red Pepper Coulis? Despite what I - a carnivore - have always thought, vegetarian cooking can be great. That's a claim I've never been able to make regarding any other vegetarian or vegan cookbook.The book is extremely well laid out with timing suggestions, \\"prepare ahead\\" ideas, and handy tips for getting through the process without any unexpected surprises. Each recipe is preceded by a good description that makes you want to try it immediately. If a recipe has multiple components, each is presented as a logical and timed subsection of the overall plate.I only wish I knew about this restaurant when I visited Seattle last year. Next time... next time.Five Stars for the book that got me back into the kitchen after a long hiatus. Feel free to contact me with any questions, but I'll be busy cooking up the next Flora meal.~R~"},{"Title":"Cafe Flora Cookbook","review":"Chiming in to agree that this is terrific modern, gourmet food. Well flavored but not fussy. Everything I've made so far has come out perfectly. I've learned new flavor combinations that work well together, and I feel like I can put that information to use when I cook other things.There are plenty of vegan choices, and these recipes are all marked in the table of contents. There are no dessert recipes. Sections are starters, soups, salads, dinners/suppers, pizza, sandwiches, brunch, beverages, side dishes, sauces/spreads. They list sources for some ingredients (like arame, miso or fenugreek) and often give you an easier to locate alternative.For recipes that require a number of steps, they've been extremely organized about breaking it down into manageable sections. There are number of fairly involved recipes mixed in with easier things like pizzas (their herb pizza dough is spot on), but the results of the more time consuming recipes are well worth it. Besides, I have enough of those \\"veg. meals in minutes\\" type books for quickie meals. Cafe Flora is something else altogether - elegant and original vegetarian recipes that have broadened my cooking horizons."},{"Title":"Cafe Flora Cookbook","review":"For almost 15 years, the most popular dish I've served to friends and taken to potlucks has been one cut from a magazine and attributed to Cafe Flora. Knowing this dish appealed to both vegetarians and non, I would periodically check to see if there was an entire Cafe Flora cookbook \\"out there\\". Then, just before a spate of seasonal visitors were scheduled to descend, I googled up what is now my most used and reliable partner in terms of taste, nutrition and dependable results. I ended up amazoning another one to a vegetarian family member who, like me, is always trying to bridge the tastebuds of meateaters and veggers. And, the recipes are FUN to make."},{"Title":"Cafe Flora Cookbook","review":"By the time I die, I will have cooked every recipe out of this cookbook. I am in love. Everytime I decide to cook from this book, I start drooling and get really excited in anticipation. I always use this book for company and it never fails. Yes, the recipes are involved. There are some that aren't so much, but for complex flavor, expect to work a little. It's completely worth it. I've made yam quesadillas w. cilantro pesto, coconut tofu with sweet chile dipping sauce, lentil pecan pate, smoky split pea soup, ceasar salad w. herbed croutons & fried capers, soba salad with spicy peanut sauce and vegetables (best peanut sauce recipe to date), wasabi potato salad, the house balsamic vinagrette (a go to!) & the dijon curry vinagrette (YUM with apples on your salad!!!), mac & cheese, roasted vegetables vindaloo, pumpkin enchiladas with roasted tomatillo sauce, english pea pancakes with colorful vegetable saute and basil butter, black eyed pea fritters w. spiced coconut sauce and tumeric basmati rice (WOW!), spinach mushroon, & gorgonzola puff pastry rolls w. roasted red pepper coulis, portobello wellingtons w. madeira sauce (BEST BIRTHDAY DINNER!), fried green tomato sandwich, falafel, baba ghanouj, nutburger w. tomato jam (go to sauce for all burgers!), chickpea and roasted yam wrap with tahini sauce, asparagus tarragon scramble w. sundried tomato aioli (BEST AIOLI EVER!), wild mushroom scramble, tofu scramble w. fu sauce, hoppin john fritters w. cajun aioli, rosemary roasted potatoes, soy sausage (will never buy veggie sausage again!), and lavendar nectar. That's not even scratching the surface-I still have a long way to go to meet my goal of making everything from this cookbook. You should too!"},{"Title":"Cafe Flora Cookbook","review":"The recipes in the book are really something of a revelation to me. I live in Seattle and have dined at Caf&eacute; Flora dozens of times. Still I didn't really expect what I found in the cookbook. In addition to signature recipes the book presents a very well thought out structured approach to vegetarian gourmet cooking. So not only do you have recipes, but you are given a pretty good idea of what sorts of things you should make in batches on weekends and save. That for me was really the key to being able to make something other than bland vegetarian fare.I've not generally been fond of the Moosewood or Laurel's Kitchen sort of recipes. They generally seem unelegant, a bit off, and mostly dull. The recipes in this book are in fact quite elegant, well honed, and exciting. Combinations like balsamic-fig reduction and gorgonzola will have you planning week of dining around the book."},{"Title":"Cafe Flora Cookbook","review":"We have had the opportunity to dine at the Cafe Flora on a recent trip to Seattle. As vegetarians, we find it difficult at times to find restaurants that serve outstanding vegetarian/vegan meals. We were certainly impressed with Cafe Flora and were delighted to find their cookbook online. Since receiving the book, I have prepared a number of the dishes and they have turned out very well.It is nice that the book provides recipes for the complete meal and not just singular recipes that you then have to integrate with other items. The Cafe Flora meals are well rounded and each dish complements the other. I'm looking forward to hosting many parties for our carnivorous friends to show them that vegetarian dining can be a fine experience. They have sampled my earlier, meat-laden creations so this will come as a very pleasant surprise thanks to these recipes.The one thing about gourmet vegetarian cooking is that it can be technique and ingredient challenging. I have been cooking for many years so most of the tasks are not that difficult, but are time consuming. This book is probably not for the truly inexperienced cook nor for those that can't acquire many of the ingredients. If you have the skills, time and availability of ingredients, this book is fantastic!"},{"Title":"Cafe Flora Cookbook","review":"So far I have made three recipes from this cookbook and they all turned out great. Most of the recipes seem very simple, no unusual ingredients which helps since I am living in Alaska. I see this becoming a staple of my everyday cooking."},{"Title":"Cafe Flora Cookbook","review":"but I love the Cafe! This book is so helpful. Living in the northwest I find it very easy to obtain all of the ingredients in this book. They give so much more than just the recipe but tips on what you can do the day and even days before. They tell you when to start dishes, what can go wrong and how to fix it. The recipes are delicious, approchable and easy to follow."},{"Title":"Cafe Flora Cookbook","review":"The Cafe Flora Cookbook is different than other vegetarian cookbooks, in my opinion, in that these are the recipes you want to go to when you are entertaining. To put this in perspective - the Moosewood Cookbooks, for example, are for delicious home cooking that are great for casual get togethers, weeknight dinners, and family meals. The Cafe Flora Cookbook is what you want to refer to when you are having a dinner party that includes vegetarians and meat eaters. The dishes are all absolutely delicious and look wonderful. These are restaurant-quality dishes (they are from the Cafe Flora restaurant), obviously. Some of the recipes are pretty time consuming, but it's worth it to know you will end up with something that everyone will love and you can prepare many things ahead of time. There are also many vegan and wheat-free recipes, which are always good to have when trying to satisfy a crowd.The cookbook starts with a great appetizer section, and then moves on to salads/soups, and then entrees. They also have a section on other things like sauces and pantry items. The dressings and sauces are excellent. When you are planning for a holiday like Thanksgiving or Christmas, take some recipes from this book!Again, every single thing I have made from this cookbook has been outstanding. It's my favorite cookbook for guest-worthy vegetarian food, and I must have at least 50 other vegetarian cookbooks. I would be lost without this one. I was lucky enough to receive this as a gift. After making some of the recipes, I bought copies for all of my friends (vegetarian and not!). Highly highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cafe Flora Cookbook","review":"I love to dine at Cafe Flora in Seattle so I was excited to see they had a cookbook. I was not disappointed with this cookbook.

I think it is time to get a button with \\"I want my money back\\" sign.The paper edition is wonderful though! Great collection for entertainment and just family dinners."},{"Title":"Cafe Flora Cookbook","review":"What I like about this cook book is that recipes are truly delicious. The end product is always amazingly flavorful. If I were basing this review only on how delicious the meals were, I'd give this book 5 stars.The problem for me is how complicated some of the recipes are. Take, for instance, the Spicy Tofu Ruben. It is delicious. I could have it several times a week. But the directions for the recipe span 3 pages. The first time I started this recipe, it took about 4 hours to complete. There is pressing the tofu, marinating the tofu, baking the tofu. There is roasting of squash and onions. And there is smoking of mushrooms, with instructions on making your own smoker. There is toasting the bread in the oven and then baking the sandwich. It was incredibly time consuming. I wanted a quick, delicious sandwich, and lost an entire afternoon.Also, the book sometimes has ingredients that are actually recipes in a different place in the book. This is frustrating, because you now have to go to another page, get another set of ingredients out and begin a whole new recipe to complete the meal you're in the middle of.After the first time I made the Tofu Ruben, I did not open the book again for months.But, since the food is so delicious, and my hubby kept asking if we could have that delicious sandwich again, so I decided to have another go and see if I could make things easier, which broke down to two important steps: Reading the recipes all the way through, and cheating the ingredients.For example, the smoked mushrooms? I tossed some liquid smoke onto some mushrooms as I was sauteing them. Voila! The pressed, marinated, baked tofu? I bought the little tofu squares that were already baked and marinated, put the marinade on them and put it in the oven at the same time that I was roasting the vegetables. This is basically twice baking the tofu, but I actually found that this worked better than starting from the plain block of soy curd. The second time I made this recipe, it took about an hour, prep time included.I read the multiple small recipes to complete the sandwich all the way through, so I did not have to get the garlic out three separate times to chop it. I cut the prep and cook time down to 1 hour, which was much better.Definitely get this book - you will learn so much about flavor profiles and you will make some great food! Just don't allow yourself to get overwhelmed, like I did. Read the recipes through, and modify them if needed to suit your time table and the ingredients you have on hand. You will still make great food."},{"Title":"Cafe Flora Cookbook","review":"We love to eat at Cafe Flora, and the cookbook allows us to try out some of our favorite recipes at home.

The recipes are...involved. But, they are amazing. The directions are very clear and very concise. I have been a vegetarian only about 5 years. The one thing I noticed when switching was a lack of depth of flavor. The Portobello Wellingtons recipe was one of the first recipes I tried, not for the faint of heart. This is one complex recipe but the authors break it down into clear steps with tips on what can be done a day, or more ahead. The result? Awesome. Non-vegetarians I served it to thought it was great. This book is not for the quick meal but for when you really want to cook amazing food."},{"Title":"Cafe Flora Cookbook","review":"Love the eponymous Seattle restaurant. When I lived closer to the city, I went often: with friends for casual get-togethers, alone for a quick afternoon espresso and dessert pick-me-up; for boisterous Thanksgiving celebrations and baby showers with the girls, and to break up with 3-month boyfriends, because nothing soothes rejection like a signature Cafe Flora plate: fresh and light, yet sustaining. Honestly, I thought they were sort of cashing in with the cookbook, or that it would date quickly, as the restaurant cookbooks tend to do. Then a family friend gave me a copy, over ten years ago, and I made something from it; I think it was the Indian Chickpea Stew. I was hooked. On the preceding page, there was this amazing-looking red curry paste recipe, necessitating, at the time, a trek to Uwajimaya (the International District Asian grocery). Another winner. One fall, after chanterelle hunting in the local woods, I took their advice for smoking mushrooms in the oven, made the accompanying dish (split pea soup with the aforementioned mushrooms . . .), and suddenly I was having epiphanies. Corn stock? I can use that as a base for so many soups, chowders, even sauces or stir-fries. The drinks alone are worth the price of the book (today I 'm buying a copy for my Arlington CSA farmers, shipping free with Amazon Prime, for $17 in the late summer of 2012). My favorite of the several terrific beverages is the Cringer, a wildly popular riff on their famous, boldly-flavored rosemary-ginger lemonade. Once in awhile, I put the book away. I delve into another cookbook, but once I return to the Cafe Flora recipes, which I am learning from anew every time I crack it, the CFC reminds me that cooking isn't always about concepts like going organic and nutrient density ratings, or \\"know-your-farmer,\\" or 'my restaurant is more local than your restaurant.' Whenever I need a boost, whenever I need cooking to feel fun again, it becomes the only book on my shelf."},{"Title":"Cafe Flora Cookbook","review":"The mushroom lentil walnut recipe and mushroom pecan pate are two main staples that I use as bases for others.

(The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"This novel is said to contain the longest sentence in literature: 1,288 words. And the sentence is incomplete on top of that. This was perhaps Faulkner showing off. Despite all this, however, I love this novel, which is the story of Thomas Sutpen, a poor white in the pre Civil War South. Sutpen aspires to become part of the Slaveocracy that ruled the South. In his climb to building a 100-acre plantation that he calls Sutpen's Hundred, he commits many crimes against humanity, including denying his own children (Charles and Clytie) because they are of \\"mixed race.\\" The story of how Sutpen does this and the obstacles he encounters, and how he and his mansion meet their ends, is gripping."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Holy S#$%! This is incredible. Faulkner's prose here is on a totally different level from anything else I've read by him. The huge sentences that make up Absalom Absalom are some of the densest, strangest and headiest things I've ever read. My eyes were literally watering at several points from the bizarre, fevered intensity that he uses to show the sad old south. And God, how sad it is, the entire Sutpen family tree (which takes work to sort out, but not nearly as much work as The Sound and the Fury does, I think) is like a monolith of guilt, revenge, incest, miscegenation, failure and bitter destruction. Every character is just so incredibly, so intimately fleshed out. You feel the rhythms of their minds, of their hatreds, histories and vulnerabilities. The delirious time shifts are brilliantly layered, probably more so than in any other of the Faulkner I've read. Faulkner seems like he gets short shrift these days for whatever reason, which is too bad, because this alone feels to me like a cornerstone of modern American literature. The guy published this, 'The Sound and the Fury', 'As I Lay Dying' and 'Light in August' all within 7 years of each other. Look, lets be honest, most authors are lucky if they write one really strong, really stylistically and structurally innovative novel in their entire career. Faulkner whipped out four in under a decade. Four. This book makes me feel genuinely privileged as a speaker of the English language, that I get to read first hand something this rich and syntactically ambitious. Consider this line:\\"Perhaps he felt, now that the grandchildren had been discharged what with Henry away at the state university at Oxford and Judith gone even further than that- into that transition stage between childhood and womanhood were she was even more inaccessible to the grandfather of whom she had seen but little during her life and probably cared less anyway- that state where, though still visible, young girls appear as though seen through glass and where even the voice cannot reach them; where they exist (this the hoyden who could-and did- outrun and outclimb, and ride and fight both with and beside her brother) in a pearly lambence without shadows and themselves partaking of it; in nebulous suspension held, strange and unpredictable, even their very shapes fluid and delicate and without substance; not in themselves floating and seeking but merely waiting, parasitic and potent and serene, drawing to themselves without effort the post-genitive upon and about which to shape, flow into back, breast; bosom, flank, thigh.\\" (pg 67).Now THAT is one amazing, freaked out sentence. I cannot recommend Absalom Absalom highly enough."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"A peerless masterpiece, the greatest novel ever written. Not merely Faulkner's greatest novel, nor even just the greatest novel of the twentieth century, simply put the best of all time. I was nearly stammering when I finished it. It is a text so thick, so full of beauty that to describe it at all is daunting. The parallels to the cinematic masterpiece Citizen Kane are numerous, and this novel was in fact a major creative influence upon that work.First of all, Faulkner is always doing things like this:\\". . . and opposite Quentin, Miss Coldfield in the eternal black which she had worn for forty-three years now, whether for sister, father, or nothusband none knew, sitting so bolt upright in the straight hard chair that was so tall for her that her legs hung straight and rigid as if she had iron shinbones and ankles, clear of the floor with that air of impotent and static rage like children's feet, and talking in that grim haggard amazed voice until at last listening would renege and hearing-sense self-confound and the long-dead object of her impotent yet indomitable frustration would appear, as though by outraged recapitulation evoked, quiet inattentive and harmless, out of the biding and dreamy and victorious dust. Her voice would not cease, it would just vanish.\\"or things like this:\\"We have a few old mouth-to-mouth tales, we exhume from old trunks and boxes and drawers letters without salutation or signature, in which men and women who once lived and breathed are now merely initials or nicknames out of some now incomprehensible affection which sound to us like Sanskrit or Chocktaw; we see dimly people, the people in whose living blood and seed we ourselves lay dormant and waiting, in this shadowy attenation of time possessing now heroic proportions, performing their acts of simple passion and simple violence, impervious to time and inexplicable...\\"This narrative is relentless, it is a constantly roiling spiral, one that keeps picking up and dropping off details and elements as it grows wider. There is a submission to the narrative that must occur, similar, but much more difficult, to the submission required to get through the opening 50-60 pages of As I Lay Dying, except that this one takes about 200 pages to settle in fully, and instead of confusion, every moment of the reading is stunning and engaging up until that point, then after crossing into the rhythm and cadence and gaining fuller comprehension you are suddenly frightfully stuck with Quentin in the devastating heart of the South and Sutpen and Quentin and Caddy and the war and so many other pieces of this mosaic, this vast terrible mosaic Faulkner is finally able to fully articulate.Sutpen is the disease, he holds himself up as a mirror to his contemporaries without conscience, they in turn are disgusted by him, his nudity, his windowless mansion, yet they are fascinated by him, Sutpen is kept close, nearly from the start in one capacity or another to his southern gentlemen counterparts.Yet, this is a love story, as Salinger wrote in Franny and Zooey \\"pure and complicated\\" And in a sense I think that is the most important part, that these multi-page sentences, the spiraling plot, the description and re-description and re-description again of the very air surrounding the events of the story are the closest I have ever seen to being wholly purely, truly, complicated. It's as if his layering and re-layering and re-re-layering and his endlessly unfolding and stacking metaphors are the ONLY way for Quentin, and for us, the readers, to understand the South, and to understand Quentin's desperate self-loathing and destructiveness, and Caddy, and Henry and Bon and Judith and etc.As bleakly austere as the plot itself is, however, Faulkner's revolutionary narration provides the perfect atmosphere for its gloom. Most of the story is not observed first-hand, but rather related by characters who were in turn told the events by others. The main narrator is Quentin Compson (see The Sound and the Fury), who was originally told the story by his grandfather and others who knew Thomas Sutpen, now some decades dead, personally. Quentin is now recounting the tale for his college roommate, while adding his own conjectures as well. And this is the brilliance of Faulkner's narrative structure: by changing viewpoints and retelling the same scene from several angles, the subtle nuances of the various characters, both storytellers and subjects, are allowed to develop. Faulkner's adroit criticism of humanity is revealed just as fully in his characters' reaction to his story as in the story itself. The dense, sometimes stream-of-consciousness narration can sometimes make comprehension difficult, but the masterful prose deserves the extra attention.The challenging, haunting combination of story and storytelling yield an artistry unsurpassed. Faulkner truly understood humanity, and the tragedy it so often comes to. Here, in this memorable tale, he reflects our tragedies, histories, laments, regrets, sorrows, memories, lost and forgotten, a window into the dark pathos of the human soul."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Absalom, Absalom! is indisputably one of the two or three greatest American novels, and while, perhaps not as easy to read as that stuff by Nicholas Sparks, it's perfectly straightforward as long as your attention span hasn't been destroyed and you can still parse a sentence. But to talk about the difficulties of Faulkner's text, it seems to me, is to miss the point of the book itself. While the subject of the novel is Thomas Sutpen and his desire for an heir, the theme is the nature of time itself, as well as the arbitrary and perverse texture of memory, and the difficulty of arriving at some version of events that we can dignify by calling them \\"truth.\\" What Faulkner achieves in this novel is a peculiarly brilliant synthesis of form and content; to read the book is to engage in the very process the book describes--to take the shreds of history, to differentiate what is probably true from what is fantasy or myth, and to reweave the shreds. The novel has both the majesty and the inexorability of Greek tragedy, and as it reaches its final pages, the hair will stand up on the back of your neck. I first read this as a college student in the 60's, and neither the book nor my reading it has ever left me. It remains one of the great experiences of my life."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"There exists among humanity a small number of men who feel themselves born into the wrong circumstances. Smaller still are the number who ever articulate what the circumstances they wish to live in would be. The people who attempt to live out Rilke's dicta: \\"You must change you life,\\" are utterly frightening in their ability to do anything that they please or feel necessary in the pursuit of their goal. Thomas Sutpen is one of these men. If there really are only two types of people on earth, masters and slaves, than he is so completely a master that all of us who do not consider ourselves the same should tremble at the fact that men and women like Thomas Sutpen still walk in the streets and on the farms and in the foot hills of America.But Thomas Sutpen is only one aspect of what Faulkner is trying to tackle in \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" Through the very frustrating, but ultimately rewarding, technique of having different characters in the story retell and retell and the story of Thomas Sutpen and the implosion of his family at the close of the Civil War, Faulkner is able to paint a picture of the south that is on par with the great classical tragedies and the old testament chronicles that gave this book its title.For Thomas Sutpen and his family the great tragedy of his life are those all to American self-imposed problem of slavery and also of race. Especially race. The genius of Faulkner is that he is able to show just how warped the actions of his characters become when race is made a factor in their relationships--some are able to accept incest more readily than black men having sexual relations with white women. There is an overwhelmingly psychosis about race that underlies nearly every action taken by all the characters in this book; ultimately it annhilates all of them from the world and leaves them only in the realms of history, folklore and legend.I have written only in the most vague generalities about this book and I do not apologize. The best part of the experience of reading this book comes with slowly piecing together one coherent story out of the several narratives. After reading the same things with only the slightest, but incredibly significant, variations over and over again I had more \\"eureka!\\" moments than I had reading a dozen mystery novels. Faulkner is able to give his readers a view of a fragmented world that is much more like our own than the more coherent story telling that is the usual province of fiction. What is gained by being forced to wrap your mind around vernacular, non-linear, and very often ungrammatical story telling, is beyond my powers of description. This is a story that is meant to be mulled over and thought about, so do not fear having to reread it."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Having read the other reviews, I found I made a big mistake - Absalom Absalom was the first William Faulkner book I had read.But--I prepared thoroughly for my reading of this classic by studying a brief outline of the book but excluding that information would give away any of the intricate threads that Faulkner wove throughout the book. Then, while reading I imagined either Shelby Foote or the woman who narrated To Kill a Mockingbird with their southern accent reading the novel to me. Doing this, I was able to have a mind set for the stream of conscienceness in which Faulkner wrote.By doing all this, I enjoyed this book immensely. It is a tightly woven fable of the rise and fall of a demon-man, his children, and the betrayal of the family along with the rise and fall of the Southern plantation system. It also is a better novel than the early Uncle Tom's Cabin in it's denunciation of slavery."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"I consider ABSALOM ABSALOM to be Faulkner's greatest work. This heavily experimental novel is difficult to read but the technical virtousity is so impressve and combined with the compelling stories of the decline of the Supten family and the narrator.Quentin Compson,and his own insecurities and obsessiveness of the decline of his own family make it an intense and pignant read.The Suptens and,by implication, the Compsons are symbols of a dcadent deterioratng old rural south that cannot relate to the changes the modern world forces upon them. This is one of a small list of truly great American novels."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"There is no question that this is one of Faulkner's greatest and most challenging books. Faulkner's symbolic and engaging story of the rise and fall of Thomas Sutpen (representing the rise and fall of the old South) is an absolutely fascinating read. Similar to The Sound and the Fury, the story is summed up in the first chapter, leaving the reader both confused and curious to find out more. I would definitely recommend the re-reading of chapter 1 upon completion of the book to bring it all together. And for those who just want to sit back and dully rea through a book, you may wnat to ignore this one. This is for the reading hobbyist who is up for both a challenge and an emotional reading experience. Having completed the book 3 days ago, I am unable to get it out of my mind. It is that powerful!"},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"I am a big Faulkner fan, and have read many of his novels and short stories. I can still remember reading Absalom, Absalom! for the first time, and how much I was moved by this epic story and Faulkner's prose. Even today, 10 years later, I can still vividly recall where I was when I finished reading Absalom, Absalom! for the first time. I envy those who haven't yet experienced this book, but soon will. Like most of Faulkner's novels, this is not an easy read, but well worth the time and effort. I think this book and Light in August are two of the greatest American novels of the 20th century. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"This book -is- a difficult undertaking, but it's not meant to be that way. The key is patience. Some things aren't meant to be understood until maybe 200 pages after they're first mentioned. If you don't understand something when you first read it, don't think it's -your- fault, you're probably not meant to understand it just yet. This really is a fantastic book, different from any other book I've ever read. It totally changed my view on writing, and what quality writing is."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Albeit a strong assertion, this book is among the most brilliant works in English... ever. I have read it for pleasure as well as for a graduate-level course, could read it another dozen times before I die. It's not appropriate for anyone's first Faulkner, ahem, most likely, as it is a prequel of sorts to the likewise fantastic _The_Sound_And_The_Fury_ (a complex and absorbing saga as well). It is a challenging read and best consumed when the palate is somewhat attuned to the conventions of Faulkner's other work: Y-- County [I still don't even try to spell it.], the cultural and psychological topography of the American South, family history and Civil War and Reconstruction--eccentric characters and epic, labyrinthine skeletal closets. Even if you've never read Faulkner in particular, it will certainly offer plenty, though it might take some time to understand how everything you see as a breathtakingly rendered detail likely refers to something huge that has happened or will happen. But get it and read it no matter--start with another one if it doesn't work for you, then come back to it.As an engaging novel, this book delivers. The language is rich with a seldom-rivaled vocabulary and a knack for tangible descriptions. The characters and plot are complex and the stuff of novels. As with other novels, there's more than you can digest, so you get lost in whatever you follow easily, turning back to earlier chapters when you get interested in something you weren't paying attention to before. Characters whose imposing shadows loomed over SF are here, and those whose tragedies consumed your attention in SF are supporting players in a sense. The result of reading both of these is an appreciation for every supporting character's story. No matter where you are in your appreciation of Faulkner, you will appreciate the fabric of the book, rich in texture and detail.Those reviews that deal with the plot are guaranteed to leave something out. The words and writing are critically acclaimed since your parents were in school. The examples of how a war can raze an entire culture's edifice of identity are compelling, each person's doom and curse being common among her kin and her countrymen: ghosts and sex and violence and cruelty, gut wrenching drama to challenge any soap opera or miniseries or movie. There are themes and studies aplenty within the nightmare realm of Faulkner's masterpiece."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"The rich tapestry Faulkner has weaved in &quot;Absalom&quot; is a delight in reading experience. Personally, not being an American ( let alone Southerner ), and living in an European &quot;racially pure&quot; ( more or less ) state, I nevertheless find this novel astonishingly universal, touching and powerful.The story on miscegenation, fratricide, struggle for recognition and &quot;respectability&quot;, divided loyalties and above and behind everything, fatality cannot fail to impress anyone susceptible to &quot;eternal verities&quot; of the heart.Apart from being a master of the craft ( the torrent of words hypnotizes &amp; swamps even a cautious reader ), Faulkner clearly possessed a rare quality of temper, mind, disposition- whatever. It is a sense of fatality, destiny- something that places him a bit apart from the 19/20th cent. writers &amp; puts him in company of ancient Egyptian, Hebrew, and, most likely, Hellenic authors. The intonation of &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; is curiously similar to that of the Hebrew Bible ( the title is not the only signifier ) &amp; Aeschylus or Euripides. Heimarmene/destiny that squashes the Sutpen family, hubris of old Tom, incestual hamartia/sin...all this reveals mythic mindset.While Joyce and Thomas Mann deliberately tried to construct elaborate mythically inspired narrative structures, Faulkner's archetypal story, redressed in antebellum South ( horse carriages, parasols &amp; all that jazz ), directly leapt from mythic times of ancient Greece and Middle East to commune with ethical core of our beings those timeless verities of heart in conflict with itself."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"This was an incredibly difficult,complex novel. I had no idea what I was getting into when I started it, my only previous Faulkner experience being The Sound and the Fury.Reading this novel is much like walking into and breaking up a fight: you don't know why people are fighting, but they are and you're thrown into the mix. Here, it is the Sutpens. At first, we hear of a drifter (Thomas Sutpen) riding into Jefferson, Miss. Miss Rosa is telling Quentin Compson about the Sutpen story, and it is obvious this woman despised this man who we really know nothing about. Through the course of the novel, Faulkner has various characters go over the story again and again, revealing more and more and essentially proving to the reader how little she/he really knows. What you think is one thing is actually quite another, quite more complex than you had even thought possible at the outset.The narrative structure here is very, very difficult. I found it hard (at times) to read more than a few pages in any sitting, but then something happened: I stumbled upon a new revelation and all of a sudden I was voracious again. Just when you're about to burn out, Faulkner throws fuel on the fire. Faulkner's long, serpentine sentences are often hard to follow, but just stick with him. Reading Faulkner is an experiment in trust: if you don't know something or can't figure something out, it's most likely because Faulkner doesn't want you to know yet.ALl in all, this novel is genius. I recommend it to anyone interested in modernism or just good literature in general."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"At the heart of this novel is the story of one man's attempt to make a place for himself in the class and race stratified society of the pre-Civil War South.Thomas Sutpen arrives in Faulkner's Yoknaphtawpha County with a wagon filled with slaves, a captive French architect and an endless supply of personal energy and determination. In his mind is a &quot;design&quot; which he intends to carry out. &quot;I had a design. To accomplish it I should require money, a house plantation, slaves, a family incidentally of course, a wife. I set out to acquire these, asking no favor of any man.&quot; Sutpen is more concerned with the status such a plantation could give him than with any wealth. His is a quest for respectability and social acceptance.While the heart of the novel is Sutpen, its emotional center is Quentin Compson, a Harvard student. Hailing from Yoknaphtawpha, Quentin's grandfather just happened to be Sutpen's only friend. It is Quentin who attempts to make sense of Sutpen's story, with help from his Canadian roommate, Shreve, and Sutpen's own son, Henry.Absalom, Absalom! is the story of the creation of the myth of Thomas Sutpen. The novel is told by a variety of narrators at a variety of times. Untangling these various narratives will be the primary difficulty for any reader, just as it is for Quentin and Shreve. Yet, it is the use of these varying, conflicting narratives that gives this novel its power. Were it told in a simple and linear style its tremendous emotional impact, coupled with the sense of a Faulkerian decaying South, would cause it to be far too melodramatic, perhaps even Gothic. There are, however, holes and spaces in this narrative that force the reader to participate in the anguish of its revelations.For most readers, Absalom, Absalom's greatest hurdle is that so much of what is related is only inferred or invented. Some critics have even gone so far as to say that many points of the narrative are, in fact, unknowable.As in many of Faulkner's novels, the key developments are introduced in bits and pieces, fragments, suppositions or brief glances. The reader is thus put into much the same position as Shreve, who remains somewhat of the skeptic, lacking Quentin's intimate connection to both the Sutpen saga and the old South.The thematic heart of the novel is mankind's ability to rewrite history and arrive at new truths. The reader must, therefore, avoid both Sutpen's and Quentin's mistakes. This is just a part of the genius of Faulkner. His novels, while not the most linear or the most accessible, allow both his characters and his readers, even modern ones, to discover new views and truths about life and mankind."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Faulkner is not for everyone, and this book is exhibit number one. I read half of it a year ago before going back and starting over, determined to finish it. I am certainly glad I did, and I will say without doubt I will read it several more times in my life, for this book is at the same time one of the most difficult I've ever read, and one of the most rewarding.First, the cons: vocabulary that continually drives you to a dictionary; long, run-on sentences, with digression piled on top of digression, parenthesis within parenthesis within parenthesis; multiple telling of the same story. The reading is not easy, in other words.But the pros: Faulkner is a master of \\"showing, not telling.\\" He writes poetry without line breaks. For example:** \\"a creature cloistered now by deliberate choice and still in the throes of enforced apprenticeship to, rather than voluntary or even acquiescent participation in, breathing\\"** \\"battles lost not alone because of superior numbers and failing ammunition and stores, but because of generals who should not have been generals, who were generals not through training in contemporary methods or aptitude for learning them, but by the divine right to say 'Go there' conferred upon them by an absolute caste system.\\"** \\"and maybe they never had time to talk about wounds and besides to talk about wounds in the Confederate army in 1865 would be like coal miners talking about soot.\\"From these three examples alone, one can see that it's unfair to say that Faulkner's book is one run-on sentence without any differentiation in style or voice. Instead, they show a mastery of language, which Faulkner admittedly gets a little carried away with from time to time, but generally uses much like we use our lungs - without seeming to think about it.What is most striking about the book is the similarity it has to the human experience. Walter Allen said this is the book in which Faulkner \\"most profoundly and completely says what he has to say about . . . the human condition.\\" And what is that? That humans are weak and prone to lying, and more dangerously, prone to believing lies that are more comfortable than the truth. When we finish the book, we're still not sure about the details of the story. We don't know who twisted what in his/her narrative, and because the story is told from several points of view, we get conflicting interpretations from the characters about the meaning and cause of certain events. But as in real life, there's no omnipotent interpreter to sort everything out. Almost . . .\\"AA\\" is particularly engrossing in the final half. Just when you think you pretty much know Sutpen's story, Faulkner reveals yet another detail -- coincidence turns out to be anything but, ignornance is shown to be willful, and many other facets which can only be called \\"plot twists\\" fall into place in the final 100 pages, and though the prose is anything but easy, it's difficult to put the book down then.If you're not into \\"academic\\" books, stay away. If you're interested just in \\"a good yarn,\\" steer clear. If you want to see an impressive effort at capturing in writing the frustrating experience of being a fallible, limited human, give it a read."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Review Summary: Absalom, Absalom! is a book that you can easily underestimate. Your persistence will be rewarded with pleasure if you are patient, and assume that something magnificent will appear that is different from what you expect. The story is a cross between a Greek tragedy, King Lear, and the oral tradition of story-telling. As such, it strikes the deepest chords of human connection and ambition. The primary settings are Mississippi and the West Indies from the Antebellum period through Reconstruction and into the early 20th century. The themes touch deeply on Southern tradition, slavery, and social class. This is a challenging book to read, and will appeal primarily to those who like difficult books that are full of allusions. For most, having read other Faulkner novels will make this one easier to access and understand. As I Lay Dying is a good precursor for this novel.Reader Caution: A six-letter word beginning with &quot;n&quot; to describe people of Afro-American descent is used frequently in this book in ways that will offend many people. The use of the word is consistent with the beliefs and the historical moment of the characters who utter it, and does not reflect racist beliefs by the author.Review: Absalom, Absalom! is certainly one of America's greatest tragic novels. Thomas Sutpen arrives in Jefferson, Mississippi in middle age with a burning desire to establish a magnificent plantation and a dynasty with a leading role in society. To accomplish this, all he has available is his passion, a French architect, some slaves from Haiti, and a huge tract of land that he has somehow swindled out of the Native Americans. From the mud, his dream rises. But his very determination to accomplish his dream causes counterforces to rise that drag his dream into the mud again.The story is told in a most unusual fashion. Almost every major character's perspective is captured through the device of recounting prior conversations with other major characters. Most of the characters are missing major elements of the &quot;why&quot; of the story, so you need to keep adding the stories together to begin to understand what was happening beneath the surface. The book eventually relies on a conversation with a nonparticipant in the events to explore why they might have occurred, where no direct evidence is available. In this last regard, the book takes on a little of the mystery-solving tradition involving logic that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle used with Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. This conversation-reporting story-telling device makes the book both remarkably recursive and potentially maddening. If you are like me, you will wonder at times what else could possibly be covered in the book. And then, Faulkner pulls new dimensions to his story out of the hat.Faulkner's point is that we can almost always know &quot;what&quot; has happened in terms of major events, but without great investigation and thought we unlikely to ever understand the &quot;why.&quot; You come to appreciate this point by seeing your understanding of Sutpen's life change as you learn more about him and the events that preceded his arrival in Jefferson. I ultimately came away intrigued and inspired by the book's structure. You could easily have the opposite reaction.The book is a rich source of concepts and observations about the contradictions inherent in slavery and Southern notions of gentle behavior during the 18th and 19th centuries. You only find these contradictions as well laid out in Thomas Jefferson's writings and biographies.After you read this book, you should be in a good position to ask yourself some basic questions about what you are trying to accomplish with your personal life and your work. Are your goals any more worthy than Sutpen's? What dangers are you exposed to as a result of having this focus? In what ways are you an innocent in your pursuits?In seeking respect and esteem, remember to give it to others even more generously!"},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Don't be afraid of Faulkner. This is the story of the young Quentin Compson, a young southerner attending Harvard who is absorbed the history of the South, specifically the decaying remains of Sutpen's Hundred, a massive Mississippi plantation fallen into physical and moral ruin. As Faulkner is wont to do, the book can be challenging with multiple narrators, points of view and a shifting narrative. Or, another way to look at the brilliant novel is to consider it a puzzle that rewards the attentive, patient reader. Faulkner presents some wonderful fragments of a story and asks that the reader help in the reconstruction of a grand, tragic American tale."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"This is a dark, convoluted, complex novel written in a stream of consciousness text that can easily confuse and scare the casual reader away. For the serious reader who is willing to put the time and effort into this work of art you will not be let down. First, however, you must read The Sound and the Fury (SAF). If you work your way through that novel and you \\"get it\\" and love it, then Absalom is a absolute must. But be prepared. T.S. Eliot once said of the book that it communicates before it is understood. Typical Faulkner. It takes some fortitude and a little background. Let me help with a little background. For starters, The title comes from an the Old Testament (2 Samuel 13). Absalom, one of David's sons kills his brother Amnon for raping their sister Tamar. Hence the title and a clue. The book is full of clues and in a sense can be taken by the reader as detective story full of mystery and revenge, suspense and gothic drama. This is the story of Southern tradgedy and the fall of the House of Sutpen. The central character is Thomas Sutpen who is the fountainhead of the southern, self-reliant man seeking to reach the American dream through creating a grand design of dynasty. To pass his dynasty on to his eldest legitimate son is part of the design and part its downfall. The story takes place before, during, and after the Civil War and issues such as race, miscegenation, class, economy, worker's rights, women's rights are all spun into the story that is a portrait of Southern realism. The story is told by four narrators: Quentin Compson (from SAF), Quentin's father, Quentin's roomate Shreve, and Miss Rosa Coldfield. Quentin however is the central narrator and by reading SAF one can better understand the issues facing Quentin and the reason he struggles so much with this story. Absalom is very much the story of Quentin's hatred for the bad qualities in the southern country that he loves. Much of the story as told by Quentin and Shreve is purely imaginative construction of what could have been as they speculate on the enigmatic drama that unfolds. In the back of the book is a genealogy and chronology which is extremely helpful as the story often jumps from one time period to another and from one character to another. Work on keeping it straight and reread if necessary. The book doesn't get any easier as it moves toward the conclusion. Do trust Faulkner. If you pay attention, he pulls it together and you will discover why this novel is, in my opinion, the greatest American novel of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"I've read all of Faulkner's work and I truly believe that those who find 'Absalom' hard to comprehend should start by first reading 'The Unvanquished'. It gives one a more comfortable, easier and firmer foothold in Yoknapatawpha County so that when &quot;Absalom, Absalom&quot; is read, one will better understand what the author is telling us....how it felt to BE southern at Quentin's time. All the promise and past glory, all the self-destruction and inner demise is there. &quot;Intruder in the Dust&quot; should be the third book to be read. Those three give you a priceless inside track into the works of Faulkner. His short stories, &quot;A Rose for Emily&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow&quot; show both sides of the southern social strata. These stories are both masterpieces yet easy for the new Faulkner reader to appreciate. Although &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; is used in many colleges as an introduction to Faulkner, I feel that choice is not good. That particular book, although popular with many, was far from his best work. His style went awry there, in my opinion. The heaviness of the dialect and the time in which the story took place is no way to introduce anyone to this marvelous writer.But of his complete body of work, &quot;Absalom, Absalom&quot; is the magnificent star and nobody should deny themselves the opportunity of reading this great contribution to American literature."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom!

It is both troubling and satisfying. The level of literary intensity and imagination is extraordinary. Faulkner's gives a great look into the depths of the human heart. This is not an easy book to read and understand. The book teaches much on love. It also teaches much on hate. You see much about the racial struggle of that period.

It is the story of Thomas Stupen and how he builds his 'design' and how it affects the people, who has the misfortune, of being sired by him or perceived as a tool or an obstacle. Fulfilling his 'design' is his reason for living, and it is sheer irony that what he believes will hamper his 'design' is the very thing that survives his building of it.

If someone likes one of his books they say it is because they are \\"literary\\", \\"university educated\\" and probably lying to save face. Ridiculous! I don't know what \\"literary\\" means, have never been to any university, except to watch a football game, went to a small hick high school in which I was never encouraged to read a classic book, and work blue collar, menial jobs and drive a dirty pickup truck. None of my jackets have patches on the elbows, nor do I smoke a pipe, yet Faulkner is my favorite writer of all time. I enjoy the hard work required to fully mine his novels vast treasure, but do not hopelessly fail to grasp what is going on in any of his books. Maybe its because I am from the deep south, live only a couple of hours from Oxford and even have an uncle who lives in Caledonia, which is mentioned a few times in Faulkners books. The tragic stories of the declining South Faulkner builds his novels around are highly relatable to me. Never in a million years did I think I would ever be lumped in with \\"snobbish\\" university professors because I love to read Faulkner AND ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND HIS BOOKS. I can assure those people would think very little of the likes of me. And isn't strange that someone would say you like a book because you are too smart? That is an insult I have never recieved (nor have I recieved that as a compliment before) yet I welcome it.Now, i guess I should say something about Absalom. What a mega book! This novel plays leap frog with Sanctuary for the place of my second favorite Faulkner book. Oh, wait, I forgot about Light in August! No! As I Lay Dying! Well, at least the Sound and the Fury is secure in first place. Don't listen to the naysayers. The positive reviews will both help you in understanding the style of Faulkner as will as discerning if he is your cup of tea. If he is not it is NOT because you are uneducated or not \\"literary\\" whatever that means."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"After the death of the three great tragedians of the fifth century B.C.E., the comic dramatist Aristophanes wrote a fantasy called &quot;The Frogs&quot; in which Euripides and Aeschylus appear before the god Dionysus to decide which shall return. For a peer to this Faulkner, we want Aeschylus brought back (as we should want Faulkner brought back). Aeschylus's difficult Greek verse and Faulkner's dense English prose may dismay the reader at first, but both have their purpose and eventually catch the reader up. You should read this Aeschylean novel."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"This is one of the great classics of American literature although it can be a struggle at times to work through. However, the work is well worth it. There are a thousand interwoven themes in this book, and the texture is achieved entirely through the personal memories and speculations of the (relatively few) characters about each other. The major themes and approaches to this book include: the death of pre-Civil War southern culture and its continued haunting of the people who lived on afterward, the ever-present issue of race, slavery and racial inter-mixing (a Faulkner favorite) and the social dysfunction accompanying them, the southern sense of bearing a unique historical burden/curse following the Civil War, and much more. Faulkner's unique style requires getting used to, but it is an awesome vehicle for the complexity he seeks to convey. For those who are interested in this aspect, the most exciting points are where the language becomes so frenzied that distinction between prose and poetry break down. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"this book is terrible. I finished reading 2 chapters and didn't have a clue what I read. In addition, the beginning was one long, very long, run on sentence. People in my discussion group were very upset when they tried to read this. Most of us are college graduates, many with advanced degrees. Yet we could not plow through this book. Disappointed, because I have read other books by William Faulkner."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"I've been working my way through many of the classics of literature and finally came to Faulkner and picked this book since it was on several lists of great works. I've found that early 20th century literature has been hit and miss for me, since sometimes the style is what gets the book on a list over substance. In this case, I found both.The style was very unique and at first I found it to be annoying, but as I got into the book, I could see that it made for a worthwhile experience. The narration goes back and forth in time and through different narrators. In essence the story is told many times, but each time giving more details and different perspectives.It ended up being a lesson to me in how there are always many sides to a story. A good example would be listening to the radically different sides of couple you know going through an ugly divorce. Piecing the whole story together is a challenge. In this case I was able to eventually gain empathy for almost all of the major characters in the story.It also gave me a good look and feel for the pre and post civil war south. I continue to have appreciation for the major problems associated with slavery. I'm so glad I didn't live at that time and place.I can recommend this book for those with an interest in literature and patience to plow through the book. It does end up being rewarding, but takes some time. It is not something that would work for the average casual reader."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"My title is controversial, I'll admit, but after close consideration of the other major candidates (and I don't exclude great novels that have come to be considered unworthy of academic \\"canonization\\"), and after teaching it (or attempting to) on three separate occasions, this is not only the Faulkner work but the single American novel that remains in tenaciously ensconced in consciousness, continually vibrant, informing the reader about him or herself as well as American history past and present. But even on the two occasions when I taught a class that \\"seemed\\" incapable of staying the course, students continued to remain attentive, practically insisting I tell them the story through a teacher's \\"translation.\\" Also, Faulkner's short story \\"Wash\\" can be very useful in conveying the fate of Thomas Sutpen in concise, clear terms that do no serious injury to Faulkner's narrative idea and thematic purpose, especially in the novel's last half. The following analysis is necessarily dense and a trifle abstruse, at least initially, for an author whose primary \\"ostensible\\" subjects are language and race, but if the reader simply approaches the story as a good yarn--perhaps with the aid of a bare-bones break-down or outline at her side-the novel should prove highly accessible--admittedly difficult at times, but it's an \\"earned difficulty,\\" repaying the reader many times over for the investment of time and work (I've never subscribed to the notion that reading literature has to be \\"fun.\\" Moreover, it's hard for me to believe that those readers who complain about the \\"Absalom's\\" difficulty have as yet tackled the work most often used to represent Faulkner--\\"The Sound and the Fury.\\")As physical beings we exist in that spatial-temporal order designated as \\"nature.\\" But as humans we also exist in an exclusive realm of \\"consciousness,\\" which might be described as a vast, collective energy field made up of the signs, i.e. \\"language,\\" by which we try to make sense of existence. This field is beyond the grasp of any of us, not only its vast and oceanic proportions but its dynamic, protean flow resisting ownership by a single instance of consciousness. Perhaps one individual has tapped into this immense reservoir more completely, directly, and vitally than any other--William Shakespeare. Who else even comes close to harnessing the stream and containing the flood long enough to permit the rest of us some sense of its unlimited potential?Despite the Bard's uniqueness as the fountainhead, the matrix, the mother of modern Western consciousness (I tend to agree with Harold Bloom's assessment on this point, at least), a handful of succeeding language-bearers have proven capable of tapping into the same source. In American literature, and certainly literature of the 20th-century, Faulkner is the chosen one, the Promethean genius who affords the rest of us an opportunity to ride the stream.As a preceding reviewer has suggested, there's no way to summarize \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" without misrepresenting it. The \\"themes\\" are the mere toeholds Faulkner offers to readers who try to mount the surfboard and stay with the churning, changing syntax and shifting referents of his 500-word sentences long enough to reach the beachhead. Even getting thrown (which is inevitable on many of the more torrential tidal waves) is, to say the least, a heady if not visceral and energizing experience. Despite the unique achievements of \\"As I Lay Dying,\\" \\"Sound and the Fury,\\" \\"Light in August,\\" and \\"Go Down, Moses,\\" this is Faulkner's most impressive and most rewarding novel. It's likely to frustrate, but don't quit on it. It's capable of paying more dividends than perhaps any other American literary work. Compare Faulkner's story about Thomas Sutpen and his \\"Grand Design\\" to any similar stories about the \\"American Dream\\"--by Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Wolf, Steinbeck--or to any of the subsequent writers said to be \\"Faulknerian\\" in their style. The others are suddenly diminished, and the singular achievement of this Southern, uneducated, probably possessed, alcoholic becomes all the more remarkable. in many respects, Faulkner's narrative structure is closer to Orson Welles' in \\"Citizen Kane\\" than that of his literary contemporaries or forbears (though Browning's \\"The Ring and the Book\\" adapts a similar technique of gradually exposing what is true through ever tighter circles drawn by a succession of different narrators).Most of us would do well to write more simply and concisely ourselves and to bring suspicious minds to verbiage that seems disproportionate to its actual content and meaning. But there's no need to be suspicious of Faulkner's story or storytelling style. Simply trust it. The style and meaning are a match, a perfect fit. Faulkner's meanings about the tragedy of a \\"grand design\\" gone wrong become significant because of our underlying sense of one that is going right.As others have pointed out, the novel can be read as an allegory of the rise and fall of the Old South. But it's at least equally absorbing in its probing into the recesses of individualized human consciousness. Much has been made of Faulkner's psychological portrayal of Addie Bundren through her sole monologue in \\"As I Lay Dying.\\" But it quickly pales when compared with the unexpected yet exquisite and supremely rewarding journey into the psyche and heart of Rosa Coldfield, who is suddenly transformed from caricature into a woman of infinite complexity, possessing depth commensurate with her heart's capacity for desiring.As for the novel's heart, it's as big as its creator's--compassionate, humble, loving of all creatures born equal under God. A key question posed by the story is: what is the difference between the \\"illegitimate\\" offspring of a white plantation owner/black slave relationship and the \\"despised\\" child of an octoroon? The answer to that question is one of the novel's great epiphanies, a moment in which the reader recognizes his own place in the narrative and is one with Faulkner's world. It's an insight that is better \\"earned\\" than explained. After seeing so many of Faulkner's characters paralyzed, crippled, and destroyed through stubborn, incestuous adherence to the pure and abstract ideal of achromatic \\"whiteness\\" (not simply Southern supremacists like Sutpen and Old South reactionaries like the Compsons but Northern Puritans like Joanna Burden), the reader suddenly apprehends Faulkner's profoundly simple moral lesson: \\"blackness\\" is humanness."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Although this is a tough book of Faulkner's--even more so than his usual tough reading--it is well worth it. The language, imagery, his style are all in top form in Absalom, Absalom! I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Faulkner. If you haven't read any Faulkner before, it might be better to start with As I Lay Dying or The Sound and The Fury for a slightly less complex read that will introduce you to the characters."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"There's a great story buried underneath all those convoluted 500- to 1,000-word sentences crammed with vocab words like \\"miscegenation,\\" \\"effluvium\\" and \\"implacable.\\" Faulkner also has an annoying habit of using pronouns like \\"he\\" and \\"they\\" without telling you who he is referring to. You just have to figure it out in context. The story is a great one and picks up toward the end, but Faulkner buries the plot and the layers of meaning in frustrating prose that is almost as hard to interpret as the book of Revelation. It requires concentration and determination to get through to the end, but when you get there you realize you still don't know everything that happened and you want to start over. I found \\"A,A!\\" much more difficult than \\"The Sound and the Fury,\\" \\"As I Lay Daying\\" and \\"Light in August\\" (my personal favorite), but all three are drenched in meaning and symbolism. The long sentences and vocab words make it far more difficult. Of the three, I think \\"A,A!\\" has the best plot but might be too damned hard to make it worth it. Still, I have found that, while difficult, Faulkner's stories are disturbing and they stay with you long after you've read them. If I could start my Faulkner reading over again, I might start with something more straight forward like \\"Light in August\\" or \\"Sanctuary\\" first. The three I've read are just too hard for an intro to Faulkner."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom!

(The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"How to review this colossal novel? I was only about fifty pages into it when I decided it was an artifact, that the characters alleged to have said something had in fact said something but they had not said exactly what they were said to have said. I had to hold this book at some distance in order to get through it, not insisting on trying to let my emotions merge with it or to take as gospel that what was being said was being said by anybody except Faulkner himself, as I imagine Faulkner in its writing kept it at arm's length, or depending upon whom was telling the story, or whom was telling the story that someone else had told, or whom was imagining elements of the story that someone had imagined from the parts that others had told of others having told, at arm's length multiplied by another arm, and maybe by another arm, and even by one or more arms. This is the dream of a story and not the story itself, and the best illustration I can give is when, during unscripted conversation, Shreve conjectures in dialog (p 337 in my copy): \\". . .a letter, two or maybe three pages of your humble and obedient e and t and c that boiled down to eighteen words I know you are a fool, but just what kind of a fool are you going to be? . .\\" because even at my best raving and ranting I can't count ahead words like that in my head before I've said them and I can't accept that Shreve could either. Well I cannot judge this novel very well because for me it boils down to how one feels about Faulkner more than it does to how one feels about Absalom, Absalom! which is obviously unfair to a review like this one. So for those of you who want sufficiently to like this book or to like Faulkner then you should pay most attention to the most favorable reviews. I really want to like Faulkner but I really have a very hard time convincing myself that I do like Faulkner because reading him to me is always like trying to suck cold molasses through a flimsy paper straw. You could say it's about style but I hate to say that about Faulkner or about Hemingway either because with either of them it's not style as much as it is who they are as writers and as human examples on this earth shaped by their experiences and dreams. But oh I wish so much it didn't seem to me like such a chore to have to penetrate through to what Faulkner was circling all around when almost always there were much shorter routes available and the knowledge that he could have focused his skills as a writer on other matters than the endless circling. Well that is just me and so my rating for this novel is really only a rating of how I coped with it and has little to do or less with its literary value. I'd give it three and a half stars if I could, but notice this is not bad but only in between \\"It's OK\\" and \\"I like it.\\" No doubt closer to \\"It's okay.\\""},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom!

(The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"A California author with my debut novel in its initial release, I have always been facinated by ABSALOM, ABSALOM! I realize I'm an easy mark for this book. My Southern roots run deep, though my mother's side of the family. She grew up in a small town in Alabama, and I've always read Faulkner, to some degree, to gain insights into my late mother's life experiences and background. I believe ABSALOM, ABSALOM! is William Faulkner's strongest work, but there are many works that one could claim is his strongest. He is the greatest American writer of all time. ABSALOM, ABSALOM!, on one level, deals with the story of Thomas Sutpen and his attempt to build a dynasty on Sutpen's Hundred. Sutpen was born poor,and he dreams of greatness. He establishes a plantation. He desires sons to carry on his legacy, yet his sons impact his life in unexpectedly tragic ways. On another level, Faulkner deals with the issues of race, exploitation, and slavery. Sutpen's first wife has black blood. His son by this woman, hence, has black blood. Sutpen repudiates both and that repudiation comes back to haunt him. On a completely different level, Faulkner deals with Quentin Compson, a grandson of one Sutpen's friends, who uses this story to reconcile himself to his past, his life, and his history while he is a student at Harvard. And ABSALOM, ABSALOM! keeps growing deeper and deeper with significance on top of significance atop significance.

(The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"I am here to tell you that not every great book that describes the human struggle as we emerged from the mud has to be written from a leftist progressive political perspective, although usually it helps. The novelist, self-proclaimed white racial purist and Mississippi partisan, William Faulkner, with this very complicated and somewhat rambling novel placed himself front and center in the pantheon of American literary figures who have tried to confront the daunting task of making great literature out of the slavery-driven plantation society of the ante bellum South and of that same locale in the period of defeat after the Civil War. One does not have to sign up for membership in the William Faulkner political fan club to realize that he has created something that speaks to that very contradictory, and at times incomprehensible, human drive to succeed as it has evolved thus far. He does not pull his punches or hold back on the grizzly picture that he paints.Let me explain that last sentence. I was put on the trail of Faulkner this time, having previously reviewed his \\"Sanctuary\\" in this space, by reading and reviewing a book titled \\"The Unwritten War\\" by Daniel Aaron. Aaron's major thesis is that the social, political and military dimensions of the American Civil experience, for both sides, were so traumatic and overwhelming that it took a figure removed in time like Faulkner to have a realistic shot at writing the \\"great American Civil War novel\\". Aaron runs through the litany of great American literary figures that did, or did not, try to create such a work in the immediate post-war period and came up dry until the emergence of Faulkner (and, possibly, the \\"Agrarians\\" like Robert Penn Warren). One can agree or disagree with Professor Aaron thesis but it hard to argue, at an artist level, that Faulkner's work here, especially the portrait of the central character, Thomas Sutpen, as he emerges from the descriptions of several fellow townspeople, including characters from other Faulkner novels, of the mythical Jefferson, Mississippi is not a serious candidate for that honor.And what do we have here in almost four hundred epages of this novel. A description of the intricate web of the roots of one branch of the slavery economy in the French West Indies as it connects to the then (1830's) virgin Mississippi lands suitable for plantation creation. The trails and tribulations of two varieties of \\"poor white trash\\" (Sutpen, and later his overseer). The Civil War as refracted though small town Southern life. Miscegenation. Lust. Incest. Murder, Almost murder. Wannabe murder. Abortion. Southern gentility. Not so gentile Southern life. Ghosts, real and imagined. Fear of going forward. Fear of going back. Hatred of the North. Hatred of the South. Carpetbaggers. Scalawags. Almost every social and human experience, except any serious description of the hated n----r in post-Civil War society, except as monsters. And that is only a start. So here is the \\"real deal\\". Goddam, William Faulkner can write a hell of a novel. Nevertheless, after reading this novel, I will stick with the lyrics of Nina Simone's old 1960's Civil Rights-inspired song- \\"Mississippi, Goddam\\""},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom!

Yes, it's a hard read, but I discovered a secret: Don't read the book from beginnning to end. Skip around a bit. That's the genius of this book. It's told like a family scandal is really told, bit by bit, piece by piece, by different people at different times in different ways. Some of its hearsay, some of it firsthand; like a REAL skeleton in a Deep Southern closet! When people get that, (and skip around), the book is a breeze to read. Besides that, it's a believeable piece about life during that era. Sutpen wrestling his slaves and having a mulatto daughter; Ellen fighting in the beginning but then giving up, giving out, and dying; Rosa being born in the right place at the wrong time; Charles De Saint Valery Bon relinquishing his whiteness for the blackness; Clytemnestra sitting and watching the rot and ruin of the family of the man who was both her father and master; Quentin's confusion about what the big deal was and why they all felt it necessary to involve him when he wasn't even BORN back in those days.

(The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"\\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" is, by far, the most difficult book to conquer that I have ever read. From William Faulkner's five page paragraphs to his two page sentences, it is a hard book to decipher. However, once I did arrive at the end of this book there was a priceless feeling of relief and pride. The book was over and I had made it through the entire thing. Even through the confusion this book caused, though, it is easy to develop relationships with the characters. I loathed Thomas Sutpen and his sleeping around ways throughout the entire story. Also, I almost pitied Rosa Coldfield's inability to get over her hatred for Sutpen's Hundred. As I read \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" I was confused and frustrated. In the end, though, the entire struggle was worth it.\\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" followed the rise and fall of Sutpen's Hundred in relationship to the rise and fall of the South throughout the Civil War. Thomas Sutpen builds a mansion in a small Southern town; this house ends up being the center of the book and causing countless problems with multiple characters. Faulkner brings the book to an astonishing climax that makes the entire book worth reading. The struggle and hours it took to read \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" are all pretty much justified when this book hits its climax and nearly everything unravels. Sutpen's Hundred falls to a fiery death and all of the characters are wrapped up, except for one. Leaving this book in a frustrating cliffhanger.Though this was a beautiful book, in my opinion, William Faulkner's drunkenness as he wrote it is apparent throughout the entire book. The lack of proper grammar usage, particularly the run on sentences, make this book so much more difficult to read than it should be. To a certain extent, all of this adds to the character of this book; however, that does not make the frustrations as I read it go away. \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" was a fantastic, classic book, but extremely hard to understand."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom!

People have said he is unreadable. I just want to point out that he is unreadable TO YOU. Faulkner is NOT overrated. He is challenging to read, but the difficulty is often necessary, an element of the story and the experience. He did also write clearly and simply when he wanted to...

This understanding of history relating to the south and its attitude/pride was the silver bullet in my gun that allowed me to slay this book. And I liked the book very much. It is more of a book to me than it would have been without the other studies. It is one of those novels that can be magic and precious, and that you find yourself reading again and again.

(The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"It is impossible to distill the complex mysteriousness of this great work in a review. Faulkner's 'Absalom, Absalom!' is perhaps his most difficult and experimental novel-a novel that is composed entirely in thickly wrought stream of consciousness prose, with switching perspectives and an a linear chronology. It is too simple to call this great work \\"Southern Gothic,\\" for it is so foreign in its conception and is a radical departure from the kind of writers Faulkner is normally associated (O'Connor, McCullers, Anderson). Rather, this text is closer to Joyce's 'Ulysses,' in terms of its linguistic complexity and attention to the labyrinthine workings of the mind. This is a novel about ruin, about decay, about what it means to be a part of a deteriorating empire. It is both political and personal, as all the great tragedies are. Through an inspired interplay of interior voice and secondary hearsay, Faulkner creates the story of Henry Sutpen and the gradual decline of his once prestigious family. This is a novel about slavery, about incest and miscegenation. It is American in its content in only the most horrifying ways. It is an incomparable literary achievement."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"I like Faulkner and I like difficult books (partly because I can't resist the challenge, it certainly can't be to impress people because then in that case it would be a miserable failure) so in that sense this was definitely right up my alley. My previous exposure to Faulkner's novels (Sound and the Fury, Light in August, As I Lay Dying) left me with enough of a sense of his style that I figured I could tackle just about anything he wrote. This novel seriously tested that idea, although I enjoyed the novel immensely. As usual, it's about the South, telling the story of Thomas Sutpen, a fellow who comes out of nowhere to build a great big mansion on a large plot of land that he basically steals and then proceeds to attempt to build some sort of legacy for himself, which in true tragic fashion he ends up sabotaging and destroying not only himself but the futures of his descendants as well. Sounds straightforward? Ha! The story is seen through the eyes of Quentin Compton (last seen in the Sound and the Fury, I think) whose grandfather was present for most of Sutpen's antics. Essentially the story is a series of monologues, really really really long monologues as various people recount Sutpen's history at various moments, some of which they were witness to and some they're just recounting. Faulkner uses dialogue to brilliant effect, retelling events from a bunch of different perspectives but leaving the reader to figure out the motivations, although it does tend to ramble a lot, which helps it develop a rhythmic effect but also can be annoying when the same character basically restates the same bushel of sentences several times in the course of a few pages. Everything is told out of order, but Faulkner obviously had a plan to what fit where since it builds to a sort of dramatic conclusion. This is a novel where the reader has to do a lot of the work though, not only are the dots only laid out and not connected but because the story is told through other people, there's always the question of narrative reliability and how good peoples' memories are. The writing tends to veer towards sharply toward the realm of sublety when recounting important events, a post-modernism trademark which means that unless you're one of the those truly rare careful readers or just an incredibly perceptive person you are going to miss stuff in this book almost guarenteed, while reading it you can almost hear a voice in your head cackling &quot;Ha, you aren't going to get this on the first try, buddy!&quot; . . . try reading the scene where Sutpen dies and tell me what you picked up on all of that on the first shot. However the scene is marvelous and spine chilling in its pacing and description and I went back and read it a few times just to let it sink in. There's also a timeline in the back for those who want to cheat, it definitely puts everything into perspective, but in the case of this book it's the execution that's important. And yes, the ending is as gut wrenching as you've heard, one of the most memorable endings of any American novel ever. I can't claim this as Faulkner's masterpiece, it's probably his best work from a technical standpoint (Sound and the Fury wasn't as integrated as this, although As I Lay Dying comes close) and its difficulty dilutes some of the initial emotional impact moreso than his other novels but if you have any interest in his work, this is one of his key novels."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom!

(The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"It is ironic to consider that Absalom Absalom was published in the same year as Gone With the Wing, two books dealing with the impact of the Civil War. For Margaret Mitchell, the Civil War was the passing of an age of gallantry. For Faulkner, the Civil War was the punishment over the original sin of slavery.This book takes as its central point of reference a great white house built by an enslaved French architect by Col Thomas Sutpen. Col Sutpen, his imagination fired at the idea of setting up a gentile dynasty, is constantly undermined by reflections of his own bad character. Slaves, who lack a real voice are mistreated or forced to service him in the woods and his fate is to sire a totally depraved collection of children of both races.That his slave daughter is named Clytemnestra is no mere accident. The fall of the Sutpens is every bit as violent and depraved as Greek tragedy (the Greek revival house is no accident either). Each move that Sutpen takes to make his family a force in the region leads ultimately to its undoing.This book is an attempt to subvert several well-held myths of the south and its slave owners with pretenses to being aristocracy. I suspect that the difficulty in reading the text might be a reason why this book has not been banned (perhaps that is Faulkner's intent). It is better if this book is read aloud since it is structured the way people tell stories, particularly in a pervious generation. It is difficult, but worth it in the end."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"An extraordinary novel, William Faulkner's \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" (1936) tells the story of Thomas Sutpen and of the Old South and its aftermath. The book is set in northern Mississippi in Faulkner's fictitious Yoknapatawa County. Part of the story takes place in the small town of Jefferson, but the story centers on a large 100 square mile plantation 12 miles from the town, \\"Sutpen's Hundred\\" and on its owner and builder, Thomas Sutpen. The story has multiple voices, the most prominent of which is young Quentin Compson, 20, who narrates Sutpen's story to his college roomate, Shreve Mccannon, a Canadian, during a snowy night in 1910 in Harvard.In the course of the book, the same story gets told many times, each time with more detail and by speakers with different perspectives. The manner of the unfolding, among many other things, makes the book difficult to read especially at first, as the reader is thrown unprepared into a complex, shadowy past world. There are three basic familial groups in the book: Thomas Sutpen's, the Coldfields,a small mercantile family in Jefferson, and the Compson's. Thomas Sutpen married a Coldfield daughter, Ellen, and the couple had two children, Judith and Henry. The Compson were friends of Sutpen's and narrate much of the story.The story begins in 1833 when Sutpen arrives mysteriously, acquires land, and builds his large mansion. He remains an outsider to the town. The reader learns a good deal of his earlier life as the story unfolds. The story is dark, passionate and brooding, with themes centering around slavery, incest (resulting from the institution of slavery), and miscgenation. Before arriving in Mississippi, Charles Sutpen had married in Haiti and had a son, Charles, and cast them both aside. When Henry attends the University of Mississippi, Bon mysteriously befriends him and ultimately becomes engaged to Judith Sutpen. The story develops around this proposed marriage, both incestuous and across racial lines.Sutpen's story is fused to a story of the old South before the Civil War and to the pride that led the South to engage in that disastrous, ruinous conflict. The reader sees the pre-bellum South, the Civil War South, and the defeated, conquered South following the War with a strange insight. The book has the feel of high tragedy. The author's attitude towards the South resists summarization. The Biblical title of the novel suggest that Faulkner sees the old South as David saw his son Absalom: dearly beloved but fatally flawed. Faulkner shows a society doomed by its dependence on slavery, while he shows love for its toughness, independence, and passion. At one point, one of the characters says in describing the Old South:\\"Yes, for them: of that day and time, of a dead time; people too as we are and victims too as we are, but victims of a different circumstance, simpler and therefore, integer for integer, larger, more heroic and the figures therefore, integer for integer, larger, more heroic and the figures therefore more heroic too, not dwarfed and involved but distinct, uncomplex who had the gift of loving once or dying once instead of being diffused and scattered creatures drawn blindly limb from limb from a grab bag and assembled, author and victim too, of a thousand homicides and a thousand copulations and divorcements.\\"Quentin Compson and his Canadian friend Shreve offer differing perspectives on the South and on the tale.\\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" is notoriously difficult to read. Part of the difficulty arises from the layers through which the story unfolds. But the larger difficulty lies in the baroque, bravura, and wordy writing style of this book with long, almost endless sentences, wandering clauses and digressions, and full vocabulary. Styles make books. In this case, the style is integrally tied to the story and the meaning that the author conveys of a distant, difficult world, that is opaque and hard to understand. The story and the world and life it shows can be seen only through a glass darkly. In coming to the book for the first time, I was frustrated together with many earlier readers. I think the best course is to persevere and not to linger overlong over the many obscurities and hard passages as the story unfolds. The book becomes more dramatic and accessible with the telling.I was greatly moved by this book and by its portrayal of the South and of the Civil War. The novel tells of the human condition in ways that cannot be found in histories. \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" belongs in the front rank of American novels. I am glad to have read the book at last.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"For someone new to Faulkner, I would not start with Absalom Absalom, Another work, like Light in August, would be a more appropriate choice. But this is his Faulkner's best novel - his most challenging technically, his most epic in vision and with some of his most memorable characters.Plus his most intricate and involved plot. If you want to know what they mean by \\"Southern Gothic,\\" take this work out for a ride. In telling the story of how Thomas Sutpen tried to create a family dynasty in the South, Faulkner throws everything he can into this story: insanity, miscegenation, family betrayals, murder, incest. And in the middle of everything, the American Civil War breaks out. There's always something.Along the way, with its rich Biblical and mythological symbolism, Faulkner uses the fate of the Sutpen family to mirror the fate of the American South during these tumultuous decades.To do this, Faulkner uses a lot of modern techniques - shifting time frames and points of view, stream of consciousness and interior monologues, and sentences almost baroque in structure. It takes a little getting use to, but stick with it. After a chapter or so you get use to the voice and realize that Faulkner is developing unique characters while giving you bits and pieces of a very intricate family mystery and letting the reader put all the pieces together. The result is a challenging masterpiece with many fascinating secrets just waiting for the reader to uncover."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"I'm so glad it's not just me that had a tough time reading this book. Actually, I thought Faulkner's earlier \\"The Sound And The Fury\\" is a tougher first read, its opening stream of consciousness narrative set in the mind of a simpleton. What 1936's \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" is is a tough second read, making it a harder pill to swallow.The challenge as I found it was not quite the same as \\"Sound\\". There, once you lock into the story, the digressions and the abstract metaphors fall nicely into place. Here, you never quite lock into the story exactly. It follows a man by the name of Sutpen, who carves out a corner of Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi for his own. This doesn't endear him to everyone, but he manages to find a bride, settle down, raise two children, and run his spread with the help of some wild Haitian slaves, one of which is his illegitimate daughter. Then comes the Civil War, a tidal wave of change by itself but the least of Thomas Sutpen's problems.Faulkner makes Sutpen a compelling if mysterious central character. A slaveholder, a hypocrite, a scoundrel, and a cruel \\"man-horse-demon\\" as his bitter sister-in-law Rosa Coldfield remembers, Sutpen emerges too as a man of great will and courage. Faulkner observes: \\"He had been too successful, you see; his was that solitude of contempt and distrust which success brings to him who gained it because he was strong instead of merely lucky.\\"Miss Rosa is the first tipoff the story isn't going to play out as straightforward as it reads. She's very bitter about Sutpen, as it turns out, in part for good reason, but in part because she's sexually uptight and a snob, mourning a social order Sutpen blew through like tissue paper.Then there's Quentin Compson, a semester removed from his suicide at Harvard, sharing stories of Sutpen with his jocular Canadian roommate Shreve. Quentin's reminiscence is gentler than Rosa's, but farther removed from the source and tinged with strange melancholy. Maybe the tale of frustrated incest strikes a nerve.The story doesn't so much come out in pieces as it revolves and gets respun with different accents and emphases. It's a hell of a story, \\"intense Southern Gothic\\", like it says in a top review here, with some sudden plot twists unusual for a deep-thought novel. That it goes on in this vein a bit too long, chewing over the same points, is a concern that doesn't melt away when you read the book a second time. Faulkner writes with power and verve, and a poet's flair, but he doesn't use periods nearly enough, overweighting sentences with layers of meaning that go off into corners and bounce back only after stretching a point to breaking.I may need a couple of more readings before I come around to embracing this novel the same way I did with \\"The Sound And The Fury\\". It's not as fun, though some humor does show up, much of it involving the frigid, hypersensitive Rosa. It does provide major insight into the antebellum side of Yoknapatawpha County, with a hard but compelling look at slavery's toll on both black and white that nevertheless is far from the novel's whole story.The story is great; the telling is problematic if mostly for the best. I'll enjoy re-immersing myself in the enigma that is \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\", but if I wind up more confused than ever the next time I read it, I won't be a bit surprised."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom!

This is perhaps the most difficult of his novels. To the inexperienced reader, some of the difficulties are insurmountable. But if one perseveres, one will discover why many critics consider this to be Faulkner's greatest novel.Of the many difficulties is his style. The recursive style is compounded by long sentences; clause piled upon clause, adjectives upon adjectives. Whoever said that adjectives are bad should see it manipulated by the master. Many grammatical gems are left to be uncovered.The narration is the most unique in modern fiction. By the end of the first chapter the most important events of the entire story is already mentioned.

Reading it should not be limited to literary savants and college freshmen who are convinced that William Faulkner's raison d'etre was to drive them nuts in return for a passing grade. I fell into that second category in 1972 when faced with reading The Sound and the Fury. As much as I hated the process back then, I realized recently that TS&TF; was perhaps responsible for training my mind to understand and actually enjoy stream of consciousness and non-linnear narratives of other contemporary authors.As have other reviewers, I decided to give Sound another read as an adult...and after having done that,decided to tackle Absalom Absalom. The bad news is that the first half Absalom makes Benji's chapter read like the Cat in the Hat. The good news is that with the following tips, both books can be savored at whatever level your capacity for understanding allows:1)Do read Sound and Fury first..Absalom is sort of its pre-quel.2) I found both books in downloadable format and was able to toggle between the online(ei:free)Sparks Notes and the text. Actually, I read the Sparks chapter synopsis before reading the chapter it self. Don't worry about spoilers (except for maybe the last chapter)...this is not a dime store detective story. You actually know the general outcome pretty early in the book anyway. I prefer the Sparks. Cliffsnotes gives too much information (unless you need to write a quick term paper).3)Don't let yourself become obsessed with the density of the sentence structure, vocabulary, and intermittant use of punctuation...with the help of a little advance information from Sparks, have faith that somehow, the story will indeed come shining through the excessive verbiage.4)Ditto the complexity of the chronology; I think (as in Sound&Fury;) Faulkner wants you to be confused. Don't further confuse yourself by worrying about who knew what about who when. It all becomes clear toward the end.5)As you are reading the book, paruse the Amazon reader reviews and other internet commentary...very helpful."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"This novel is a historical reconstruction by the fictional Quentin Compson (from \\"The Sound and the Fury\\") of the long ago rise of Thomas Sutpen out of a bog of obscurity to become a wealthy landowner in Mississippi, only to have it all destroyed again. It features all of the bugaboos one expects of Southern or Gothic literature--rumors of miscegenation, incest, murder, love, and betrayal. In the telling of the story, Faulkner also uses Sutpen's history as an allegory of the South itself.Anyone can tell a story, especially a story that is essentially as old as the hills as this one. What makes this book, of course, is the style in which Faulkner narrates it. In terms of language, this is the most excessive, Baroque, verbose, garrulous and thick verbiage Faulkner has ever laid down at this length. It's like Section 4 of \\"The Bear\\" for 300 pages, and features at least one notorious 1.5 page long sentence. I strongly recommend you take a peek at the first page available here, and then imagine that going on ceaselessly until the end of the book. True, it can be very tiresome--Faulkner is a demanding author--but it also has a way of getting into your blood, if you let it, so that the text becomes unbearably effective and powerful.The structure of the novel is equally elaborate. Faulkner spent his entire career as a writer discovering ways to project narrative into a character's voice, rather than directly narrating himself. As such, you get things like Bob and James talking about how Jane related the story of Rex witnessing Sue and Melanie talking about Larry murdering who he suspected his wife was sleeping with. [This example is illustrative, and bears no relation to the book.) In the final analysis, this means knowing exactly what happens becomes difficult to follow in general, and perhaps unknowable. Of course, part of Faulkner's point is precisely that only we, here and now, can reproduce or guess at the history of our pasts, and it is those reconstructed histories that we live by, rather than the actual historical reality (whatever it was).This is a difficult book by one of the United States most difficult authors. It is also one of the best books by one of our best authors. The relationship between Sutpen's children and the half-brothers is one of the most effective he ever penned; not since \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" had a family been drawn so well. Also very memorable is the psychological portrait of Sutpen as a boy and young man.Faulkner's narratives, unlike most modernists', do not require you to understand their allusions and so forth to make sense. They deepen the meaning of the novel if you know them, of course, but you can get the sense of the novel without them. In this case, the title is a reference to one of the Biblical David's sons, who launched an armed rebellion against David. In the course of this attempt, the son is killed, and it is at that point that King David cries out his son's name, \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\""},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom!

(The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Having read three major works by Faulkner, I never thought Faulkner's prose to be THAT long and convoluted until I read this one. The sentences go on and on, sometimes for half a page, sometimes for an entire page, strung together with clause after clause, requiring the reader to really focus and remember what the subject of the enormous sentence is, though retaining and figuring out what all the clauses are referring to is often times hard to determine as you get lost in that meandering prose that keeps burgeoning like this, sometimes ignoring grammar altogether, sometimes even omitting commas when listing euphuistic obscure poetic little adjectives, punctuated with long parenthetical asides (kind of like this, making it hard to follow the gist of the sentence and causing momentary amnesia whereby the subject of the sentence you tried so hard to retain throughout the long serpentine sentences is almost completely obliterated, sometimes made more complex by an insertion of another parenthetical aside inside of it (like this, you see?) compelling you to go ALL THE WAY back to the beginning and skip the asides altogether and re-read the entire damn thing again to wholly understand what the hell it's saying), the inexplicable semi-colon followed by a dash -- the dash long and imposing, confusing and unnecessary, enclosing more clause after clause in this fashion, severing the subject from everything else that is relevant and instrumental in understanding the sentence as a whole;-- the dash further elongating and compounding the sentence, and all those \\"not only...but\\" constructions that are sometimes embedded in or juxtaposed with a negative clause, making it outright ANNOYING (here it is, just CHECK this out) not because they are unpoetic (it can be at times) or stylistically uninteresting (because sometimes - just sometimes - it is) but not only because they are unnecessary and time-consuming to read but because they are just damn confusing!So if you made it this far in my review and took the time to understand what I said above, you should be able to handle Absalom, Absalom!.

So know what you're getting yourself into before tackling this difficult work.The story, on the other hand, is interesting. Though 90% of it is really telling and not showing at all, it's generally interesting enough to impel you through the dense, clattered prose and understand the story of a mysterious and impeccable man bent on building a dynasty of his own. In a nutshell, it's a good Shakespearian tragedy (the son destroying the dynasty) with a good Southern twist (in particular, racism).Overall, despite my parody of his style, I did enjoy the unique experience of reading Faulkner at his most convoluted. An interesting (yet hard) read."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"To characterize this novel as a stream-of-consciouness tirade of wayward thought is not entirely fair. True, Faulkner pencils together one idea after another in an endless series of commas, hyphens, and other grammatical devices save the elusive period (which affords the reader a brief rest). But to me \\"stream of consciousness\\" means thoughts spilling from the mind of the narrator-ideas that drift about much like own's own mind does-a pattern of thought better kept locked inside one's own skull than spewn forth on the printed page. But Faulkner's endless narrative is not just ambling thoughts-rather it is a detective story-albeit a much more difficult detective story than Faulkner's \\"Sanctuary\\"-where subtle clues and obvious facts are planted deep inside this jumble of sentences. So it's not just musings but is a tightly woven narrative albeit short on periods, white space, and paragraphs. For that reason the reader better read carefully and not miss a word.\\"Absalom, Absalom\\" reminds me of the recent movie \\"Memento\\". It is a tale told backwards. We have the ending given first and then we are given various pieces of the plot from different character's points of view. We know what happens at the end of the novel before we get there. But we are not sure why the novel ends as it does until we get to the end. More accurately, we are given greater clarity to the events that have happened as various narrators and events make other events more clear. In that regard it's much like \\"The Sound and the Fury\\". In that novel the story is made clear only when the final narrator has her say. As other reviewers have already pointed out, Quentin Compson was also a character in that other difficult Faulkner novel.Lile other reviews have said read \\"Light in August\\" before you read \\"Absalom, Absalom\\". It's style is a good primer for \\"Absalom, Absalom\\" which is, of course, a much more difficult read. Also I would recommend a proper book of literary criticism such as Alfred Kazin's work on Faulkner. That will help you understand the plot and be able to distill the important themes therein."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"I've been interested in Faulkner's writing ever since The Sound and the Fury drove me crazy in high school. That interest became and obsession when I reread it in college and loved it. I didn't come to Absalom, Absalom! expecting anything other than a masterpiece, and I wasn't disappointed.What drives the novel is the telling and retelling of Thomas Sutpen's life story. He's a charismatic man who, born poor in the antebellum American South, rises to riches through sheer will and then falls after the Civil War. He loses everything with that same energy he used to acquire it.What interests me most is how the story is listened to and then recalled by Quentin Compson, my favorite character from The Sound and the Fury. It is to him that Sutpen first emerges as a ghost of memory from the \\"victorious dust\\" of a bitter woman's retelling. Absalom, Absalom! is one of the most captivating analyses I've experienced of the power of history on the living.I'm not sure I'd recommend this as a good way to get started with Faulkner. It's necessarily long-winded at times--even Quentin gets tired of listening, and that's an understatement. But if you put in the time and effort, you'll find a close look into race, family, sex, and what it means to be born after \\"the fall.\\" Most importantly, you'll find a great story and images that will stick with you."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Thomas Sutpen is a man with one single, unfailing goal: to forge a dynasty in 1830s Jefferson, Mississippi. A century later, young Quentin Compson, obsessed with Sutpen, slowly uncovers the interweaving, ever-expanding story of Sutpen's ruthless ambition, the intervention of the Civil War, and his ultimate failure and destruction through his children. A gothic novel of the highest degree, this book is rich with complicated family histories, race issues, and above all complex character motivations that create a slowly evolving story of increasing depth and darkness. The writing style is lengthy and dense, becoming at times frustratingly difficult, but in the end the pieces of the story unify into a whole truth: a vivid analysis not only of one man's life, but of the lives of those he touched and of Southern identity itself.The major fault of this novel is the lengthy, wordy, sometimes difficult writing style; the major strength is the complex layers of plot which confuse, reveal, confuse again, and reveal more, building an ever more complex and meaningful complete story. In many ways, this weakness and strength feed in to each other: it would not be the same book if it were written any other way, but the novel may be difficult or off-putting to some readers as a result. Faulkner's writing style is often dense and presented as a stream of consciousness, where topics shift, articles go unspecified, and phrases or words are repeated for emphasis. In Absalom, Absalom! the style is even more exaggerated, with incredibly long sentences and paragraphs. Worse, despite the fact that the narrator changes a number of times through the book, the narrative voice is almost always identical, making it difficult to separate speakers and determine character relations. The difficult, dense narrative may make it hard for the reader to begin this book--it takes a few chapters to get into the rhythm of the writing, and the reader has to accept a certain degree of confusion and trust that the story will explain itself in time.However, granted some hard work and some faith in Faulkner's storytelling, the novel expands into a story of increasing complexity and great depth. Like the writing style, which often begins with confusing references and repetition before resolving into comprehensible storytelling, the plot is alternately confusing and revealing. Once one relation, motivation, or event is revealed, it again becomes confusing, and then again reveals new information--information which often revises previous events or complicates an earlier character. As such, the story may come back to the same event three times, but each time exposes more about the event, the people involved, and their motivations, creating an ever more meaningful story as the truth is revealed. Such complexity would be impossible without the dense writing style, and both style and story aid the other into new settings, rich language, new events, greater motivation.As the book comes to its conclusions and the final revelations unfold, there is a classically tragic sense to Sutpen's story: stuck between the reality and the appearance of his own success, he watches and enacts the repeated downfall of his personal dynasty and finally himself, all by way of his offspring. Quentin, the reader's companion as he researches and knits together Sutpen's story, must interpret this underlying failure, the crisis of Southern identity: what it means to be a part of, what it means to be great in, the South--and ultimately, of course, this is an identity crisis that reaches from the South to all humanity. The end of the book is heavy with motivation and character, and ultimately fulfilling, even as it raises doubt and a sense of personal dis-ease. So while the writing style can be difficult at times, while the constant confusion and re-confusion of the plot may become frustrating, this is ultimately a satisfying read: satisfying to the very heart of the reader, a brilliant piece of storytelling and a wonderful analysis of humankind. I greatly enjoyed it and very highly recommend it--to all readers, even those that have to force themselves through the first few chapters."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"I first read Absalom, Absalom! in a class on women's writing and feminist interpretation. The instructor assured us that this book was \\"all about\\" Faulkner's fear of and jealousy of women or more specifically of our reproductive power. Even though I was very much a feminist at the time (hence the class in the first place) I admit, this interpretation ruined the book for me.In fact, I never finished this book while at college and only read enough to get an \\"A\\" on the term paper and exam. It wasn't until very recently that a good friend of mine finally succeeded in convincing me to give Faulkner another chance. I did and this review is a kind of thank you to that friend.For Absalom, Absalom! is an incredible work. For those of you who want to know \\"what it's all about,\\" the plot is fairly simple: a poor boy goes to the West Indies to make his fortune, meets a woman there, marries her, finds out she is part Black, repudiates her and his child, gets another (White) wife and family. Eventually his son by his first wife meets his second son, the two come home and his first son falls in love with his half-sister. And the younger brother kills the older brother before the latter can marry their sister.That's it. That's the \\"what happened\\" plot but the real \\"plot\\" is in the \\"why happened\\" not the \\"what happened\\". This book takes us on a breathless journey to the depths of the human heart (a heart corrupted by an immutable caste system) and lifts us up again on a rollercoaster ride that is a bit hard to take sometimes. It is about the way people think and react; about the way (and the why) they love and whether they acknowledge that love (or not) and what happens as a result.It is about the choices we make once but that happen over and over as though those choices are not and can never be made only once. And no doubt Faulkner's fear of women is in here too.It's just that this time I didn't see it as much; or perhaps it wasn't the only thing I saw."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom!

This is one of them.With some less well-constructed books, or less thoughtful books, you can read it once, know what you think, and know that if you read it again you will think the same thing. This is not one of those.It is written to draw you in. It is written as if you were inside the mind of a twenty-year-old who (along with his friend) is trying to figure out the history of his town, his family, and his part of the country. Each time he gets something, it opens another path that must be explored. Just like it was for all of us when we were that age and just got a new bit of information about our parents, grandparents, or great-grandparents or their friends, or their enemies.So, it is the story of many things. It's primarily the story of the Thomas Sutpen, his life in Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi (a name and place familiar to any reader of Faulkner), and of his effect on the future of the Coldfield's. It is also the story of the devil, of the South, of a culture that had to die, of fate, of destiny, and of our need to hold onto the past. It is also the story of all of us, our need to know more, and our recoil when we find out more than we want to know.Read this novel like a poem. Read it first to get the general flow, read it again for details, then read it again to notice words and structure, the way you travel constantly through time (from 1910 to 1833 to 1861-65) and space (Harvard, Mississippi, Haiti). Each time you read it, you will be satisfied. The last time you read it will be as satisfying as the first. What more can you ask from a single work of art?"},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom!

I have read many of his novels, specifically his best works during the thirties, and most of his short stories. Many acclaim the work of Sound and the Fury as his best piece; the accolades are well founded. Yet, Absalom, Absalom as an experiment in fictional writing is unparalleled in his Yoknapatawpha Tales.

Sentences take hours and pages take days but this book is just an experience waiting to be had. I hate the idea that people are turned off because of the involved style he uses. He captures the myth of the south in a way that's really hard to believe, and he gives and takes point of views from his characters in a way that on the surface seems vacillating or capricious but is actually unbelievably intentional. The decline of the Sutpen family is a grotesque study in decadence and decay and the fall of the southern plantations.

As the saying goes, no pain no gain -- and Absalom will give you plenty of both.Is Absalom an accurate portrait of the South? I think not. But it is an accurate portrait of how people think about the South, and that ultimately is far more interesting. From Thomas Sutpen's coldhearted pursuit of his grand design, passing through Aunt (er, I mean, Miss) Rosa's gothic caricature of it, and ending up with Shreve and Quentin trying -- almost fumbling in the dark -- to figure out the circumstances surrounding Thomas Sutpen, just as Southerners today are still trying to figure out how we ended up on a road to self-destruction.

(The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Although the word 'masterpiece' has been overused and hence lost its real meaning, the word was invented for works like this. \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" is Faulkner's dark, dense and brooding epic about the fall: the fall of the South, a Southern Family, Charles Sutpen and every other character involved. Told in a variety of narratives the work is difficult at first, yet something early in the book clicks and the language is a pure genious in narrative technique.The novel reminded me of Garcia Marquez's \\"Autumn of the Patriarch\\". Marquez was heavily influenced by Faulkner and the first to admit it. Yet this novel preceeded Marquez by as much as 35 years. Anyone interested in Literature with a capitol L should read this novel."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"It may be rather pointless at this late date to review a now-unavailable audio edition of one of Faulkner's most important works, but I have only just now encountered (from my local library) the Books on Tape #3220 unabridged 'Absalom, Absalom!', read by Wolfram Kandinsky on 11 90-minute cassettes.Kandinsky is not what I would consider an especially poor reader; he pays careful attention to his text, and he usually enunciates clearly. To try to keep from being boring, he sprinkles voice modulation and emphasis in his lines, and not entirely at random. However, he unfortunately IS a boring reader, and I have to admit I couldn't get past the first tape. But even aside from being a boring reader, Kandinsky's real problem is that he has no ear for the sounds and rhythms of Faulkner's language, of his unique Faulknerian dialect. 'Absalom, Absalom!' is itself a difficult book to read convincingly--sentences can go on for pages on end, with hardly any other intervening punctuation. In this experimental book, Faulkner is building, in a very architectural sense, piling words upon words; and it's in the architecture of his writing, as much as, or more than, in the sense of the individual words themselves, that the meaning and the impact of his story is revealed. This requires a very different style of reading than Kandinsky can muster--it needs a subtle, almost flat and uninflected, almost hypnotic, building of words and lines and pages, with slow and deep waves of emphasis that grow and recede and grow again. Like many (or most) really good books, 'Absalom, Absalom!' needs to be &quot;told&quot; to the listener, not simply &quot;read&quot;. Wolfram Kandinsky's reading would suffice admirably for a Hardy Boys mystery; but anyone who knows and loves Faulkner is bound to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom!

And this was my favorite, though of course the most difficult read. Stream of consciousness, several different and unspecified narrators, the story unfolding very slowly in a flood of detail. Many, probably most, people would hate this book, but if you like this sort of challenging reading, this is one of the great works you owe it to yourself to read.

I didn't manage to get around to reading it back during my academic life, but every year when I read 2 Samuel 13-15 I renew my vow to read it. This year I followed through.If you are familiar with Faulkner's work, I don't have to tell you he would have hated twitter. And he never heard the warnings about not using adjectives and adverbs. And while I sometimes get forget where he is going, I\`m drawn to be lost in his words.This is particularly true when the characters do not want to tell the story. So they hem and hah and talk around the story. The first half of the book, told by Aunt or Miss Rosa is painfully slow. The pace picks up in the second half when Quentin and his college roommate tell the story to each other, but still they can barely say the words of the real story.Somewhere between the long sentence structures and the outdated vocabulary, you sense the power of the story as characters realize small familial attributes and watch the death of dreams as the people, land and their ways are devastated by the Civil War. In the end it seems the only way to honor the story.More than anything, we are reminded the most important thing for a son is to be recognized by his father.I have a soft cover, but I read this book on my Kindle, Being able to call the dictionary up at will was a help for understanding this book."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"As William Faulkner handed his finished manuscript of \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" to his friend to read, Faulkner said something along the lines of 'this is the best American novel written yet' (I paraphrase). I first saw this brazen statement upon finishing the novel, and while I truly loved the book and everything about it, that statement still irritated me: why would anyone ever say something so pretentious? However, once I looked at the publishing date, and gave it some thought, I concluded that Faulkner's statement, however pretentious it might have been, was completely accurate. \\"Absalom!\\" is my fifth favorite novel, and the only novels that precede it are either not American or written after 1936 when \\"Absalom!\\" was published. Thus, yes, it IS the best American novel written before 1936; it's that good.I've read Faulkner's \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" and \\"As I Lay Dying,\\" both of which were excellent in their own ways, and I've heard respectable cases stating that either of those novels are his best. But they're really not. \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" is, without a doubt, Faulkner's best novel. His most intelligent characters, originating from \\"The Sound and the Fury,\\" (Quentin Compson, Shreve, and Jason Compson Sr.) return to this novel, narrating a tragic story that sums up the decay of the South and its clinging people. People. Yes, this story is about people: what they do and why they do it. Thomas Sutpen's tragedy is seen indirectly through the eyes of several characters--whether Miss Rosa or Quentin or Mr. Compson or Shreve--and the reader has to find a way to trust these characters on the information they provide.Ultimately, it's Faulkner's incredibly powerful style that pulls the entire novel together. Often using page-long sentences to express ideas and thoughts, Faulkner is able to communicate with such descriptive language that the reader becomes engulfed entirely in the work. \\"Absalom!\\" is doubtless Faulkner's magnum opus, comparable in quality to Steinbeck's \\"East of Eden\\" and Dostoevsky's \\"The Brothers Karamazov.\\" There are only a handful of books in history written better.

That is because it is a searing, shocking and truly unsurpassed work of art.At the heart of this novel is a struggle for identity. How do we understand our history. In these days of \\"evil-doers\\" and the axis of \\"evil\\", we are often deluged with a biased media's quest to simplify historical conflicts of identity. Likewise, Quentin Compson is intrigued and repulsed by the history of the South. Is the South \\"America\\"?

Judith, Sutpen's daugther is a new Antigone who must bury one of her two brothers when they feud. Faulkner's Southern agrarian lifestyle, and gentle humility in the face of nature(and correspondingly, our natures) is somewhat lacking in the flippant Beat generation through the electronic generation.

In this way, I gained two unexpected bonuses. For one, I got right with the rhythm of the novel, and for another I gained a glimpse of a major Faulkner strategy. --Which is to refer to things in the early part of the book that do not happen or indeed become clear for another fifty pages or more. Faulkner writes about these later events as if we, the reader, know fully as much about them as he does. This isn't a simple foreshadowing, either, the kind you read in short story class. For first time readers --especially assigned readers-- it can be a perplexing read.Absalom Absalom is, or can be, a lifelong relationship of sorts --complete with commitment, long-gestating revelations and things that mean very much more to you on third and fourth reading than they possibly could have at earlier points in your life."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom!

In this day of Stephen King and John Grisham, it is extraordinary and eye-opening to come across a writer of such talent and imagination, a twentieth century authors long-forgotten to many of today's readers, but, perhaps, on par with very few. Only Proust springs to mind as a companion on the hilltop.What makes this book so frustrating is the very thing that makes it so succesful. His use of flashback without announcing it as flashback, his use of foreshadowing that appears to be simply the black mark a tree has made on the ground, thrown there by the sun through no fault of the tree, unless, of course, you consider the tree guilty for simply being there.I consider &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; to be not only Faulkner's greatest work (challenged, perhaps, given my mood fluctuations, by &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;), but one of the great works of this century.

People read his books not mostly because of the story -- but actually for his narrative, for his writing. Understanding the story is a bonus.Regarded as one of his most difficult books --and virtually, all his books are difficult -- \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" is one of the most important novels published in the 20 Century in any language. With this book, the writer went beyond what he had done with books like \\"The Sound and the Fury\\", \\"As I lay Dying\\" and \\"Light in August\\". \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" is Faulkner in extreme.Here he perfects his experience in narrative -- that's why all reader's concentration is not enough. Unintroduced characters pop up, the narrative brings them (namely Charles Bon, Walsh Jones...) as if the reader were familiar with them. That is one of challenges. At first it is not clear who this people are, but once readers keep moving and gathering information those people start to make sense. Narrator also changes without much warning.With \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" Faulkner also develops more his stream-of- consciousness technique. In this device the inner experience of a character in a scene is contrasted with the scene's outward appearance. This is considered his greatest achievements.In this novel, the writer tries to exposure the moral crisis that led to the destruction of the South. \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" tells the story of a man Sutpen trying to forge a dynasty. It also is the exploitation of individuals can guide or control their destinies and win an external force or fate. As one characters believes, the protagonist's story is an example of a great and powerful man brought down by a hostile fate.To tell this battle, Faulkner uses multiple points of view that add or even contradict each other. For some, like Miss Rosa, Sutpen is a demon, the supernatural force of evil. While for Mr Compson he is a courageous and admirable man. Who are we supposed to believe in? Miss Rosa knew him, while Mr Compson's father was the one who was acquaintance with Sutpen. It is up to each reader to reach his/her own conclusion, or even take sides.One thing is certain, Faulkner has written one of the most challenging books even written. But in this case, against to what one character say, you cant beat them: you just flee. But there is no reason to flee. It is impossible to beat Faulkner so let yourself be immersed in his prose and be seduced by his work. A book that deserves multiple reads."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Absalom, Absalom! The title treks back to the lament that King David has for his very treacherous very dead son, Absalom. The title parallels events in the book that relate very closely to the power of a family members deviancy. Faulkner takes the reader of this novel on a truely literary adventure. Faulkner's structure is incredibly complex, sometimes leaving this reader far behind eating dust, but just when a burn out on the book is close Faulkner rekindles the hunger for more. The complexity of the novel starts from the very beginning. Immediately the reader is thrown into a story of lies, hatred, and fisticuffs between characters. Once I thought I had a grasp on the story taking place with Thomas Sutpen and the other characters, my feet are pulled out from underneith. The story is much deeper and darker than I had imagined. Based in Northern Mississippii, this novel takes the reader through the southern countryside during the Civil War. The story revolves around the tangled lies and dark secrets that the Sutpen family has twisted itself into. Every page holds a new clue or fact that makes the reader hunger for more. A great book."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"I probably would never have touched any book by Faulkner - the sentiment that seems to be unconsciously passed down from generation to generation is that Faulkner is dense to the point of impenetrability (is that a word?) - if I hadn't had to read &quot;Absalom, Absalom&quot; for a class on American literature. I'm glad I took the class; this book was a wonderful surprise. It brought me back to the pure joys of reading, the delight I feel any time I tackle something truly meaty. Admittedly, &quot;Absalom, Absalom&quot; is confusing, even schizophrenic, in its multiple narrators and its page-long sentences. You can't read it half-heartedly; I had to turn off the stereo and retreat to the quiet of my room to give it my full attention. And I was blown away. There is so much here for a literature lover to delve into. I won't even bother offering a synopsis - it wouldn't make much sense, and you should just read it anyway. I've heard people say that one shouldn't read &quot;Absalom, Absalom&quot; for their first Faulkner experience, and I can see why: this book is hard work. Still, it has inspired me to explore the rest of Faulkner's bibliography. And to read other books I was hesitant to read before. And it reminded me why I love to read. Not bad for a book I was dreading."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Absalom Absalom has all the markings of a great classic, and it is considered by many to be one of Faulkner's greatest works. It is worth reading, but if you are going to read only one of Faulkner's books, I think Go Down Moses is far better. Both novels are written in a sort of stream-of-consciousness manner, but the prose in Go Down Moses seems tighter. In Go Down Moses every word counts, while in Absalom there is a great deal that I would have trimmed if I were the author. Another thing that bothers me about Absalom is that everyone speaks (and thinks) in almost exactly the same style of prose--there is almost no variation between the way characters think, which is in long run-on sentences, and the way they speak to others, which is likewise in long run-on sentences full of similies and metaphors (some of which do not seem to make sense, and some of which are very good). I also found it annoying that I could sometimes read for pages before figuring out who was talking (or thinking). The stream of consciousness writing style is good when handled with skill, and in my opinion it is handled with more skill in Go Down Moses."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Faulkner masterfully mixes narratives and chronology in creating an epic tragedy that permeates the space and time of the era of Thomas Sutpen et al. Certainly one of Faulkner's most challenging novels, ABSALOM, ABSALOM is also one of his most rewarding. For those new to Faulkner, this might not be the best starting point. I'd recommend AS I LAY DYING or THE UNVANQUISHED as first reads.Shreve: \\"The South. Jesus. No wonder you folks all outlive yourselves by years and years and years.\\""},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"He came from the far mountains of Appalachia, trudging down range after range till he reached the rich, fertile lands of coastal Virginia to grow up poor, in a shack, with less dignity than even a house slave of that distant, fecund time when imagination ruled more than facts, when he (a boy) could dream of fame and fortune in the legendary West Indies and, daring, hoping, actually set sail for such fabled isles to wrest, by courage and by native cleverness, the position he saw before him, dancing unreachable before his potent desire that later, in Mississippi, on a hundred square miles of swamp with only his own brute strength and a band of rough slaves, would carve out a plantation in the old, genteel Southern style, a style that he embraced as an outsider, who was never accepted, never allowed in to the circle of locals-even pelted with vegetables and threatened with arrest when he dared to marry a local girl-because he had formerly trudged down those far blue mountains, bore some resemblance to white trash, but worst of all had not been born among them (the folk of Yoknapatawpha County, renowned in American literature these many decades) and so having dared, having fought over the years to ensure his progeny a place at the top, was brought down, utterly destroyed, by early deeds, and by racial separatism, which in that faroff day, was considered more important than incest.Well, folks, if you can stand many more sentences more daunting than my above miserable effort, if you like Jackson Pollock in art, you will love ABSALOM, ABSALOM !, one of the great novels of American literature. It is a thick dreaming; figures looming up through the dark, redolant masses of verbiage, marked, even scarred by inevitability, but veiled in mystery, awful conclusions to be revealed just around the corner---on the next page perhaps. Jackson Pollock's best paintings pull the viewer in, the depth is astounding, the effect stunning. Faulkner's novels, at their best, are the same. That intense, magic splatter of words turning into a flood. The tales of doomed aspirations, \\"currents of retribution and fatality\\", the corruption, violence, and murky destiny of crocodilian proportions lying in wait for the craftiest, most potent striver. Faulkner's plots seem to be predictable-and they are in terms of unhappy endings-but the twists remain fascinating, the ways in which you learn them, always impressive. There is nobody like Faulkner, who can weave tales of family disasters, hubris, incest, and racism that appall and amaze at the same time. He is truly one of the great novelists of world literature and in my humble opinion, the best ever produced by the USA.P.S. The racial images and language of this novel are unpleasant. Faulkner wrote before the days of political correctness and his words can be ugly. I took this in the same vein as \\"Merchant of Venice\\" or other historic literature that uses stereotypical images. Faulkner knew that racism was the curse of the South, and perhaps he extended it to the whole country, but he portrayed the South as it was, not as we would like it to have been."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Absalom, Absalom! is Faulkner's great novel of the rise and fall of the Sutpen dynasty and a great allegory of the rise and fall of the Old South. It should be noted that first of all this is probably Faulkner's greatest and most difficult work.The book told through three interconnected narratives tells the life story of Thomas Sutpen. The story parallels the rise of the Old South. The narratives are not straight forward and present a constant challenge to the reader. But if the reader does not close the book in despair the rewards are great indeed.The mood of the storytelling alone is worth the price of admission here. The long flowing sentences are marvels and testaments to Faulker's skill as a writer. The narrative drive makes reading the book almost like reading Greek tragedy. We gets views of Sutpens life from several townspeople and also across generations.This is the first book that I've read in a long time that made me feel like I had accomplished something when I finished it. You don't so much read this novel as you become lost in it. Jump in get your feet wet and prepare for some of the most intense Southern gothic that you are ever likely to read."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"My favorite book used to be The Sound and the Fury, but Absalom! Absalom! simply blew that away! A novel of themes dating back to the Bible and Greek tragedies--love, hubris, fratricide, incest--juxtaposed with the most peculiarly American of settings. Despite what many readers might say (my one friend said this was the first and last book she's started reading that she could simply not finish), it's not that diffiuclt once you get in the rhythm--reading aloud to yourself helps as well. While I would place this at the top of my &quot;greatest books ever written&quot; list, I would not recommend it to a first-time Faulkner reader. I'd read (in this order) The Unvanquished, As I Lay Dying, The Sound and the Fury, Go Down Moses, and Light in August before tackling Absalom! The Unvanquished is probably your best bet to start out on--its stream of consciousness style is not nearly as extreme as in Sound, Absalom, or even As I Lay. This book is worth all the page-long sentences and multiple voices...It's the finest work of not just Faulkner but of American writers as a whole."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"I struggled through this aggravating yet breathtaking book, but I don't think very many people can say they've read it and not struggled through it for Faulkner is still experimenting with style, and in this novel, considered by many to be his masterpiece, he does this by writing confusing page-long sentences for which he became famous (or should I say infamous) - this overall effect, combined with Faulkner's overuse of SAT vocabulary, makes the book a hard but worthwhile read; some read it and love every word of it, some read the first fifty pages and say it's \\"unreadable\\" - I happened to really enjoy it, but then again, I am a big Faulkner fan, and these sentences I'm writing are written in the same style Faulkner uses in Absalom, Absalom! - so if you think this style is annoying, don't even pick up this book! The story itself is told from a twisted angle: Quentin Compson (yes, the same Quentin Compson from The Sound and the Fury) hears the story of Thomas Sutpen's life and of his desire to forge a dynasty in Jefferson, Missisippi, a desire which failed due to the actions of Sutpen's children and of Sutpen himself - this story is told to Quentin from various different members of the Jefferson community (each account is slightly twisted or bias, and the reader, along with Quentin, is left to patch the \\"true\\" story together from the myriad accounts) in an attempt by Faulkner to show how a community tells and twists a story as it passes through the town - Faulkner masterfully succeeds at this, but in doing so, he only gives the reader enough information to just keep the story going, and things happen later in the book that explain the mysteries in the beginning. I recommend this book if you DON'T read for quick, coherent plot development, but rather, if you like hearing stories told in unique ways, if you like figuring out what's happening on your own instead of having everything being told to you up front, if you can stand mile-long, ungrammatically correct sentences, and if you like Faulkner (warning, this is NOT a suitable introduction for a reader who is new to Faulkner), otherwise I recommend you stay away from this book, and if you really want to read Faulkner, start with something easier, like Light in August, or even As I LayDying, then perhaps move on to The Sound and the Fury and finally, when you think you can handle it, challenge yourself and move onto the confusing but rewarding world of Faulkner's most twisted work, Absalom, Absalom!"},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"I am glad to have read Absalom, Absalom!. The unknowable story of Thomas Sutpen and his doomed progeny is haunting, the heavy gothic atmosphere is effective, and I'm certainly not likely to forget it any time soon.On the other hand, I have to say, by no means did I actually enjoy the process of reading Absalom, Absalom!. The Sound and the Fury, Light in August--those I actually got pleasure out of reading. Absalom, Absalom!, I did not. I won't deny that there is some brilliant writing on display here, the sort of thing that makes you pump your fist and shout &quot;yeah! Go William!&quot; (c'mon, I know I'm not the only one--'fess up), but more often than not, the prose just seems convoluted and tangled, for no other reason than that the man wanted to display his virtuosity. More often than not, this does not work, and sometimes it actively damages the novel. Regard, for instance, the following passage:&quot;...because I had learned nothing of love, not even parents' love--that fond dear constant violation of privacy, that stulification of the burgeoning and incorrigible I which is the meed and due of all mammalian meat, became not mistress, not beloved, but more than even love; I became all polymath love's androgynous advocate (117)Yes indeed: polymath love's androgynous advocate. Faulkner would seem to be going for the 'bad prog rock lyrics' effect here. Even if you can figure out what this is supposed to mean, the fact remains: it looks damned silly, a clear case of complexity for complexity's sake. Sometimes less is more, Bill.So no, slogging my way through three hundred pages of this stuff was not an enjoyable task. And yet, for some reason, it really does stick with you, as previously noted. I'm still not sure I'd recommend it, though. I suspect that if it's your first Faulkner, it will also be your last. If you have read others of the man's works (both of the aforementioned novels come highly recommended by me), and you have a high tolerance for literary self-indulgence, you may find it worthwhile, but I would take all the rave reviews on this site with a grain of salt: everyone likes the feeling of pride that comes from finishing a book like this, but we shouldn't let that blind us to its very real faults."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"This is Faulkner at his best (and, some would say, least comprehensible). The book integrates Quentin and Shreve (The Sound and the Fury) with Sutpen, the main character, beautifully. If you loved the gloriously neurotic Quentin Compson, this is a must-read book, as well as a beautiful portrait of what Faulkner sees about the American South.However, what sold me on this book, and what made the entire journey through Faulkner's labyrinth of parentheses more than worthwhile, was one line--the final line. The ending of Absalom, Absalom! absolutely blew me away and left me speechless. It was the perfect closing if I have ever read a perfect closing to any book.This is one Faulkner novel a fan should not go without reading, but it's not the one to start with; As I Lay Dying and The Sound and the Fury should be read first (in that order). In addition, it will enhance the reader's enjoyment if s/he first familiarizes him/herself with the Biblical story of Absalom (it's short and it'll help, trust me).This is a book I will keep for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"I'll admit straight off the bat that I'm not a huge fan of stream-of-consciousness narratives. In fact, I dislike such styles more often than I enjoy them. ABSALOM, ABSALOM! was also the first work by William Faulkner that I have ever read, which (judging by the reviews on this site) is apparently not the best place I could have started. Yet despite these potential problems, I quite enjoyed the overall book. There were several places where I found the narrative voice to be quite tedious, but the story was so captivating that these difficulties were well worth struggling through.As I said, I don't usually like the stream-of-consciousness style of writing. When done incorrectly, it can lead to books full of hopelessly incoherent rambling that is neither insightful nor interesting. However, in the case of ABSALOM, ABSALOM!, I'll grudgingly admit that the style does help the story quite a bit. Some of the asides and passages were extremely effective at conveying the atmosphere of the South during the Civil War. The various misconceptions that several characters have (the reader can only gradually piece together the truth) are perfectly true to their personalities and reveal more about the people in this story than the actual events would have. That said, some of the more esoteric portions of the text had me nearly throwing the book across the room in angry confusion. Fortunately for the sake of my library, my walls and my sanity, those more obscure sections are not terribly numerous, and many of them can become penetrable, albeit after the second or third reading.One of the aspects of the novel I most appreciated was Faulkner's ability to set my expectations in one direction, and then completely pull the rug out from under me. There were several major twists and turns that I genuinely did not anticipate. Characters' understandings are fallible, and yet whenever something that someone had said turned out to be false, I never felt cheated. While a lot of the narrative shocks stem from people misunderstanding events from long ago, the mistakes they make are perfectly valid, and I never once felt that Faulkner had deliberately caused people to misconstrue happenings merely to drive the plot.Racism plays a major part in this story, so be prepared to see some language and activities that aren't politically correct. Faulkner is showing racism for exactly what it was at the time, an everyday fact of life, and a concept that was applied randomly and irrationally. He doesn't compromise, but neither does he dwell on this subject. He records it exactly as he saw it, from a perspective that none of his characters have the benefit of sharing.Despite my own apprehension upon reading the first few pages, I ended up quite enjoying ABSALOM, ABSALOM!. It took me a couple of chapters before I got into the rhythm of the prose, but once it clicked in my head I was able to read it with very little problem. If the text looks intimidating at first, I advise you to attempt it anyway to see if you can't wrap your head around it. I managed to make myself understand it, and I am very glad that I didn't simply give up before the end. The symbolism, the tragedy, and the bare emotions - they all contribute to making this a fantastic story. The way that Faulkner manages to portray hopes, dreams, heartbreak, blind ambition, and hubris in a manner than somehow all manages to be perfectly believable is a huge achievement, and something well worth the time it takes to read."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Be warned: The first 100 pages of Absalom, Absalom! are some of the most confusing narration ever written in English. No matter how literate you consider yourself to be, you will have a difficult time in this novel until you get your bearings. There are multiple narrators, and the narrative shifts from one to the other, with little or no warning. However, by the end of the novel my jaw hung open in appreciation for how incredibly well crafted this novel is. In fact, it is almost perfect.The story concerns the rise and fall of Thomas Sutpen, an outsider with a shady past who attempts to build a family dynasty in antebellum Mississippi. The events of his life and those of his children are told in a fascinating style where each narrator gives his or her take on each of the different events. Seeing a scene a third or fourth time from a different perspective, with a new twist of information, evokes an eerie feeling of inevitability. If you have ever seen CITIZEN KANE or PULP FICTION you know what I am referring to. Faulkner was brilliant for his deep-lunged prose style, for his fascinating plots, but most especially for his ability to understand the events he creted to such a degree that he can keep his trump cards hidden and dance around THE TRUTH for 250 pages and then drop the A-Bomb on his audience and leave them floored, slapping their heads for their failure to recognize where the story was going all along. This is a masterpiece of style. I can't give it a stronger recommendation."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Although I've read several of Faulkner's books, this was the first to leap out at me as indicative of his genius. The work that must have gone into it is staggering. Absalom, Absalom! is Southern tragedy at its very best, replete with dark meditations on the South's Civil War legacy and a story so fascinating, so magnificently plotted that it leaps out at the reader despite Faulkner's often mind-bending prose and endless parade of parentheses. Thomas Sutpen is the type of tragic character Shakespeare would have written had he been alive and living in Mississippi at the time--a self-made man whose ruthless, myopic vision of forming a family dynasty is destroyed through chance and his own grave mistakes. Faulkner unravels this dark tale with perfect timing, leaving the most tantalizing, informative details to the very end. The whole novel possesses a kind of brooding atmosphere which lasts to the closing words. I would not suggest this as the first Faulkner book to read--better to spend some time on the less important works in order to get a feel for his style, otherwise you will miss too much. And even then, it helps to keep a finger on the family tree at the back of the book to get the characters straight. But it's well worth it--this is one of the finest, most introspective and fascinating American novels I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"When I was in college, wandering the aisles looking for a book for some other assignment, I would often find myself standing in front of Mr. Faulkner, and I would often find myself thereafter seated on the floor, flipping the pages of this book, marvelling at that first sentence that lasts for two pages. This book reads like Beethoven to me, and I'll admit that I'm in love with it.First, it's not an easy or a light read. I've read this book three times all the way through (I've read chunks of it countless times), and I can't say that I understand everything. There are a few different narrators, and the narrators themselves will often slip into other voices - Quentin telling Shreve the story that he heard from his father of what Sutpen told the elder Compson twenty years ago - that sort of thing.Let's talk about the basic plot. There's a chronology included in this edition (I believe) that helps. Yoknapatawpha County, of course, and a stranger moves into town named Thomas Sutpen. Brings a strange bunch of wild slaves, claims a hundred square miles, builds a house, and then tries to find a wife. Marries the daughter of a respected local man, has some children, and then the Civil War comes along. Eldest son rides off to war, happens to fall into communion with his abandoned half-brother, and chaos ensues. It turns out that Sutpen is himself not your average guy, and we hear some very interesting stories about his family, his history, and the lives of his children.I wouldn't recommend this book to a first-time Faulkner reader. If you want a good Faulkner novel that isn't too dense, try Light in August, or maybe Sanctuary. Both are relatively straightforward. If you've read either of these, or if you just want to dive in, this one is probably his best.What really \\"gets\\" me about this book is the way that we are made to admire, respect, even love the horrific creature that is Thomas Sutpen. He's a fascinating character, and the passages retelling his personal history are alive with tension. You can imagine this man barricaded in the home of a white planter, facing doom at the hands of a slave rebellion; you can see the weird light in his face when he puts down his rifle, opens the door, and steps out into the \\"darkness\\" to \\"subdue\\" the slave revolt. It's a kind of meditation on the nature of colonialism, tied into myths of patriarchy and gender, with a shot at Christianity stirred in for good measure. I suppose that sounds garbled - but believe me, the fact that Faulkner can effectively blend all of this into one story speaks to his genius. What a book."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Faulkner's most compelling trait is he doesn't tell a story--he involves the reader in it so the reader, in effect, pieces it together in his mind as he reads it. It's hard work, but hard work is always more rewarding than the slop that passes for much of fiction these days (as well as back then). Faulkner makes you work, and this brilliant story of a doomed Southern family is a brilliant allegory for the entire South. It's about the human condition, and no one explains and explores it better than Faulkner. Read it and you'll understand...."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Read this and you will prove to yourself why Faulkner won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Absalom, Absalom! is his most ambitious novel not only continuing his remarkable experimentation with style and narrative form but also seeking to unravel the complexities of southern history. This novel pushes the limits of story telling in order to expose the deeply ingrained racism of southern identity. A real challenge to the reader, we must listen carefully to the echoes that run throughout this labyrinthine tale. Any person who considers themselves literate must read this book. My advice is read the first ten pages aloud to get the style and form and after that it will be clear sailing. And well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom!

Forget the people who say it is &quot;difficult.&quot; If you grew up in the south, if you listened to relatives tell the same story over and over again, each time changing the details slightly, always making the old material seem fresh, you will have no problem reading this book. When I picked this book up at age 16, I literally could not put it down. I read it on the bus, in class, between classes, late into the night. The ending is especially effective and poignant, so be sure to read all the way through."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"The legacy of slavery is shared by all Americans, but it is among American Southerners that this sin and its place in American history is most intensely felt. One need only to have been born or raised in the South to have this legacy reinforced almost on a daily basis: the statue of the Confederate soldier in the squares of most Southern towns and cities, the remnants of the plantation system still visible in some parts of the South (and now tourist attractions), and most importantly, the descendants of those slaves who still live and work in the region that once legitimized (both economically and morally) the bondange of their ancestors.To William Faulkner, living in 1930s Mississippi these signs of the past must have been much more intense than they are today and displayed an immediacy that can hardly be understood now. Surely, he must have known Confederate veterans as he was growing up and the history of the ante-bellum South and the war that brought it down was still fresh in the mind. It was with this background that he began writing his masterpiece. Faulkner had dealt with slavery and its aftermath in earlier works (Sound and the Fury and Light in August) but treatd the subject obliquely paying more attention to the malaise that afflicted his characters rather than to the source of that malaise. With this novel he is concerned with the cause.To put it simply, this is his best work and probably one of the top three American novels ever written. It is a complex creation intermingling multi-character monologues with some of his most beautiful steam of consciousness prose; it is difficult and obtuse; it is undeniably brilliant and beautiful; and it's relevance is universal. Although the pivotal location of the novel is the north woods of Mississippi, it is applicable to any location where denial of humanity and the integrity of the individual is commonplace, whether this denial be based on religion, race, or on some artificially constructed idea (such as fear) where the intent is to divide rather than to unite. Come to think of it, given the political realities of the time, this book should be required reading."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"This was my first approach to Faulkner, and a very satisfying one, though experts advise on NOT starting with this one, as it is one of the most complex and obscure of his novels. However hard to read, it is very rewarding, since Faulkner's prose is so intense, dark and realistic. Clue after clue, the reader puts together the pieces of a nightmarish puzzle, a story of ambition, sin, revenge, envy, hard work, disappointment and tragedy. Indeed, it reminds of a Greek tragedy, one that takes place during several decades, in the torrid scenery of the Yoknapatawpha county in the American Deep South.The story is totally phantasmagoric; it is the account and the reflection of the diverse -and improbable- narrators, who imprint their own passions and longings as they build the story. The Sutpen saga is a journey of madness and perversion, close in its own way to Russian classical stories. Just as in Greek tragedy, the main character is Fate. The most disturbing aspect of this novel is the ambiguity which characterizes the narrators.Thomas Sutpen is a man of humble origins in the Appalachians, a man who has suffered rejection and discrimination. But he is terribly strong-willed and so he travels to the South looking for fortune. He dreams of building an empire and a dynasty that will prevail and avenge him for his misfortunes. He arrives at Yoknapatawpha and buys some land, which he, by virtue of hard work, turns into an emporium. But he is also a dark and violent man, who rejects his first wife and son for having black blood in their veins, an action that will come back to haunt him.The main narrator is Quentin Compson, the son of a neighboring family, who years later recounts the story to a roommate in Harvard, so building a parallel story of drama and death.Even if it is a challenging read, it is much worth it, since Faulkner develops a very powerful narrative with a strong prose and a great gift to create moods and sceneries. It leaves you with the sensation that you have read an epic of grand proportions, a &quot;War and Peace&quot; with much war and little peace, without balls nor nobility."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"With every William Faulkner book I have one criteria as to whether or not I'm going to keep reading past page 50 - is it worth the headache. Faulkner has a style that rivals Joyce for sheer incomprehensibility. Sure, he comes from a time of experimental writing, but he survived where dozens of writers disappeared into obscurity.The reason why he survived is because he plays games but he has something to say. This tale of a Southern family gone bad resonates long after its finished. Incest, murder and slavery plague these people and the world is in constant decay. Like the wisteria that shows up throughout the novel, the family is pretty on the outside but rotting from within.This is a beautiful book full of pathos and angst, and thankfully the publisher or author provides the cast of characters with time line in back. Now this will ruin the surprise of the last few chapters, but Faulkner is a writer that works best if you know where you're going so you can enjoy the stops along the way."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"This book will change the way you think about US history. After reading this astonishing novel I now understand Toni Morrison's high estimation of Faulkner as a novelist. Indeed, Faulkner and Morrison are the two indispensable authors of the 20th century. Like Morrison's \\"Paradise\\" Faulkner's \\"Supten's Hundred\\" is an attempt to create a kind of American utopia that goes horrifically awry. (Not the least because it is built on the evils of slavery.) This wonderful novel that gives the reader a sober, unromantic picture of slavery and the Old South. Remember that Absalom, Absalom! was published around the same time that the film \\"Gone with the Wind\\" was released. \\"Gone with the Wind\\" gave Americans a false, romantic portrait of the Old South which continues to wreak havoc with our efforts to come to grips with our history. In contrast, Faulkner's lucid prose forces the reader to come to grips with the price that white supremacy has exacted on the society. The key to understanding this novel is to remember that Faulkner, like Morrison, was deeply fascinated by the way that ordinary human beings remember events. The story that is told in this book is a tragedy that is worthy of Melville's Moby Dick and Morrison's Beloved.At the same time, it would be a mistake to view this novel--or any of Faulkner's novels--as a \\"southern novel\\" because the themes explored are universal questions that continue to mark the human condition."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"This is a complex compelling novel by a monumental son of the South who uses all of his considerable talents to bring us to a coherent understanding of the deeper meanings of the South and the thing that America itself is most neurotic about, race. However, he does not slam us in the face with it, but instead quietly slides it into the backs of our heads with a stiletto.The first clue that something big and scary must be rumbling about in the subtext of this novel is when the entire plot is outlined in the first chapter of the book? The rest of the book essentially is just tying up all of the loose ends and details. The second clue lies in the title, \\"Absalom, Absalom,\\" which is a reference to the biblical allegory about the third son of David who was murdered by his half brother, for the rape of their sister. And the final clue is in the way Faulkner repeatedly rolls the dice trying to give the main protagonist, Thomas Sutpen, a chance at redemption for his troubled soul, and yet the dice keep coming up \\"craps.\\"Thomas Sutpen, by anyone's assessment was \\"certifiable grade A white trash,\\" who mysteriously appears out of nowhere in the Mississippi Hamlet of Jefferson with several dozen slaves, a hundred square miles of land (bought from the Indians), and a French Architect, but otherwise no visible means of how he might have come into such wealth? The story that unfolds in chapter one (and is only fleshed-out in the rest of the book) is the rapid rise out of nowhere from \\"white trash\\" to \\"white success\\" and on to \\"white respectability\\" of one Thomas Sutpen and his multigenerational dynastic family of misfits.And while the table had already long been set before the Civil War for this drama/tragedy, it did not get played out nor did the real fun begin until afterwards. Faulkner uses the Civil War together with his considerable craft like a cultural rotor-tiller: to break up, break through, breakdown, and turn over and expose in exquisite and unmistakably honest details, the underbelly of southern culture and the southern way of life. It does not take the reader long to understand that Faulkner speaks fluent \\"abstract-ese,\\" that is to say he deals only in large abstract ideas, metaphors, allegories, etc., and thus serves up the Sutpen family as just a paradigmatic \\"stand-in\\" for the troubling racist and thus inhuman and evil Southern white way of life (If not indeed the whole of America). Lost of the Civil War to Faulkner seems incidental and small in comparison to the cosmic sins committed everyday in the southern way of life.The riddle of the novel is left as an exercise for the reader, whose job it seems is to take the pieces, the partial views, the fragments and shards uncovered by Faulkner's rotor-tiller, and by the end of the novel, be able to paste them together into a coherent and meaningful whole picture of white southern life? The verdict of this novel is that it cannot be done? Just as was the companion case in the bible, the moral chaos and confusion that reigned in the South required a god to intervene, and god it seemed has intervened on the side of the North (i.e., on the side of normal humanity).It is a tribute to Faulkner's high level of craftsmanship that his construction is general enough for each mind to come up with its own resulting picture of the whole. One such whole is the simplistic one that once was the Black Muslim Malcolm X's mantra: to the effect that the White man is a devil. Period.Here Faulkner would not disagree with Malcolm characterization on this point if only it is restricted to the South. For what is common to their parallel constructions is that with racism, there always comes the torrent of distortions: of power, violence, murder, religious and racial hatred and hypocrisy. And always too it comes with forbidden cross-racial sexual taboos, incest, rape, and a general dulling of all of the sensitivities and sensibilities that lean in the direction of elevating humanity.That is Faulkner's deepest point here. Thus that the Sutpen's tragedy was foreordained. His family's curse in the end has been built into the inhumanity of the southern way of life. And thus was biblical only in the sense that his humanity was trapped inside the false dimension of whiteness, a garment whose meaning is tied up in the knot of false consciousness, hypocrisy, violence, wickedness and racism all of which represent pure evil. 100 stars"},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"...in China, which causes the proverbial tornado in Kansas (a topical subject in itself). Admittedly it is a simplistic formulation, but it is the classic metaphor for the Chaos Theory which states that dynamic systems are highly sensitive to initial conditions. Human life itself is an essential \\"dynamic system,\\" and it seems that Faulkner was a proponent of the Chaos Theory, in his writings, even before the theory was formulized. InIntruder in the Dust, the \\"initial condition\\" was a young, cold white boy being offered warmth, and a plate of collard greens. Faulkner depicts this scene at the beginning of \\"Intruder.\\" In \\"Absalom, Absalom,\\" one must read more than half the book before realizing the \\"initial condition\\" that set all else in motion, in the form of a Greek tragedy: being asked to go around to the back door.This is a great novel; a quintessential American masterpiece. The \\"great\\" themes of life are there: striving, hubris, the choices made in the mating rituals, hierarchical social relations, the means by which the few maintain control over the many, war and peace, aging, family relations, and on and on. Themes that transcend the American condition, and apply to all societies. But few novels speak so directly to that uniquely American issue: its \\"original sin,\\" slavery and race relations. This issue permeates the book. It has rarely been stated as starkly: \\"So it's the miscegenation, not the incest, which you cant bear. Henry doesn't answer.\\" Maybe, just maybe, this question was answered in the last election. Imagine, if you will, the sheer strength of \\"black blood.\\" Just a bit, one-eight or even much less, makes a person \\"black.\\" Faulkner explores this idea with more than one of his characters.As a narrative, well, there are actually several narratives, it starts in 1909, with Miss Rosa Coldfield sitting in \\"a dim hot airless room with the blinds all closed and fastened for forty-three summers...latticed with yellow slashes full of dust motes...\\" Wisteria makes its appearance on the first page also, but one must wait for the fireflies, an essential element of Southern summers, to make their appearance later in the book. Miss Coldfield is intent on telling the story of the Sutpen's, and her interactions, as well as her family's, with them. The receptive vehicle, soon bound for Harvard, and those cold northern winters, is Quentin Compson, grandson of the person who first befriended Thomas Sutpen when he arrived on \\"the frontier,\\" which was Northern Mississippi in the 1830's. Faulkner is demanding of the reader: long convoluted sentences rarely duplicated, just a hint of a particular relationship or incident, and then he moves on, returning and backfilling, explaining. The author dazzles with his style, which rests on a solid basis of content concerning the human condition. I savored it like a fine after dinner drink: small doses of 20, 30, at most 50 pages at a time. In doing so, I was richly rewarded. I even learned what an \\"octoroon\\" is, a term that should slide into the dustbin of history. And who would have ever thought of them as \\"sparrows,\\" living in New Orleans?Another \\"topical\\" subject is Haiti, still poor, forevermore? White men going there, and becoming rich. Need to learn French? \\"...because Grandfather asked him why he didn't get himself a girl to live with and learn it the easy way...\\" Are Caribbean planters a model for Southern society? Sutpen obtained, earned, or stole his \\"grub stake,\\" take your pick, and built a mansion in the middle of his hundred square miles of land. The reader struggles to keep up with the dates; at least I did, knowing the \\"doom\\" is coming in 1861. War, a losing war, which will haunt the proud survivors. Faulkner keeps the war mainly in the background, but is still insightful: there is the year of marching backward, towards Richmond, trying to slow down Sherman as he marches up from devastated Georgia. On Southern military leadership Faulkner says: \\"...because of generals who should not have been generals, who were generals not through training in contemporary methods or aptitude for learning them, but by the divine right to say \`Go there' conferred upon them by an absolute caste system;\\" Faulkner had the wisdom, obtained from his personal experience in World War I, to identify one strain in the forces which cause wars: \\"...that wars were sometimes created for the sole aim of settling youth's private difficulties and discontents.\\"Why is Miss Coldfield so angry? What was the insult she experienced at Sutpen's One Hundred after the war? I do not doubt that a good 20 PhD's have been awarded based on the theme of women in Faulkner's writings. Absalom is a rich mine of material, not only for Rosa Coldfield's anger, but the circumstances of Ellen Coldfield's marriage, the unfailing loyalty of Clytemnestra Sutpen to her dubious family role, the bucolic innocence of Judith Sutpen perched on her pedestal.Based on some of the negative reviews, I can only say that it is indeed a pleasure to read this book for the pleasure, and not as a school assignment or a PhD thesis. With all due deference to Amazon, I purchase my copy from the excellent bookstore \\"on the square\\" in Oxford in April of this year. It was the weekend; we didn't have reservations and there was \\"no room at the inn,\\" (any of them) as the town filled for a spring college football game. The bookstore proudly displayed another \\"native son,\\" Richard Ford, but you have to go upstairs, past the coffee bar, to the very front of the store to find the Faulkner selection. No doubt some of the football fans could have explained why: Sure, they are proud of him, in an ambivalent sort of way, but he did tell far too much about them.An essential read, and even an essential re-read, in five years time, given the allocation. Absolutely 6-stars."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"\\"Absalom, Absalom!, in my opinion the greatest of Faulkner's novels, is probably the least well understood of all his books...\\" so begins Cleanth Brooks essay History and the Sense of the Tragic in his fine collection of Faulkner criticism William Faulkner: The Yoknapatawpha Country Experience.The problem frequently comes in getting a handle on Thomas Sutpen, who seeks to build the image of the great house after he and his father suffer the humiliation of being denied entry at the front door and are instructed to go around to the back. From that moment, Sutpen, in his terrible innocence sets out about constructing the vision burned into his mind. Brooks points out that Sutpen's innocence is that of the modern man, with links to characters such as Oedipus and Macbeth.In my estimation, Sutpen's innocence is that of the characteristic that distinguishes America and like a crazed karma leads us into impossible pursuits: the innocence that we can recreate ourselves in an image that is divorced from our history and our true selves. Brooks no longer is among us, so I'm safe in saying I don't think he would disagree with my take. Sutpen's innocence is the innocence that views Vietnam as a domino that can be redefined in America's image, or Iraq or Egypt as potential Jeffersonian democracies, or the recreation of America without poverty as achievable aims.\\"It is this innocence about the nature of reality that persists, for Sutpen 'believed that the ingredients of morality were like the ingredients of a pie or cake and once you had measured them and balanced them and mixed them and put them into the oven it was all finished and nothing but pie or cake could come out\\" (p.236), Brooks quotes old man Compson's take on Sutpen. Sound like some recent American leaders who think that to bake a democracy you set up a legislature, some courts, an executive body; hold some elections and voila: democracy?For Sutpen the ingredients were: \\"I had a design. To accomplish it I should require money, a house, a plantation, slaves, a family - incidentally of course, a wife. I set out to acquire these asking no favor of any man\\" (p.263).Not unlike Ahab, Sutpen's endeavor ends in an unmitigated failure.For just Sutpen's story, A,A! would be an incredible book. But Faulkner wove into this Sutpen's spawn, including the illigimate and inter-racial Bon, who acts as a foil to help define his father, and Bon's son Charles Etienne de Saint Velery Bon, and Charles' son Jim Bon/Bond, who is unleashed upon the world and a threat to western society's existence according to Shreve, Quentin Compson's roommate at Harvard. The Compsons also importantly are included as is Henry, Sutpen's son by the wife in his recipe.But the women characters are particularly outstanding, especially Clytie the slave mother of Charles, Judith (Henry's sister), and the octoroon (Bon's mistress), who to varying degrees manifest feminine qualities - especially compassion and mystery - in contrast to Sutpen's unbending pursuit of his design, and the universe of men characters orbiting around Sutpen.One final observation: A,A! was published seven years after The Sound and the Fury, which deals with the decay of the emblematic Compson family, culminating in Quentin's suicide. A,A! and TSatF are inextricably linked and inform one another. That A,A! was published so long after TSatF indicates to me that Faulkner wasn't finished with the allegory that put him on the literary math. That he placed A,A! preceding the events of TSaTF is further indication that he meant Sutpen's tale to precede and inform the later story of the Compsons, especially Quentin Compson's suicide.Quentin loses his bearing in time as indicated by the scene in the clock shop (\\"clocks slay time\\" from TSatF) shortly before he drowns himself. In A,A!, Faulkner significantly conflates Sutpen's time/space with Quentin's at Harvard. Or, as Faulkner put it (in Requiem for a Nun): \\"The past is never dead. It's not even past.\\""},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"this is the ultimate in american literature. faulkner's other tales of previous days and people in mississippi are stunning, but 'absalom, absalom' is so transcendent in all it attempts to do, that it clearly identifies itself as THE essential american novel.in case you are somehow unaware, this is another piece in the puzzle of the fictional county in mississippi faulkner created to illustrate the american south in the early twentieth century. more specifically, it is the tale of henry sutpen and his grand design to rule whatever he could. it really is a tragedy of sorts -- sutpen will go to any length to be in control, when he really has no control at all. the story is much to cavernous to describe here.this opus is just another indicator that faulkner was the master of stream of consciousness writing. from miss coldfield's telling of her version of sutpen to quentin compson [yes, quentin from 'the sound and the fury], to shreve mccannon spewing conjecture at quentin in a dorm room in harvard, to the shocking, disturbing end, faulkner's prose keeps the pages ablaze.i once had a teacher who said that reading and understanding this book was much like climbing a mountain. i cannot agree more. digesting faulkner's masterwork is amongst the most rewarding experiences possible via literature. words of warning: don't expect to be blown away the first time through. this book reveals its beauty when it unfolds in subsequent readings.if you are new to faulkner, try 'the sound and the fury' or 'as i lay dying' first, as each serves as perhaps a better introduction to the universe of southern mississippi."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Imagine a line drawn in red dust. A stick dragging through creates mounds on either side that are too small to appreciate. Then the men: people, a conglomeration of classes and sexes, with race usually being white, walking on either side of the line. Then they are standing, yelling curt insults and blasphemies at each other....This sad situation best describes critical appraisal of William Faulkner and his novels. I find myself one of his supporters, though to tell the truth I understand why others don't like him and I can understand their aversion to him. First of all, it isn't that they are less intelligent than Faulkner fans, (V. Nabokov, one of the best literary minds of the 20th century, hated Faulkner's works and called them \\"Corn Cobb Chronicles\\") or that they don't understand the plots. The problem differs for each, and once again I can't blame them....Unnecessary Difficulty is the most often complaint, in fact its the only complaint I can think of off the top of my head. Let me start by saying this book is at heart a mystery story. Quentin Compson is about to go to college, but before he does, Ms. Rosa Coldfield, now nearing the age of ninety, begins telling Quetin a story about a man who tried to create a dynasty in the south before the Civil War. This first part of the story begins Quentin on a quest to find out just what happened to him, and what motivated him....This is Straight-forward enough, given that each source he goes to (Rosa, his father Jason, and his Canadian room mate) have differing personalities and motivations. So there is in fact little challenge to those that can think for themselves about what will happen in the book. So, what can Faulkner do? Simple, the same pompous style that would become the bane for readers for years to come can be utilized here as an artistic tool that provides simultanously the theme and the mood for this great novel. Those that can keep this in mind may come out with a sense of awe when they finish those final words and the inherent revelation that was staring them in the face the whole time....What effect does all this acheive? A sense that the book we're reading becomes a strange work of art both modern and ancient. A sense that the weight of our book comes from it's pulp and the dust that had settled on it. The first effect is Bafflement, then Embattlement, and finally Beauty."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Absalom, Absalom! is the story of a legend and the people who tell it over and over again. In September 1909, 20-year-old Quentin Compson goes to visit Rosa Coldfield, an older woman in his hometown of Jefferson, Mississippi. Miss Rosa has summoned him to listen to her version of the legend of Thomas Sutpen. That same night, Quentin goes over the story again with his father, Mr. Compson, who tells the story from a different perspective. Five months later, when he goes to Harvard, he reinvents the story with his roommate, Shreve.In 1833, Thomas Sutpen came to Jefferson and built, without any help but his own wild, superhuman will, an enormous mansion on 100 acres that he swindled from an Indian tribe. With a band of foreign slaves and a French architect, he raises the house and cultivates a plantation. Within a few years he is one of the richest single planters in the county, and he marries the daughter of a local merchant (Rosa's older sister) and has a son and daughter, Henry and Judith. The two children grow up with privilege yet the knowledge that the town resents and despises their father. Henry goes to the University of Mississippi in 1859, and becomes friends with a worldly older student named Charles Bon. He brings Bon home for Christmas and holidays, and soon it is assumed that Bon will marry Judith. But Sutpen recognizes Bon as his own son--the son he abandoned when he discovered that his first wife had black blood. He follows Bon to New Orleans to be sure of this fact, then tells Henry that they cannot be married because Bon is actually Judith's half-brother. Henry refuses to believe his father and will not abandon his friend. They quarrel; Henry repudiates his birthright and leaves. For four years, while the Civil War rages, Henry tries to convince himself that Charles Bon and Judith can be married even if it means incest. He has almost justified it to himself when Sutpen (a colonel for the Confederate Army) calls his son to his tent and tells him that Charles Bon must not marry Judith. Not only is he Judith and Henry's half-brother, but Charles Bon also has black blood.This information repulses Henry in a way that even incest does not. When Charles Bon insists on marrying Judith anyway, goading Henry to do something about it, Henry shoots Charles Bon as they walk up to the gates of Sutpen's Hundred. Then he disappears. Sutpen returns home after the war to a ruined dynasty and a devastated plantation. Determined to start over again, he first tries to marry Rosa Coldfield, then takes up with Milly, the 15-year-old granddaughter of a poor white squatter on his property. Increasingly impoverished and alcoholic, Sutpen insults Milly after she bears his child. Furious, her grandfather kills Sutpen that very day in 1869.After she tells Quentin her version of the story, Rosa asks him to accompany her to Sutpen's Hundred, where Clytie (Sutpen's daughter with a slave woman; she is now in her late 60s) still lives. Clytie has been hiding Henry Sutpen there for four years while he waits to die. Quentin and Rosa discover this when they go to the estate after midnight. Rosa returns to the house three months later with an ambulance for Henry, and Clytie sets fire to the house, killing herself and Henry. No one remains of Sutpen's dynasty but Jim Bond, a mentally-impaired man of mixed blood."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom!

But once you have learnt that the whole story of the Sutpen family is going to be told through a series of interviews between Quentin and several witnesses of the facts related, you can relax and really enjoy it. For me, one of the greatest wonders and sources of joy in this novel was to find the paralelisms between the story of the Sutpen family and that of king David of the Bible. And even though we know what is going to happen with Colonel Sutpen and his offspring (especially the one who stands for Absalom), Faulkner's chilling solution for the conlfict is inevitably amazing. Do I need to add that the paralelism does not only work at the level of the Sutpen family tragedy, but also with the historical setting --the heroic times of the American Civil War in the South?. One of the jewels of universal literature."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom!

Born of poor white stock in what later became West Virginia, as an adolescent he moved with his family to the Tidewater region of Virginia and for the first time saw wealthy planters. This formative experience at the age of fourteen led him to realize the social caste system of the antebellum South, and this experience led him to conceive his \\"design\\" to create a dynasty of wealth and power.\\"Out of quiet thunderclap,\\" Faulkner writes of Sutpen's haunting presence in Miss Rosa's voice, \\"he would abrupt (man-horse-demon) upon a scene peaceful and decorous as a schoolprize water color, faint sulphur-reek still in hair clothes and beard\\" Sutpen with slaves and an architect \\"overrun suddenly the hundred square miles of tranquil and astonished earth and drag house and formal gardens violently out of the soundless Nothing and clap them down like cards upon a table beneath the up-palm immobile and pontific, creating the Sutpen's Hundred, the Be Sutpen's Hundred like the oldentime Be Light\\". Sutpen appears upon the \\"soundless Nothing\\" of earth like some gnostic demiurge. Distorting the invocation \\"Be Light\\" from the book of Genesis, the description of Sutpen's construction on the land 12 miles outside Jefferson shows him calling his own empire into existence with the phrase \\"Be Sutpen's Hundred\\" like a demoted godling trying to rob the creator of franchise.During the war Sutpen's daughters Judith and Clytie along with Aunt Rosa form a cabal at Sutpen's Hundred like three nuns awaiting not Christ's return but Sutpen's. Judith repudiates, but fulfills the spirit of, Sutpen's design by taking in Bon's mulatto son who has yellow fever and dies nursing him. Faulkner has spun an intricate tapestry of polymathic prose. He experiments with characters becoming part of telling the story. The story is told from three views, Rosa Coldfield, Mr. Compson whos father knew Sutpen, and Quentin and Shreve who are college roomates and who tell and imagine parts of the story in their cold, cold room deep into one winter night, \\"the two of them creating between them, out of the rag-tag and bob-ends of old tales and talking, people who perhaps had never existed at all anywhere, who, shadows, were shadows not of flesh and blood which had lived and died but shadows in turn of what were (to one of them at least, to Shreve) shades too, quiet as the visible murmur of their vaporizing breath\\". Reading Absalom, Absalom! is like being lost in a maze turning corners and finding where you have been before but a little different, something added, growing dimensional jigsaw until you hit the exit panting in the cold air, the iron New England dark, saying I could go again like you have been on some phantasmagoric carnival ride."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom!

(The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"William Faulkner's Absalom, Absalom! is perhaps the most profoundly tragic of all his works, recapturing the ancient classical aura of fate and hubris, its fugual, non-linear style circling round and round the central, mythic figure of a man who defied the gods of his land. As always, Faulkner takes his readers into a realm beyond convention and realism, in order to question the most fundamental social laws and dictates, but more importantly to transform a story of revenge, sin, and decay into a symbolic depiction of human nature, its sublime potential and terrifying possibilities.Through the mouths of different narrators, Faulkner tells the story of a man, Thomas Sutpen, who defied the norms of his day in order to carve for himself an immortality of name such as that which the Greeks sought on the battlefields of Troy. The narrators follow the doomed path of this man, sometimes with horror, sometimes with sympathy, depicting the decay and fall of his family. Sutpen's fate is evidence in the last of the tragic dilemma of the South, caught between rival goods of culture and justice, law and right--a dilemma which mirrors that of all of humanity. Faulkner's style, which combines the voices of different characters, constantly circling around, retelling, and interpreting the story, is appropriate to the theme, and to the reality of a situation in which there does not seem to be one valid perspective or interpretation. It is also this retelling which lends the story its mythic quality, giving its characters the stature of ancient heroes no longer seen, but only remembered in stunning and apocalyptic dimensions"},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"The trouble many people seem to have with this book is that it doesn't just jump out at you with some quote-of-the-day morality slogan; you have to find it yourself. And, unfortunantly, maybe there is no moral to the story. Maybe there is no universal purpose that the lives of the Sutphens were meant to bestow on us. But guess what: this is life! This is real! Faulkner chooses to tell this story in a way that suggests that the story is the story. The ACT of telling the story. If you'll notice as you go along, the characters relaying the story are getting further and further away from the actual events, until you get to Shreve and Quinten at Harvard, basically making things up. Yet Faulkner portrays this in such a way as that the reader must realize on his own that maybe what they are saying is not entirely accurate, with no help from the author. This can certainly be a shock to some readers, who expect everything they read to be gospel truth. But, like I said, this is life! How do you know exactly what happened in all the stories you have heard third, forth, fifthand? Or if they even happened at all? This is one of the many aspects of human nature Faulkner explores. There are many others (race, regional identity, family ties, the list goes on).It's simply some of the most brilliant stuff ever written. But, yes, it does take some work. I'm sorry. Everything worth knowing does. As Faulkner says &quot;It simply does not explain.&quot; Even that phrase is brilliant; what is he saying? It does not explain itself, or it can't be explained? Easily? But these are the things you run up against in life everyday, whether you know it or not. Vagaries of language. Alright I'll stop rambling on, but this book is really, really, really good. On a side note, after you read this, read &quot;The Sound and The Fury&quot; to catch up with Quinten. It is also brilliant, complex, and difficult.

(The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"I can understand why this book has so many 5 star ratings. Its ideas on the decay of the South are pretty brilliant and perceptive, and the plot is devastating. However, the language, although poetic, is enigmatic and completely exhausting. What's more troubling is that every character in the book has the same way of talking, without ever stopping or completing a thought. Sentences literally go on for over a page. Apparently, that's how every single person talked in 1909.\\"Not cowardice which will not face that sickness somewhere at the prime foundation of this factual scheme from which the prisoner soul, miasmal-distillant, wroils ever upward sunward...\\" This continues for quite some time. While an occassional sentence like this would add a sense of mystery and mysticism to the novel, when the whole thing reads like this, you get pretty tired. Another reviewer noted this sentence: \\"I became all polymath love's androgynous advocate.\\" What?I do like the narrative style though. You have a basic idea of the plot from the beginning, but pieces get filled in my different sources, leading to the overall picture of murder, decay, revenge. I didn't think the characterization was very good though, and that to me is the most important part of a book. Sure, you know who Sutpen is, but you don't really understand him. Ellen is called a moth, desperately clinging to the light but not understanding why. That's pretty a beautiful simile, but not incredibly useful, since we don't know why Ellen is a moth, just that she is.Basically, if you're going to read this novel, know what you're getting yourself into, and read it slowly, or you'll have to go back a million times and re-read."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Absalom, Abasalom is high Faulkner. It looks into the themes that he usually covers: the South and racism and other types of evil and abnormality. The method of exposition is one Faulkner used before in The Sound and the Fury, but here Faulkner's use of multiple points of view and the stream of consciousness technique attains a more highly developed, indeed baroque, level. Faulkner drops the relevant details of the plot into the stream, usually with no great fanfare, so this book must be read closely even to understand the basic information of who did what. Discerning these details involves reading a lot of sentences like the following one and, occasionally, encountering a valuable clue:\\"Or perhaps it is no lack of courage either: not cowardice that will not face that sickness somewhere at the prime foundation of this factual scheme from which the prisoner soul, miasmal-distillant, wroils ever upward sunward, tugs its tenuous prisoner arteries and veins and prisoning in its turn that spark, that dream which, as the globy and complete instant of its freedom mirrors and repeats (repeats? creates, reduces to a fragile evanescent iridescent sphere) all of space and time and massy earth, relicts the seething and miasmal mass which in all years of time has taught itself no boon of death but only how to recreate, renew; and dies, is gone, vanished: nothing- but is that true wisdom which can comprehend that there is a might-have-been which is more than truth, from which the dreamer, waking, says not \`Did I dream?' but rather says, indicts high heaven's very self with \`Why did I wake since waking I shall never sleep again?'\\"This novel is art, even great art, but is it a good read? In my opinion, no. This is a book that really must be studied rather than read, preferably with pencil and paper at hand to keep track of the relationships between the characters. (Faulkner helpfully ends the book with a chronology and a list of characters. I discovered this too late and at any rate the chronology is not complete.) For me, the effort required to get through this book somewhat outweighed the rewards. Doubtless other readers would disagree."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"After a half dozen false starts, I finally finished this masterpiece. I am feeling both unease and satisfaction in the face of genius. This is the second most satisfying novel I've read in my lengthening life. The level of literary intensity and imagination is extraordinary. Faulkner's insight into the depths of the human heart: its ability to desire and strive, surpasses any other fiction I've come across. Like so many worthy efforts in life, this is not an easy book to read and understand. But it taught me much about the possibilities of love and hate, about this country's epochal racial struggle, and, not least, about the strange, sad country we call The South."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Absolutely incredible! The writing structure is extremely difficult along with the shifting narrators, but it is an amazing book in large part because of these challenging aspects. Faulkner's use of language is exquisite, so that you feel like you are flowing down a meandering river and taking in the sights as you move through the text. Definitely one of the best ever!"},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"This may be simultaneously Faulkner's least accessible work and his best.It is not a light easy read, so don't consider picking it up if that is what you are looking for. And it should not be the first of his works that you read. But if you are interested in the kind of complex mastery that eventually earned him the Nobel, this may be the best example.The narrative is as innovative and difficult, in its way, as the multi-party narration of As I Lay Dying, but when the book finally comes together for you (this will not happen near the beginning) it will enthrall you. After a few hundred pages of not being sure I knew what he was up to, I found myself muttering \\"Oh my God. Oh my God.\\"There was a fad about 10 years ago of paintings one must stare at for an extended period before a face or other images emerges; once it has emerged, the observer has no idea how they ever missed it.That is the best possible metaphor for this work.You must read no criticism of the book before you dive in. But by all means dive in."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Granted, William Faulkner is an acquired taste. I believe it was Sherwood Anderson who said he didn't mind Faulkner living with them (in New Orleans) just as long as he didn't have to read his work.But don't be mislead by that statement, for while Mr. F. is an acquired taste, he's well worth the effort you have to put in. Like anything in life that's rewarding, it doesn't come easy. Yes, his sentence structure is bizarre and yes, he uses the &quot;stream of consciousness,&quot; sometimes ad nauseaum, but if you study him, his works, his life, you'll see that he's miles ahead of all of us.Which brings me to this book: Absalom is not one of this author's easiest reads if you're starting out with one of &quot;Bill's&quot; books. Sanctuary or As I Lay Dying are probably easier to take. But Absalom, along with Light in August, are his greatest achievements.If you're a fan of Southern Literature, Faulkner is probably the highest you can go. That said, there are others out there that are more accessible. Works like Conroy's Prince of Tides or McCrae's Bark of the Dogwood (Dogwood was even compared to a cross between Faulkner and Sedaris, if you can imagine that!).Still, I would highly recommend this book to anyone. Read it--you'll be better off when you're finished."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Faulkner is notoriously cruel to his readers for making them scrape and dig for details in his almost incomprehensibly dense chronicles of the fictional families of Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, but not for nothing is he one of the greatest of American writers. A story is not a collection of cold hard facts but of ideas and images designed to make us exercise the remotest faculties of our minds, and Faulkner's fiction presses the buttons and turns the dials that set our mental mechanisms in motion.&quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; is a particularly intricate machine that links the Old South with the New and features a family tree whose branches are gnarled beyond all reasonable efforts at traceability. The trunk is a man named Thomas Sutpen, who, after an adventurous youth in Virginia and the West Indies, arrives in YoCo in the 1830's with a large supply of money and black slaves, builds a plantation, marries a local girl, Ellen Coldfield, and fathers two children, Henry and Judith, envisioning a fruitful dynasty.In Faulkner's characteristically confusing style, the story is narrated through a few different viewpoints. The closest to the Sutpen family is Ellen's sister Rosa Coldfield, who happens to be younger than Henry and Judith. She has suffered some unhappy experiences as a result of being associated with Sutpen, but she retains a certain pride as she recounts her history to Quentin Compson, the morose young man who, we know from &quot;The Sound and the Fury,&quot; is later to drown himself in the Charles River. Quentin also gets information from his father, whose own father was a close friend of Sutpen's, and in turn discusses the Sutpen saga with his Harvard roommate Shreve, to whom Quentin insists, as the novel ends, that he doesn't hate the South.As in &quot;Light in August,&quot; race consciousness is a major subject in &quot;A, A!&quot; Thomas Sutpen is revealed to have fathered a boy named Charles Bon by a Haitian woman he thought was &quot;pure&quot; white, but he abandons her and the baby when he learns of her mixed ancestry. Later, he has a daughter named Clytemnestra (oh, the implications) by one of his slave women, proving himself to be a rather lecherous sort of hypocrite. Trouble begins when Henry meets his half-brother Charles at the University of Mississippi and brings him home, where he and Judith fall in love; Quentin's ultimate lesson about the Sutpens is that irony is a merciless punisher of irresponsibility.&quot;A, A!&quot; returns to the impressionistic style of narration used in &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; and &quot;As I Lay Dying.&quot; There are frequent shifts in focus and voice and extremely long parenthetical digressions which make this a difficult novel, but this is the kind of difficulty that gives Faulkner's fiction its substance. With an almost Shakespearean sensibility, Faulkner creates majestic characters of dazzling complexity and brooding intensity out of the basic cloth of ordinary folks, which is why figures like Thomas Sutpen, Quentin Compson, and Rosa Coldfield survive in our memories long after we finish reading the novel."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom! (The Modern library of the world's best books, 271)","review":"Everything is peculiar about Faulkner's writing, but I will mention this to save someone the pain. It is often difficult/impossible to figure out what is generally going on in a Faulkner book until you finish it and start over. However, lots and lots of people have written about him and will fill in the blanks for you. If you don't like reading things twice, bring along some criticism with you. It will make reading these books a pleasant experience without ruining much. Because, Faulkner cannot be summarized.I'm rereading this book right now, and I'm stopped at every sentence and weep to think, there's no way a critic will ever bring attention to this thought, because in the very next sentence, there's something to top it. There is no way to retain everything that Faulkner has to say, so a good approach to life is to keep reading and rereading him. Fortunately or unfortunately (depending on your view) he's written so much that you can never master him, not even his classics, but you can hope to retain much of one, and this is a good one to try.Plot summaries, feh, if you use them to get into Faulkner, by all means. Even if every spoiler is trotted out in front of you, you can't help but be surprised on every page of this book."},{"Title":"Absalom, Absalom!

You can be all thumbs with the glue gun and still be a winner with many of the projects in this book. It is almost overstating it to say these are \`projects', as the hardest thing about many of the suggestions if finding some of the components.While a basket is the container you always picture when you imagine gift collections (except me, whose all time greatest gift collection came in a plain cardboard box, giftwrapped, at Christmas when I was five years old) one of this book's major suggestions is in how to use a lot of different kinds of containers. My favorites are a \`Radio Flyer' little red wagon and a slow cooker.These two examples point up one important fact that along with the \`easy to do' aspect of these collections goes the \`not exactly cheap' caution. The author does us a great favor of giving us up to three different price levels, adding more and more expensive items to fit a more generous presentation. But, even the least expensive collections will rarely run less than 25 dollars and some of the high end collections can easily run to over 100 dollars.And, the price level may vary widely if you are not careful or willing to choose less expensive, and therefore less impressive items. For example, the \`Festival Italiano' $25 basket includes extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The problem is that a good \`everyday' (Bertolli, Berio, Colavita) brand and size (1 Liter) of extra virgin olive oil can run to $15 and a good \`everyday' brand of balsamic vinegar brand and size ((500 ml) can also run to over $10. Premium brands of both products can run to $50 a bottle, and if your recipient has high standards, a below-average brand will create a below-average impression. But this gets into knowing your recipient. My only point is that some of Ms. Phillips' collections can be expensive and they can be a lot more expensive than her suggested price. One place where the author specifically underquotes prices is in some of the containers. That little Radio Flyer wagon may only be available in pricy speciality stores and I am certain that a backpack \`basket' from The North Face company will run to $50.Another virtue of this book is the variety of occasions for which the author offers suggestions. And, almost all the collections are general enough so that tweaking them a bit one way or another will turn a \`Picnic Basket' into a housewarming basket or a Memorial Day or Labor Day or 4th of July gathering basket.The book is divided into a larger section of \`Special Occasion Baskets' which involve no cookery and \`Food Baskets' where the centerpiece is one or more homemade mixes for baking or assembling cookies, breads, muffins, chili, tea, lemonade, scones, salads, salsas, pancakes, popovers, or you name it! Recipes for these goodies actually require practically no cooking skills. The most important skill is the sense to buy a really good set of measuring tools (and know how to use them) and secure glass containers in which to put the goods. The recipes all have two parts. The first part, which is generally very simple matter of measuring and mixing either all wet or all dry ingredients, is for the gift giver. The second part, presented on pictures of little index cards, is for the recipient, and it is up to the gift giver to transfer this recipe to a card and place it in the basket with the ingredients. I think the author really missed some good opportunities here. The very easiest way to transfer these \`end user' recipes to the basket would be to scan them into a computer and print them on card stock, but the author gives no clue to how this can be done. I am not expecting a cooking specialist to also be an expert Kinkos operative, but a mention of this technique and some guidance would have gone a long way. Another suggestion would have been for the author to offer all these recipe cards on images on an internet site which could be downloaded and printed.On perishables in general, the author offers excellent warnings to the gift giver to on what to tell the recipient about the shelf life of the mixtures.The book opens with a nice section of general tips on assembling baskets. This includes the tip which always rubs me the wrong way, about being sure to pack the basket with raffia, shredded paper, or plastic to bulk up the appearance of the goodies. It seems to me that a superior method is to provide candy, hand towels, or shop towels as filler. That is, bulk up with something which is useful.I'm sure there was some issue with publisher Harvard Common Press on keeping the book down to an easily marketable price, but I think a picture of each and every basket would have been a good thing here. I rarely feel the need for pictures for food recipes, but here, the presentation is the whole game. I don't know what the legal issues are here, but it would have been a very clever way to present recommended brands without mentioning them in the text. The quality of the pictures which are given give a small taste of what could have been done with a picture for every basket.While I have not reviewed any other books on doing gift baskets, I sense that this volume is excellent for the price, but it could have been a bit better. The very test thing that even without the pics, the suggestions are imaginative and inspiring."},{"Title":"Selected Stories","review":"The short stories that were written in this book were very detailed and had excellent style and really kept the reader entranced.

Is she however as many of her readers seem to believe in the same league as Chekhov? I cannot answer that. I can say she is a very tough and realistic writer, one who provides detailed descriptions of complex characters and settings. She seems to specialize in women who know great disappointments and men who are by and large cruel jerks. But saying that I know it is too simplistic. She has many interesting male characters. And in fact her descriptions of character, her ability to create interesting characters is one of her real strengths. What I missed in reading this work was any sense of joy and exuberance. Great Literature for me is the Literature which makes me love life more. Her world of small- town characters who have known mostly hard times is not a world which yields a great deal of beauty and joy. It does however it seems to me yield a great deal of realistic truthfulness. This means there are very few if any happy endings in her stories. She is a master of showing how people miss and mess up each other , are cruel to each other in sometimes inexplicable ways. She does too have a landscape and world of her own one largely my guess is unfamiliar to most of her readers.

It is like the one black mark on her otherwise distinguished career-- Pretentious style, dialogue that doesn't ring true, too many characters for a short story. Still, no one writes about family dynamics like Alice Munro. Her stories always make me reflect back on my own family.

Because I realized, she is someone I will read and read again and not get bored of, and I just plain wanted to own one of her books. I don't know, it's hard to pinpoint why the stories are so good. They feel very real to me - very true to inner feelings. Sometimes it's so hard to get inner thoughts and moods onto paper, but she does it so effortlessly. She can also describe a character in a few lines and give the readers the picture of that person in their heads immediately. I stop, wondering, how did that just happen? She is talented I guess! Gifted! She knows how to create! Her stories are very beautiful. They are very intelligent stories. I feel like they are exploring. They explore people, all their secrets, the hazy reasons behind their actions.

And that's Robertson Davies, Margaret Atwood, and Alice Munro, all of whom brought Canadian literature onto the world stage. Munro is widely regarded, with complete justification, as possibly the best living creator of short stories in English. She's been doing this stuff since the 1950s and is still going strong. She's won all sorts of awards and she may yet snag a Nobel one of these days. A \\"complete works of\\" volume would be several times the size of this one, but the twenty-eight stories in these 500-plus pages are the very cream of a superior crop. Her stories tend to be about the ways people link to one another, spouses both past and present, parents with their children both young and grown, all sorts of people with those in their pasts and their futures. And the settings are most often the old towns of southern and western Ontario, old ports, mill towns filled with working families and boarded-up factories, and the hardscrabble farms a few miles away. These people in their old clothes, the children in their reworked hand-me-downs, often are poor though without acknowledging it, perhaps without even realizing it.Just as a sample: One of my own favorites in this volume is \\"The Beggar Maid,\\" about how people can be talked into bad decisions, by others or by themselves, including marriage. It's almost a very small but perfect novel, and, of course, Rose and Flo figure in some other stories. Another favorite, probably because I'm a working genealogist, is \\"A Wilderness Station,\\" quite a fascinating little multigenerational family epic. The subject of \\"Lichen\\" is serial relationships, none of which is ever quite good enough. \\"The Progress of Love\\" is another of Munro's classic explorations of the potential violence in love, carried out this time in masterful dialogue. \\"Postcard\\" is about the danger of making assumptions about what other people think and feel. \\"Dance of the Happy Shades\\" and \\"Images\\" each views a small corner of the adult world as seen by a child; like many of Munro's pieces, these aren't so much \\"stories\\" (with a beginning, middle, and end) as vignettes, portraits of people in a certain time and place and what they experience and how they feel about it. The most recent piece in the volume (though Munro has written many more since) is \\"Vandals,\\" which is also one of the longest. It's one of those stories that is almost impossible to describe. One can say it's about taxidermy and nature, or about unexpected death and the aftermath and what comes after that. It's about strange and completely unacceptable behavior. It's about people. It's a terrific story and it's also one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Selected Stories","review":"Absolutely not! In these stories Munro shows how complete stories can be; these feel like novellas, not stories. &quot;Dance of the Happy Shades,&quot; is spectacular (particularly as it was one of her earliest stories); the paragraph describing the music teacher sitting by the piano as the retarded girl played absolutely took away my breath. This collection is just teeming with riches. Read &quot;The Beggar Maid&quot; immediately, and then proceed directly to &quot;Fits&quot; and &quot;Material.&quot; There isn't a weak link in this collection. Munro's style at first may seem bland, but she pulls you right into these characters' lives and offers surprising insights on the emptiness of extramarital affairs after their initial euphoria. Her characters are all a little disappointed with the world, but filled with wistfulness, too. I can't think of more sensitive portraits of women than these stories. I hope she keeps writing for another forty years."},{"Title":"Selected Stories","review":"As a woman, I was caught up in her storys as some seemed to speak to me of my own life experiences.

Certainly a story like \\"The Progress of Love,\\" in this volume--a rich, poignantly ironic delineation of the selectivity of memory--is proof enough that Munro is as great as her reputation would have it, and that she is one of the few living writers who deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence as Chekhov. Nevertheless, plowing through her Selected Stories is like gorging on a box of chocolates; you'd be a lot better off savoring just one or two at a time. The maiin problem is that Munro's subject range is narrow. How many stories can you read in one sitting about women from impoverished small-town Ontario, who are misunderstood and often brutalized by their families, boyfriends and husbands? (The reviewers who called Munro's women weak are misreading the stories severely; these women could have hauled the wounded Titanic to port, 2,000 passengers and all, single-handedly. They have the clemency of the very strong, which unfortunately means that weaker, more spiteful souls can walk all over them.) Yet within each story, Munro's elegant, lucid prose style and encyclopedic knowledge of the human mind and heart make themselves felt. I will reread stories such as \\"Material,\\" \\"Chaddeleys and Flemings,\\" \\"Dulse,\\" \\"The Turkey Season\\" and \\"The Beggar Maid\\" with joy and admiration for their perfect artistry. But I'll have to wait to reread stories such as \\"Labor Day Dinner,\\" which after an unrelieved diet of Munro stories can almost seem like a parody of the author. Do yourself a favor; buy this wonderful book, but savor its delights sparingly, as you would a box of Godivas."},{"Title":"Selected Stories","review":"I was thoroughly entranced and mesmerized by these stories. Ms. Munro accomplisheswhat has to be the most beautiful and difficult task infiction--illuminating the darkest corners of human nature.I don't mean dark as necessarily evil, but dark as in thesides of oneself no one talks about, or even knows is there.&quot;Fits&quot; is a perfect example of this.I read the stories out of order, which produced an interestingeffect. They do have a chronology. The opening piecesare very different from the ones at the end."},{"Title":"Selected Stories","review":"Alice Munro gives us a quick and sometimes fleeting glimpse into the inner workings of the stories' characters and lives. This is one of the most literary short-story collections I've ever read. All of the stories in this collection are powerful and intense. Munro has the ability to add tremendous depth in a short story. It isn't easy to have precise characterization and story development in short stories, but Munro does a brilliant work in creating memorable characters and compelling tale in just a few pages. I can't recommend this wonderful collection enough."},{"Title":"Selected Stories","review":"Alice Munro is among the few great writers who have chosen the story (short and long) for her/his primary genre of expression. Almost every one of the stories in this collection is as rich and rewarding as a novel of 400 pages by a lesser artist. I give the collection 4 stars rather than 5 because I firmly believe that each of the selected stories was richer and more satisfying in its original context,i.e. in the volume in which it was first published. The Beggar Maid, for instance, one of Munro's earlier storybooks, lists ten titles. Each of the tales, to my mind, is analogous to a subplot in a sprawling novel, but clarified and intensified by isolation. No awkward transitions, no fillers! The whole is definitely more than the sum of the parts. Read one of the storybooks first, before you accept some editor's cherry-picking. If you've never read Munro, start with The Moons of Jupiter. You have a lot of reading thrills to look forward to."},{"Title":"Selected Stories","review":"Alice Munro's collection of short stories embodies over 25 of her finest works. Within the text, she deals with issues of family, friends, betrayal, and the creation of art--sometimes all at once. Her writing is powerful, and she controls it with unimaginable skill. A must-read for anyone truly interested in the art of fiction."},{"Title":"Selected Stories","review":"My primary complaint about this collection of short stories is the characters. Each of them is so richly drawn in such a short span of pages, that just as you feel you've gotten to know them and are looking forward to what they'll do next -- POOF! -- they're gone, and you're on to the next batch.Alice Munro's insight into the human experience, especially the realm of relationships, is sometimes spooky. I kept seeing my own thoughts, many of them heretofore unarticulated, being subtly coaxed out and examined.Many of the stories held me captive as I was reading them, but the one that will continue to haunt me in the future is \\"Fits,\\" the story of a woman who visits a neighbor's house only to find a scene of unspeakable horror. The revelation at the very end is chilling and thought-provoking, and I couldn't help but wonder what i would have done in the same situation."},{"Title":"Selected Stories","review":"Of course I don't have to tell you what any other review will: first, that Munro is among the greatest, if not THE greatest, living writer of short stories in English. The comparison that so many reviewers draw between her work and Chekhov's isn't just lazy journalism, but an entirely accurate summation of the profound influence she has quietly made on contemporary fiction. I say \\"quietly\\" not just because she has a strangely small readership outside of Canada, but because of her astounding subtlety; she follows all the \\"rules\\" of writing fiction that you learn in workshops just as often as she breaks them, giving the novice reader the impression that her stories are either overly studied or amateurish (a reaction that many have, I might add, to reading Chekhov). How wrong you'll realize you are.Second, you don't need me to tell you that these stories probably are Munro's best. So why only three stars? Munro is unique among short story writers in giving each collection that she publishes a carefully designed structure: despite the many plots of its individual stories, a Munro book has a cohesive arc that unifies the collection into a seemingly connected narrative. Publishing a selection of her work feels a bit like printing only the juicier moments of Mrs. Dalloway or To the Lighthouse and billing the book as Virginia Woolf's Greatest Hits, or marketing a compilation of only the more exciting movements from his symphonies as The Best of Beethoven. If you're looking for an introduction to Munro, there's nearly nowhere to go wrong in her catalog, but anything from The Moons of Jupiter to The View from Castle Rock is especially sure to be a gem."},{"Title":"Selected Stories","review":"Munro is widely considered to be one of the best short story writers (still, at 81) around. She's highly regarded not only by readers, but, apparently, by fellow writers, as well. After reading my way through the majority of this generous collection, I can see why. There is something that puts one in mind of \\"the classics\\" about Munro, even when her subjects are contemporary. She eschews literary gimmicks, for one thing. Her tone and style are largely traditional. Her themes are the eternal ones as relevant to the human condition a hundred years ago as they are today; one is put to the challenge to imagine a time when they wouldn't be relevant. She seems a shoe-in to be included in every serious comprehensive short story anthology from now until Doomsday.Childhood, family life, marriage, infidelity, illness, death--these are the subjects Munro returns to again and again in her work. She deals in the \\"small\\" mysteries and quiet crises that mark the pivotal turning points in ordinary lives. For the most part, her stories have rural Canadian settings. Oddly, this doesn't seem an impediment to their universality any more than a setting in a traditional fairy tale does. Even though few of us have ever lived in a rural Canadian setting, or any kind of rural setting, there is an elemental truth to Munro's world that strikes close to the bone, that taps some larger archetypal memory we still share of a life lived closer to earth and weather.Traditional, even conservative as they are, Munro's stories almost never track an ABC plot-line; often it is even hard to say exactly what they are \\"about.\\" The stories seem to grow organically, like a crystal in solution; events are often recounted out of order, past and present reflecting, amplifying, clarifying, and deepening the meaning of events, the definition of character. Munro writes about a situation--a father's illness, a mother's infidelity, a husband's abandonment--without seeking to resolve anything, with no other discernible intent than to present it in all it's complexity. If anything becomes clearer at the end of a typical Munro story, it's that life--and other people--are an even greater mystery than we ever realized.My favorite story in this collection, \\"Fits,\\" is a good example. In it, Peg, a sensible, undemonstrative woman, a good wife and hardworking mother, discovers the bodies of her next door neighbors, both shot to death in their bedroom. She dutifully calls the police, files a report, and then goes to work. She never mentions what she saw that morning, not to her friend and co-worker, not to her husband, not even to the son who's home from school that day. Why not? She figures everyone will hear about it soon enough. That's her plainspoken answer. But is it the truth? As Munro reveals, it both is and isn't, and either way, you have the essence of what a mystery a human being is.***Memorable Lines***\\"I did not avoid touching my child but realized I was touching her with a difference. There was a care--not a withdrawal but a care--not to feel anything much. I saw how the forms of love might be maintained with a condemned person but with the love measured and disciplined, because you have to survive. It could be done so discreetly that the object of such care would not suspect, any more than she would suspect the sentence of death itself.\\"\\"People say they have been paralyzed by fear, but I was transfixed, as if struck by lightning, and what hit me did not feel like fear so much as recognition. I was not surprised. This is the sight that does not surprise you, the thing you have always known was there that comes so naturally, moving delicately and contentedly and in no hurry, as if it was made, in the first place, from a wish of yours, a hope of something final, terrifying.\\"\\"All my life I had known there was a man like this and he was behind doors, around the corner at the dark end of a hall. So now I saw him and just waited, like a child in an old negative, electrified against the dark noon sky, with blazing hair and burned-out Orphan Annie eyes. The man slipped down through the bushes to my father. And I never thought, or even hoped for, anything but the worst.\\"\\"Like the children in fairy stories who have seen their parents make pacts with terrifying strangers, who have discovered that our fears are based on nothing but the truth, but who come back from marvelous escapes and take up their knives and forks, with humility and good manners, prepared to live happily ever after--like them, dazed and powerful with secrets, I never said a word.\\"\\"The map of the city that she had held in her mind up till now, with its routes to shops and work and friends' houses, was overlaid with another map, of circuitous routes followed in fear (not shame) and excitement, of flimsy shelters, temporary hiding places, where she and Miles made love, often within hearing distance of passing traffic or a hiking part or a family picnic.\\"\\"She saw herself as a person surrounded by, living by, sham. Because she had been so readily unfaithful, her marriage was a sham. Because she had gone so far out of it, so quickly, it was a sham. She dreaded a life like her own before this happened. She could not but destroy. Such cold energy was building in her she had to blow her own house down.\\"\\"I guess we never believe we're going to die,\\" Georgia says. I mean we never behave as if we believed we were going to die.\\"Raymond smiles more and more and puts a hand on her shoulder. \\"How should we behave?\\" he says.\\"Differently,\\" says Georgia. She puts a foolish stress on the word, meaning that her answer is so lame that she can offer it only as a joke.\\""},{"Title":"Selected Stories","review":"I am an absolute fan of Alice Munro, who never disappoints. The editing on this digital edition, however, is remarkably sloppy. It appears that the text has been scanned in and not proofread. There are stray punctuation marks, lost spaces between words, etc. I suppose that, on average, an error like this happens every 10 pages or so. A few make a hash of Munro's meaning; most are relatively harmless."},{"Title":"Selected Stories","review":"This book came out in 1996 and selected 28 short stories published between 1961 and 1994, from seven of the author's collections up through the mid-90s. There were four stories in it from the 1960s, nine from the 70s, ten from the 80s and five from the 90s. Seventeen of the stories from the 1970s onward had made their debut in the New Yorker. Since Selected Stories came out, Munro has published four collections of new short fiction.Two of the very early tales here, from the 1960s, were the simplest and enjoyed the most by this reader (\\"Walker Brothers Cowboy,\\" \\"Dance of the Happy Shades\\"). They were written in the first person and generally contained a narrator recalling an experience from girlhood -- incidents from time spent with a father, a piano recital -- or an adult recounting another's betrayal.In the stories from the 70s, things started to become more elaborate. More characters and story lines, more locations outside the Ontario back country, and a greater focus on adult relationships -- women living their lives and looking for a place in the world. There were flashes forward and backward. The stories got longer. A decent male character other than the narrator's father was introduced (\\"The Turkey Season\\"). About half of the stories were written in the third person; the author's earliest pieces had also been of this type but were left out of the collection. Most enjoyed from the 70s was \\"Chaddeleys and Flemings,\\" the narrator's recollection of relatives on both sides of her family, their contrasts and similarities, and the passing of time.From the 1980s and 90s, the stories got longer still. There were more pieces about married, separated, divorced or remarried women and their partners and friends. There were a greater number of works written in the third person, mostly from a woman's point of view but sometimes including other characters, occasionally even partners, ex-partners, friends or sons. Some stories were more open-ended, with motives or actions remaining ambiguous.A few works from these decades mixed third- and first-person narratives, in stories set at least partly in the 19th century (\\"Meneseteung,\\" \\"A Wilderness Station\\"). From these decades, most enjoyed was \\"Miles City, Montana,\\" in which a narrator recalled a driving trip with her husband and daughters, paired with a memory from her own childhood, which she wasn't completely sure of. There was much else of interest going on in this work: a beautiful description of children, a near-tragedy, the relation between parents and children, and thoughts on death.Many of the other stories from the later decades contained back stories, parallel threads or other description that were just too meandering for this reader, approaching self-parody. One example, midway through a story focused on something else: \\"She and Georgia worked out the history of the Empire window, and Georgia was added to the story as a grumpy, secretly Socialistic hired companion named Miss Amy Jukes. The widow's name was Mrs. Allegra Forbes-Bellyea. Her husband had been Nigel Forbes-Bellyea. Sometimes Sir Nigel. Most of one rainy afternoon in the Moghul's Court was spent in devising the horrors of the Forbes-Bellyea honeymoon, in a damp hotel in Wales.\\"A number of the later stories were almost unreadable, but contained observations here and there that were still evocative: on the passing of time, aging, the end of life and so on. It was surprising that despite the frequent focus on relationships between people, so few of the pieces concerned long-lasting, mutual understanding between couples. The women in these stories -- and the characters generally -- often felt isolated from those around them.This writer has frequently been compared to Chekhov. Similarities could be felt in descriptions of how life was lived -- the pathos, the way people soldiered on despite everything -- especially vivid when Munro wrote in the first person. But Chekhov introduced a greater range of characters and situations and offered some of his characters the possibility of religious faith or redemption (\\"In the Ravine\\"). He was a master of brevity and -- especially in his earlier work -- humor.I read Munro's collection while in the middle of something by an older Canadian writer, Gabrielle Roy. Roy's book involved a narrator's memories of childhood, of beginning to understand adult sorrows. It concerned elderly people who shared their wisdom with a child, and encouraged her feeling for the beauty of the land. Momentarily at least, some of the people in it could share their understanding and joy. In many ways, these simpler fictions of Roy were preferred."},{"Title":"Commentary on Isaiah","review":"Dutch reformed pastor turns dispensational from his own study of Isaiah.

Many Orthodox will be shocked to learn that, yes, there is a need and a justification for primacy, that there is a persuasive case for that primacy to reside in Rome, and that our model of individual churches based on nationality is both harmful and contrary to Tradition.This is not to let Rome off the hook, however. The Roman Catholic Church has badly played the issue of primacy for many centuries and even now generally does not appreciate the compelling Orthodox arguments against primacy as defined by Rome. This book therefore also should be read by RCs interested in healing the schism and returning church governance to its authentic origins.A few quotations from each essay will serve to distill the main points:Nicholas Koulomzine, \`Peter's Place in the Primitive Church':--It was the Twelve, still in Jerusalem, that dispatched Peter and John to Samaria.--Peter always held first place among the Twelve, but the role he played in the Church was still bound up with that of the Twelve and Jerusalem.--Peter's work, after he left Jerusalem, was no longer tied to a single place on the map, or to a special church.--The community [at Jerusalem] led by James, the brother of the Lord, is the earliest, chronologically, of all the local churches to be revered by all, but without direct authority over the other churches.Veselin Kesich, \`Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition':--The evidence points to the preeminence of the Church in Jerusalem and her leaders, rather than to the primacy of any Apostle, either Peter or James.. . In authority and power they were equal; there were no degrees of power in the circle of the twelve.--Every bishop in the apostolic church who occupies the place which Peter occupied at the Eucharistic gathering, and who performs the pastoral duties which Peter performed, is the successor to the apostle. . . If there was any teaching concerning Peter's supremacy, it was not known to Paul.John Meyendorff, \`St. Peter in Byzantine Theology':--The Byzantines unanimously recognized the great authority of the old Rome, but never understood this authority in the sense of an absolute power. The fact of the Pope's traditional definition as the successor of Peter was by no means denied, but it was not considered as a decisive issue. In the East there were numerous \`apostolic sees': was not Jerusalem the \`mother of all the Churches'? Could not the Bishop of Antioch also claim the title of successor to Peter?--The Byzantines [considered] the Church of Rome vested with primacy among other churches, a primacy analogous to the one that Peter had among the apostles, [but] this Roman primacy came not from Peter, whose presence had been more effective and better attested in Jerusalem or in Antioch than in Rome, but from the fact that Rome was the capital of the Empire. [At the same time,] the primacy of Rome, which was established by general consensus, is useful to the Church but must depend on the confession of Orthodox faith.Nicholas Afanassieff, \`The Church Which Presides in Love':--The basis of priority is neither power, nor honor, but only the authority that flows from love and is made manifest by love. The church-in-priority may make mistakes in the very act of coming to the rescue of churches in need and especially of churches in error; that is why the witness of the other churches is needed. Its grand mistake is wanting to impose a sovereign will or put itself above other churches.Alexander Schmemann, \`The Idea of Primacy in Orthodox Ecclesiology':--The fatal error of universal ecclesiology [is that it] identifies primacy with power, transforming the latter from a ministry in the Church into power over the Church.--An objective study of the canonical tradition cannot fail to establish beyond any doubt that, along with local \`centers of agreement' or primacies, the Church had also known a universal primacy. The ecclesiological error of Rome lies not in the affirmation of her universal primacy. Rather, the error lies in her identification of this primacy with \`supreme power.'--Primacy is a necessity because therein is the expression and manifestation of the unity of the churches as being the unity of the Church.Overall, this work is highly recommended for insight on what arguably is the most important issue facing Christianity."},{"Title":"The Primacy of Peter: Essays in Ecclesiology and the Early Church","review":"As a recent convert from Roman Catholicism to Orthodoxy, I especially recommend this volume of essays, regarding the primacy of Peter, and, by extension, the primacy of the Pope, to any Roman Catholic interested in Orthodoxy. The essays are well researched and well balanced, and give the reader the Orthodox point of view regarding the claims of the Papacy, without resorting to polemics.I also recommend the book &quot;Rome, Constantinople, Moscow: Historical and Theological Studies&quot; written by Fr. Meyendorff as well as &quot;The Orthodox Church&quot; by Bishop Kallistos Ware for anyone interested in the history of the Church."},{"Title":"The Primacy of Peter: Essays in Ecclesiology and the Early Church","review":"I know John Meyendorff's work through many different texts, but I first discovered his work through this book. It was innocently lying on the table in the break room at the monastery were I was on retreat, and I thought I'd glance at it briefly to see the contents and then go on my way. Such was not to be - I read the book entire while I was on the retreat, and then purchased my own copy shortly thereafter.This book consists of five essays (apart from a brief introduction), all dealing with the issue of the primacy of Peter. The issue is, in short, the interpretation and practice of the authority of the successors of Peter in Rome. This was one of the key issues in the East/West schism of 1054 (although not the only issue, as it is sometimes portrayed in simplistic history texts), and remains a key sticking point preventing reunion of the Eastern Orthodox churches with the Roman church. This book was originally published in 1963, around the time of the Second Vatican Council; the reprint in 1992 includes updates of two of the four essays, and includes a new essay by Veselin Kesich.The article by Meyendorff himself deals with the image of St. Peter in Byzantine theology. He confines his approach primarily to the literature written after the schism to see the way in which Byzantine theology, often overlooked and unpublished in the West, continued a rather consistent theme toward the successors of Peter. He states that it was not generally known in the Eastern Churches that the Western Church was interpreting honourifics and acclamations as formal definitions of papal primacy. However, even the authority granted Rome was never due solely to any inheritance of the status of Peter, but also owed to the general historical situation of the primacy of Rome as a city - Meyendorff quotes Canon 28 of Chalcedon that gives old Rome authority because of its seat of the ancient Emperor and Senate. Many post-schismatic writings deal more with the Filioque clause than the idea of Roman primacy, and among those that address the role of the bishop of Rome over time, there is no clear consensus - some try to deny any authority to the bishop of Rome beyond that of an ordinary bishopric, while others do ascribe different levels of authority.Theologian Alexander Schmemann is also a contributor to this text. His essay explores the idea of primacy in Orthodox ecclesiology. There are three different kinds of primacy - regional, church-based (autocephalous or other kinds of national/larger church structures), and universal. The second form is well-known in the Orthodox circles, but the first and third are virtually absent in terms of definition and application. Schmemann looks at some of the difficulties of Orthodox ecclesiology when combined with modern ideas like the nation-state, and explores the true seat of authority as that residing not in any particular figure, but rather in the synod of bishops.The article by Nicholas Koulomzine looks at the historical view of Peter position in the early church, broken down into three successive units - Peter in the church of Jerusalem (found in the book of Acts), Peter at the beginning of the missionary work of the gospel (found in later Acts), and Peter after he left Jerusalem. Koulomzine stresses the missionary activity of Peter, and that his presence in Rome was not a long-standing one (he wasn't in Rome either during Paul's time there nor during the period when letters were written); also, Koulomzine also stresses that Peter's status as head of the apostles faded after he left Jerusalem. 'The Twelve no longer formed a collegium at Jerusalem, so the city lost its position as hierarchical centre. Given these new historical conditions, is it still possible to speak of the primacy of Peter?'The essay by Nicolas Afanassieff looks at underlying issues in terms of what should be a principle concern of Christians of every complexion - the unity of faith in love. 'Unity of faith still reigns within the Orthodox Church, but without union in love; and neither exists between the Orthodox and the Roman Catholic Churches.' Afanassieff states that all churches possess catholicity (which is a contentious issues in and of itself), but that those who possess authority are those acting in love. Afanassieff's essay is perhaps the most controversial of the pieces here, both for the Orthodox and the Catholic. Perhaps that is why it is the longest.Veselin Kesich's essay is new to the collection, and takes advantage of a generation of scholarship in terms of biblical studies and theology. He looks specifically at the New Testament and early church traditions rooted in this text. He draws on the early church fathers as well as particular bishops in his study both of general authority as well as particular Petrine authority.This is an important book in terms of ecumenical dialogue between East and West on the issue of the primacy of Peter."},{"Title":"The Primacy of Peter: Essays in Ecclesiology and the Early Church","review":"After such a long division, large diaspora communities of Western Orthodox Christians and their ever-growing numbers of converts have proven the need once more for the Orthodox Church to write (in English) about Orthodoxy's relationship to Rome, and about what it perceives to be Rome's errors. This book combines essays from several authors who cover different aspects of Orthodox ecclesiology and who give an Orthodox vision of primacy within the Church of Christ.My favorite essay in the entire book is the one written by Fr. John Meyendorff entitled, \\"St. Peter in Byzantine Theology\\" which uses many quotations from contemporaries at the time of the schism and beyond it to illustrate the Orthodox Church's view of St. Peter, how it viewed each Bishop as occupying the Chair of St. Peter, and what exactly that meant. That essay alone is worth the price of the book, but the others are also outstanding and thoughtful."},{"Title":"The Primacy of Peter: Essays in Ecclesiology and the Early Church","review":"This book provides essential insight for understanding the idea of primacy and its errors both in Roman and Orthodox churches. Although the Roman Church seems to be more deeply and qualitatively wrong than the Orthodox Church, in both churches the idea of primacy was shaped by the State as an acting force in the world, therefore pushing the Church of Christ away from its real function as the Body of Christ manifested in this world but not of this world."},{"Title":"Collected Poems","review":"To My Sister; The Heron; No Bird; Elegy for Jane; She; Her Reticence; The Meadow Mouse; and of course, My Papa's Waltz--these are all some of the great poems that Theodore Roethke wrote. Roethke is one of our American masters. I found that when he was on his game (as he was in the poems above, among others) his poetry was phenomenal, but when he wasn't, his poetry could be awful. His earlier work is better than his later work, though he seems to have gotten most of his recognition for his later work. Still, for the poetry lover this is pretty much a required volume for your shelves."},{"Title":"Collected Poems","review":"A friend loaned me The Collected Poems of Theodore Roethke when I was trying to compile a program of poems related to the painter Morris Graves, who is having a centenary exhibition of his work this year in San Francisco. I had never really studied up on Roethke, even though my teachers in graduate school were keen on him, but they were keen in a certain way that left one thinking, \\"He may be great but Robert Lowell is miles ahead of him.\\" Or, \\"Between them Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop are doing everything poor Roethke tried to do, but with a solid East Coast grounding of reality.\\" It was still an age when the suicide of poets meant something. Lowell and Bishop were both still alive and working, and every time Lowell came by our campus (I never met Bishop) you could see him growing nuttier and nuttier, and that was the way things were in the 1970s.Anyhow, Roethke was regulated to a lower, West Coast brand of confessionalism that hadn't the classical rigor of his Eastern counterparts, He was about to do some good work--when he died--was the general feeling. Now, as I read the work, much of it for the first time, I wind up thinking that maybe the naysayers were partially right. Roethke's diction seems clotted and strange, a byproduct of his attempt to \\"do\\" Yeats and Blake and Manley Hopkins in American accents. Sylvia Plath does it too, but from her it sounds vaguely natural, like she thought in metaphysics. Roethke's \\"Praise to the End\\" is emblematic of the problems a reader encounters while trying to love the guy. \\"It's dark in this wood, soft mocker,\\" it begins. \\"For whom have I swelled like a seed?\\" You can almost hear \\"Daddy\\" coming around the corner. \\"Bumpkin, he can dance alone./ Ooh, ooh, I'm a duke of eels./ / Arch my back, pretty-bones, I'm dead at both ends./ Softly softly, you'll wake the clams./ I'll feed the ghost alone./ Father, forgive my hands.\\" As a matter of fact, you can get used to this kind of thing, and in fact positively savor the whole stew of infelicities, the raw and the cooked heated together like a tuna melt. The humble and the grand, the high and low. It's sort of an absolute binary that TR seems hellbent to break out of, but he always takes the high road eventually.\\"Where are you now, my bonny beating gristle,/ My blue original dandy, numb with sugar?\\" At moments like this I pause, feeling irritated, like Travis Bickle. \\"You talking to me?\\" Nevertheless it is a book of great historical interest, and maybe you too will feel a little intoxicated by the end of it."},{"Title":"Collected Poems","review":"A nice inexpensive edition of Roethke's poetry. There is a great deal of interesting and sometimes powerful poetry in this book. While taste's will differ, I find the earlier and later poems to be the most compelling. A good deal of Roethke's work in the middle of his life is characterized by experimentation with language. The later poems, in particular, combine the more direct approach of Roethke's earlier poems with greater command of language and imagery. Roethke's use of nature imagery in the later poems, often in the context of reflections on his personal life and problems, is outstanding."},{"Title":"Collected Poems","review":"High school and College students across the nation (especially in Michigan) have been cheated by not being introduced to this outstanding writer of poetry.

Roethke possessed a way of speaking in his poetry that was both confessional and deeply spiritual. He was beyond doubt one of the greatest American poets of the 20th Century. Some of his poems, like Journey to the Interior, The Far Field, The Lost Son, and so many others create an almost religious experience in the reader.Roethke suffered from bipolar disorder throughout most of his life, and this experience (extreme emotional ups and downs) colored his vision of the world around him. But there is no trace of self-pity, and no great emphasis on depression or death. Instead, love, time, age, and the mystery of life are the themes of his poetry. He saw life as a religious experience, and was essentially a pantheist at heart.This is a book to give as a gift to some Seeker, if you are lucky enough to know someone who fits into that category. It's a book to guide, inform, and heal a life."},{"Title":"Collected Poems","review":"\\"A late rose ravages the casual eye,\\" writes Roethke in A Walk in Late Summer, \\"a blaze of being on a central stem.\\" In such images we see the symbols of nature fully tapped in modern poetry -- and tapped in American English, in fresh, vivid language that overpowers the reader with its grace and presence. The poetry of Theodore Roethke is written by a man profoundly alive -- skirting the edge of suicide, losing his voice in the awe of love, reeling wildly in the throes of \\"the pure fury,\\" and looking at last with calm eyes into infinity and his own undoing in the Far Field. Roethke was a true descendent of Whitman where the latter wrote \\"This is no book / Who touches this touches a man.\\" But Roethke's poetry moves us as much by its lyrical language as by the power and wisdom of its experience. Roethke himself was, as represented by his art alone, a \\"blaze of being.\\"Among Roethke's contributions to literature are his poems that treat depression. Far from letting his manic episodes paralyze him, he used them to write some his most intense poetry. \\"In a Dark Time\\" is one of the immortal poems of the 20th century, worthy to be set aside a Van Gogh painting. Roethke was not alone in treating these subjects: two other Pulitzer Prize-winning poets of his time, Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton, learned from him and wrote about similar themes. But Roethke's writing stands out in two ways from these poets and other poets the 50's and 60's.One is the unity of his work and vision -- this Collected Poems traces a single spiritual journey beginning with his childhood memories of the greenhouse, and ending somewhere among \\"the windy cliffs of forever\\", last visions tragically cut short by his early death. Between those points are rendered all of the experiences of his life -- as he wrote in his first poem, \\"my heart keeps open-house.\\" But he never fails to interpret these experiences and understand their significance in the larger picture of his life and poetry. Unlike so much of the poetry of Sylvia Plath and other Confessional poets, Roethke never demands that you read his biography to understand his symbolism. Rather, his symbols develop among his poems to form a kind of mythology: his recurring symbols include stones, fire, light, \\"the small,\\" and the spirit.The other difference between Roethke and other poets of his time is his technique. Roethke is never obscure; he always writes in fresh language, avoiding cliches, although his symbols are indeed personal and take time to understand. Roethke's craft is \\"strict and pure,\\" such that even the staunchest defenders of Sylvia Plath have confessed that Roethke's writing is more disciplined. The Deep Image movement of poets like Robert Bly and James Wright is influenced by the kind of symbolism found throughout Roethke's poetry, and those writers have acknowledged their debt to him. Roethke retained rhyme and meter in a time when all the conventions of poetry were being ripped apart; and he did so with a consummate technical skill not to be found in the Beatniks or in the Black Mountain poets. Roethke's ear for poetry is much more sensitive than that of other poets of his time. We are gagged by the lyricism in lines like\\"She came toward me in the flowing air,A shape of change, encircled by its fire.\\"(\\"The Dream\\")\\"When allMy waterfallFancies sway awayFrom me, in the sea's silence...\\"(\\"Her Time\\")\\"O love, you who hearThe slow tick of timeIn your sea-buried ear...\\"(\\"Song\\")The most exhilarating of all these are Roethke's love poems in \\"Words for the Wind\\", which justly won the Bollingen Prize and the National Book Award. These poems are unmatched for eloquence and spiritual intensity -- and it's a damn shame that modern anthologies do not reprint them, aside from the famous \\"I Knew a Woman.\\" For it is in these love poems that Roethke's soul soars, and his poetic power is fully realized.\\"She knew the grammar of least motion.\\"(\\"The Dream\\")\\"Light listened when she sang.\\"(\\"Light Listened\\")\\"I measure time by how a body sways.\\"(\\"I Knew a Woman\\").Theodore Roethke achieved greatness in art by having the courage to confront the most intense human experiences and the skill to craft them into some of the most eloquent poems of his time. If there is ONE modern poet you will read, let it be Roethke. His \\"Collected Poems\\" is a must for every poet and every lover of poetry."},{"Title":"Collected Poems","review":"I love Roethke and I can't stop loving him. His words, phrases, rhythms, thoughts, feelings and meditations stick with me. I will go a year or two without reading his work, but he is still there shaping the way I see the world. His poetry occupies the same space in my mind as Brian Eno's transcendent work On Land. It's meditative, quiet, and joyful and yet, sweaty, ominous, and alarming, all at the same time.The Far Field (North American Sequence) incarnates this feeling for me. Roethke meditates on his own mortality (don't all poets?) and finds a vast encompassing love for life. A love not only for the &quot;growing rose,&quot; but also, seemingly for the summer heat and the stench of dead buffalo, &quot;their damp fur drying in the sun.&quot; He sees beauty in nature but also &quot;redolent disorder&quot; and he calls life &quot;This ambush, this silence.&quot;I agree with him.Roethke proclaims a love for life which is similar to Nietzsche's concept of the Eternal Recurring. That is, he has learned to love life, the good and the evil, to such an extent that he would have it recur again and again, eternally. This kind of love is not a love for evil, rather it is a willingness to sit behind the window of one's pain and still look out and see the beauty. This takes great courage.Roethke's influences are obvious. What American poet could escape Whitman and his lineage, Thoreau, Henry Miller, etc.? I'm sure he read his fair share of Nietzsche. I also note, Roethke's style seems to have changed drastically towards the end of his life. I believe this was probably partly in reaction to the Beats. However, in my opinion he swallows the Beats whole and makes something new of them. Roethke's verse also periodically has the ring of Wallace Stevens, and sometimes Robert Frost. Some of his verses sound like bad seventies self-help schtick; &quot;I long for the imperishable quiet at the heart of form,&quot; etc.I only go into these criticisms so I can make a larger point. Roethke's metaphors are sometimes, seemingly, larger than their implication, sometimes they are derivative, sometimes clunky. But, his work, for me, has an almost Biblical air to it. By this I mean his work resonates on a mythological level. His ideas are broad and go to the heart without ignoring the blood and stench of life. At the same time, yes, his ideas are broad, however, his details, while often being merely enumerative, are true. By this I mean, they come from a real eye roving across a real landscape. He is, at once, strange and familiar.I would hope that Academia would catch up with Roethke. It seems that he is being unfairly ignored."},{"Title":"Collected Poems","review":"Theodore Roethke is a poet I discovered while reading an anthology in college as a freshman. Writing about a wide continuum of subjects that range from the natural landscape to the convoluted paths of love, Roethke's poems are compelling and still applicable to our time. However, he does have a tendency to be quite abstruse, especially in such poems as &quot;Forcing House&quot; and &quot;O Lull Me, Lull Me.&quot; Roethke's persistent examination of nature and its meaning to him, though, is engaging and imaginative; it was my most favorite aspect of his poems. Take, for example, the following lines from &quot;The Waking&quot; (different than the vilanelle, this one is in The Lost Son): &quot;And all the waters/ Of all the streams/ Sang in my veins/ That summer day.&quot; The poet's intricate observations, too, make his poetry powerful and a treat for the senses. If you are patient and don't mind reading his poems a few times over to get their jist, Roethke is for you."},{"Title":"Collected Poems","review":"This collection contains Roethke's \\"Words for the Wind\\", one of the great c20 collections by any poet.

The poems from Words for the Wind deal in heart stopping beauty, refinement of form, and the pleasures of a uniquely great mind in play.Dont miss it."},{"Title":"Collected Poems","review":"Theodore Roethke lived a life of inner turmoil and often outward beauty, from growing up on his father's farm to teaching at Bennington College and suffering mental illness, his poems at once recognize the yearning for more than the worldly as well as the beauty and tragedy of the physical beings we are. His children's poems (not only for children) bring an Ogden Nash-esque primitive and humorous view that makes these themes in his other poems more noticeable. All in all, Roethke was one of the great twentieth century American poets, and these poems bear this out."},{"Title":"Collected Poems","review":"At first, I was heitant to delve into this author's work simply because I'd never heard of him in all my wide readings of poetry, both modern and old.Don't make the same mistake I did.

In addition to being an impeccable craftsman of formal (metrical and rhymed) poetry, Roethke has given us some of the best free verse in the language. The poems on his father's greenhouse demonstrate Roethke's own critical comment that the best free verse has the ghost of formal verse behind it. &quot;The Lost Son&quot; is equally impressive. Whether you're interested in formal or free verse, then, Roethke is an excellent poet."},{"Title":"Collected Poems","review":"Theodore Roethke's poetry is obscure, confusing, sometimes nonsensical, often filled with inexplicable sexual imagery, from time to time impenetrable to the reader. However, in spite of, or perhaps because of, these things, Roethke is one of the finest American poets of the 20th century. This was a poet who wrote utterly nonpretentiously, putting together words for himself as much as for the world, writing to solve his own questions more than to show off to the reader that he had something to prove.Roethke was a keen observer of the links between the physical world and the metaphysical, and poems such as &quot;Meditation at Oyster River&quot; show a profound understanding of Man's place in Nature even in the mundane-ness of the life of the individual. Other pieces, such as his sequence &quot;The Lost Son,&quot; link personal events to common human experience.Roethke is not an easy poet, but he deserves recognition for his style and observations, and I would recommend him to anyone who seeks good poetry."},{"Title":"Collected Poems","review":"When I think of poetry I put Roethke right next to all the mastersthat I love: Keats, Shakespeare, Thomas. Roethke separates himself byhis immersion full thrust into our world. For him there is no membrane betweenhis words and nature. Plants, people, provide pictures for his unerringrhythm. While chilling me to the bone, he charms me with wit. When I wishto shake myself out my doldrums I read Roethke. His poems have a courageof a pioneer that goes alone.

The book portrays the king as a lover of German Myth and art and more than anything Richard Wagner. While it dabbles into the question of whether Ludwig II truly was \\"mad\\" it doesn't definitively answer the question. It does however go to great lengths to describe the behavior, misanthropy, lack of desire to act as king and above all excessive spending of the King. To some extent the book also explores the circumstances that may have caused Ludwig to live more in his dream world than in reality. His father was stern and offered little support and guidance to the heir to the throne and the political climate in pre-unified Germany was rife with turmoil and war. And finally (and possibly most importantly) he ascended the throne at 19. All of these factors provide ample reasons why Ludwig would find being king as a challenge. His romantic temperament which is emphasized in the book took over...Where the true greatness of this book is in the accounts, letters, primary sources used to describe the kings loney and enigmatic life. In spite of the strangeness of the king you cant help but pity him. His only contact with the real world was in his midnight rides through the alpine dorfs of Bavaria where he felt relaxed and and showed the peasants only kindness. He also was incredibly genrous with these people and the few others he took a liking too even if he did require them to go at great lengths to please him including trecking over Swiss Glaciers to re-enact a scene from Schiller's \\"William Tell\\"I found this book to be both beautiful and enjoyable. It was a fast read however I found the \\"The Swan King\\" to be a far more complete and thorough work that explored Ludwig's Bavaria and Europe better than this one. If you are looking for an easy to follow and wholly enjoyable read \\"The Dream King\\" is for you. This is the perfect book to bring on a flight to Munich since it will only take a few hours to read and sets the scene for the cultural treasures of Bavaria. Reading and viewing this book you will understand why Bavarians today think so kindly of Ludwig II. Ludwig shows us that all great men need to be a little eccentric to see beyond the plane of the average and Ludwig'eccentricity did much to add to German culture and to beautify Bavaria. Like his grandfather he did more to beautify Munich and Bavaria and any other of the Wittelsbach and only adds to the charm of southern German culture.Ted Murena"},{"Title":"The Dream King, Ludwig II of Bavaria","review":"If you have any curiosity at all about the man who built those famous, fairytale castles in Germany, this is an excellent overview. It pairs a good, basic biography with loads of images and pulls the reader into Ludwig's world in a way a less well-illustrated biography might not. The images are, in fact, the strongest part of this book since the narrative, though good, isn't what you'd call a comprehensive study of Ludwig's life.

Love stories run the spectrum from soup to nuts, bawdy to ethereal. Mr. Parker's Love and Glory seems to me to be a worthy archetype of the best of breed of a middle ground for the young and not so young reader. At its core it concerns itself with the male character's recognition of and efforts toward becoming the best man possible for the woman he loves. He works to release self pity and the arrogance and short-sightedness of youth. At the novel's end he again offers his mature love as a gift to his beloved. The icing on this luscious cake is his willingness beforehand to accept both a final rejection and the certainty that his love will occupy his heart for the rest of his life. Mr. Parker accomplishes this with the reader's great thanks: there is just enough prose to create three dimensional characters worth caring for. He does this within a relatively small book, whose story line fluidly brings us to a emotionally satisfying conclusion and whose meaning echoes in our lives.

At the very least, this novel is his pathetic attempt at emulating the day time soap operas and he fails miserably."},{"Title":"Love and Glory","review":"This book is one of Robert Parker's few non-Spenser novels, though the protagonist has some sort of family resemblance to the Boston gumshoe. Like the Spenser novels, it's told in first person narrative and makes plenty of literary references. There's a friendship with a black man who boxes (like Hawk), and the girl eats fastidiously (like Susan). Much of the book takes place at Taft University, a fictional college that was the setting of Parker's Spenser novel Playmates.But what's most interesting about this book is that the protagonist describes his experiences as a writer and his work on a doctorate in English literature. At this point the character has less in common with Spenser and more in common with Robert Parker himself. One is left wondering if through this novel, Parker has given his readers more of an autobiographical glimpse of his own life and literary career."},{"Title":"Love and Glory","review":"Some friends of mine gave me a copy of Love and Glory as a present. They knew how much I liked the author (actually, I like the Spenser mystery series, which are penned by the author), and thought that I might like this book as well. Since I am not a rabid fan of love stories, the book found its way to the very bottom of my 'to read much later list'.Well, to make a long story short, given that I read a book a day, I eventually got around to Love and Glory, and I now regret not having read it much earlier. Parker spins a tale well, with characters that, despite all our best efforts, we come to care about, a clipped, succinct writing style, and an absorbing narrative. In this love story, we meet a young man who goes off to college, falls in love with a flighty, free-spirited, but somewhat confused classmate. She naturallly breaks his heart, he eventually suffers hardship and a protracted fall from grace, and we watch as he picks himself up at rock bottom, dusts off his backside, and slowly but surely climbs the ladder to personal success one slow but sure step at a time, using nothing but strength of character, force of conviction and the flicker of undying love for the woman who once spurned him.Of course, you can guess the ending to this wonderful tale, but as they say about life, it is not the destination but the journey that matters most. The hero's story from idealistic young man to a man in his own right is both touching and highly motivating. Parker's penchant for dropping life lessons here and there are evident in this story, and at times I got the feeling that I was actually reading a Spenser novel, only in this setting, everyone's favorite Back Bay PI chose to go to college and grad school, eventually becoming a writer, and not a detective. There were also some interesting similarities between Boone, the hero of this story, and Spenser, such as both serving in the Korean Conflict, both sharing a love of literature, and both possessing a love, bordering on religious devotion, for one woman.In sum, I liked Love and Glory, and I think most people will like it, too. Spanning a time period between the early 1950s and the middle 1970s, it also provides the reader with a good glimpse of a turbulent in American history. For me, the book was an interesting departure from my usual fare (mysteries, assorted non-fiction and god-awful sci-fi), and in future, I may add more of the genre to my eclectic reading list."},{"Title":"Love and Glory","review":"If you enjoy the Spenser novels, you will probably enjoy this - although the novel is not about Spenser. The main character wants to win the fair haired maiden at any cost and in that sense is romantic. What is lacking is any real history of the main character that would give him more life.

Wish I could have afforded it in hardback."},{"Title":"Love and Glory","review":"Feeling semi-autobiographical this is one of Parker's best books! Dealing with some of his best themes: life, love, what it means to be a man; Parker masterfully tells the story of a man coming into himself and what that means. If you love Parker you MUST read this one."},{"Title":"Jesus and Lao Tzu: The Parallel Sayings","review":"I strongly recommend this book to those who are interested inor involved with Christian, Jewish, and/or Tao outlooks.The author and editor take the position that Jesus and Lao Tzurepresented 2 separate philosophical disciplines that branchedfrom the same originating river (GOD). This is,to my way ofthinking, quite extraordinary,considering the vast differencesof East and West histories and cultures, and communication.It's too bad that this book is not in more people's hands(and lives!). You get 3 basic things from the book:1) An excellent overview of Jesus' and Lao Tzu's teachings,and how they relected on each others', as presentedin the preface.2) A breakdown of all the teachings into 9 catagories;1 catagory per chapter. Each chapter comprises many pairedquotes from each teacher; you be the judge to just how similarthey are to each other.3) A Commentary section following the 9 chapters/topicsthat is well worth having all by itself. Tremendous insight,backed up by the referred to precious chapters.If all the above isn't enough, and it is, the bindingends with a fine list of recommended books for furthurstudy.Again, if you are a serious Jew, Christian or Taoist(or seeker of deeper meaning in life) I think you shouldhave this as one of your key reference books.P.S. Jesus' sayings in the book are just Jesus' sayingsalone, not mixed up with what disciples and clergy addedto the Gospel from their vantage points."},{"Title":"Jesus and Lao Tzu: The Parallel Sayings","review":"This book is loaded with thought-provoking parables of life that could interest people of any religion. These life parables are universal and quite entertaining. Definitely not a heavy read --easy to pick up and set down anytime. One page has a sentence from Jesus and the opposite page has Lao Tzu's version. Seems good for teaching."},{"Title":"Jesus and Lao Tzu: The Parallel Sayings","review":"Of corse all Taoists in America and Europe are influanced or affected by Christianity... it is woven into the fabric of our society. This is why is is good for a Taoist to read this book. It will bring him/her some &quot;comfort&quot; with regard to Christianity, and help them to understand the nature of Jesus, thus, understand more about their Christian neighbor.&quot;Liberal&quot; Christians will probably enjoy this book as well... and may even begin to regard Lao Tzu as a bit of a prophet :)I would recomend it as a gift from Taoist to Chrisian or Christian to Taoist.... NOT as a &quot;conversion&quot; tool, but as a tool for mutual understanding.Although I enjoyed seeing the parallels... I thought that some of the sayings did not really match very well as far as their actual meanings, also I was suprised by some of the verses that were *not* included... there are some better verses that show the simular intents of Lau Tzu and Jesus than some of the ones chosen by the Author.One might do better to read the Tao Te Ching and the &quot;words in red&quot; of the new testiment for his/herself! However, if you can't be bothered to do that, this book is a nice quick referance and a nice teaching tool.I wish there was a Lao Tzu and Muhammad book.. I'd like to see what would be made of that! :)"},{"Title":"Jesus and Lao Tzu: The Parallel Sayings","review":"I bought this book thinking the parallels would be helpful, and they might have been if I could have seen any parallel between the 2 texts.

As pastor I felt compelled to find similarities between the 2 teachers.I found a few but not with the help of this book.Everyone enjoyed the book discussion anyway."},{"Title":"Jesus and Lao Tzu: The Parallel Sayings","review":"This book is a good attempt at demonstrating parallels between the words of Christ and Lao Tzu - but is falls short. For one thing, other biblical writer's words are used as parallels, such as Paul, and I believe one of the psalmists, so the title is misleading. Some of the parallels are impressive, while others are tenuous, stretching it quite a bit. Some of the chapter introductions are pretty well-written, though. It's a light read, not the least bit scholarly, and probably won't give you any more parallels than you could have quickly found yourself from reading the Tao, assuming you are familiar with the New Testament."},{"Title":"Jesus and Lao Tzu: The Parallel Sayings","review":"Not so sure about the comparisons made (Jesus - Lao Ze) on opposing pages. Interesting, though."},{"Title":"The Baby Trail: A Novel","review":"Married one year thirty-three years old make-up artist Emma Hamilton and her spouse rugby coach James decide to have a baby. Emma conducts research, develops an action plan with a detailed time line, and implements the process because she must be ready to celebrate next Christmas with her three month old child.However, month two in her plan called for pregnancy, which failed to happen in spite of constant sex. Now two months behind schedule, Emma decides to supplement the au natural plan that failed to perceive its objective. Months later and still not pregnant, fertility drugs, standing on her head, and James not allowed wasting one iota in case that one is the gold medal swimmer, Emma is stopped by a cop who has just adopted a Romanian child. Two years and no kid, even James is losing patience with Emma (can the readers be far behind?) so perhaps Bucharest is the perfect vacation spot that is after a stop at Lourdes hoping for divine intervention.This chick lit tale is more a series of vignettes that focus on contraception and fertility than a novel. Though the obsessed Emma is an interesting character, readers will become weary of her antics yet ironically root for her to achieve her goal and become pregnant. James is a saint (or the reincarnation of Job) for putting up with Emma's insanity. THE BABY TRAIL has amusing moments and overall is well written, but reads more like a short story collection with a central character worth perusing over several sittings.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Baby Trail: A Novel","review":"So many days I see girls pushing prams looking way too young to be mums, breeding the world with kids who will probably never know their fathers cos the mothers were too out of it to catch his name.On the other hand there are so many would-be mothers out there desperately trying to get pregnant, and find out it isn't so easy as coming off the pill. This book addresses all those issues.Like many following in the very successful footsteps of Marian Keyes, every other new romance author is now Irish. Marian Keyes is the success story here - some of the others will fall by the wayside, cos they're simply following a tried and tested route. Too many authors struggle to get recognised cos their work is \\"different\\", while these style of books are everywhere. Bookshops these days are saturated by them.The Baby Trail does deal with a complicated issue, which is quite often in the news, but fails, due to a demanding, immature woman trying to get pregnant. Readers will get easily get irritated with Emma's character, as she demands stuff from her husband that he can't provide in the middle of an important meeting; kicks children; cries at the drop of a hat, and pushes away her friends who can get pregnant. By the end of the book, I was well and truly annoyed with her, and worst of all, the book ended on a weird note - could Sinead Moriarty be perhaps planning a sequel?I would recommend this book, but only for the less easily annoyed of the readers out there. Pick it up cheap if you can, or don't buy it all. Stick to Marian Keyes, or something DIFFERENT."},{"Title":"The Baby Trail: A Novel","review":"I know Chick Lit isnt exactly \\"the classics\\" but sometimes I wonder how these books get published. I thought the premise was good- for a target audience of women in their late 20's/early 30's, pregnancy and babys are topic of interest, and of which there arent that many books written, actually.But this book misses the mark. The lead character is one dimensional and I didnt feel a connection to her. Her friends were more interesting if anything, but you only saw the surface of them. The sister was a little over the top. Its heavy on accented or regional dialect English (Irish slant?) which seemed a bit much at times. The book seemed predicatable. Despite that, I decided to continue to read it anyway (took 1.5 days) to see what happened and heaven help me if the ending was not one of the worst Ive ever read.Did she have an editor on this? No one noticed this lack of detail?Anyway, the author might do ok eventually (deeper characters and try to include an ending next time) but I didnt find this book inspired, funny (rarely), or ultimately, satisfying."},{"Title":"The Baby Trail: A Novel","review":"The story started out ok but never really picked up for me. The main character was too whiney and seemed silly rather than serious about having a baby. Her husband, James, was a real trooper through the whole ordeal. There is one big funny part where he gets a groin injury and she still wants to have sex! There were funny parts here and there but this isn't deep reading. I had hoped for more but nope - not this novel."},{"Title":"The Baby Trail: A Novel","review":"This is the author's debut. As far the writing goes, this is a wonderful book. The author manages to really involve us in the storyline of this couple who are somewhat desperately attempting to have a baby.However, the author needs to make her main character (Emma) a heck of a lot less annoying. Although I felt for Emma and her hubby not being able to conceive, the author managed to make me extremely dislike Emma.Emma was portrayed as increasingly infantile and I kept expecting her to start stamping her foot and holding her breath until the powers that be gave her what she wanted.I think if I had been her hubby or family, I would have smacked her. This removed alot of the pleasure of this book for me, hence the 3 stars.I think there would have been a few other ways to explain Emma's frustration without making her so annoying.Still, I would consider reading the next novel by this author."},{"Title":"The Baby Trail: A Novel","review":"This is a tale of a young married woman in Dublin who can't seem to get pregnant and her attempts to do just that. The characters are attractive and Moriarty has written some hysterical scenes, but there is way too much specific information on fertility techniques for this to succeed completely as a novel. At one point, I checked to see if it was non-fiction!At the same time, I found it a fast and, for the most part, enjoyable read. The end seemed to peter out, so to speak, and so I docked it a star for that."},{"Title":"The Baby Trail: A Novel","review":"I was a little unsure about this book after reading the reviews but after reading the book it is obvious to me that some of the reviewers have not dealt with infertility and therefore could not relate to the book.If you have dealt with infertility or know someone who has this book is great. It was so nice to read a story that I could completely relate to. Emma does seem to have a dramatic response to her inability to get pregnant while all those around her seem to get pregnant at the drop of a hat but if you have been through it you can completely relate to her frustrations. My sister borrowed it from me to read also because I kept telling her how true so many of Emma's feelings were. She wanted to understand more what it was like to stand on the infertility side of things.The ending is slightly disappointing but all in all the book is really good. I just saw recently that there is a follow-up book coming out in June 2006 where the story continues. I can not wait to get it and read more about Emma's journey to motherhood.This may be Sinead's first book but I think she did a fantastic job writing about something that effects so many women yet isn't written about much."},{"Title":"The Baby Trail: A Novel","review":"I had been going through months and months of IVF treatments and I just happened to purchase this book the day that I had my embryo transfer done (bedrest for 3 days!). There couldn't be a more perfect book for someone who has had difficulty conceiving and has gone through the ups and downs of infertility. You feel the frustration, anxiety, anger, depression... all the emotions that women go through. Women who have not experienced this might not get as much of a kick out of the book that I did, but it was the perfect book that I needed at that time! The ending... I hated it. I was really bummed when I read the last chapter. There had been so much excitement leading up to that point... then nothing."},{"Title":"The Baby Trail: A Novel","review":"I loved this book! I got it very fast and couldn't put it down after I opened it up.My husband and myself have been going through all the same things as Emma, the main character, goes through in this book. I felt like I was reading a story about myself.I liked the book because it really hits home and points out some of the crazy things that us women hoped up on fertility drugs will do. I particuraly liked the part about having to change shirts because of the hot flashes from Clomid (this is so true!)Although the book has a very sad ending, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is sensitive to this issue, I very much enjoyed it, and I feel better knowing that a woman has the guts to write about a very real issue."},{"Title":"The Baby Trail: A Novel","review":"Infertility is no laughing matter. Men and women unable to have children are often put through the emotional and physical wringer in trying to build a family. So to say that Sinead Moriarty's first novel THE BABY TRAIL --- about one woman's difficulty getting pregnant --- is humorous, while true, does not do justice to the depth of the story and the sensitivity Moriarty feels for the serious subject matter.THE BABY TRAIL is funny, often laugh-out-loud funny. But that is because its main character, Emma Hamilton, is funny, not because Moriarty tries to suggest that infertility is.At thirty-three, happily married and content in her career, Emma has decided it is high time to start a family. Her husband, James, agrees. She thinks it will be simple; stop using birth control, have sex, and after a couple of months she will find herself pregnant. But after a few months go by, Emma starts to get worried. She changes her diet, exercises more, and tracks her ovulation. Still no pregnancy. After a year, Emma and James visit fertility specialists, and from that point on Emma spends a year undergoing painful and depressing procedures, taking hormones and becoming positively obsessed with conception.Her family and friends begin to worry about her, and her relationship with James becomes strained; Emma knows she is losing emotional control but feels she needs to keep trying to have a baby. Finally, after a couple of years and one too many invasive doctor visits, she needs to decide what her priorities are and how much she is willing to endure to have a child.What is funny about this story? Despite the serious and heartbreaking topic, Moriarty's prose is often hilarious and always witty. Dubliner Emma is smarty and sassy with a sharp tongue, and her brogue and Irish slang are charming (yet readable). Often it is Emma's --- that is Moriarty's --- honesty about sex, relationships and ego that make the book funny, but mostly it is Emma's wry and bold narration that will get a laugh from readers.Still, this is a serious book. Moriarty does not trivialize the issue of infertility and never gives Emma an easy way out; she and James must make tough decisions. We follow Emma through two years of humiliation, sadness, anger and frustration as well as hopefulness. THE BABY TRAIL is realistic and poignant in this way.Along with Emma and James, readers meet a host of characters that are all important in Emma's life. Her two close friends represent two alternate lifestyles --- the single, workaholic and the stressed stay-at-home mom. Her parents and siblings, while unable to empathize, are supportive of Emma and every bit as quirky as she is. James's friend Donal, a professional rugby player, is raising his orphaned niece on his own. And James's brother and sister-in-law are having twins, and rubbing salt in Emma's emotional wounds.It would be a shame to pass over this novel because it seems at first glance like so much light \\"Chick Lit\\" reading. For fans of the genre there is the spunky heroine (and Irish to boot), the handsome love interest, the fiery friends, and lots to smile at. However, this novel transcends many similar stories by dealing with a difficult issue with grace and intelligence. So readers looking for something a bit meatier will not be disappointed. While the abrupt ending may leave readers a bit put off, Moriarty seems to be trying to leave the end of Emma's struggles to the imagination. Still, the end, while a respectable effort, is the main weakness of the novel.Moriarty's debut is promising. It is well-written with a good blend of humor and drama.--- Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman"},{"Title":"The Baby Trail: A Novel","review":"It was a pleasure to read a story that is so true that people NOT going thru it will review it as she is crazy. Yes, she may seem that way - but you would be too.I found it a wonderful and honest surprise that like life, she does NOT end up with a perfect pink line on a stick - something we all long for.If this is something you are currently dealing with it felt safe reading it, I hoped along with her and laughed when it felt good. She isn't perfect and it is ok."},{"Title":"The Baby Trail: A Novel","review":"The books starts out well. There is a lot hilarity in the heroine, Emma, and her direct approach to conceiving with her husband, James. The comparisons to the new mothers are particular funny, especially the loss of personality and humor. But it starts to fall apart towards the end when it fails to resound with the reality of infertility. The specialist comes across as a quack and Emma begins to be viewed as a tad psycho. It was hard for me to swallow that one year of attempting to conceive equated to infertility without any medical explanation, therefore the treatments seemed absurd. Suspending reality however, the secondary characters carried the book. Lucy, Donal, Babs, and Sean provide the comic relief and their own stories are fun to follow. I'd never couch this book as a waste of time, but at the same time, I'd never reread this book. The ending was disappointing with no real resolution to the story line."},{"Title":"The Baby Trail: A Novel","review":"This is a great book!!! I laughed so hard!! I can totally relate to this book since my husband and I are on fertility treatments.

I really loved the approach of this book, a humorous look at the seriously pathetic subject of infertility.I could personally identify with almost all the stuff Emma was going through. While I haven't yet interrupted my husband's meeting to tear his clothes off, I have gone loco when he informed me he had to go out of town during my \`fertile days' (and I was once an extremely rational woman)!I laughed and cried with Emma as she dealt with social issues, went through the multiple \`mildly uncomfortable' medical procedures, undertook pilgrimages and saw her friends get pregnant incessantly!I give this book 4 stars instead of 5 only because of the books' tremendous appeal for a very selective audience. If you have been through this, you know exactly what Emma's life is like. For me personally it was very helpful to step back and look at this situation from another perspective, and the humor gave a much-needed release to plenty of pent up frustrations!For others, this book may seem unnecessary, weird and whiny.But for all the women populating the millions of infertility bulletin boards out there, this is a must read. You will totally identify with the trials and tribulations of the process and get some much-needed laughs."},{"Title":"The Baby Trail: A Novel","review":"his is the first fiction book I've ever read that has accurately portrayed what it is like to cope with fertility problems. The descriptions of the tests, drugs, procedures and emotions are dead-on. Because it is fiction, the main character has some behavior that is a bit nutsy. For example, the woman who will go to her husband's office and rip his shirt off when he refuses to have sex with her when she is ovulating is probably few and far between. However, once you've taking your temp every morning for a year, peed on sticks for half of every month, and taken drugs that make you crazy, you can certainly see how someone might entertain such behavior. And I very much appreciated reading a book that did not tie everything up in a neat pink or blue bow at the end."},{"Title":"The Baby Trail: A Novel","review":"Having just started out down the TTC path and finding a whole new world out there (not to mention a raft of abbreviations to deal with), I found this book very refreshing.

Having just learned that a close friend is expecting No.2 child (not planned but joyous), I could appreciate Emma's response to her sister-in-laws news of twins and the constant comments by well meaning friends and family.

It's a quick read, but goes into way too much details about her fertility struggles with absolutely no other plotline, reflection, etc....

The only side-plot, about her friend's dating, wasn't that interesting because I just didn't care enough about the characters.

This will happen right away, as soon as she gets off the pill. Or so she thinks.Emma finds herself on a two-year rollercoaster, trying everything from limiting her husband's, ahem, alone time to fertility drugs and in vitro fertilization. The author definitely knew her stuff about these procedures, rattling off medical terms like an expert.In addition, though Emma's obsession with getting pregnant is completely and humorously brought to light, the story is not just about her. There are funny interludes about Emma's friend Lucy and Emma's husband's friend Donal, who are fixed up with disastrous results, but gradually find their way to a happier footing.One of my favorite things about the story was that it remained quite light and funny throughout, even as Emma underwent trying times. I even laughed out loud a few times.

I will definitely read more of her books, they are nice easy reads."},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"Will Storr, journalist, not only does not believe in ghosts, he's not even sure there is a God. So when the idea to research the paranormal occurs, he approaches the concept with more than the usual amount of skepticism. However, he gamely plunges on, interviewing the possessed, the ghost hunters, and the demonologists, relentlessly seeking answers as he investigates haunted places on both sides of the Atlantic. What he finds causes him not only to re-evaluate his position on things that go bump in the night, but his belief in what happens when we die and therefore his own agnosticism.Written with a great deal of humor, Will Storr covers a wide variety of paranormal research, including not only ghosts but demons, possessions, and Satanic worship. He's tenacious in finding those who are famous (or infamous) in the world of paranormal research, including those who don't want to be interviewed. He doesn't shy away from the hard questions, and in pursuing the \\"truth\\", he discovers that some things simply cannot be explained, though he does spend a good deal of time trying to find scientific reasons for what's he's finding. A point in his favor is that he doesn't swallow everything he's fed without analyzing; his observance on the set of England's TV prgram \\"Most Haunted\\" is particularly revealing. However, as is often said in the paranormal investigations world, once everything has been analyzed carefully, what cannot be debunked becomes evidence, and Storr certainly sees some gripping substantiation that there is something else out there.You don't have to believe in ghosts to enjoy this title. Storr has an engaging style that will definitely keep you entertained. A minor irritation for me was the fact that at times I felt as though I was left hanging without conclusion to the investigation, though probably Storr himself felt this way occasionally. Storr's about-face on his beliefs may indeed make you question your own, and in this case, that's a good thing. Recommended."},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"I have read many ghost story books, seen many if not all the documentaries on ghosts, poltergiests, demons, etc. . . But I have never read a book with such a refreshing perspective on ghosts than the one that Will Storr has wrote. This book is very well done, it makes you believe and question the reality of ghosts. Will plays both sides of the fence skeptic and believer. He takes you through the lives of ghost hunters, demon chasers and exorcist priests. Will shows both sides of the coin, laying the facts in front of you to let you decide what is real and what is not. If you are a believer in ghosts you will question your belief and if you do not believe you will suspect that ghosts exist. You have to get this book especially if you are not a believer in the paranormal, you will be amazed and quite entertatined by the notion of ghostly beings. I hope Will will write a sequel to his awesome ending. Write on Will!"},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"I have read and thoroughly enjoyed several books on the paranormal over the years and \`Will Storr Vs. The Supernatural', written by Will Storr, was no exception. It was one of those books that you start to read and then have difficulty putting down. In fact I had read it cover to cover in less than three days, despite working and being mum to a four-year-old child!Storr's narrative style of writing and investigative journalism have earned him comparisons with Louis Theroux and Jon Ronson. I personally found the book to be a fascinating piece of work. Thought provoking, to the point, balanced, well researched and in places his description of events had me laughing out loud! As a sceptic, he started his journey to disprove paranormal events and poke gentle fun at those who believe in them when he was sent on a journalistic assignment to follow a Demonologist in Philadelphia, USA. As events unfolded, he found himself being unable to debunk what he was witnessing and he became more and more convinced that there really was \`something' out there. On returning home, he decided to try and explain these events for himself, so he delved into several different areas of the paranormal in an attempt to clarify things in his own mind. He takes part in investigations with various paranormal groups including the Ghost Club, he visit's Maurice Grosse at home, goes on set with Most Haunted Live, has coffee with sceptical psychologists, experiments with Ouija boards and dowsing rods and is exorcised by the Vatican's chief exorcist in Rome. He meets some very interesting and colourful characters along the way!Will Storr's assessment of events is fair and unpretentious. It will appeal to the believer or sceptic alike as Will keeps an open mind and evaluates each event in its own context. The book includes favourite UK investigation sites such as Michelham Priory and Coalhouse Fort. I particularly enjoyed the way Will involves the reader in his thought process but doesn't force his own view on you, merely suggests explanations and lets you, as the reader, draw your own conclusions.As a Council member of 'The Ghost Club' which is featured in the book I would like to congratulate Will on an accurate portrayal of the club - which incidently does use scientific methods and equipment during it's investigations; something that a previous reviewer has quoted wrongly.On that note I only have one thing left to say. More of the same please!"},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"If, like me, you consider yourself an open-minded sceptic about the issue of ghosts and ghost hunters - but admit to loving a ghost story none-the-less - then this is a great book to read. Will Storr is essentially one of us. If I were to carry out an inquiry into modern day ghost hunters and their subject matter, I would probably want to meet all the same people and ask all the same questions that Storr does of his subjects.As well as being a bit of a non-fiction thriller, this book is also about someone on something like a spiritual quest, and this gives the book an interesting extra depth, although I wouldn't buy it on this basis as the emphasis is more about ghosts and ghost hunters.Most importantly for me, though, the book can be very eerie in places, but Storr remains as scientifically minded as possible throughout. His objectivity makes the exercise all the more believable and enjoyable, as one doesn't feel that you're possibly being hoodwinked (at least not by the author).Much, much, much better than an entire series of \`Britain's Most Haunted' and similar shows."},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"What happens when a confirmed skeptic takes on the supernatural world?Well, in the real world, not a hell of a lot. The skeptic will, in most cases, remain utterly skeptical, always finding some logical reason by which to relegate the supernatural into something mundanely prosaic.But if that skeptic happens to be internationally famous journalist Will Storr, known for his irreverence and straight shooting style of Gonzo-journalism, then you know to expect the unexpected- even from someone as proud of his level headed skepticism as Storr.This is a quest, written by a man who wants to find the truth, and goes to great lengths to find it. Storr walks us through his own doubts, giving us an honest assessment of his emotional tensions throughout his two years of research. He admits that he started the book with a smirking derision about all things spiritual (including his own religious upbringing), but by its end has a different view on the things he witnesses that have no rational explanation.Even though Storr doesn't take things at face value, at one point in his fascinating quest he decides to try and believe anything that anyone tells him without question. This includes some obviously delusional people who see something supernatural in even the most common of events, and some earnest people who believe in their possession and haunting without a modicum of scientific proof. Needless to say, Storr's intelligent skepticism soon kicks back in and he seeks out hard scientific reasoning for the things he sees and hears along the way, including phantom lights that follow people around their homes, heavy breathing and being touched by something in an empty room, and many other creepy moments that are sure to make even the most stalwart unbeliever pause for a second and wonder.Storr tries to cover all aspects of supernatural, visiting philosophers, doctors, scientists, parapsychologists, mediums, priests, demonologists, and everyday people who have been victims of hauntings, possessions, and other less than normal events for answers. He finds superstitious people that seem to still live in the Middle Ages where demons and devils control every aspect of their simple lives and a skeptical doctor who, although he confesses to having seen a ghost as a child, blindly refuses to accept that anything beyond the normal can exist. Storr cleverly shows us the two ends of the extreme, and smartly decides to plop himself somewhere between them. His 2004 visit to the set of Most Haunted (a successful reality show about haunted places on the U.K.'s Living Channel) is laugh out loud funny reading, as he exposes the show for fake.So do ghosts really exist? Are devils and demons all around us? Is there something beyond when we shuffle off this mortal coil?Unbeliever, or one of the faithful, WILL STORR VS. THE SUPERNATURAL will give you much food for thought, and may even give you chance to answer those questions for yourself.--Nickolas Cook"},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"I read this book on holiday and found it a fascinating read. Will Storr is a journalist who stumbled across \`the Supernatural' whilst doing an article for a magazine. He is neither wholly sceptical nor a firm believer, but rather takes us through a journey of discovery through a variety crackpots in both camps. Will never really offers an opinion on his subjects but prefers to let the various people hang themselves, or not as the case may be. Its testament to his writing that one often doesn't come to an overall opinion about many of the people he meets: that even if they do seem completely wacko they come across as very ordinary people like you and me: which of course (at least some of them!) are.One of the best things about this book is not the fear factor (and I'm ashamed to say I was a bundle of nerves while reading a lot of it) but the humour. His visit to the set of TV's Most Haunted is particularly funny, in an \`isn't the Media so ridiculous' kind of way and Will's Brazen cheekiness at stealing the evenings programme of \`Happenings' makes particularly funny reading.On the other hand this is not simply an exercise in poking fun at those who believe in ghosts. There were many passages that we're genuinely terrifying reading, and Will does a very good job of recreating the experience of fear, whether rational or irrational. What this book does is remind us that there is a lot in the world that we don't know about and often Scientists who believe that they know everything are often just as scary as Ghost hunters. Will's trip to the Vatican and his meeting with the Vatican's chief exorcist is a real eye opener and a fascinating piece of writing, and I recommend this book just for that piece alone."},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down! The pages just flew by. The author, a journalist, recounts his journey of exploration and research into the world of the supernatural - in particular, the existence of ghosts. Starting off basically as a skeptic, his travels lead him into all sorts of situations - some more baffling than others. On the matter of the existence of ghosts and an afterlife, he has discussions with a philosopher, a psychiatrist, research physicians, a priest/exorcist and a variety of ghost hunters; he interviews people who have had various experiences with ghosts; he travels to several places in England, the USA and even the Vatican; he participates in various investigations, including haunted houses, poltergeists, possessions and even examines the issue of Near Death Experiences. Throughout his researches he remains focused, objective and open-minded. He continuously reflects on what he's experiencing in his investigations, in light of the history of these various phenomena throughout the ages, looking for patterns. He even considers quantum physics (Uncertainty Principle) and string theory (multi dimensions) as possibly having the potential for eventually explaining these phenomena. Could it be that consciousness and the physical body are two separable entities? The evidence is there to be studied. The bottom line is that some of these events, as described, are simply not obviously explainable through conventional knowledge. This is an excellent book. The prose flows in a very friendly and engaging style. It should be of interest to skeptics and believers alike, as well as those simply interested in unsolved mysteries."},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"This is a balanced and thoroughly entertaining exploration of ghostly phenomena written by a journalist with an impressive profile in the UK. Storr is neither credulous nor so blinkered as to dismiss his subject matter out of hand. In fact, one of the delights of the book is an ongoing dialogue the author maintains between the part of him that wants to believe and the part that doesn't. In his quest Storr also covers a lot of territory, examining philosophical, psychological and scientific aspects of the supernatural as well as forming astute assessments of the characters he encounters. Both sceptics and those who believe that ghosts are real will therefore find much to delight and challenge them here. Best of all, Storr does not sit on the fence at the end but readers will be hard pressed to second guess his conclusions as they make their way through the text."},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"I read this book as a sceptic, but ended up really enjoying it.A sceptic in terms of the fact that the author and I are related and I was reading it more from a sense of duty than anything else. After the months of dinner-table chat about his adventures racing around distant houses and woodlands it was only natural that I buy a copy, if only to join in future conversations around it!I did in fact enjoy it immensly. It's an engaging, funny, curious and most of all accessible romp through a complex and mysterious question; is there more to life than we perceive? I was pleased to see that many other people shared my opinion, have a look at the reviews on amazon.co.uk.Having known Will all my life and spoken to him many times during his research for this book, I can assure the previous reviewer he is no James Frey and this is no \\"Million Little Pieces\\"."},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"Will Storr Vs. The Supernatural is one of those books that beg to be read on a rainy day while drinking some hot tea or coffee. It's very easy to read, funny, and some times terrifying."},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"I have quite a collection of books on ghosts and theparanormal. I've met so many serious people in thewoo-woo New Age scene. Then I stumbled into WillStorr's gem. Frank, honest, and devastatinglyFUNNY. And I was cured of all that woo-woo (andbecame less pretentious/pious). Also, this bookis a serious quest (re:a fterlife). Will Storris more than funny (classic Brit funny). He'ssensitive. I love this book."},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"Will Storr is a very good writer. The subject is interesting, but its the writing that makes the book such a great read. Storr can create an image or an atmosphere with a few carefully crafted words. He's also got a great sense of humor. I whole-heartedly agree with the reviewer commenting on how this book doesn't resort to mockery or pretention about its subject, like some other writers have. The tone as a whole is respectfully skeptical, but open minded. A paranormal event is, I guess, like pornography-you know it when you see it."},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"Will Storr's a good writer, indeed, but he rambles throughout and stumbles past important points on his way to a vague conclusion to his work. The book's an entertaining read, but lacks teeth for those passionately seeking for him to delve into the real \\"bones\\" of supernatural investigation. No shortage of what I'd call filler chapters chosen for their entertainment value and fluffed up enough for one to continue turning pages. Storr's point is to entertain, not provoke too much thought, although he succeeds in entertaining in great bounds. A good read for those for those interested enough to wade past the \\"interesting\\" characters into the realm of his real investigations."},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"The book's one disappointment was that Storr avoided spelling out his own conclusions from his investigations, leaving the readers wondering just what influence his experiences had on his initial scepticism.Otherwise, Storr did a great job. He reported the fakery, self-deception, and general nonsense offered by many paranormal 'investigators,' the nonsense that has convinced some that all supernatural investigations are bunk. He also reported those real questions unbiased investigators have found. Like most of the honest investigators I've read, he found evidence of 'something' or inexplicable things, and found the evidence insufficient to support grand conclusions.I enjoyed his account of his foray into the inexplicable. I found myself liking the people he liked and thought sincere, and getting a bad taste in my mouth from the obvious fakes. Overall, a good piece of light reading."},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"This book is entertaining and easy to read, but it will be informative only if you're really new to the whole paranormal/supernatural/occult thing. 95% of what Will Storr covers is old hat for people who've done a smidgen of reading about the topic. But it's OK cuz even if it's old hat, it's all fun. Will Storr is a lively writer. He has a flair for description, and is great at capturing peoples' appearance, personalities and quirks.And Will Storr is earnest. He's open-minded. He's willing. One could say he's naive, yes. But Will Storr is also honest. Rather than draw a bunch of conclusions about what he experienced in his research, he just puts it out there for you.What can we conclude from Will Storr Vs. The Supernatural then? Some people are faking, some of it is wishful thinking, some is definitely unexplainable weirdness, and some is probably some kind of physical phenomenon that we just don't have the science for yet. Yeah, I already knew that, but what the heck.What baffles me more than the ghost stories, though, is Will Storr's literal-minded assumption that proof of the existence of ghosts would validate the Christian God of the Roman Catholic church, which he rejected in high school. Um. Did I miss something?Also, it should be noted that Will Storr spends a lot of time talking about TV personalities from the UK, who mean absolutely nothing to US readers.And remember: Never use a Ouija board."},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"I found this book to be very informative and at the same time very entertaining. Mr. Storr writes with both the critical mind of a skeptical journalist but, yet, he could not deny the reality of his experiences after going on a journalistic assignment to investigate the paranormal world by following around an expert Philadelphia Demonoligist.His investigations take him into the world of EVP (Electronic voice phenomenon), trance mediumship, s&eacute;ances, divining rods, monsterology, and exorcism. Concerning the paranormal, Storr may have been a 'proud skeptic' (and, in my opinion, this is best way to approach the subject) but his experiences showed him that there is indeed 'more things in heaven and earth' then Storr had ever dreamed of in his skeptical philosophy.Written with a great sense of humor, the critical eye for details of a journalist, the analytical insight of a clinical psychologist, the open mind of a philosopher and you have a thoroughly fascinating book that is informative on several levels at the same time. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"Will Storr knows that \\"the truth is out there\\" (a phrase affectionately borrowed from \\"The X-Files\\") regarding the supernatural. He wants to find the truth of ghosts, demons, witches, and the devil - anything that can be deemed \\"paranormal\\".What the reader doesn't know until after the prologue is that his search takes place in the United Kingdom and parts of Europe. This is not a problem in search of ghosts, in fact that is probably one of the best places to search and do research. However, when the TV series \\"Most Haunted\\" came up in the book, I almost spit out my mouthful of pop (soda for the rest of you). \\"Most Haunted\\" has to be one of the WORST ghost hunting shows I have seen in my 30 year history of watching paranormal shows. This show is seen in the United States on the Travel Channel. It is also the subject of many web pages for debunking the investigations found on the show. Storr was able to attend the live broadcast of \\"Most Haunted\\". Watching this show alone would make me, the researcher, not believe in the paranormal at all. It has an overly dramatic Psychic Medium as well as a jumpy host who is so afraid of the paranormal, makes the viewer wonder why she is hosting this TV show.During his investigation:* He attends a Ghost Club meeting. This club goal is to \\"observe, record and monitor possible phenomena.\\" (Storr, page 25) They do not use scientific methods or machinery however they do use dowsing rods during their investigation to find out if there is a spirit willing to communicate with them.* A page explains what causes orbs (with an explanation from Fuji Film's webpage). Many of these ghost hunters he interviews believe that orbs are spirits and not just dust.* Storr tries to contact various pastors and priests regarding exorcisms. Some believe that he is playing with fire and will not speak to him. Others are more than willing to talk to him and give many names of other priests who were involved in exorcisms.This is the part that troubles me in the book. I was always taught through my years of being raised Catholic and 12 years of Catholic school that exorcisms were like the \\"redheaded stepchild\\" of a family. It has been said that it is hard to get the church to accept something is possessed (whether it would be a house or a person) and to have a priest come to perform an exorcism. Also, the priest must be experienced and qualified to perform an exorcism since they are dangerous. Yet Storr was able to find so many priests and other \\"lay people\\" who could state \\"Yes I've performed an exorcism.\\" Or \\"Yes we may do one tonight if necessary.\\" I wonder if in Europe it is more common to find a priest who is experienced in the Rites of Exorcism than in the United States.* The people who did have a traumatic paranormal experience were not as willing to talk to Storr. Some wanted to put the past behind them and not think back to when the events took place. Those were the stories I was most interested in because the people seemed sincere in their experiences.* Storr's visit to the psychiatrist was the chapter that irritated me the most. This is a side of paranormal research I've never seen someone tackle and this is a good thing. Dr Salter believes that anyone who believes in the paranormal, believes they are a witch or has the ability to talk to the dead are mentally disturbed and are experiencing illusions. I wonder what he would change his mind and studies if he spoke with Allison DuBois...* The book should not have ended with the \\"10 most haunted places in America.\\" Since 99% of his research and references were from the UK, then it should have had the 10 most haunted places in the UK or Europe.Some things I would have loved to hear more about during his investigations:* Did he feel he wasted his time with those who were supposed to be legitimate ghost hunters and mediums only to see that looked like they were faking their trances and contacts of spirits 99% of the time?* The Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is amazing. Most times I feel as though I cannot hear what is on the tape, but when I can hear it, it will send a chill down my spine. How many EVPs did he get to listen to from the haunted places he visited?* Did anyone catch anything on video or film besides Orbs?* Did he experience anything personally and so profound that gave him his revelation \\"YES! There is an afterlife!\\"In the end I believe that Will Storr is a believer in the supernatural and always was. He did research for this book to find all types of people in the field of paranormal research. Storr interviewed so many different types of people that, at some points in the book, the reader starts to become a skeptic and wonders \\"Is everyone a fake as this in the ghost field or as supernaturally flamboyant as this one?\\"This book did not change my mind if there is an afterlife or not. It did make me think about the people he met. There are some interesting characters he encountered during his research and how it takes many to make up the field of the paranormal, no matter what part of the world the ghosts and demons are located in.-cdk"},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"I really enjoyed this book because Will Storr wrote it without taking the subject matter so seriously. He investigated many issues dealing with the paranormal, and played devil's advocate, skeptic or believer; he played both ends, and gave each a fair shot at explaining the supernatural. However along the way, among the interviews, heart-stopping moments of fear and paranormal investigations, he injected humor many time into the predicaments he placed himself in. He didn't do what so many of the believers and non-believers did which appeared in his story, which is... take themselves so SERIOUSLY! Well written, this book is a keeper. (Hint... best page in the book is #242; scariest is chapter 15, the entire thing)."},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"Journalist Will Storr wrote a piece for Loaded magazine about his experiences tagging along with a demonologist on a couple of errands--recording electronic voice phenomena (EVPs) in an allegedly haunted house in Baltimore, meeting with a suburban mother in New Jersey who is a habitual Ouija board user and may be possessed. Storr entered the project a skeptic, but he couldn't rationalize away everything he witnessed with the demon investigator. Will Storr vs. The Supernatural is the result of his decision to pursue the paranormal further. Storr's original article appears as the book's prologue. In subsequent chapters Storr details his further experiences: meetings with various groups of paranormal enthusiasts (such as the Scooby Doo-ishly named \\"Ghost Club\\"), a walk in the woods with a Druid, the few minutes he managed to stay in the most haunted room of Britain's most haunted house, an interview with a woman who, in her youth, was the central figure in a celebrated case of possession, an afternoon spent with the Vatican's chief exorcist. The stories Storr has to tell are at the least interesting. One, about an English pub said to be haunted by its former landlady, is downright chilling. And Storr's account in his last chapter of an alleged case of possession in Texas is horrifying--not because demons are on the loose but, alas, because humans are.Happily, Storr never fully surrenders his skepticism. He isn't afraid to express doubts about the claims some of his interviewees make, if not in person then at least on the page, if not in bold type then subtly:\\"'Hang on, he says, pausing with his duster and his can, 'I can hear sounds, like wooshing sounds.' His ear is cocked skywards. 'It's almost like windy conditions, even though it's not windy outside. Can you hear it?''Yes,' I say. 'Is it an aeroplane?''No, I don't think so,' he says. 'I heard it last night as well.'We listen in silence as the aeroplane goes past.\\"Mostly, as in his report from the set of Britain's television series Most Haunted, Storr reports honestly on what he's observed and lets readers draw their own conclusions. He also considers possible scientific explanations for the ghostly phenomena he and others have observed, though in the end he finds that science in its current state cannot explain everything he's experienced. A fallen Catholic, he emerges from his research convinced that there is at least some kind of an afterlife awaiting us.Storr's narrative is punctuated with some very nice bits of writing:\\"I glance to my left through the window. There have been blizzards all down the eastern seaboard for the last three days. Fat whacks of snow cover the ground everywhere except the freeway. I pause for a second to watch the cars and trucks and monstrous articulated lorries bomb noisily through the night, all exhaust-steam and slipstream and white lights and red. And as I sit and look at the traffic, somewhere deep in my brain, a tiny alarm starts to sound. At this moment, I'm still barely aware of it. But I've just begun to sense that something isn't right.\\"Note that long fourth sentence in the example above, the repetition of the coordinating conjunction \\"and\\" slowing the reader after three short sentences in a row, the dactyls and rhyme after the comma. It's a sentence that begs to be reread.Will Storr vs. The Supernatural is worth the read, because its subject matter is interesting and because Storr does a good job with it. Skeptics won't find his exploration of the paranormal convincing, I'm sure, but they should find it well-written, and possibly thought-provoking. I would only suggest that the author include in subsequent editions an index and some kind of documentation of sources and locations.Debra Hamel -- author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece (Yale University Press, 2003)"},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"'Will Storr versus the Supernatural' is not a book for self-proclaimed 'experts' or 'investigators' in the supernatural. In fact your enjoyment of this book will rely mostly on your cynicism and what you don't know about the world of ghosts and demons. There's no hard proof, no fore-drawn conclusions by the author, and no self-proclaimed sense of crediblity that plagues so many books on this subject. What this book offers is a terrific insiders look into the world of supernatural investigation and the people and experiences involved in it.What I enjoy most about 'Will Storr versus the Supernatural' is the writting by the author, Will Storr. Will's a terrific narrator who had no real connection to anything supernatural related before writing this book. Starting as a passing interest he meets with everyone from self-proclaimed 'Druids' and 'witches' to reality tv investigators to psychologists and skeptics, to exorcists, to just local ghost hunters. While Will's tone in his writing suggests his own feelings and theories you never feel like he's shoving his ideas down your throat. He lets the people and situations speak for themselves.The experiences and observations in 'Will Storr versus the supernatural' range from 'scary as hell' to interesting, to groan-worthy, to drop dead hilarious! Seriously I've never read a book that scares the crap out of me on one page then makes me burst out laughing on the other!I really can't praise 'Will Storr versus the Supernatural' enough! With so many books and docu-dramas shoving theories and ideas down your thoat by a bunch of adults playing pretend it's nice to finally get an outsider's perspective on the world of ghosts and demons and the people who investigate them.

Being a good journalist, Storr hunts for the truth. He leaves no gravestone unturned. From ouija boards, to sceances, possessed people and even a night spent with the Most Haunted television show, Storr watches and questions what he believes and what he sees.When Storr is scared, he admits it. In fact, he is shocked when anything happens but mulls it all over, gathers evidence and talks to every authority figure on just about every paranormal subject, including the Catholic church on the topic of exorcism and demons. He is relentless in his search for the truth about the paranormal.Storr is professional in his skepticism and fair when considering the sanity of the situations and people who focus to the supernatural.

Ultimately, I was very disappointed. Rather than do anything more than superficial research, Roach simply goes from one nutball \\"expert\\" to the next while making very lame jokes at their expense.Full disclosure: I'm an open-minded rationalist. Paranormalists would probably label me a skeptic, but I'm quite open to the possibility of a world beyond our own if the evidence is there. Again: IF THE EVIDENCE IS THERE. It's one thing to not have a decent explanation for odd orb-like shapes that occasionally show up in photography; it's a quantum leap (of the religious kind) to think they represent spirits of dead people.The biggest issue with paranormal studies is proof. Though there have been ghost story anecdotes over hundreds of years of human history, there continues to be an absolute lack of any tangible evidence to back it up. I think this takes researchers like Storr and Roach by surprise when they go to write a book of this nature - how could anyone be so involved in this kind of stuff when there's zero hard evidence? So Roach takes to making dumb jokes about the people she's involved with, which is basically shooting fish in a barrel.What Storr understands (and what makes his book infinitely more readable than Roach's) is that he doesn't have to make the jokes for it to be funny. Though the book starts out very superficial - he hasn't done any research before getting in the car with a demonologist from Pennsylvania - the book gets a bit more weighty as we go along. While meeting victims of poltergeists, spending evenings at haunted inns, and talking with exorcists and druids, Storr keeps his criticisms subtle and maintains an almost wide-eyed naivete into the subject matter. And while Roach keeps a comfortable distance from the stuff she's researching, Storr dives right in with enthusiasm.The most compelling chapter occurs at the end of the book, in which a bunch of ghost hunters learn of a child that is showing classic signs of possession. Without giving anything away, it's a very, very thought-provoking chapter on the dangers of baseless beliefs, and the horrors that can happen when they're forced on other people. It makes you rethink every single person Storr has met, and their (often unsettling) psychological reasons for being drawn to the paranormal in the first place.This book is highly recommended. Storr's British humor shows through, and it's a very fun, amusing, enlightening, and thought-provoking look at the supernatural. Someone here complained that Storr deals with a lot of paranormal groups that are mostly unknown outside of the UK. To me, this is a positive - it really gives perspective to evaluate someone's beliefs without any knowledge of their \\"authority\\" on the subject."},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"for an author writing on the subject of ghosts.

Humorous, touching and saddening glimpses into the desire of people to try to understand life and what comes after."},{"Title":"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural","review":"Will Storr knows that \\"the truth is out there\\" (a phrase affectionately borrowed from \\"The X-Files\\") regarding the supernatural. He wants to find the truth of ghosts, demons, witches, and the devil - anything that can be deemed \\"paranormal.\\"What the reader doesn't know until after the prologue is that his search takes place in the United Kingdom and parts of Europe. This is not a problem in search of ghosts, in fact that is probably one of the best places to search and do research. However, when the TV series \\"Most Haunted\\" came up in the book, I almost spit out my mouthful of pop (soda for the rest of you). \\"Most Haunted\\" has to be one of the WORST ghost hunting shows I have seen in my 30 year history of watching paranormal shows. This show is seen in the United States on the Travel Channel. It is also the subject of many web pages for debunking the investigations found on the show. Storr was able to attend the live broadcast of \\"Most Haunted\\". Watching this show alone would make me, the researcher, not believe in the paranormal at all. It has an overly dramatic Psychic Medium as well as a jumpy host who is so afraid of the paranormal, makes the viewer wonder why she is hosting this TV show.During his investigation:* He attends a Ghost Club meeting. This club goal is to \\"observe, record and monitor possible phenomena.\\" (Storr, page 25) They do not use scientific methods or machinery however they do use dowsing rods during their investigation to find out if there is a spirit willing to communicate with them.* A page explains what causes orbs (with an explanation from Fuji Film's webpage). Many of these ghost hunters he interviews believe that orbs are spirits and not just dust.* Storr tries to contact various pastors and priests regarding exorcisms. Some believe that he is playing with fire and will not speak to him. Others are more than willing to talk to him and give many names of other priests who were involved in exorcisms.This is the part that troubles me in the book. I was always taught through my years of being raised Catholic and 12 years of Catholic school that exorcisms were like the \\"redheaded stepchild\\" of a family. It has been said that it is hard to get the church to accept something is possessed (whether it would be a house or a person) and to have a priest come to perform an exorcism. Also, the priest must be experienced and qualified to perform an exorcism since they are dangerous. Yet Storr was able to find so many priests and other \\"lay people\\" who could state \\"Yes I've performed an exorcism.\\" Or \\"Yes we may do one tonight if necessary.\\" I wonder if in Europe it is more common to find a priest who is experienced in the Rites of Exorcism than in the United States.* The people who did have a traumatic paranormal experience were not as willing to talk to Storr. Some wanted to put the past behind them and not think back to when the events took place. Those were the stories I was most interested in because the people seemed sincere in their experiences.* Storr's visit to the psychiatrist was the chapter that irritated me the most. This is a side of paranormal research I've never seen someone tackle and this is a good thing. Dr Salter believes that anyone who believes in the paranormal, believes they are a witch or has the ability to talk to the dead are mentally disturbed and are experiencing illusions. I wonder what he would change his mind and studies if he spoke with Allison DuBois...* The book should not have ended with the \\"10 most haunted places in America.\\" Since 99% of his research and references were from the UK, then it should have had the 10 most haunted places in the UK or Europe. (this is for the September 2006 release of this book from Harper Collins)Some things I would have loved to hear more about during his investigations:* Did he feel he wasted his time with those who were supposed to be legitimate ghost hunters and mediums only to see that looked like they were faking their trances and contacts of spirits 99% of the time?* The Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is amazing. Most times I feel as though I cannot hear what is on the tape, but when I can hear it, it will send a chill down my spine. How many EVPs did he get to listen to from the haunted places he visited?* Did anyone catch anything on video or film besides Orbs?* Did he experience anything personally and so profound that gave him his revelation \\"YES! There is an afterlife!\\"In the end I believe that Will Storr is a believer in the supernatural and always was. He did research for this book to find all types of people in the field of paranormal research. Storr interviewed so many different types of people that, at some points in the book, the reader starts to become a skeptic and wonders \\"Is everyone a fake as this in the ghost field or as supernaturally flamboyant as this one?\\"This book did not change my mind if there is an afterlife or not. It did make me think about the people he met. There are some interesting characters he encountered during his research and how it takes many to make up the field of the paranormal, no matter what part of the world the ghosts and demons are located in.--cdk"},{"Title":"Unholy War: America, Israel and Radical Islam","review":"Having read several of the books by Dr. Price, I looked forward to a well written book with ample research behind it. I was not disappointed. Dr. Price goes into depth just why America is involved deeply in this struggle. Considerable attention is then given to the key concepts behind the Jewish versus Islamic confrontation. The information given is current, and relevant to the religious yet radical confrontation we witness daily.While written from a Judeo-Christian point of view, the intended audience is clearly non-religious in nature.Highly recommend that you not only read this book, but that you keep it as a reference work."},{"Title":"Unholy War: America, Israel and Radical Islam","review":"Price uses Palestinian, as well as Christian and Jewish sources, to back his view of the conflict in the Middle East. I thought he did a good job of representing both sides. He is more slanted towards the Christian view, but I would expect that from a Christian. Yet he used Palestinian and Islamic sources to support what he has to say about their viewpoint and beliefs. He helped me to understand much more of what is going on in the Middle East, and even here with the Sept. 11th destruction of the WTC. I recommend this book whether you know a lot or nothing at all about the conflict. It brings it together in an interesting and clarifying way. He asks questions, such as \\"Why can't they just get along?\\" and then he answers the questions using quotes and thoughts from various sources. With all that is going on in the world today, I agree with him that we need to familiarize ourselves with the situation in the Middle East and I think that this book is a good place to start."},{"Title":"Unholy War: America, Israel and Radical Islam","review":"Seldom has a book been more relevant and more timely.With the ongoing \`war against terrorism', the current climate in the political and international arenas, and the unrest in the Middle East, the author delves into the myths surrounding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and sifts through the Islamic propaganda and media bias against the Jewish state.With his exceptional expertise, the learned author approaches the whole scenario from a Biblical basis and analyses the entire issue, past, present and future, with alarming insight. We all owe it to ourselves to read this book and to be completely aware as to what is happening around us at this crucial time in history. The contents of this book will open our eyes and enlighten us to the wholesale deception that is presently surrounding us. We need to know the truth about Islamic fundamentalism, it's real agenda, the Middle East crisis and the facts concerning the Israeli-Palestinian issue and how it affects the rest of the world, ourselves included.This book is full of such facts from cover to cover and is very easy to read.I also seriously recommend two other books by the same author entitled, \`Jerusalem In Prophecy' and \`The Coming Last Days Temple'."},{"Title":"Unholy War: America, Israel and Radical Islam","review":"This is an outstanding book. Extremely well written, it conveys depths of information quickly, and is a very fast read. Most striking of all, however, is that the angle taken is often directly contrary to the slant that large parts of the American news media give. Due to this fact, this is one of those items that really belongs in the hands of students who are researching Mideast issues. A perspective very different from traditional news sources is given. A very valuable book when place alongside materials of a different perspective.

A very good way to get &quot;behind the headlines.&quot;"},{"Title":"Unholy War: America, Israel and Radical Islam","review":"This book by Randall Price along with another book by him called The Temple and Bible Prophecy are two of the most important books that deal with Israel and the fulfillment of the Jewish fate in Bible prophecy. Two other books that you might like are by Keith Intrater entitled Israel, The Church, and the Last Days along with From Irag to Armageddon. Why are these books so important? Simply this, we as Christians, even those of us who trust in Bible prophecy, have placed aside many a times the importance of Abraham and his descendants when it deals with Yahweh's plan for the world. It is vital that we understand Israel and the Jews because without understanding these topics, we fail in our call to follow in the footsteps of our Lord and Savior Yeshua/Jesus Christ.Just as in days of old, throughout the Old Testament time period and now in the New Testament era, the last days, beginning with the resurrection and culminating in the seven years of tribulation along with the Millennial Kingdom and then the New Heavens and the New Earth, Israel and her people have been a vital foci for prophecy and fate of the world. And just as those who are giving this a one star because it shows the truth as to what is going on in Israel and Israel's threat from all sides by radical Islam, there are many people out there who are anti-Semitic and want to see the Jewish people wiped off the face of the earth. We as Christians SHOULD be praying and loving and caring for the Jewish people. Remember! Yahweh curses those who curse Abraham and his descendants just as much as Yahweh will bless those who bless Abraham and his descendants.This book in particular, I will admit, is somewhat dated, as a lot has gone on since its publishing in 2001/2. The Israel nation faces even graver threats now than she did around 9-11. This book helps you the reader to realize just how horrific the world is growing toward the Jews. Radical Islam does not just want to gain power over Israel, and in particular Jerusalem. No. What they want is simply this. To wipe the Jewish people off the face of the earth. Radical Islam does not want peace. Radical Islam will not settle for anything less than total destruction of the Jewish people. This is not an opinion, this is reality. Not that the Jewish people are perfect, no, no one is, and yes the Jewish authorities have done some damage and there have been kills that should not have been. But. But. The Israelites are fighting for their very existence, not just for simple territory. The Israelites are fighting for their very dignity, not just some ideology.I firmly believe this book will open your eyes if you haven't already (like the one stars show) decided to be anti-Semitic. We as Gentile Christians who have been saved by the blood of Yeshua, Jesus, have a specific Biblical call to love and to feed and to clothe and to care for Yahweh's covenant people that we have (through Yeshua) been grafted unto. Read this book, learn the truth."},{"Title":"Unholy War: America, Israel and Radical Islam","review":"This book definitely transcends the propaganda that completely permeates the Islamic world in the Middle East. Randall Price delves into the true attitudes of Palestinians and exposes the real intentions behind them that is missed in the media. Price uses a wealth of evidence and quotes to back up his statements. It also focuses on the control of the Temple Mount and how Jews want back from the Muslims what is rightfully their's. Unholy War may cause bitterness, but sometimes the truth hurts. A must read!"},{"Title":"Unholy War: America, Israel and Radical Islam","review":"If you aren't quite sure of the whys and wherefores of the complex relationship between Americans, Israelis, and the radical sect of Islam, this is an excellent book for you. Randall Price's knowledge of the history and relationship between these three is astonishing. The book is very in-depth and chock full of details and gives the reader insightful explanations for much of what we are seeing in the news today.

These questions are answered in just the first half of the book! One of the more eye-opening features running throughout are quotes attributed to different world leaders that show exactly how they feel about Israel and how some of them have redefined \\"Palestine\\" to suit their own agendas.Easy writing style, compact size, very reasonably priced. Just a wee bit on the negative side: a bit repetitious and I would've liked to have seen a section explaining all the places Arafat has been thrown out of to show the hypocrisy of those nations who are now trying to force Israel to negotiate with someone they couldn't stand to have in their own backyards because he was too hard to handle. Even though Israel has lately taken the stance that Arafat is irrelevant, the rest of the world does not see him that way and to get an overall picture of what is going on over there a little background info on the man would be helpful. -- Moza"},{"Title":"Unholy War: America, Israel and Radical Islam","review":"Randall Price is the author of many other books, such asThe Stones Cry Out: What Archaeology Reveals About the Truth of the Bible,The Coming Last Day's Temple,Fast Facts on the Middle East Conflict,Jerusalem in Prophecy, etc. He notes in the \\"Acknowledgements\\" section of this 2001 book that it was \\"initiallly completed before the September 11 attack on America and then rushed into rewrite!\\"He distinguishes between \\"Christian\\" acts of terror (\\"committed... in disobedience to the word of Christ\\") and those of Muslims, who commit acts of terror \\"in obedience to the word of Muhammad.\\" (Pg. 21) An unabashed \\"Christian Zionist,\\" he argues that \\"It is not the Israelis who cooperate with terrorist organizations... who joined with Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War... who train young men by the hundreds to become suicide bombers... who danced with joy in their streets at news of the attack on America.\\" (Pg. 53)He admits that at the time of the 1948-1949 formation of the State of Israel, \\"Palestinian Arabs were literally scared away from their home by rumors of bloody massacres... this preinvasion violence led many Arabs to letigimately flee out of fear for their lives.\\" (Pg. 165)He asserts that \\"Anybody who does not believe that the Jewish Temple stood on the Temple Mount does not believe in history!\\" (Pg. 261) He also argues that \\"there is no historical basis for the Muslim claim that Jerusalem and the Temple Mount are Islamic holy places.\\" (Pg. 271) He adds that \\"Judaism views Jewish sovereignty over Jerusalem as essential for the fulfillment of its ultimate destiny toward God...\\" (Pg. 306)Price's books are always provocative and challenging reading, whether or not one accepts all of his conclusions from his arguments and evidences."},{"Title":"Unholy War: America, Israel and Radical Islam","review":"Dr. Randall Price's 'Unholy War' focuses on America, Israel and Radical Islam.

He is author of 'Secret of the Dead Sea Scrolls', 'The Coming Last Days Temple', 'Jerusalem in Prophecy' and 'The Stones Cry Out.'

In reality there is a lot of fiction here.1. Page 36 presents the fabricated tale that one of the pilots of WTS on 9/11 had previously bombed a Jerusalem bus. Check out any &quot;Urban Legends&quot; site to see that this rumor is false (or see the 7 Nov. 2001 Jerusalem Post). It's bad enough that a rumor has been included, but the author then uses the rumor to trash the Oslo Peace process.2. Page 99 declares that the Al Aqsa Mosque was built over the Basilica of Mary &quot;to demonstrate [Islam's]status as military conqueror of Christianity.&quot; In fact, the Basilica of Mary was discovered in the 1970s by Israeli archaeologist Avigad--known as Nea Church. Its location is far away from al-Aqsa mosque in southern Jerusalem. There is no truth to Price's assertion.3. Page 54 includes the claim that in 1947, &quot;the Arabs owned a mere three percent of the land [of Palestine]&quot;. UN documents show that Jews owned a mere three percent of the land. Price says that Arabs were given 82 % of the land in the partition while in truth it was 47 %. These figures are readily available in numerous sources.4. On page 69-70 he says that the U.S. cast &quot;the deciding vote&quot; in 1947 for U.N. partition. The vote was 33 yes, 13 no, 10 abstentions. The U.S. could have voted against partition and it still would have passed.The book is filled with errors like this which are then manipulated to create a fictional account of reality.Frequently, he makes use of outdated research ignoring recent research by Israelis Benny Morris, Ilan Pappe, and Norman Finkelstein--unexcusable in a 2001 book.However, his bigotry against Islam and Arabs is most disappointing. His approach is made most clear on page 21, when he contrasts the best of Christianity with the worst of Islam. He believes Christian terrorists are disobedient to the tenets of their religion while Muslim terrorists are obedient. His choice of language-- describing Christian acts of violent in a past tense in contrast to Muslim acts in the present tense and using quotation marks for &quot;Christians&quot; who committed acts of terror--shows his clever manipulation of the reader.On page 50, after referring to a Hamas appeal for support in their struggle, he adds, &quot;an ominous thought considering there are 30,000 Palestinians living in New Jersey alone!&quot; Were anyone to use this language for any other ethnic group, they would be branded a racist.There are plenty of good books on the Middle East from several points of view. This is not one of them."},{"Title":"Unholy War: America, Israel and Radical Islam","review":"When I started reading the book, I was put-off by anti-Islam statements without basis. 'Oh no, not another Islam-basher', I thought. Somehow, I persisted, and I am glad I did. The rest of the book lays a good background to why the author thinks that the Islam religion itself is a violent one. The idea is something everyone in the contemporary world is trying to find an answer too. I don't think anobody has the answer, yet.Meanwhile, as part of the debate, Price presents a very good argument. His tone is not shrill but fairly calm and mature. The historical background is fairly well researched. I was reading Amos Elon's A' Blood-Dimmed Tide' along with this book and found some factual discrepancies indicating bias on part of Price. So, apparently the author is biased, but that is what one expects in a debate of this kind. I looked at it as one side of the story. This book is probably not a must-read if you want to read about the region, but it is interesting nevertheless.And yes, if you haven't read 'A Blood-Dimmed Tide' - read that too."},{"Title":"Unholy War: America, Israel and Radical Islam","review":"Just a preface to the dissenting opinions towards this book,there seems to be an ominous ulterior motive behind the negativity towards the book and its author. Just give a quick glance at reviewer &quot;Tara Marshall&quot; and her More about Me section and it will become clear as crystal her bias against this book.I think it is interesting that a majority of the sources to Dr. Price's credit that are quoted from and accessed are of Arabic background. Dr. Price attempts to offer counter-offenses to the pro-Palestinian side throughout the book. But he wisely shows us, polarized from what the media does, that the true aimof the Palestinians and their supporters is not statehood. The book gives balance in the admittance that the Israeli response toPalestinian acts of terror is sometimes an overreation. I can agree! But one thing is clear. Overreacting to the protection of one's citizens is not commensurate to someone murdering innocentsthrough the macabre act of blowing up body parts of babies via a bomb strapped around your waist. Whenever the United States sees Jews flying planes into skyscrapers, Jews blowing up Olympic contestants, Jews paying 25,000 dollars to the families of &quot;homicide&quot; bombers, maybe then they will have more compassion for the Palestinian cause. Until that day comes I think THE TRUE ASPIRATIONS AND ACTIONS OF ISLAM SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.I also didnt see any defense by the dissentors against Dr. Price's accusations about specific passages within the Koran itself. Interestingly, can anyone defend a religion that specifically says to kill someone who does not convert or submit to the desires of the cause of one's religion?

Thus you have people in India (Asia) convinced that Native Americans died because they would not make room for the beneficent whites... and thus you have people convinced that the &quot;battle of civilizations&quot; between Islam and &quot;the West&quot; is inevitable, and due almost entirely to the ignorance of the backward Muslim majority.Nothing could be further from the truth. There are large, educated urban populations in many Arab and Muslim countries (and Dr. Price does not differentiate well between the two). Many of these people were educated in Europe or the United States, or had professors from the &quot;Western&quot; nations.This is a &quot;history&quot; designed for the interests of the right-wing Republicans in control of the United States foreign policy, and has almost nothing to do with the realities of the situation.These realities include the fact that the United States has supported Israel for over 50 years and is no longer seen as an honest broker in the Israel-Palestine peace process by any of the Arab or Muslim nations, or by the citizens of most Western European nations.Another reality is the fact that the United States has a history of supporting dictators in the Middle East for purposes of access to oil and other valuable resources. This is why (somehow missed by Dr. Price) the Iranians (a NON-Arab population of Muslims) rebelled against the tyrannical Shah of Iran. The United States backed a coup (financed, trained, and armed) against the DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED Mosadegh government and replaced it with a monarch, trained his secret police (the Savak) who repressed the population and &quot;disappeared&quot; thousands. Since the Shia clerics of Qom had a history of fighting tyrannical shahs in the past, it was hardly a surprise to anyone knowledgeable of Persian history when the population once again turned to its clerics in leadership against a cruel dictator.Similar events are taking place in Saudi Arabia, whose police, armed and trained by the United States or by &quot;independent military contractors&quot; paid for by the United States, suppress Shias, Sufis, and the various democratic movements. Since the Saudi monarchy officially follows the Wahhabi doctrine of Islam and has outlawed most non-Wahhabi political groups, it can hardly be a surprise that Wahhabi movements such as that which spawned Osama bin Laden are the only surviving political movements. Thus leading to a situation where the United States has no choice but to continue assisting the unpopular Sa'ud dynasty or be forced to deal with a truly Wahhabi fundamentalist government.This book should only be found on the shelves of fundamentalist Christians and people who read the Weekly Standard."},{"Title":"Unholy War: America, Israel and Radical Islam","review":"Randall Price is an excellent prophecy teacher but I did not find this book to be his best.

This author fails to present both sides of the story, and goes on in the typical propoganda in supporting the tyrannical policies of Israel, many of which seem to appeal to fanatics. The book tries to avoid any mention of the wrongs and oppressions Israel commits, like expanding in illegal settlements, using violence to kill innocent civilians, and so on. This conflict has been created from the 35 years of oppression and occupation Israel has continued to make, and America seems to give its military and monitary support.

He lives on that ranch with his forceful but deteriorating grandpa, an African-American servant Halmea (whom he has the hots for), a couple of kindly ranch hands, and Hud, his grandfather's hedonistic and downright mean stepson. The novel recounts the tale of one summer, in which Lonnie's safe world seems to deteriorate around him, tossing him out into that world he so longs to visit.The novel, to me, is one of those hard-to-judge books because I do respect the author and what he accomplished here. This is a grim, anti-western, even anti-coming-of-age story, and McMurtry certainly pulled off his stark, unsentimental, and desperate vision. But that said, I didn't particularly enjoy reading it, as it provided nobody really to root for (except, perhaps, side characters--Lonnie's passivity bothered me too much) and nothing to root for anyway."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"This is a great story with a great character about a man who simply has no morals. Very poignant because instead of heroic acts it shows what most men would do when faced with decisions where they can either help others at a cost to themselves or help themselves at a cost to others. Sadly, the book does not expand upon the movie \\"Hud\\" with Paul Newman. In fact, based on the short length of the book the movie probably expanded on the book. I would argue that this was Paul Newman's greatest role because he delivers on this flawed character flawlessly."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"I read this book many years ago after seeing the movie version, Hud, with Paul Newman. As others have noted there are some major differences between the book and film. McMurtry's early books, like this one, are so beautiful and evocative of a time and place. When I try to read the more recent books they seem flat and contrived. It is almost like reading two different writers. The sad thing is that he seems to be getting worse rather than better. Horseman Pass By, Leaving Cheyenne, and The Last Picture Show are his best work. They are all beautifully done and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"This was a lazy effort by McMurtry. No real beginning and definitely less than a sterling effort to end it."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"This book starts off good.

Such a sad story. I have read other novels by this author and have enjoyed his books but not this one. Kind of boring, I kept expecting it to get better but it did not."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"As my title indicates, if this book were realistic, the kid would have shot the s.o.b. Hud when he caught him in a rape. The book would have ended there. It follows that although the rape was pure Hud, the kid, whom McMurtry didn't really intend to be a chicken, stepped out of character. A fatal defect. This book takes a lot of suspension of belief. It beats hell out of Lonesome Dove in which two Texas rangers, retired after twenty years service in the Rangers (as of the year they were officially formed) are cavoting along the Rio Grande at the little burg of Lonesome Dove, and there is not a tree to be found for twenty miles. Where was that along the Rio Grande? Today, of course, there are places where there's no water to be found for twenty miles. Is Larry kidding? I think so in every book he's written. An avid fan I ain't."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"This is a complete rewrite of an earlier review. My essays tend to be sloppy, but this one was so bad, I was obliged to completely redo it. My apologies to anyone who wasted their time trying to read the earlier version.It's impossible to discuss this novel without also discussing \\"Hud\\", which has become a classic film in its own right. Most readers will have seen the film before having read the novel, which is not a bad thing, as it gives a better appreciation of the novel's strengths (as is true of \\"No Country for Old Men\\").The /fundamental/ difference between the novel and the film is that the novel is about the post-War changes in Texas cattle ranching, whereas the film is about the people experiencing those changes. This difference extends to making the film characters not merely advocates of (or opponents to) those changes (as they are in the novel), but the (figurative) changes themselves.The development of the Texas oil industry encouraged ranchers to lease their land to oil companies, rather than raising cattle. In the novel (and film), Homer Bannon declares that he will never lease his land, because he wants to work at something he has direct contact with, rather than sit around collecting royalties. Larry McMurtry, the son and grandson of cattlemen, obviously agrees with Homer. But...McMurtry is a better novelist than to think that characters who are all-good or all-bad are interesting. The novel's characters -- unlike the film's -- are not easily categorized. This is especially true of Hud (birth name: Scott). There's justification for his strained relationship with Homer (who, in the book, is his step-father). Homer not only failed to keep Hud out of the draft when he easily could have, but wouldn't let him go to college. (The Bannons aren't filthy-rich, but both the novel and film make it clear they're hardly scraping along.)Hud also has justification for feeling that his father used him as cheap labor. (Both the film and novel have him remark about \\"working from the neck down\\".) When Hud gripes \\"You assumed that what you wanted for me was what I wanted for myself\\", we are partly on his side. The Hud of the novel isn't ignorant about ranching, and was correct in trying to keep Homer from buying the cheap Mexican cattle that spread hoof-and-mouth -- a point the film conveniently omits. Even Hud's attempt to have Homer committed for \\"incapacity\\" is partly understandable, as Homer is likely to make additional mistakes that will further reduce the ranch's value.The novel's Hud, rotten as he is, is not so much evil as he is the representative of a new era, in which people ranch simply to make money (or abandon it altogether for oil). When, in the film, Homer accuses Hud of having no concern for anyone but himself, the screenwriters are conflating Hud's character with McMurtry's feelings about the way the West changed after WWII.Nor is Homer Bannon the blameless good guy. He's a man stuck in his ways, approaching senility and incapable of handing off control to others. Lonnie tells us that, contrary to the minister's eulogy, his grandfather was not particularly well-liked or widely respected. The film conveniently deletes Homer's remark that, although he loves raising cattle, he also loves having money, and lots of it. This supports Hud's view that Homer is cheap -- and not only because he wouldn't pay $50 for tinted glass for the car.Despite the film's \\"adultness\\" for its era (it's amazing the script got a Production Code seal), it insults the audience's intelligence by portraying its characters in such a \\"one-note\\" fashion. This is true even of Lonnie, who initially admires Hud, then turns against him. In the novel, Lonnie (who narrates the story) has no need to read \\"Low-Lifes for Dummies\\" to understand that there's no good reason to admire Hud. Lonnie admits he's afraid of Hud, who, as Homer says, \\"has no rope on him\\".The film largely reduces the characters to dramatic stereotypes. The problems besetting the Bannons are not Homer's fault, nor are they the result of social and economic changes (with Homer and Hud on opposing sides). Rather, they are /wholly/ due to the bad behavior of Hud, who is A Really Awful Person. We learn that Hud was indirectly responsible for the death of Lonnie's father (which is not in the novel), and Melvyn Douglas is given a watered-down-Chayefsky rant in which he condemns Hud as A Rotten Human Being. We are not far-removed from \\"The Bad Seed\\".The novel's most-brutal moment -- Hud's murdering Homer with Lonnie's .22, \\"to put him out of his misery\\" and assure ownership of the ranch -- should not be viewed as a \\"legitimate\\" element of the story, but rather the first-novel prototype of McMurtry's over-the-top characterizations and repeated cruelty/brutality/sadism. Homer is in such bad shape he would have died anyway, and McMurtry could just as easily bumped him off that way. Instead, we're treated to a revolting and gratuitous murder. (It's amazing a decrepit Blue Duck didn't show up out of nowhere to gut Homer. How old would he have been in 1954?)There are compensations. Perhaps the best part of the novel is the prologue, in which Lonnie describes what the end of day is like on a ranch. The description of Thalia's rodeo, from its bright beginning to dispirited end, is almost as good.\\"Horseman, Pass By\\" anticipates \\"The Last Picture Show\\" (and beyond). Some of the action takes place in McMurtry's fictional Thalia; the black man who runs the pool hall is Lem the Lion; one of its regulars is Dumb Billy; there's talk about sex with heifers; and Lonnie watches a Gene Autry movie, \\"Streets of Laredo\\". (McMurtry apparently didn't like Autry, and has Lonnie observe \\"in the picture he was his chubby fat self\\".) I'm inclined to think McMurtry gave \\"Horseman\\" a second look, decided \\"I can do better\\", and \\"The Last Picture Show\\" was the result.McMurtry is a well-known gynecophile, and \\"Horseman, Pass By\\" includes the first of his near-perfect females, Halmea the black housekeeper. Why she became the film's white Alma (Patricia Neal) will probably never be known. It was likely due to nothing more than difficulty in casting the role. Other possibilities come to mind, such as her being (mis?)-interpreted as the idealized nurturing (or seductive) black mammy, but I leave it to readers and viewers to draw their own conclusions.\\"Horseman, Pass By\\" is a short read, and worthwhile, if only to view 1954 Texas from Lonnie's (McMurtry's) perspective. You'll also get to see what was \\"lost in translation\\". If you're even the least interested, I don't think you'll be disappointed.----------\\"Hud\\" can't even be /mentioned/ without reference to MAD's classic parody (12/1963). The first page announces that \\"adult\\" Westerns have a new kind of not-100%-good \\"hero\\", and \\"Hood\\" is the first \\"sick\\" Western of this sort. The second and third pages riff on every rotten thing Hood does, the funniest of which is his gleeful Schadenfreude in burying the diseased cattle alive. This oddly anticipates the sadism that (in my view) has infected too many of McMurtry's novels."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"This is a book that should be required reading in every high school in America. It is an unflinching portrayal of the American reality: a mix of strong moral principles vs. greed. When McMurtry nails a book, great things occur. This is also a novel that foreigners with a good level in English, must read if they want to understand what is America and who are the Americans."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"Horseman, Pass By is quite a departure for McMurty, being very different from his &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; works. It has more in common with &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; than it does any of his other works. It was the basis for the Paul Newman movie, &quot;Hud&quot;, but that movie failed miserably in capturing the essense of this novel. (The best part about the movie is the performance of Brandon de Wilde as Lonny). I've re-read this several times, and it always touches me with each reading. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"An outstanding read that accurately describes the way of life for many rural Texans of the mid 50's and 60's. Horseman Pass Me By far surpasses the Hollywood depiction of this great novel in their version \\"Hud\\"."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"As I continue my goal to read every McMurtry book, I realized it was time to read his first one, Horseman, Pass By. In most ways, the McMurtry style of describing people through the events and reactions of situations remains true, but in other ways, this book is atypical of his later books. Told in first person by a young man, Lonnie Bannon, whose admiration for his grandfather shines forth throughout the book, Horseman, Pass By is a gripping story set in the 1950s Western culture of a small town and a nearby ranch.The fictional town of Thalia, located near Wichita Falls bears some resemblance to many of the small towns in the region, including McMurtry's hometown, Archer City. Replete with rodeos, cafes, cowboys, oil workers, cattle, and small town gossip, Thalia becomes the location for many of McMurtry's later books. In this pointed, and somewhat frightening novel, a successful cattleman deals with aging, sick cows, and a violent family member whose anger leads to many of the events of the story.Lonnie is a hard-working, but fun-loving young man with a heavy sense of responsibility, love of his family, and concern for other people. It is Lon's character and integrity that seems to represent the strength of the Western heritage, a heritage that needs to remain. His commitment to helping his grandfather and the ranch puts him at odds with the impetuous and pain-inflicting Hud, a man with no scruples and no morality.The story moves well and demonstrates human confusion, fear, love, and the hopelessness of certain situations. While justice is implied at the end, the reader gets the sense that it may not happen. The accurate descriptions of the cows, the people, the rodeo, and the town place this book several notches above typical modern fiction. Highly recommended for all McMurtry fans and those interested in the modern Western."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"I will concede that I have been on something of tear concerning the works of Larry McMurtry lately. That is just the way I operate when I find that rare novelist that \\"speaks\\" to me. Gore Vidal, the great American historical novelist, is another whose works you will be seeing reviewed more in this space. That said, the particular purpose here is to compare McMurtry's Horseman, Pass By with Hud, the cinematic version of this novel, that starred the recently deceased Paul Newman, a very talented actor from my youth as a misbegotten, angry modern cowboy (although a cinematic heart throb in those days) I, frankly, like to make such comparisons to see how close the film comes to the novel.Some films, as I recall from an article that Joan Didion wrote in The New York Review of Books concerning one of her books, move very far away from the author's intent. That happened in her case and she had to abandon the screenwriting of the film version of one of her books in the interest of her own artistic integrity. Some cinematic presentations, even more egregiously, pay bare homage to their source. That occurred in Ernest Hemingway's To Have and To Have Not. Here the situation is something of a happy mix between the need to highlight the 1960's blue-eyed heart throb Newman's role as the errand, self-centered cowboy \\"angel\\" Hud and the coming of age story of his teenage nephew Lonnie Bannon that McMurtry is trying to portray here.Naturally, as McMurtry's intent is to show not only the ruthless way that the modern cowboy, Hud, has to deal with the world in order to survive but the vagaries of his nephew Lonnie's coming of age in rural West Texas in the 1950's (in the mythical town of Thalia, the scene of more than one of his efforts) the screenwriting must reflect director Martin Ritt's concerns to keep the story moving. Thus the book, unlike the movie, concentrates not on the action of the various events at the ranch (the problem with the cattle that have to be destroyed) and small town life (the booze, dances and Last Picture Show movie house) that drive the film but the sheer struggle against loneliness and meaningless that every teenager goes through but more so here out on the range. Those feelings, described by McMurtry so well here (and in The Last Picture Show) do not translate well onto the screen.There are a number of other characters and events in the book that do not make it to the screen. The family relationship between Grandpa Homer Bannon and Hud is different (although the generational tensions are still present). Grandma Bannon is still alive (as Homer's second wife and Hud's mother) and the housekeeper is black not white like in the film. Needless to say Newman's sexual assault of the housekeeper (played by Patricia Neal) in the early 1960's era film subject to more taboos than today is much less graphic than in the book. But a good suggestion here is to watch the film for the performances of Newman, Neal and Melvyn Douglas (as Grandpa Homer) AND read this novel. This is McMurtry's first effort at being the \\"king\\" of Texas story tellers (New West version and Old West version as well). The pair of efforts compliment each other. That is a rare feat."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"A modern day son in conflict with a father who clings to the &quot;old ways&quot; of the West in this gripping story of life set a small Texas town and a nearby ranch during the last days of the Old West still held only in a father's memories,now sets the mood and tone of the book.

A great read!Evelyn Horan - teacher/counselor/authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Books One - Three"},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"This book was my introduction to Larry McMurtry, and I intend to read many more of his books based on this classic. The book was made into the movie &quot;Hud,&quot; starring Paul Newman and Patricia Neal. The movie was brilliant, but different from the book in several notable ways. The stars of this book are teenager Lonnie and the evocative Texas setting. However, it is not simply another sensitive coming of age story. Instead it explores such varied topics as race relations and the death of the Old West. Look for the town and some of the same characters in McMurtry's &quot;The Last Picture Show,&quot; another beautiful novel."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"Before Lonesome Dove and the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, before about 30 other novels, before Brokeback Mountain and more than 40 other screenplays, Larry McMurtry wrote Horseman, Pass By , his first novel. And it is one of his best. Along with The Last Picture Show, it is also one of his most honest, being based on first-hand knowledge of a Texas that was.The time is 1954; the place is a ranch outside the fictional town of Thalia, near Wichita Falls (a stand-in for Archer City, McMurtry's home town); the narrator is Lonnie, a 17-year-old trying to find the man he will turn out to be. Three people loom large in his life: Homer Brannon, his 80-year-old grandfather, an old-time, hard-working rancher dedicated to his land and his cattle; Halmea, the black cook, both a mother-figure for him and an object of his teenage lust; and Hud, the grandfather's stepson, a first-class SOB (no other way to say it) dedicated to money and chasing women.Many very bad things happen in this novel, beginning with the dreaded threat of hoof-and-mouth disease, which could mean that all the carefully-bred cattle will have to be slaughtered, essentially bringing an end to the grandfather's way of life. And that's not the worst.What saves this book from being just an incredibly sad tale of the demise of the Old West is the lack of romanticism in character portrayal, the authenticity of the dialogue for the time and place, and the lyrical poetry of the language in describing the landscape. It all feels so real that one can only assume that, while the story details are probably fictitious, the yearnings of the young Lonnie must have been those of the young McMurtry.Just a note about the movie Hud, which was made from this book--it starred Paul Newman as Hud Bannon, and he was so magnetic, so sexy (for those older readers who remember him), that the focus of the movie necessarily shifted to his story, his motivations. Don't expect that from this book. Also, in the movie the character Halmea was switched to a white character, Alma. They didn't want to tackle the race-relation angle in the 1960s, I suppose.Highly recommended, particularly for Texans."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"Enjoyed this one a lot!He is an entertaining author ; our whole family enjoys his work a lot. Hope there is more to come."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"In 1961 Larry McMurtry's debut, HORSEMAN, PASS BY, would revitalize the image of the cowboy in literature. With the release of the movie HUD (starring Paul Newman, Melvyn Douglas and Patricia Neal) two years later, it would be the first of many McMurtry stories to be adapted to film.HUD was a big success: Melvyn Douglas and Patricia Neal both won Oscars, while Paul Newman's performance in the title role is considered to be one of his finest. Over the years the novel has unfortunately become somewhat obscure, being searched for mostly by those who are fans of the film. But, as is usually the case, book and movie differ significantly in a variety of ways.Exemplified in the antagonism between the stoic and hardworking Homer Bannon and the arrogant and amoral Scott \\"Hud\\" Bannon, HORSEMAN, PASS BY and HUD both present a stark and unsentimental account of the Old West losing ground to the modern world. Nevertheless, McMurtry's novel is less willing to compromise with its message that there are those of us who are simply bad people.While the movie naturally focuses on its namesake-character, utilizing a handsome and charming Paul Newman to portray him as a deeply flawed but ultimately misunderstood antihero, McMurty's book reads from the perspective of Homer's 17 years old grandson, Lonnie, who witnesses the demise of his grandfather's life and everything the old man spent 80 years of hard work and patience to build. Despite a teenaged boy's likely envy for the older man's independence and easy way with women, Lonnie is mature enough to see little good in Hud. He shows Hud for the swaggering, self-serving, mean-spirited bully that he is. Lonnie knows Hud despises Homer, and realizing that their isn't much he can do about it. So, while Hud spends his time beating up on smaller and weaker men or bedding down married women, Lonnie works hard with his grandfather and a ranch hand named Jesse, admiring and learning from their life experiences. Except for these men, Lonnie's only regular company was the Bannons' young black housekeeper, Halmea.One important aspect of this book was the situation for blacks--and especially young black women--in 1950s Texas. HUD conveniently sidestepped this issue by turning the black woman Halmea into the hillbilly Alma who was played by Patricia Neal. HORSEMAN'S Halmea is as upfront and outspoken as HUD's Alma. But there the similarities mostly end. Where Alma is middle-aged, hard bitten and tired of men's ways, Halmea is younger, vivacious and attractive. She and Lonnie are relatively close, having whatever friendship the Texas of that time would allow to a white teenager and his family's black housekeeper. While it's obvious that Lonnie is sexually attracted to Halmea, his youth and inexperience as much as her candor with such matters keeps him in check. Unfortunately--and tragically, the same can't be said for Hud. The movie might brim with sexual tension between Hud and Alma, but McMurtry's Halmea despises the man. Hud's evil and debased character is confirmed on the night he beats both Jesse and Lonnie into the ground and rapes Halmea. Afterwards, as he is zipping up, unable to resist any opportunity to further humiliate, he tells to expect this kind of treatment from now on. Halmea knows what's her only option and quits to leaves town the next day. As she explains to the cut and bruised Lonnie...What can she do? She can't stay, because Hud will only do it again. And she can't go to the police, because they will most likely arrest her saying a white man raped her.No way was this storyline going to be made into a western-oriented motion picture in 1963 America.Unlikely though it may be, I still would like to see HORSEMAN, PASS BY brought to the big screen once again, this time remaining true to McMurtry's original story. It is a marvelous book, deserving recognition that's equal with McMurtry's later work."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"McMurtry's first published novel is maybe his best ever. If you think that Lonesome Dove is classic McMurtry, then you need to read this book. Horseman, Pass By introduced settings, characters, and themes that McMurtry has spent over thirty years defining. The prose is Faulkner dried out on the Texas prarie. The characterization is simple and full. The plot is classic and original. After this book, the reader should see the movie (Hud) and then read about the making of the movie in McMurtry's In a Narrow Grave."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"McMurtry's first novel is a spare, eloquent evocation of thepassing of the Old West. In its description of the decline and deathof an old rancher, it paints a vivid picture of life on a Texas cattle ranch in the '50s; in his narrator, the teenage grandson of the old rancher, McMurtry captures a voice that gains wisdom with each turn of the page.The novel inspired the Hollywood film &quot;Hud,&quot; but McMurtry's work is much the more resonant and disturbing. Woven into the fabric of the novel is the theme of racism, which the movie skirted. Also missing from the film is the sense of melancholy that pervades the book. In the old rancher, Homer Bannon, and in Jesse, the cowboy with wanderlust, McMurtry paints portraits of good, hardworking men who know that their time has passed, to be usurped by the violent Hud, a new kind of Western businessman whose main goal is to make a buck in any way possible.Lonnie's longing to see the world that lies outside the boundary of his grandfather's ranch creates another strain of sadness in the book. McMurtry's descriptions of the wide, open prairies and the ache that these vistas create in the young man are superbly drawn and leanly poetic.McMurtry's economy of language is accompanied by dozens of sharp-eyed observations of rural and small-town life. And in the black maid Halmea, he creates a genuinely sympathetic character who also helps to expose the conflicts within the narrator. While Lonnie likes Halmea immensely, he can not help but see her also as a sexual object. While at times his late adolescent longings are amusing, the conflict comes into sharp relief when Halmea is sexually attacked by Hud, an act observed by Lonnie. In Hud's brutal sexual gratification, Lonnie recognizes a piece of himself.This is a great American novel, one that presaged the many later successes of McMurtry, one of the great contributors to the literature of the modern West."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"Larry McMurtry does an excellent job in the presentation of cattle country in 1950's Texas. You can literally see all the dust, smell the sweat of the cowhands, and sense the rising panic of cattle about to be dispatched to their deaths. The book is narrated by 17 year old Lonnie, a sensitive young man on the verge of manhood and who has, unbeknownst to himself, reached a turning point in his life. His granddad, Homer, whom Lonnie dearly loves, is an aged cattle rancher of long standing. Homer is a hardworking, honest, fair and decent man, who through circumstances beyond his control, experiences a great loss that changes his life and livelihood forever. Homer also has to contend with Hud, who though charming to women, is one of the most evil characters ever presented in a work of literature. My main problem with the novel is that Hud's motivations for his various acts are never clearly presented. Although Hud threatens Homer from time to time to sell off his land, it appears that more than just greed is at work here. Without any warning, McMurtry allows Hud to swoop down on his perceived prey to do as much damage as he can. Hud makes no attempts to excuse or explain his actions, but just walks away practically unchallenged.On the whole, despite McMurtry's very colorful writing, I found reading this seemingly unfinished book a rather unsatisfying experience."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"This was Larry McMurtry's first novel, published in 1961, long before &quot;Lonesome Dove.&quot; It's also his first of several books set in and around the small Texas town of Thalia. The story was quickly transformed into a Paul Newman film &quot;Hud&quot; in 1963, which is the version of the story most people know. In spirit, the two stories are similar - they are both anti-westerns, in which code of the West is subverted and corrupted by failure of moral character.But McMurtry's novel tells a story with a darker vision. At the center is Lonnie, the teenager growing up on his grandfather's ranch, and it's through his eyes that we see the cold, self-serving indifference of his uncle Hud. Still a boy, unschooled in much of anything besides the dawn-to-dusk labor of ranch work, Lonnie is no moral center, following his grandfather's example. In many ways, he accepts Hud's violent behavior, his disrespect for the old man, and his ruthless use of women as a kind of norm. In the end, as he leaves the ranch, he takes the first steps toward a life that may well be no more rewarding or purposeful than that of the regretful hired hand Jesse, who gets too drunk to ride his cutting horse in the rodeo.To streamline the story, the film has scaled back or eliminated interesting key characters like Jesse, another ranch hand Lonzo, a neighbor Hank, and a friend Hermy, who is badly injured trying to ride a bull. Also, by casting a white woman in the role of the black cook Halmea (Patricia Neal's Alma), the film sidesteps a racial dimension that the novel brings to the story.So for readers who know and like the film, this is a very different telling of the story and well worth reading. As usual in McMurtry's early novels, there is a richly detailed capturing of character, speech, and setting. He knows these people inside and out, how they think, talk, and behave. He also totally deromanticizes ranch work, representing it as mercilessly hot, dusty, and exhausting. The small-town rodeo, with its drinking, womanizing cowboys, fares little better. I heartily recommend this novel for anyone interested in the rural West and ranching, along with McMurtry's more melancholy but less bleak &quot;Leaving Cheyenne.&quot;"},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"I have not seen the movie, so the differences in the story don't concern me (though from what I read about it, the fact that the racist angle was taken out is culturally significant). The title of the book was somehow familiar, but I had no clear idea who LMM is. Then I bought the book after recommendation by the Emperor, and found out that I am quite familiar with the writer, only I never memorized the name. However the aquaintance is from movies: Brokeback Mountain, Terms of Endearment, Last Picture Show. A good reference list.The book is a lesson in efficient story telling. Calling it a Western evokes images of cowboys, rodeos, fights between men about everything under the sun, but in first place about property and in second place about women. And then we think of country and weather, mostly of the dry variety, and of animals: cattle, horses, rattlers, vultures, bullfrogs.This is all there, but the idea is also misleading.We are actually in a multiple conflict zone: between generations, between individuals and the government, between races, between master and servant. This is a story from the world of work on a ranch, and the work process is central. It is not a romantic novel, but one from the world of industry.The plot centers on a man's fight against fate and age. He is not a quitter, but Foot and Mouth Disease is a rancher's version of a disastrous epidemic. And a young rival without scruples is a bad match for an octogenarian.If I may look for something mildly critical to say: the narration is not trying hard to build suspense. It is oddly aloof. The narrator is strangely absent despite his multiple involvement: he is not taking sides. He is a young man of 17 without real emotions, it seems."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"Next to &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;, &quot;Horseman, Pass by&quot; is another book by McMurtry I truly enjoyed. Engrossing and poignant, it tells of the growing pains of a teenager in a small town and his need to find his own path in life and make his own decisions. In so doing, he has to face up to his family ties, his responsibilities, his fascination with a character who is less than decent, and ultimately, himself. This quiet, honest, and sensitive coming-of-age novel is a contrast from the dramatic &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;, but proves to be just as enduring."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"McMurtry's first novel, it's a tough, nostalgic look at a cattle ranching family in the panhandle of Texas in the early 1950s. Lonnie Bannon narrates the story mainly of his grandfather, a tough old coot who owns the ranch and Hud, his wild half-brother. A disease breaks out with their cattle that forces them to slaughter the herd; the results have a devastating effect on both characters. Written before McMurtry's style took on the broad Dickensian humor of his later work, he manages to capture the place and the people very well and truthfully. A great start to a most illustrious career. [The movie HUD came from this book.]"},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"This great , first novel by Mr. McMurtry was the basis for the movie HUD. McMurtry captures the passing of the \\"Old West\\". The grandfather, Homer Bannon, is trying to hang on to a dying way of life. His stepson Hud is trying to force his will onto Homer. Lonnie, Homer's grandson, is caught in the middle. Mr. McMurtry paints the western landscape in manner that few writers can approach. If you have read Mr. McMurtry's later work, I encourage you to go back and pick up this slim gem of a book."},{"Title":"Horseman, Pass By","review":"I recently discovered this 'early' Larry McMurtry novel having read many of his later works. this rites of passage story is intriguing and disturbing. The narrator Lonnie and his family come to life in a series of illuminating episodes which are both nostalgic and contemporary. The character of Hud is unscrupulous and without any redeeming features save perhaps for his final actions which leave you wondering about his real motive. A colourful picture of Texas which is a graphic reminder of the Old West and its values, HORSEMAN PASS BY is unsettling and at the same time compulsive reading. Search it out now, you won't be disappointed. Oh, and forget the movie HUD - this is the real thing - and much better on the printed page."},{"Title":"Chasing Rubi: The Truth About Porfirio Rubirosa the Last Playboy","review":"A friend recommended this book to me.

Indeed, he shared beds with many of the same women as the rich and powerful of his day. Marty and Isabella Wall have captured this fascinating tale of Rubirosa's relationships with kings, princes, presidents, dictators, mobsters, and movie stars (including the Rat Pack), over fifty years and spanning the globe. Especially interesting is the amount of money women were willing to part with just to be with Rubirosa, including a $1 million fee allegedly paid by Doris Duke to Rubirosa's wife to divorce him, to Barbara Hutton's $66,000 a day marriage to him for 53 days.

The strength of the book is the subject matter, the life of pleasure and hedonism of Rubi.Specially, the book fails to bring Rubi to life. Like a B-grade high-schooler's report, the story is mechanical, overly relies upon big quotes from Rubi's memoirs and FBI documents, and is pedantic. The story lacks any magic; instead, it's just a rote string of descriptions of one biographical event onto the next. The story doesn't get the reader into the head or personality of Rubi; it just tells what he did from one happening to the next. The story fails to deliver any rich anecdotes of his high-life that would inject zest into the story line.The gnawing question the book only makes a meager attempt to answer is, \\"How?\\" Surely with Rubi's fascinating life, of cavorting with Hollywood's leading ladies, pursuing the world's richest eligible bachelorettes, and his associations to the mob, the rat pack, and to President Kennedy, how did the man come about to make this happen? The book provides a few pithy but poor quotes from some celebs who knew him, but they fail to capture the essence, instead only presenting simple quips. Unfortunately, the book doesn't provide its own analysis, of who Rubi was and what made him special.Rubi is a whirlwind of a story. Too bad this book doesn't bring it out."},{"Title":"A Jeweler's Eye for Flaw: Stories (Associated Writing Programs Award in Short Fiction)","review":"The sheer verbal energy and inventiveness of this collection pulled me straight through to the last page in less than two days, a personal recond for reading a story collection.

Prior to the sino-soviet split, the Red Chinese threatened to invade the Nationalist held islands, with Russian nuclear weaponry holding the US forces back from a preemptive attack on the PRC. Instead, US Navy fighters armed with \\"special weapons\\" zoom near the critical lines at 1300 mph. Between their distance from home, their own meager resources and the rigors of naval aviation, the pilots of our hero's squadron are whittled to the bone. The main character, who writes in first person, isn't even a very good pilot (unfortunately, he never gets a chance to show his stuff in combat ) instead, the elements and the tricky aspects of flying planes from aircraft carriers put him to the test. If not a peerless warrior, he at least displays a supernatural capacity for survival, even as other planes crash into the sea on aborted carrier landings (\\"bolters\\") or simply vanish. The squadron commander, a scarred warrior (literally: he's got a fake lower-leg and you almost never hear him talk) has no choice but to keep him around, knowing that the narrator is essentially all they've got.\\"The Brink\\" is an old book, but obviously one that hasn't made a dent the way \\"Flight of the Intruder\\" has, which is a shame. The hero's sense of self-deprecation is light, but strong enough to keep him from being one of those action figures who populate other military aviation novels. In fact, it's refreshing to read an aviation novel that stays focused on one person (most are about a host of people, few of whom become convincing characters). It's an extreme that perhaps goes a bit far (it would have been nice if he did have some friends, something to broaden our horizons; instead, the narrator's solitude gives the rest of us chronic tunnel vision). Also, it would have been great if he could have given us some sense of what it's like to actually fly the mighty F-8 Crusader, one of the legendary machines in the history of air warfare. Also, although the author adequately describes the underlying global situation, it never manages to connect that with the desperation of the round-the-clock ops suffered by the pilots here - any chronic shortages in men or aircraft coinciding with an even less-than-earth shattering situation would probably result in US military units being put in high-tension, low-margin-for-error operations in which planes and the men who flew them would be stretched to the breaking point. Setlowe misses a great chance to elevate the crisis to one of WWIII proportions by having our hero have to deal with the nuclear weapons he may be forced to fly with. Instead, the nukes remain shadowy Mcguffins - objects whose presence is more felt than realized. Also, the end is a bit of a cop out. (We all know that the Quemoy-Matsu crisis ended in anti-climax, but couldn't the author have given us something less pat than what he ends the book on?) All in all, a great book nonetheless, one guaranteed to make you feel as if you had been standing on the deck of a steaming carrier, with salt spray from the Sea of China blowing at you."},{"Title":"M.

Butterfly / 0-822-20712-5No doubt you've heard the story of the man who was married to another man, but claimed to have mistakenly thought that his \\"wife\\" was a woman. In this incredible drama, Hwang takes this real life story, often distilled into a joke or a bit of trivia, and creates a compelling drama. He refuses easy answers here, noting that the thing people *really* want to ask is \\"Did he or didn't he know?\\" The novelty of the situation shocks us, and we want to hear the details - partly to satisfy a vicarious desire, and partly to reassure ourselves that such deception could not happen to us.However, Hwang turns the question aside as meaningless and points out that the underlying deception - that of a false lover - is one that we've all seen countless times. The gender of the participants is less important than their feelings and motivations. Whatever else may have occurred, he argues, a human being was used in a terrible way, and his heart was destroyed in the process. Everything else in immaterial.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"M.

It's a little grotesque at times and definitely not moral, but you wont regret reading it. I would suggest it highly."},{"Title":"M. Butterfly","review":"M. Butterfly is ment to be a deconstruction of the &quot;classic&quot; story of Western-man-meets-Asian-woman imortalized in the Italian opera, Madame Butterfly, and the American musical, Miss Saigon. M. Butterfly is a biting social critique of the inherent racial, cultural, and sexual dynamics at play in the West's story of the East. The play is truly interesting in the way in which it deconstructs the West's imperialistic attitued toward the East and its women. The power in this relationship between an French dilomat and the Chinese opera singer seems to belong, as traditionally is the case, to the Western man. However, it soon becomes clear that the real power in lies in the hands of Song, who is actually a Chinese spy. It is a convoluted story in which all of the traditional roles are confused. And while it does a wonderful job of confusing the simplistic dominant-submissive binary construction along which we traditionally judge West and East, it does little to reverse the similar assumptions we as a society make when evaluating the male-female dicotomy. Throughout the play, while the power shifts back and forth between Eastern and Western characters, the weak character is consistently depicted as feminine while the power resides in whichever character is the most traditionally masculine at any given moment. In this way, Whang does both a service to society in breaking down the West's stereotypes of the East without likewise deconstructing our patriarchal society's imperialistic attitueds towards women."},{"Title":"M. Butterfly","review":"I recently saw a performance of M. Butterfly at a local theatre, and I was left utterly speechless. The acting was extremely powerful, which brought the story and its themes to life better than any book could. Nevertheless, I'm going to buy a copy of the play!"},{"Title":"M. Butterfly","review":"Hwang's M. Butterfly is a splendid tale of conflicting differences between man and woman, East and West, love and lust. Based on a true story, M. Butterfly invokes commonly held sterotypes about both the East and West and calls into question normative constructs of gender and the power dynamic found within. Here, we see Gallimard, the quasi-male, Western representation, fall in love with another man, Song, who dupes Gallimard by dressing and carrying on as a submissive Asian mistress. The reader is taken on a journey of flashbacks and all throughout the play, is forced to walk along Gallimard's consciousness. By the play's unpredictable end, we see what happens when all the roles are reversed--when man becomes woman, East becomes West. Clearly, Hwang intended to play upon an inversion of modern-day stereotypes in this work and does so quite well. From this work, the audience is forced to question the myth of the standard gendered roles and ethnic markers.However, as well written and effective this play is, it does lack some serios character development, particularly for some of its minor characters. The audience does not get to know much about Helga or Rene and some may claim that Song's character is never fully and ripefully presented. He comes across as one dimensional and still confined to the very stereotypes which Hwang obviously wants to reclaim and rewrite.Overall, this is a fine theatrical piece and worthy of in-depth discussion. One bit of caution: do not precede to read this piece as a simple &quot;coming out&quot; story, as it is more substantive and profound. For a budding playwright, Hwang hits the mark with this one!"},{"Title":"M. Butterfly","review":"M. Butterfly, a play by Henry David Hwang, cleverly manipulates stereotypes about race, gender, and sexuality from the Puccini's Opera, Mme Butterfly. In Mme Butterfly, an American serviceman buys a Vietnamese wife for a price equivocal to pocket change. She is the epitome of the doting, submissive Asian stereotype. The American boasts that, like a Butterfly, the woman is so tame that she'll eat from his hand. During his stint in her country, she bears a baby boy. Yet, soon afterwards, the man is sent back to the United States, leaving the heartbroken wife waiting for his return. Finally, when she realizes that he is lost forever, she commits suicide so that at least her son will have a better life. In a heart wrenching scene, the small boy is retrieved by the American's new wife. Her unfailing love and her sacrifice are glorified. Yet, Hwang challenges this submission by playing upon this first M. abbreviation, using the french Monsieur instead of the opera's Madame. In Hwang's play, Song, an assertive Chinese opera singer, asks the American, and the reader, to reconsider his &quot;favorite fantasy, &quot; that of &quot;the submissive Oriental woman and the cruel white man.&quot; She asks him, and her reader, to reconsider -&quot;Consider it this way: what would you say if a blonde homecoming queen fell in love with a short Japanese businessman? ....................... &quot; (17) However, presumably, Song becomes the American serviceman's Butterfly. Hong illustrates how his confidence, which was weak beforehand, grows because the newfound feelings of superiority that the relationship provides. Yet, as the play progresses, Hwang adds several surprise twists that border on the bizarre to dispel these misconceptions about race aand gender."},{"Title":"M. Butterfly","review":"Trite but true! The (trite) notion underpinning this play, that people tend not to be too discerning when thinking about foreign places and people (which leads to stereotyping) is amply demonstrated by the confusion over the setting of the play. Let's get this straight: This play M Butterfly is set in CHINA, Puccini's opera Madama Butterfly is set in JAPAN (a very different country) and neither are set in VIETNAM (though the modern musical based on Madama Butterfly, Miss Saigon, is). Now on to the play itself ...The play's premise is that the Western Man (represented by real-life French diplomat Gallimard) is so powerfully taken with the myth of the perfect submissive Asian woman who would love him to death (represented by the Chinese opera singer Song Liling) that he would go to great lengths, even mind-boggling self-delusion, to realise this myth. In doing so, he proves that he, not the Asian woman, is the manipulated one; manipulated by his own prejudices and preconceptions.The myth of the idealised submissive Asian female awaiting her salvation by the love of a big strong western male is deserving enough of explosion. The megaton explosion is handily provided by Song being the ultimate manipulator; a Chinese spy after Gallimard's state secrets, not his love, who also happens to be a man exploiting Gallimard and his fantasy of the devoted Asian woman. Well well. ... That's about it, though. After (it hopes) pulling the rug from under the audiences' feet, the play doesn't replace the rug with any solid flooring. This play relies too much on exposing a stereotype - if in the first place you have never bought into the stereotype of the Asian woman dying to love the white man, it really has very little to say to you. Anyone who has thought through the complex implications of the &quot;Pinkerton syndrome&quot; will find the play rather stale. Admittedly there's something gratifying in having this faintly-offensive stereotype thrown into the faces of a western audience, but this hardly validates the play as a profound voice or an artistic endeavour (and in fact, it's a tad childish). This play isn't very deep; it doesn't improve upon a second reading, nor upon performance. Stripped of its shock value, I find not much left."},{"Title":"M.

However, I wouldn't recommend it to younger audiences because it's pretty sexual. I was so intrigued with this piece that I couldn't put it down, and I will definitely read it again. Plus, this play has a pretty shocking ending. The sexual undertones make the play lively and suspenseful. However, the deeper meaning of it is what makes me want to come back to it again. It's a play about who has power, denial, deception, and fantasies. Well worth the read!!!"},{"Title":"M. Butterfly","review":"namely that a man can have a liaison with a supposed woman lasting years, have sex with \\"her\\" regularly (ah! the mysterious ways of the East!) and not realise that he is indeed with a man.

Go figure.)On the other hand, as a comment of the make-believe that \\"straight\\" men will go to almost any lengths to preserve, and not only with other men, this play is an amusing artifact. There is no bigger power trip than the nonsense we inflict on ourselves and others in order to live life according to Inherited Silly Myths! In Puccini's opera there is no bigger (self-)prevaricator than Butterfly herself: she lives the charade of her \\"Japanese marriage\\" long after it is over...indeed, it never was. She is the obsessive, she the power-tripper.Puccini's opera, by the way, was not based on Pierre Loti's charming 1887 Japonnaiserie Madame Chrysant&egrave;me. In that novel, the geisha never believes her \\"marriage\\" is real.The opera was based on an 1898 short story by Pennsylvania-born John Luther Long (1861-1927) which was made into a play (1900) by the highly successful American playwright David Belasco (1853-1931), as of the Belasco Theater. Unlike her counterpart in Madame Chrysanth&egrave;me, Butterfly chooses to believes that her marriage is real, and allows herself to fall in love. Rather un-Asian perhaps, but a Broadway master-stroke.There is a beautiful and unfairly neglected 1892 opera based on Loti's Madame Chysanth&egrave;me, by Andr&eacute; Messager (1853-1929.)"},{"Title":"M. Butterfly","review":"Can you really believe he had sex with this \\"woman\\" (Butterfly) and didn't know she was a man ? Besides this crucial evasion most of the rest of this otherwise worthy attempt to portray the clash between oriental ( in this case Maoist) culture and that of the West seems rather footling. The final scene in which Gallimard imagines himself to be Butterfly and commits suicide in front of 200 French prison inmates is both unreal and foolish."},{"Title":"M. Butterfly","review":"My view of the message of this play can be summed up actually by a character in the play itself. Upon hearing of Song's rant about the opera \\"Madame Butterfly,\\" Helga asks Rene, \\"Does it always have to be about the politics for them? Can't they just see it as beautiful music?\\"This play is good, but it is too bashing of the opera known as \\"Madame Butterfly.\\"First off, I have to correct reviewers: \\"Miss Saigon\\" was NEVER mentioned. \\"Miss Saigon\\" is actually very, very little like its predecessor \\"Madame Butterfly.\\" I am VERY annoyed to read that people think it is. Boubil and Schonberg knew the flaws of the opera right away, and they did their best to correct them. Chris is not a jerk who views their marriage as a sham: he truly loves Kim and, trying to be the American hero, tries to save her and fails. After this failure, after losing her, does not speak for a year. Pinkerton viewed the relationship as a joke all along: Chris did not. Kim herself is a very strong individual: she rejects marriage from Thuy because she doesn't love him, not because he's Asian, and when Thuy tries to murder her son she shoots him. To say that \\"Miss Saigon\\" upholds the traditional East vs. West stereotypes is wrong, wrong, wrong.Anyway, in case you can't tell, \\"Miss Saigon\\" is my favorite musical. I am rather obsessed. I know all about how it came about, every creative process involved, stemming back to the Puccini opera. Also, I am an opera freak. Thus, I had a unique approach to this play by being not only well-acquainted with Puccini's opera (I adore the version with Ying Huang) but also the background behind it.This was a great play, and I would love to see it. I was hooked from the minute I started it (its name connection to the opera listed in the table of contents of the Bedford Compact Guide to Literature intrigued me) and I've read it several times since, even purchased a copy for myself.However, David Henry Hwang approaches things from a view that I cannot agree with. He wrote that he'd never heard Madame Butterfly until he got this play idea, but he knew about the plot. He knew the plot to Madame Butterfly before he'd ever heard it. He knew its controversy. He went in with it in mind, and I bet was too busy looking for it that he wasn't letting himself be touched by the music. The story sucks. I will admit it. But the music is beautiful, and when you see it performed it is wonderful.Hwang's lack of knowledge regarding opera was rather apparent. Want to hear something interesting? The original story of Madame Butterfly, Madame Chrysanthemum, was about a Japanese geisha who completely used a French officer (Pierre Loti, who wrote the novel.) I often wondered throughout if Hwang knew this, and was being cute on purpose, but reading criticisms of the play, and also Hwang's comments on it, I decided that he most likely did not. Also, Puccini women in general tend to be pitiful like that. It's not just the Asian thing. Heck, the common opera theme period is a girl killing herself for a man--look at \\"Lakm&eacute;\\" or \\"Lucia di Lammermoor.\\" Even Mozart's \\"Die Zauberflote\\"!Hwang wrote the book to the musical version of Verdi's \\"Aida.\\" In the original, she chooses to voluntarily die with her lover. In the musical, she is ordered to die with him. Sure, maybe it's more sensible, but is it as romantic? Isn't that the whole point of theatre?Hwang also failed to realize that \\"Madame Butterfly\\" is viewed as beautiful not because a woman kills herself for the man she loves, but because she kills herself for her child. It's referred to as her \\"ultimate sacrifice.\\" As she prepares to kill herself, she sings that she is doing it so her son will have no regrets, and will forget her. I personally feel that \\"Miss Saigon\\" exemplifies this ultimate sacrifice better, but hey. The opera is more about her undying love for her son rather than her undying love for Pinkerton.Thus, I really feel that Hwang is pretty much playing the race card. Puccini's \\"Madame Butterfly\\" has a crappy plot, as I've already said, and it does embody the attitudes that the West had towards the East back when the East was viewed as exotic and the story was at the apex of its popularity.Hwang also wrote the book for the revival of \\"Flower Drum Song.\\" He made it less offensive to Asians, I suppose, but the story really suffered...Please, those of you that love this story, take some time to look into the opera that inspired it. Why do you think it is so popular, if it is as horrible as Hwang makes it out to be? It's not my favorite--in fact, I never thought I would be defending it--but it's completely misconstrued in this play.Must it always be about the politics? Can't it just be seen as beautiful music?"},{"Title":"M. Butterfly","review":"M. Butterfly takes place in the mind of Rene Gallimard. While the play begins with him in a French prison, we are taken far away from this prison into the depths of his mind. His fantasies of Song Liling are both reality and illusionary. He will ultimately face the most shocking truth about the &quot;woman&quot; he thought he loved for twenty years. M. Butterfly takes a bold move in rearranging common roles set by our society, whether speaking for the present or from fifty years ago. This play dives deep into the pool of stereotypes and makes every turn imaginable. While the Eastern/Western dichotomy is presented with stereotypes of both sides, roles are soon reversed which gives the dichotomy a whole new meaning. Gallimard, initially portrayed as the Western dominant male, and Song, initially portrayed as the compliant Asian woman, will both eventually reverse their sexual roles although their enthnic identities remain in tact. Gallimard evolves from the controller to the controlled, while Song proves his power and control as his masculinity is revealed. All of this role and sexual confusion causes us to re-examine the stereotypes. Are they socially constructed or are they inherent in the person? You must read and decide for yourself!"},{"Title":"M. Butterfly","review":"Reviewers who focus on the inplausibility of the play's premise are missing the forest for the trees. The ridiculousness of Gallimard's situation is the product of his (and through him, the West's) self-absorbed and limited view of the East, evidenced through the overly simplistic dichotomy of East & West. He has been utterly blinded by his preconceptions of gender, culture, and politics. Hwang has written a masterpiece with grace, humor, and wit.

Butterfly","review":"Hwang's play, &quot;M.Butterfly&quot; attepts to deconstruct the opera &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; by breaking the back of the play. He does this by reversing both gender roles and the identifications of power that go along with those roles. First, Hwang represents the Western man, who is stereotypically strong, crass, and powerful, as Rene, a rather effeminate man with homosexual leanings. In doing so, Hwang makes it possible for the sterotypically weak and effiminate Oriental man, played by Song, to dupe and therefore overpower the Western man. One problem Hwang runs into, however, is the fact that Song is presented as effiminate. In fact, for most of the play Song is dressed and acts like a woman. His lines play right into Rene's preconceptions about the East, which both leads to his promotion as well as his eventual destruction and downfall. While Song does appear to win in the end, Rene, in fact rejects him. Thus while Hwang does attempt to deconstruct many of the Western stereotypes about the East, and does, he also perpetuates others. This play examines the overwhelming power of sterotypes as a discourse, through the concepts of gender and with the backdrop of the Vietnam War."},{"Title":"M. Butterfly","review":"Since some broad-minded fellow in the bible first referred to a woman as the \\"weaker vessel\\", and most likely before that, women have been fighting the stigma of the physically and mentally weak being, only capable of caring for herself to a certain extent. Even in this day and time, with self-proclaimed sensitive males coming out of the woodwork, quiet as kept, this is still the ideal. Passivity is thought of as a female trait, and an admirable one-though it has also become popular to herald the new dawn of strong, intelligent women. Only don't be too strong or intelligent. A heady mixture of non-threatening intelligence and feminine strength is probably best.Hwang's M. BUTTERFLY skewers these concepts, attacking traditional Western views of Asian women, whom, perhaps even more than their sisters elsewhere, have the \\"weaker vessel\\", the delicate \\"lotus blossom\\" tattooed on their backsides. The character Gallimard is pulled into M. Butterfly's trap because he is enthralled with the modern western education and values she has, which he considers to be in conflict with her \\"Oriental\\" soul. It's exactly this piquant combination of an innocence and sexual prowess, which he considers culturally entrenched, that has him so in love with her. Asian girls in these types of stories are always slight, shy and beautiful, but no matter, they will eventually give in to the White Alpha Male, no matter WHAT he looks like. They are also loyal until the death, serving the White Alpha Male until their code of honor calls for suicide or some such nonsense, freeing White Alpha Male to marry a white woman, as the story wants us to believe he ought to have done in the first place. This thought is so entrenched in society, that we don't think twice when Puccini's Butterfly falls for some pencil pushing bureaucrat, renouncing offers from rich, handsome young men of her own country, and her demise at the end is celebrated. But Hwang WANTS us to start thinking, start realizing what our preconceptions about others say about US.Does anyone think that the real life Butterfly that this play is based on was as beautiful as her enamored bureaucrat thought? Or did he simply see what he wanted to see? MADAME BUTTERFLY IS A MAN! Gallimard has, and perhaps not consciously, mentally objectified Asian women so much that he is able to project his fantasies and delusions of what an Asian woman should be ON A MAN! Butterfly even STRIPS in front of him, and he sees nothing amiss. The reason the ruse works is, as Butterfly says \\"only a man knows how woman is supposed to act\\". Butterfly keys into Gallimard's own preconceptions of Asian female behavior, and uses them against him.Generally, smirking retellings of old stories where a dubious gilding of modern sociological mores is splashed over everything give me a pain. But this time it works, and HOW it works. Pick up M. BUTTERFLY today."},{"Title":"M. Butterfly","review":"This is a pretty interesting play..but I strongly recommend that you should read it first..and if you want you can watch the film..(J.Irons is pretty good). David H.Hwang combines the gender confusion with themes from G. Puccini's opera &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; which is briefly about an American man having a relationship with a Chinese woman. Hwang blends this with the facts in which he inspired by a 1986 newspaper story, where a French diplomat who was is trial for espionage had a relationship with a woman which turned out to be a man. This play is a gender complicated drama about clash between Western &amp; Eastern cultures. Moreover, this may also be considered as a love story, which I think is a very sad one. Hwang creates stereotypes, and he makes these stereotypes vice versa. By changing the roles, Rene who is supposed to represent West &amp; Song, East no longer represent those.Song becomes the masculine which is masked by the feminine disguise represents West &amp; Rene who becomes submissive in the play represents East. In this play many of you may find Rene stupid and perverted but he is not. They were in love for a long time. Rene knew that Song was a man, but he is definitely not gay. Rene is in love with the idea that such a perfect woman exists. In reality, there is no perfect woman according to his standards. He is in love with a perfect fantasy. &quot; it is true that only a man knows how a woman is supposed to act.&quot; By the word woman I am referring to the ideal woman of which every man dreams and Song fulfills this role so well that Rene does not want to discover that Song is a man, because he has a perfect relationship,and why should he ruin it ? He has the woman of is life, why lose it ? On the other, Song is a spy, an actress! and gay. He uses theater and wears woman dresses( In that time women were excluded from performing in a theater because of culturally constructed constaints.) Beyond this acting, under that disguise, Song gets what he wants. He gets a relationship in which he would never get if he was not an actor. There is so much to say about this play.. I think it is a great love story..I really felt sorry for Rene.. Having found his perfect woman, confronting with the reality, he realizes that his dream will never go on. I wont tell the end..but it made me cry..its a pathetic ending.."},{"Title":"M. Butterfly","review":"I had to read M Butterfly for my College Sophomore-level English class last semester. I admit: I cheated. I rented the movie version of M Butterfly with Jeremy Irons in it. I was shocked when I saw the movie. I had no concept of the plot. An American Man in China, a Diplomat/Spy during the Vietnam war era meets this Chinese Woman and he is smitten by her because he believes in the stereotype that all Chinese women are submissive and docile. She plays into it and they become lovers for a very long period of years. At the end he finds out that his Chinese lover is actually a man, something he claims he never knew. I watched the movie and said &quot;yeah right, look at her, how can you not tell she is a man?&quot; I was intrigued by the plot after the movie, so I read the play and I was completely engrossed. The play is so much more better than the movie. The play has a lot more characters and gives more depth. I felt sorry for the movie version of Gallimard because it seemed like he was duped, but in the play we find Gallimard to be quite sexist, cold, and down right mean. The play M Butterfly is a fine play. It blends homosexuality, male dominance, female submission, gender roles, racial roles all into one ball of plot."},{"Title":"M.

Also you would need to have a good deal of knowledge in pattern making to really use this book for making vestments. There is no info, that I could find, on how to size the garments to individual people and if you need a different size than the arbitrary one that is used in the instructions then you will have to know how to alter the patterns to fit. Also, there is no cassock pattern even though the cassock is listed in the table of contents. The authors comment is that cassocks need to be tailored to the individual and that is beyond the scope of the book. That doesn't bode well for the rest of the patterns. A minor irritation is that although there is a beautiful example of embroidery on the cover there is really not much usable embroidery information in the book. This is a rather major oversight since traditional vestments, especially chasubles, usually are heavily embroidered. So you would need an addition resource for that.The quality of the book is rather bad, since it appears to be a photocopy of the original book.

A reference book isn't worth a good deal unless the editors stive to make it objective and accurate and this one isn't consistently either. (Mine is the Head edition, so perhaps I'm being unfair to the others.) I've skipped about reading entries and have thus read that George Gissing had only one friend and that his marriages failed because Gissing felt that his wives weren't sufficiently grateful to him. I've also learned that Isabel Burton burned her husband's writings because he drank a lot and travelled a lot.These don't seem to me simply sloppy inaccuracies. They're so supremely removed from the factual as to seem, particularly in the Gissing entry, the product of malevolence. Why? Because they're dead white men--or, worse, dead white Victorian men? Because the writer(s) didn't approve of their books? And if I lit upon these porkies by chance, how many more are there in the volume?

In other respects it is maddening; for every example that the author used to demonstrate a provocative and useful thesis there are counterexamples that could be used to refute it. In \\"Hard Bodies\\" Susan Jeffords, professor of English and director of Women's Studies at the University of Washington, offers an entree into the ideology of the Reagan era of the 1980s by unpacking several blockbuster film series, especially \\"Rambo,\\" \\"Lethal Weapon,\\" \\"Die Hard,\\" and \\"Robocop.\\" For Jeffords, these films display an underlying masculinity. As she put it: \\"The depiction of the indefatigable, muscular, and invincible masculine body became the lynchpin of the Reagan imaginary; this hardened male form became the emblem not only for the Reagan presidency but for its ideologies and economies as well\\" (p. 25).The incredibly \\"buff\\" bodies of the actors in these films, always on display, according to Jeffords stood for the aggressive militaristic and hard power strategies of the Reagan administration. At the same time, as these various film series unfolded over time Jeffords tracks the changes in the \\"hard bodies\\" involved and their place in the schema of the era. For example, in the first of \\"The Terminator\\" series Arnold Schwarzenegger's cyborg is a brutal, single-minded killing machine, the prototypical \\"hard body\\" of the Reagan era. Jeffords argues that in the second film in the series, Schwarzenegger's cyborg has become a protective, nurturing father figure for the young John Connor. In Jefford's characterization, the second film was reflective of a different version of masculinity as espoused in the George H.W. Bush administration (1989-1993). She concludes that the second film presented \\"male viewers an alternative to the declining workplace and national structure as sources of masculine authority and power--the world of the family\\" (p. 170).This is a powerful thesis which has much to recommend it. And Jeffords marshals strong evidence to support it throughout this intriguing book. At the same time Jeffords overstates her case in two fundamental ways. First, she fails to account for the very many other films of the Reagan era which do not support her thesis of masculine aggressiveness on display. The Oscar winners for best picture between 1981 and 1988 were \\"Chariots of Fire\\" (1981), \\"Gandhi\\" (1982), \\"Terms of Endearment\\" (1983), \\"Amadeus\\" (1984), \\"Out of Africa\\" (1985), \\"Platoon\\" (1986), \\"The Last Emperor\\" (1987), and \\"Rain Man\\" (1988). Of those, none displayed aggressive masculinity as epitomized by Jeffords as the dominant theme of the era. With this as the case, does Jeffords offer a convincing thesis of aggressive masculinity as a dominant theme of the Reagan era?A second concern is Jeffords suggestive relationship between the film and the Reagan presidential style of leadership. She seems to read Hollywood's interest in producing these blockbusters, and the dominant masculinity inherent in them, as a reflection of the era in which they emerged. This is an old theme in film studies, and there is much truth to it, but the overreliance on this concept can lead down paths that overstate intentionality. That may be a weakness of \\"Hard Bodies.\\"Notwithstanding the fact that I question some of the conclusions contained in \\"Hard Bodies,\\" Susan Jeffords' work is a fascinating statement of a powerful and provocative thesis. It forces all who seriously analyze films of the 1980s to deal with her arguments in some manner. They might be accepted or rejected, but more likely they will be revised. Regardless, everyone must deal with them. That is the penultimate accomplishment of any scholar, and Jeffords fulfills it with exemplary skill. I have given this book four out of five stars only because I question some of her conclusions, not because I do not value the very real contributions it makes to the body of knowledge about modern American society."},{"Title":"Hard Bodies: Hollywood Masculinity in the Reagan Era","review":"Susan Jefflords is an academic who is intelligent, informed, educated and well-read, but the amount of books she has read about feminism and class theory are secondary to the paltry amount of movies she has watched. Hard Bodies is not an analysis of Hollywood films at the time, it's a well-written attempt to shoe-horn films like Rambo, Casualties of War and Unforgiven into theories she has read or formulated herself.Jefflords claims on page 22 to have chosen movies by popular acclaim, but this begs the question: why did she choose Casualties of War as one of the movies featured in the book, a box-office flop at the time of its release? And why does she not cover Top Gun, the biggest box-office smash of the decade and a feast for a book such as this? In the introduction, she defends Reagan by saying that she does not believe he funded or endorsed the movies she covered. As most cinema buffs are aware of, the Reagan administration partly funded Cannon Films, a production company that made successful action pictures like Cobra and Missing in Action, but Jefflords makes no mention of this or those movies. If she had taken the time to research this, I suspect the content would have been much more interesting to read than a six-page comparative analysis of Clint Eastwoods character in \\"Unforgiven\\" and Nixon's vision of America.I call this a waste of potential because the subject is extremely interesting, in addition to Jefflords being a good writer who makes her ideas and theories clear throughout the text. I call it a waste of time because in the end, the book is a collection of theories and dodgy speculation that no cinema enthusiast and few academics will be interested in."},{"Title":"Strategic Management in Public and Nonprofit Organizations: Managing Public Concerns in an Era of Limits Second Edition","review":"The book arrived in a timely manner.

For starters, it was nearly impossible to blow up the tree enough for it to stand up and not flop down on his head. I ended up completely deflating it and letting it drag in the water. More importantly, there is a string which holds 3 plastic balls for the child to play with while floating. This string is secured to the float only by a simple knot on each side. It came undone almost immediately after just a few light tugs on the balls by my son. The balls then came off and although they are not small enough to choke on, he still put them in his mouth and the string was left dangling and of course that ended up in his mouth as well and most definitely did pose a choking hazard. I was so unhappy with this product I emailed the manufacturer, and got NO RESPONSE after resending my complaints several times. So I do not recommend this or any other pool toy made by this company. If you do choose to buy it, be careful - it's just not safe."},{"Title":"BABY'S TROPICAL ISLAND - by SWIM WAYS","review":"I purchased this product for my 12 month old to introduce him to the water in a fun and safe way, and changed my mind quickly. As soon as I put him in, it began to tip and sink. The only way to keep him afloat was for me to hold it up (which took quite some effort), and in that case, there's no point in having a float at all! I give this product 1 star accross the board because it's not safe, not enjoyable, and definitely not worth the measly [money] that they charge you. Sometimes cheap isn't the way to go."},{"Title":"BABY'S TROPICAL ISLAND - by SWIM WAYS","review":"I bought this for my one year old son (who loves the water).

She quickly became bored enough with the floaty to attempt climbing out of it while still in the pool."},{"Title":"Twin Resolutions: The Sol Chronicles","review":"Twin Resolutions is the sixth book in The Sol Chronicles and introduces a departure from Donald D. Thompson's past story-line and direction of text. In the past books of The Sol Chronicles, the story not only jumps from person to person, and tribe to tribe but also planet to planet. In Twin Resolutions, the story takes place on one planet, Saturn, and stays there.The story picks up many years after the arrival of the space ship ARGO arrived following the destruction of Armageddon. The Captain and crew succumbed to the hazard of breathing the tainted atmosphere of Saturn and lost all long term memory. However some must have survived to form the subterranean colony of Solaria, breathing clean air and developing a society close to the one we know today.The Twins, Sabrina and Solomon, stumble on Solaria and their memories start to clear. In a series of events, the Solaria elders become suspicious of them due to their superb intelligence and find that the Twins can communicate telepathically. The Twins then go separate ways of fitting into the society. The elders devise a disastrous plan to explore the surface of Saturn and there is sadness, intrigue and justice when the rescue attempt is discovered and shut down. When the large scale rescue is devised, there is much to learn about the surface and the Satans before converting and rescuing the poisoned people.While the story was well written and the story line was concise, I was disappointed that the story did not tie itself to the other planets and ended kind of blah. The other books of The Sol Chronicles ended with the promise of adventure and exploration of other worlds and the Twin Resolutions ends with an \\"ok, here we are.\\"It seems to me that the intention of Twin Resolutions was to tell a good story and find an end to a strand of the rope which is The Sol Chronicles. If so, Donald has succeeded. I would recommend this book to anyone but would suggest that they read through the series first. I look forward to the next installment."},{"Title":"Arthritis: What Works","review":"This book is a large-scale study of arthritis which can serve as a catalog of arthritis treatments available.

If it hadn't said Jeffery Deaver on the cover, I never would have guessed the author. It doesn't have the pace, the painstaking clues, and the twists and turns in the plot that you expect from Mr. Deaver. What it does have is a fascinating group of characters, tremendous humor (most of it rather dark), and an interesting setting. The hero, John Pellam. is likeable, quirky and reminds me of many characters Harrison Ford has played--the average guy who is pushed too far and resorts to action. Donnie Buffett, the cop who was paralyzed by a gunshot wound early in the book, is no stereotype. His reactions to his terrible injury run the gamut and strike true. The only female in the cast is mysterious, but not in a femme fatale way. You keep wondering &quot;what is she *doing* here??&quot; The setting is Maddox, MO, a economically depressed river town whose only claim to fame is FDR once mentioned it in a Fireside Chat as an example of towns hard-hit by the depression. In this hard-scrabble town, a movie is being made. Hollywood lurks in the background.I recommend this enjoyable book highly."},{"Title":"Bloody River Blues (Location Scout)","review":"John Pellam works as a freelance location scout in the movie industry. His latest job has taken him to the supposedly sleepy town of Maddox, Missouri. He unknowingly bumps into a hired killer minutes before a hit takes place. Also caught up in the murder is a policeman who is shot and wounded. Both the cop and the killer remember Pellam and want to find him, though for obviously very different reasons.Because a policeman was injured the local police department is very keen that Pellam comes forward as a witness and they become very aggressive when he claims that he didn&#8217;t see anything. The killer has assumed that he left behind a witness to his crime, and so takes it upon himself to eliminate the danger.This early Jeffery Deaver provides a nice little thriller with a few surprises thron in, yet there is nothing that really grabs you and distinguishes it from the many other books in the genre."},{"Title":"Bloody River Blues (Location Scout)","review":"This second in the location scout mysteries by Jeffery Deaver, writing as William Jefferies, is one of those books that probably would never been re-released had it not been for Deaver's incredible success of the past five or six years. It doesn't have the complex plot twists or non-stop action Deaver has mastered lately. The hero, John Pellam, is upstaged in this book by Donnie Buffett, an incredibly complex and multi-facted character. Buffett's character dominates the book, while Pellam is left being abused and mistreated by the ever nasty FBI and the local police force. The identity of the mystery blonde is pretty evident, if you remember those film noirs of the forties and fifties; the big boss' reason for wanting Vince Guadia dead is pretty obvious, too. The back and forth mob activities get confusing at first, and then downright, mediocre. The elimination of one of Pellam's friends is also predictable and the hitmen Bales and Steve From end up reminiscent of Laurel and Hardy, or the Two Stooges. I admire Deaver's writing style, which is evident in this book; it's just that it's such a cliche-ridden book, I was disappointed knowing how great Deaver is now!"},{"Title":"Bloody River Blues (Location Scout)","review":"I'm a huge Jeffery Deaver fan and until this book had never read one of his tomes that I didn't absolutely love. Bloody River Blues was anything but spectacular in my opinion and it was a struggle to even get to the end.Character development was fair but not the usual style I've come to enjoy from Deaver. I never really knew John Pellam like an intimate friend and was only given tidbits of information about him. Along the way a few more scraps were thrown out but most seemed unimportant. Subcharacters were also underdeveloped - even the villain was so underdeveloped that when the identity was known it was anticlimactic. One of my favorite characters was the paralyzed cop but his story was often short changed - his doctor could have been developed to give so much more to the story but she never was and it left me lacking enthusiasm for the storyline. And his chanting, nutsy wife could have been fun but again she was almost mentioned in passing and nothing more said.The main plot was fair but not something that would grab the reader and not let go. In fact, I kept putting this book down and it was difficult to muddle my way through it. The subplots were tossed in with no clear reason behind them. For example, the subplot that has John Pellam trying to sell his own movie script so he can make it into a film himself had me scratching my head and saying, \\"So what!\\" I really didn't care and didn't see what relevance it had in the big picture. The other subplots were similar and left me wondering why they took up page space.Overall this book was just a tad below average but for a Jeffery Deaver book to even be average is a very unusual thing. His books usually grab me from the beginning and I lose sleep trying to finish them. If anything, BLOODY RIVER BLUES put me to sleep! I'd definitely skip this one and read anything else by Deaver."},{"Title":"Bloody River Blues (Location Scout)","review":"The 2nd in the Location Scout series, BLOODY RIVER BLUES, starts out like most good mysteries...Pellam literally gets caught in the middle of a hit on a person walking the street. When the dust settles, 2 people have been killed and a cop crippled.Pellam befriends the cop and together they try and put together the who's and why's. Deaver strengthens Pellam's character and lets him fight through all kinds of different scenarios to reach the truth. From beginning to end, Deaver never shys away from what Pellam has to do and draws into his world all sorts of bad guys, good guys and people who are definitely in the middle.Deaver delivers another strong mystery and you will be guessing up to the bone shattering climax as to whom did what. Jeffery Deaver triumphs again!"},{"Title":"Bloody River Blues (Location Scout)","review":"This Kindle edition is a disgrace. No whitespace between paragraphs often makes it hard to understand who is saying or doing what, or even what's happening. I can imagine someone editing a free book for Kindle in a hurry doing a job like this, but this is a book that's pretty expensive. Since writers get 30 percent of the sales -soon even 70 I think- they should take responsibility for how their work is sold.Mr. Deaver, show us what you are made of! Oversee the editing yourself and let everyone who bought this Kindle edition based on your good name as an author have a refund or a properly edited book.The book itself would get 5 stars from me (I read the paperback years ago and liked it), but the shoddy editing job takes away three of those stars for the Kindle edition."},{"Title":"Bloody River Blues (Location Scout)","review":"Buy a paperback, or check out a used book store.

Suspense was not well recreated when it has to be done and I could count just only one interesting twist that turns the whole story the other way, now Pellam goes after the perpetrators of the crime (the Feds, the thugs) , trying to find who was behind that act and why.This novel was written around or before 1993, it is clear that at that time Mr. Deaver was polishing his writing skills in order to become the excellent writer that he is today. So I conclude that William Jefferies and Jeffery Deaver are both the same \\"individual\\" but two different \\"writers\\"If you are looking for a good location scout mystery series novel, better try another attempt like Shallow Graves, is in my opinion the best of the trilogy (Shallow Graves - Bloody River Blues - Hell's Kitchen)"},{"Title":"Bloody River Blues (Location Scout)","review":"ExcellentThis review requires that I write ten more words.

Unfortunately, that's just about all of the plot that peaked any interest at all. The premise of a movie location scout becoming accidentally involved in a murder investigation had promise, but the story was very slow in developing. I kept putting the book down because I just got tired of reading. The real killer (pun intended) was that I just don't like Pellham, and when I don't like the main character, I have a very difficult time liking the story."},{"Title":"Bloody River Blues (Location Scout)","review":"John Pellam is a character from a 3-book series written relatively early in Deaver's career under the pseudonym William Jefferies. Pellam works for movie companies as a \\"location scout\\", traveling the world to find general locales appropriate for filming - or in this case, very specific Missouri scenes to suit the director of a low-budget gangster film. Early in the story, Pellam is walking home from buying beer when he witnesses a murder. The trouble is, he doesn't see the perpetrator, only the victim - but all book long, the police authorities, and the actual crooks, are convinced he knows whodunit; and so Pellam is subject of all manner of harassment until at the end, and after several more killings, we finally all learn what's what.So in this tepid thriller, we get like two good chapters at the start and two more at the end, but a lot of tedious filler in between. We'd have to rate this novel pretty low in entertainment value; and as Deaver fans, are glad he picked up the pace when he started authoring under his real name!"},{"Title":"Bloody River Blues (Location Scout)","review":"Like I said in my feedback this book was in great shape and arrived in a timely manner with no damages.

(especially his RUNE series) this one is no exception. Its not exactly high-brow, but its a fast, entertaining read, as all his early thrillers have so far been. They have good plots, which are not very complex, and are easy to get your head around, they are also full of twists, as is the norm with Deaver.however, this one is a tiny bit disappoinging, because the cahracters are not as fleshed out as he is capable of.but, the writing is very good once again, the plot sustains interest, its a quick and enjoyable read, and is reccomended to all fans of Jeffery Deaver."},{"Title":"Bloody River Blues (Location Scout)","review":"John Pellam, a movie location scout with a checkered past, finds himself caught in the middle of a real life murder for hire scenario in which he becomes the main witness. Withstanding pressure from the local police, federal agents, and the perpetrators, he must take matters into his own hands and bring down the curtain on the case. Along the way he becomes involved with a mysterious blonde, assorted hit men, and a partially paralyzed policeman.Deaver's John Pellam is a reasonaably interesting character. He personifies the typical anti-hero, and we get a fairly clear picture of his strengths and weaknesses. Except for Donnie Buffett, the partially paralyzed police officer, all of the other characters are shallow.This is a moderately interesting book. The story line is straight forward and we learn early on much of what we need to know to follow along as observers with Pellam. There are not many twists and turns to ratchet up the suspense level here. I'd say this is a nice book to curl up with beside the fireplace on a long winter's night.

An opportunity missed."},{"Title":"The Game of Chess (Algebraic Edition)","review":"If you are looking to get a solid foundation in the basics, in tactics, and a superb OPEN game repertoire, and you want to be a solid Candidate Master (2100 +) then this is the book for you.When I began to learn chess, I wish that someone had given me this book, (instead of Nimzowitsch's; MEIN System). Many \\"so-called Experts\\" talk about MY System as if Nimzowitsch had invented Water(H2O) and then taught us Cavemen how to boil and cook our food with it.Unlike Herr Nimzowitsch, Dr. Tarrasch is witty, objective, and he shows you how to finish an opponent off. Tarrasch makes you think constantly about the CENTRE, Pawn structures, and what your opponent BEST move is.It is true that he was a bit catholic/pedantic about 'how' too LEARN chess, but what University Professor isn't? And if the goal is to create a Correct habit that can be produced instinctively under GREAT pressure (think 3-0 Blitz). Then Tarrasch's method is pure genius,...As Vince Lombardi once said, \\"My teams KNOW one play, but they know a thousand variants of it and they KNOW it Better than any other team in the League.\\" (paraphrase)If you Master Tarrasch's diagrams 99-330, and remember his advise about not 'playing-to-lose,' you will turn all your current opponents into tactical dust. And lets be honest, isn't that why we REALLY play chess.Unfortunately/Fortunately, after you MASTER this book, you will have to find new and better opponents because your current friends & NEW 'enemies' will no longer want to play with you.If you are still not convinced about Tarrasch's Method then take a look at the number of First place finishes that Tarrasch Walked away with during the 1890's. Perhaps only Karpov had such a successful or more successful tournament record. AND in the 1920's when he was already in his 60's Tarrasch was still being invited to top level tournaments and playing successfully against the likes of Alekhine, Nimzowitsch, Tartakower, Reti, Capablanca, etc...All-the-While maintaining a thriving and successful Medical practise.As I said, I wish that I had been given this book first. Then I would not have wasted so much time learning HOW to boil water.Good luck & have fun beating your X-opponents/friends.Other recommended books: 300 Chess Games"},{"Title":"The Game of Chess (Algebraic Edition)","review":"This book clearly demonstrates all the elementsthat compose a classical chess game.

I have been using the Dover Edition of The Game of Chess by Tarrasch, but that edition is in Standard Notation. I saw this online and figured it would be more useful in algebraic notation. It seems to be the same content, which is great. However the formatting they changed in how the text is organized is not as well done as the Dover Edition. Its mostly big chunks of paragraphs which makes it difficult to follow the moves list. The Dover Edition presented it in a numbered list format.Also, the images for the chess boards are very low resolution and noticeably worse than the Dover Edition. Some times the pieces are a bit confusing (pawn vs bishop) because the ink is so blurry.Overall, great book for me being new to chess and trying to take it to the next level. I would recommend this over the Dover Edition only because its in algebraic and that is used more often in today's chess games."},{"Title":"The Game of Chess (Algebraic Edition)","review":"I have self-taught myself chess using Tarrasch's \\"Game of Chess\\" in the Dover edition. Not only is the book of a great quality with nice smooth paper and good binding, the content is great as well. Tarrasch talks you through the game following a possibly unusual endgame, tactics & strategy, openings succession. However, by teaching you the principles of the end game first, you gain a better appreciation for everything that follows.I enjoy chess, yet I realized early that you'd need an inordinate amount of time and effort to gain master strength, so I'm content with playing some casual games either in real life or on FICS here and there. My rating is around 1600, which is above the median, and I attribute this to studying a few great books instead of spreading myself thin. If you've liked The Game of Chess, then pick upBetter Chess for Average Players (Dover Chess), and do some tactics, maybe withChess: 5334 Problems, Combinations and Games.

Tarrasch was a top notch tournament chess player. He wrote this book to help the intermediate player really learn about the game without just trying to make a buck off of a book! If you are an adult reader, who wants to gain an insight by an oldtime, but smartimer, then enjoy this book! I can certainly recomment \\"Understanding Chess\\" by Nunn, both \\"Unbeatable Chess Lesons for Juniors\\", \\"More Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors\\" and \\"Winning Chess Traps for Juniors\\" by Snyder, and \\"The Art of Checkmate\\" by Renaud, but this book is right up there with them as equals."},{"Title":"The Game of Chess (Algebraic Edition)","review":"This is quite possibly the best single volume on the game of chess for advanced beginners to early intermediate players. The book covers all three phases of the game - ending (first), middlegame (second), and openings (last).Tarrasch's writing style is very clear and easy to understand. The section on the endgame starts with basic mating patterns (most players could skip this assuming they already have them down) and works into the the &quot;essential&quot; endgame theory quickly; square of the pawn, philidor and lucena positions in rook endings, etc.The middlegame section leans heavily toward tactical ideas rather than strategic, but this is a good thing because tactics are the most important thing to study for an improving student. One major difference in his presentation is that some of the tactical devices are presented as larger ideas, not just mechanical executions. For example, instead of running through the usual pins, forks, skewers, etc. Tarrasch works through ideas such as the attack on the f7 square, the attack on the g7 square, the attack with the h-pawn down the rooks file, etc.The openings sections is excellent, but very dated. He begins with a nice discussion on time, space, and force. He then follows by examining most major opening systems and the associated ideaa. The weakness of this part of the book is that the specific lines are somewhat dated (improvements have been found since the book was written), and certain relatively recent systems such as the pirc/modern complex are not even discussed.Even with the limitations, most of the ideas he expresses still retain a great deal of relevance.The final part of the book walks the reader through some very good illustrative games with lots of notes to expalain what is going on.All in all, this is a really good book. Another bonus is the incredible price (this is the case with most Dover Books.The only downside to the book is that it is written in the older descriptive notation. I personally have no problem reading through the notation (I even slightly prefer it), but for younger readers it may make for more work."},{"Title":"The Game of Chess (Algebraic Edition)","review":"Even though I've never wanted to become a serious chess player, I enjoy the game and I always wanted to be a decent player.Over the years, I had bought a number of books - e.g a classic by John Nunn, one about openings, a couple on strategy and theory, another &quot;compilation&quot; of grand master games).

I knew the &quot;rhetoric&quot; of the game, but somehow I didn't understand things - I couldn't &quot;see&quot; the board!Whatever is published as &quot;beginner&quot; material is limited to the hopelessly trivial stuff. And, then all of a sudden there is a myriad of overwhelming material on openings, end-games, strategy, etc. It's like trying to read about advanced physics with your high school knowledge!Finally one fine day last summer I decided to face my frustration! So I embarked on a mission to find a &quot;teacher&quot;! It took some time before I came across Siegbert Tarrasch's book, but I knew I had found the book I was looking for!He uses an absolutely inspired and uniquely brilliant (and common sense, when you come right down to it!) approach. He starts by what he calls the &quot;elements&quot; of the game - only a few pieces at a time - i.e. the end game!Next, he teaches the building blocks of the middle game. This is where he carries you over the chasm that lies between a beginner and an intermediate player! Even some intermediate players are likely to learn something. The last part of the book, as he himself points out, is really just to send you off towards the more advanced material on openings and strategy.Finally, most remarkable of all, his passion for the game of chess and his knack for &quot;teaching&quot; it comes across each and every page!"},{"Title":"The Game of Chess (Algebraic Edition)","review":"A great book to be studied and restudied. The author has done an outstanding job in breaking chess into first principles, and then using these principles to illustrate how to play chess well. First principles are principles that cannot be refuted without incurring a contradiction. In chess, these first principles are force ie, material advantage, space which is the clearance of ranks and files and time which is the gaining of tempo or a time advantage over your opponents moves. A mastery of these principles is essential to chess mastery. Chess would be impossible without these principles in operation. The author then shows how by repeated practice over the examples given in the book, one can develop &quot;chess vision&quot; which is the ability to see strengths and weaknesses in an opponents position. The book shows how tactical manuevers such as double attack, destruction of the gaurd, etc. is using the principle of force. Similar examples are given to show how time and space are used also. This is a very deep and profound book, that needs to be carefully studied to mine its secrets. One can reach any level of chess mastery by applying and repeating the exercises in the book as the author suggests. Chess masters such as Capablanca, Fisher, Kasparov and others do not know some kind of secret information that gives them such mastery. They have simply become so good by repeated practice at basic principles as expounded in this book. This book tells you outright what this secret is. It is constant practice. A very good book that will take one from novice to the highest levels of mastery and beyond."},{"Title":"The Game of Chess (Algebraic Edition)","review":"I'm 41 years old, and I'm a Portuguese lawyer. I became acquainted with the game of chess when I was a child, but I learned how to play it when I was already a law student. By then, my father offered me a copy of the (not very good) French translation of Dr. Siegbert Tarrasch's The Game of Chess. Before that, I read many, too many books and articles on the subject, without any pleasure or profit. After the careful study I did of this specific book, I ventured to play my first official tournament: it was a good enough one, and I did so well I got immediately over 1600 (portuguese) ELO! In spite of that, I never took Chess very seriously: while I was a student I seldom played official games, and after my graduation I virtually had to stop. Since my personal and professional life stabilized in the meantime, I decided to try it again a couple of years ago. For that purpose, I studied once more The Game of Chess, never dreaming of what was really going to happen. The weekend before last, I played my very first international Open: five sessions with forty players, of which twenty-six with (high) ELO FIDE, two with FM titles and three with IM titles. Having just 1913 (national) ELO and looking at so strong a competition, I estimated the best I'd get would be something around 1,5 points. Surprise! I've finished 8th (3rd ex aequo), with 3,5 points (+3=2&#8722;1) (1,5 points against three international ranked players, of which one with IM and another with FM titles) and a performance of 2293 (!) (the second best in the tournament) which earned me the right to get my first ever ELO FIDE. The next player like me finished only 22nd, with 2 points. I left behind one player with a FM title and twenty players with ELO FIDE. I was flabbergasted: how could a simple amateur obtain such a good result?! The answer was: Dr. Siegbert Tarrasch's The Game of Chess!Many critics consider this the finest all-round manual on the game: I think they're right. It had an outstanding success when it was first published in Germany in 1931 and in Great-Britain in 1934. Such a success was largely due to the apparently unorthodox but extremely effective teaching method the author used, one analogous to that a mother uses to teach her child to talk: the intuitive method of instruction. After dealing with the elements, the author proceeds not to the opening but to the end-game, since obviously it is easier for the beginner to deal with a few men than with the entire thirty-two. Dr. Tarrasch doesn't waste any time with all those eng-games which do not occur in actual play: he goes right through explaining the fundamental positions of this part of the game, doing it so simply and clearly that one finds himself quite able to understand some longer end-games (four in number) with which he concludes this part of his book. After the end-game comes the part dealing with the middle-game, the most important part of the game. He not only traces back to fixed and constantly recurring types the manifold combinations of chess, but also gives the standard positional concepts of the game: through the study of the typical combinations and attacks, one makes himself familiarized more than enough with the raw material for the conduct of the middle game, as regards both tactics and strategy. Finally, Dr. Tarrasch comes to the opening, the most difficult part of the game. After presenting a general theory of the opening, he deals with the important lines of practically all the openings, though not pretending to be exhaustive. (More than seventy years after the first edition of this book, the section on the various openings is somewhat dated, particularly on the Indian Defenses; but, to my mind, not as dramatically dated as critics say). A few games (seven in the german edition, twelve in the English edition), very fully annotated, form the concluding part of the manual.Dr. Siegbert Tarrasch's The Game of Chess is A Systematic Text-book for Beginners and More Experienced Players. To me, it's more than that: it's the true Chess Bible. Besides, it's the culminating point of the literary production of the greatest chess teacher of all times: the Praeceptor Germaniae seu Mundi, as he is known even today. Naturally, for further progress the study of master games is most important - but only those games which are accompanied by the most complete and apposite notes. In my case, I decided to study Fred Reinfeld's Tarrasch's Best Games of Chess: there were no other Dr. Tarrasch's books translated to English when I finished reading his manual. Again I made great progresses: in fact, I learned more and more about the game with the same teacher, since Reinfeld in many cases merely follows Dr. Tarrasch's own analyses and comments. Now, at long last, Three Hundred Chess Games, Montecarlo 1903 and St. Petersburg 1914 are available in English (not yet Die moderne Schachpartie, which is a pity): once read both The Game of Chess and Tarrasch's Best Games of Chess, these are the next books to study, preferably by this order. After this (and, if I may say so, only after this), one may go on to other authors - above all Alekhine. But don't you forget to start with the Chess Bible: Dr. Siegbert Tarrasch's The Game of Chess..."},{"Title":"The Game of Chess (Algebraic Edition)","review":"This is the absolute best all around chess book out there. It will start you off from square one, if needed, and turn you into a better than average player. This books is geared for begginers, however do not underestimate the material that is covered. Tarrasch covers tactics, mating nets, strategy, and opening/middle/and endgame play. In comparison to Lasker's Manual of Chess, this book is by far better. Tarrasch, though very old school, explains things clearly and simply. This book took me from about a 900 point rating to a 1500 point rating. If you combine this book with any tactical book (reinfeld's 1001 series, or Sharpen your Tactics), I gaurentee that you will be able to beat most players who challenge you outside of the tournament circle.

If you could only have only one chess book for your entire life, this might be the one you would want. It coverseverything in broad brush but also includes many interesting details of openings, etc."},{"Title":"The Game of Chess (Algebraic Edition)","review":"[The writer of this review is a chess enthusiast, rated 2150, owns over 100 chess books]This will (hopefully) be both an overall feedback that this book never really received but also a reality-check to Tarrasch's numerous theories and approach.I always believed that there is no such thing as a good chess book. The books we love are the books that made a difference. Those special books that improved our play are what we consider as quality literature but very few realize that timing is of the essence!True, there are many classics to fill the largest of libraries but the ones we keep close to our hearts, affected us with such passion because the timing was right!We were ready for the information and when it came, like a long lasting thirst; it lubricated our inner chess machinery and shined with brilliant genius.Tarrasch's \\"The Game of Chess\\" is an immortal classic for he is regarded the father of the classical school of chess. He emphasized swift development of the minor pieces, he advocated open play and explained the foundation of any opening to be rooted and entwined with the placement of the Rooks.He brought to light the importance of activity and initiative when others considered the supremacy of the pawn structure he considered the force and activity of his pieces and was willing to accept seemingly structural handicaps to successfully engage his forces and control centre mobilization.He introduced the Tarrasch defence (an early c5) and was the first to consider isolated pawns as means to an end and showed no fear in playing them even as attacking details.As a critic, I feel that I must also bring these following aspects of this book to your attention...The main problem can be easily understood once your knowledge of current theory reached an acceptable measure. Tarrasch's approach is unfortunately quite simple and his view of chess is, I dare say, quite undeveloped and if I may say so, at times, quite childish.He seems to be a rather stubborn person and as the Americans like to say - \\"one tough cookie\\".I want to make it clear that his approach, systematically speaking, is quite correct and his reasons quite reasonable and important to understand. He is what they call \\"a concept player\\" he thinks in concepts rather than, shall we say, dry science.The reader should note that this was the spirit and the limitations of his era. You can't blame Tarrasch for his lack of modern and hyper-modern understanding.Nowadays you cannot judge a position by declaration of concepts alone. Such judgment call will be unsound by its very nature! Yet in Tarrasch's time profound understanding was perhaps more important for the individual player.Today, concrete analysis of variations took over certain aspects of chess and completely changed the old chess theory.I would like to point out that even then certain players were ahead of their time, perhaps more so than Tarrasch but they dealt with different positions and that is something the reader should keep in mind if he decides to venture this book.Nimzovich who is considered the father of the modern chess school had very different points of view and his theories are certainly considered more precise by today's standards.Lasker who is somewhat the father of the hyper modern chess school had different ideas than Tarrasch entirely. Lasker (who beat Tarrasch quite badly one too many times!) once criticize Tarrasch by saying that Tarrasch is looking for reason, logic and even esthetics of the chess board while he (Lasker) simply looked for what actually works! That statement, whether true or false captures the essence of tarrasch's approach to chess. For certain his theories proved to be correct on certain aspects but his approach certainly did not! It is way too simple for today's standards and in fact it was perhaps way too simple for his own time as well but the shortage of future technicality allowed him (combined with his obviously enormous talent) to fight head in head with the world's elite. In truth, his competitors were likely all better than he was. Nimzovich, Lasker, Rubinstein and Capablanca all demonstrated better understanding of chess theory and although technical knowledge such as: opening theory, defensive techniques, prophylaxis and even simple sense of danger were all still amazingly undeveloped for today's standard Tarrasch managed to create some beautiful masterpieces that will last forever. (The same can be said about Morphy)It is important here to make notice that his theories regarding isolated pawn(s) is somewhat accepted as correct today but very few are willing to adopt it still. Strong players such as GM Akobian and the young GM Petrosian and of course GM (and former world champion) Kasparov have all played the Tarrash defence. Still, while you cannot refute tarrasch's points regarding the black side you could argue that he doesn't pay enough attention to the white side! The simple Rubinstein variation offers easy play, it is almost risk free and offers very good winning chances for white. So perhaps the fact that very few people actually play any and all of Tarrasch's variations is a good enough statement in itself and we'll leave it as that.About the book:It will serve as the absolute best of all books if you were to read it as your very first chess book!No other book and no other player can explain the simplicity of chess as well as Tarrasch. No other can install the mental behavior that is needed in dealing with the open games (which is where beginners should start their chess life) and for certain no other can impart the necessity of vengeance when talking about the value of Tempo (chess time units). Tarrasch regarded the loss of three Tempi (plural for tempo) as the value of one pawn and he is quite right about that.Reasons for buying this book:A) it is a true classicB) it will teach you a lot about chessC) it will fully explain the value of a tempoD) It will teach you how to plan your opening development in concepts rather than the memorization of tedious computer lines.E) It will impart you with the wisdom of ancient past.F) It will benefit your chess as a whole regardless of your strength.G) If you can spare the time, it should be considered as the first book of all manuals for it serves the best soil for your future studies providing you didn't take his words as religious studies but rather understood that it is step one of the many steps you will make.* Conclusion: if this is to be your first chess book then you will do well reading it.If this is not your first chess book then you will learn a lot about chess by reading it.However, if you don't have all the time in the world and you have to make a choice between Tarrasch's \`The Game of Chess', to Nimzovich's \\"My System, to Lasker's \\"Manual of Chess', then I'm here to tell you that with regard for your chess education you would do better reading \`My System' by Nimzovich!But I still hold my ground when I say that this is by far the ultimate first book about chess that one should read. Unfortunately, most of us start in the wrong order and tend to dabble as well. How very unfortunate.- I tried to keep this review to what I feel are the major differences between these classics and not giving much detail about the actual content because I feel it's somewhat irrelevant. Allthe manuals for beginners share similarity. All cover the basic fundamental knowledge, the elements of chess and general principles and for sure all are great books to own! In fact, it's probably also important, on a practical level to mention that this book is rather cheap and can be bought second hand for a few bucks so everyone should own it!"},{"Title":"The Game of Chess (Algebraic Edition)","review":"I read this book after Chess Fundamentals, and found it was very similar in its layout. The difference is that this book is much longer, because of its smaller type, and it answers many of the questions that Chess Fundamentals left unanswered; for example, from Chess Fundamentals I learned a few openings, the Ruy Lopez, Queen's Gambit, Petroff, French Defence, and a couple others, but The Game of Chess discusses 28 openings. Part 3, on the middle game, covers a few details not found in other books, like illusory protection and the point QB6 as a target for attack. This book was very helpful to me, a player who finished reading Chess Fundamentals and wanted a more thourough lesson."},{"Title":"The Game of Chess (Algebraic Edition)","review":"This book is simply a classic. It was given to me by an older friend who played during the seventies mostly, when I showed an interest in the game. It goes from complete basics (the endgame with 2-4 pieces usually) all the way to intermediate club player level.This book was a joy to read, Tarrasch is truly one of chess's greatest teachers that has lived. His passion and infectious love for the game is captivating. Tarrasch teaches the game in a highly instructive, concise, and understandable fasion aimed at the complete beginner all the way up to someone who plays in chess clubs.I wish they'd release an algebraic version of this book, as it would make it slightly easier to read. The descriptive notation is more old school and not used so much anymore.If you haven't read this, or know someone who wants to get more into chess theory and become a better player, then BUY THIS.I cannot recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Alice & Edith: A Biographical Novel of the Two Wives of Theodore Roosevelt","review":"If you are interested in Theodore Roosevelt and family, this book gives lots of info from a different point of view.

He's deliberately rebutting A.J.P. Taylor, as he also does in his biography of Bismarck.But Crankshaw is too good a writer, and too intelligent, to beat a hobbyhorse. He writes magisterially of Franz Josef's reign and the many personalities who came and went. His description of the Franco-Austrian war is particularly good.Readable and humane -- not to be missed by anyone who enjoys history."},{"Title":"The Fall of the House of Habsburg","review":"Edward Crankenshaw's sympathetic history of the last decades of the Habsburg Empire is an excellent and informative read and good to keep along side the equally good but slightly too harsh history by AJP Taylor. The one criticism of the book is that the author shows an obvious sympathy with the dynasty rather than simply relating the story. Comments on the Hungarians and reference to their manipulation and abuse of the 1867 Compromise to their own benefit are spoken in a censorious manner. The facts may be true but the Hungarians had a number of good reasons for not being crazy about the Empire or its ruling dynasty. To expect anything other than temporary and conditional loyalty from them is expecting too much from a nation the dynasty would have destroyed if it could."},{"Title":"The Fall of the House of Habsburg","review":"This is a marvelous little history of one of the great royal dynasties of Eurpoe which came to an end with the First World War.Proof of the universal appeal of this book and Crankshaw's writing style lies in the fact that this reviewer has read the book at three different times in his life (once as an undergraduate, another time at the conclusion of law school and yet another time about a year ago). Even though each of these three readings occurred at times when the reviewer's outlook and background on the subject matter was quite different, he derived pleasure and something new with each reading."},{"Title":"The Fall of the House of Habsburg","review":"3 out of 5. I purchased this book so that I could better appreciate a visit to Austria and I was not disappointed. I recommend for the non-historian, that a less scholarly read is perused first, as this book is chock-full of characters and so broad in scope and rich in description, that it is easy to lose track of people, places, and events. I took notes to better keep track of the lineage of the Hapsburg rulers and my subsequent impressions of them."},{"Title":"The Fall of the House of Habsburg","review":"Even though this book was written over thirty years ago and the period has probably been subject to many revised histories, I found this book interesting because it gives the in-depth reasoning behind the actions of the various players. It includes lots of intrigues and gives a glimpse of flawed personalities. My only complaint is the writer uses personal pronouns when he should name the person and it's confusing to whom he's referring at times. It seems unbiased, but it's difficult to know if it really is without reading dozens of other books for the period. It is not a good book to go to sleep by, but is excellent when you feel the need to make yourself smarter."},{"Title":"The Fall of the House of Habsburg","review":"Although first published almost a half century ago, this remains an authoritative and highly readable account of the gradual decline and final fall of the Habsburg empire. Crankshaw provides a colorful and detailed account of the endless intrigues, conspiracies and machinations that characterized relations among the European powers in the 19th and early 20th century, culminating, of course, in World War I.The Austrian monarchy had a dual problem unique to the Europe of the period: it was forced to thread its way through complicated foreign maneuverings; even more essential, it had to cope with and balance the multiple rivalries and interests of the ethnic groups that composed the Empire itself. Franz Josef, the decent and dedicated, if unimaginative, monarch slowly lost out on both counts. His rule, which lasted for 68 years, included wars lost first to Italy and France and then to Bismarck's Germany. Domestically, his ministers, many of them bumbling aristocrats, failed to come to grips with the rising nationalist ambitions of the Magyars and the varied Slavic language groups.Crankshaw is not shy about exposing his biases. He admires Franz Josef \`s courage and diligence while acknowledging his shortcomings. He takes an opposite view of Bismarck, respecting his brilliance, but recognizing the catastrophic long term damage his aggressiveness and militance brought to Europe. He despises the Magyars for their ruthlessness and narrow-minded assertion of their parochial interests.Crankshaw crams a huge amount of historical detail into the space of 420 pages. Occasionally, his elaborate prose runs afoul of the point he is trying to convey. Occasionally, also, he assumes a greater background knowledge of the period than the reader is likely to bring. These, however, are minor flaws, in what is a grand and impressive historical narrative."},{"Title":"The Fall of the House of Habsburg","review":"the book is detailed and it is packed with very importantdata if you are interested in how the map of europeevolved and especially the events leading up toWWI. the best i've ever read. highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Fall of the House of Habsburg","review":"Author is not interested in the presenting of head-levelled, balanced, solid facts' grounded history of the last 70 years of the Austrian Empire.Author is presenting his view on personality and psychology of Frantz Josef, members of his family and some of his ministers, where History serves as a background to provide examples and illustrations. This kind of approach is quite befitting to the genre of Historical Fiction, but out of place in the History Department. Author has unabashed admiration towards Frantz Josef and tries to show to readers, that contrary to the general opinion Emperor was an intellegent and reasonable person and brilliant political tactician. Author's line of resoningis is rather peculiar and goes as such, that History shows us that blunders of elected governments and political leaders are as frequent and as bad as of any autocrate, and Frantz Josef and his ministers were neither worst nor more clueless than contemporary governments of England for example. This reasoning is going in various forms and disguises through the book. For example author informs us that Frantz Josef being young, unexperienced and lacking any solid soldierng and military education had appointed himself his own War Minister and Comander in Chief, concentrating his efforts on smart uniforms, parade-ground maneuvres, and spit and span kind of soldireing with horredous results at Solferino and Magenta. However he immediately adds that British army at Crimea, run by minister resposible before Parliament and constitutional Queen performed equally bad in Crimea, only 5 years before . Author tries present in the best possible light what had become undoing of the Empire and the Dynasty i.e. Frantz Josef's Nationalities' policy. In 1848 he used army, composed of German and Slav recruites,to supress the Revolution making to Slavs all kind of vague promises to invoke thier help against rebellious Hungarian nobility. As the reward Slavs of the Empire instead of autonomy got unitarian Germaizing Empire, where Slavs and Magyars and Rumanians had become equal with each other and Germans and Italians as well, on the precondition of abdicating their own national identities and accepting the German-Austrian one. Than after the loss of Italian possessions and the defeat from Prussia Emperor had reconstituted his Empire as Dual Monarchy in 1867, with Hungary getting almost independence and Slavs left at tender mercy of Magyars suppressing any Croatian, Serbian and Slovak national identity through imposition of the enforced Magyarization. The fate of Rumanians of Transilvania was not better either. In Bohemia and Moravia Czechs were as well offended and severe conflict between Germans ans Czechs which had lead directly to the Munich was brewing. To mollify Czechs ,the status of the second language for local administration and education was given, neither satisfying Czechs who had wanted their own parliament akin to Hungarian Diet, with it's broad powers encompasing everything but Foreign Policy and Army, nor ensuring Germans who had felt themselves threatend in their position of the privileged nation of Austrian Lands. Exactly among Bohemian and Moravian German millieu ideas had sprung, Hitler included in his ideological brew later. German liberals-nationalists in Bohemia and to slightly lesser extend in the Austrian Lands proper started to speak about Anshluss and entering into Grossen Deutshland. In Moravian Brno(Brauenau)German Trade Unionists called their organization, closed for Czechs, the German National Socialist workers' Party, around the time Hitler was a schoolboy still. Managing this mess definitely required some tactical skill, but mess had been created by Frantz Josef himself, according to the author by consequences of quite pardonable blunders."},{"Title":"Homicide #2: violent delights","review":"This was a good, but not great book. For a novel that ties into a TV show, it was very well written. Other novelizations I read tend to be under-written, meant to only appeal to the fans of whatever show it's about. This book, however, could be picked up by anyone, and it would be a good, and more importantly, an easy read. The character's are fairly true to the show. I can totally see Munsch trying to ruin everyone's holiday with his rant on tainted meat. His character is written perfectly. I am a huge fan of the show, and Violent Delights does the show justice. That is the highest compliment that could be given to this or any book about the show Homicide."},{"Title":"Homicide #2: violent delights","review":"The author obviously knows his Policework.

Otherwise, a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Homicide #2: violent delights","review":"I mean, just because it's off the tube shouldn't mean it's all over, period. The characterizations of Munch as intellectual head-gamester who misses the designation &quot;nerd&quot; only because he leaves you with the slight impression that it might just be a lousy idea to mess with him, Pembleton as tough but intelligent sleuth, Kellerman as somewhat immature &quot;himbo&quot;, Lewis as levelheaded counterbalance to his colleagues' emotional excesses, and Giardello's imposing but fatherly relationship with his subordinates are dead-on. Priesman gets Colonel Barnfather's rank wrong, though--I don't ever remember seeing him as only a captain on the tube. Both this book series and its screen counterpart (as well as the &quot;competition&quot; of &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;) mark a renaissance in the &quot;cop story&quot; genre. The killing spree of two escapees from a hospital for the criminally insane doesn't dominate the whole story as used to be the case back when cops were seen as a faceless mass of &quot;Blue Meanies&quot; and the &quot;problems&quot; of the criminals were all anyone was supposed to care about. I know it had to evolve beyond the knight-like Sergeant Friday &amp; Dan Matthews, but the social work theory of police work was no &quot;evolution&quot;. Nor were Ponch &amp; Jon, who were only a notch more serious than Barney Miller. Baltimore's &quot;Homicide&quot; cops are PEOPLE--guys with problems at home, problems with the brass, problems with each other. They have strengths and weaknesses. Now here's hoping that this series continues (Munch transferring to a &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; spinoff isn't quite enough--he comes off as really pretentious and annoying over there), and that somebody gets on the stick and gives us some books on Sipowicz &amp; co."},{"Title":"Mathematical Quickies: 270 Stimulating Problems with Solutions (Dover Recreational Math)","review":"The best problems conform to the following pattern:1) Easy to state and understand.2) Appear difficult to solve and in fact are hard to solve if the approach is wrong.3) Easy to solve if the proper techniques are applied.All 270 problems in this collection satisfy these criteria. Taken from the \`Quickies' column in Mathematics Magazine, these are excellent problems that will tax you if you approach them from the wrong direction. However, once stated, the solution is obvious, and often can be understood by someone with only an advanced high school mathematics background. These problems or their logical variants, form a pool of problems from which you can find many to serve as either challenge problems or even slightly offbeat examination problems. My favorite is the following:Ten letters are placed in ten pre-addressed envelopes at random. What is the probability that exactly nine letters were placed in the proper envelope?The answer is zero, since if nine are placed in the correct envelope the tenth must have been as well.I first read this book about ten years ago and was impressed with the brevity, elegance and at times obvious nature of the solutions.

For instance, one asks multiplcation of a very large number by 125 -- the quickie solution is to multiply by 1000 and divide by 8, but this is not even so \\"quick\\"."},{"Title":"Mathematical Quickies: 270 Stimulating Problems with Solutions (Dover Recreational Math)","review":"So, a complaint of another reviewer is that these problems may require knowledge of Theorems the reader will not know. Isn't that the point? If you knew everything, you could write the book. If you don't, you can learn from the book. My greatest pleasure in reading this was not from the problems I could do easily, but from the ones I could not. Reading the elegant solutions to the problems I had difficulty with resulted in many \\"Ah hah!\\" moments and I felt like I was honing my mathematical skills as I hopped around the book. If you want something easy, go elsewhere. If you want to be challenged and to learn shortcuts and elegant solutions to sometimes difficult problems, this book is for you.Also, just to say it, I have not encountered a problem that could not be solved with high school mathematics. So, you don't have to be a college math major or a math genius to enjoy this book. You just have to enjoy mathematics in general and working with numbers. I have a number of mathematical puzzle books, but I like this one the best.

Hollander is gold with this, his third guide, and I recomend the use of this book to anyone interested in expanding their knowledge of computers."},{"Title":"A Guide to Software Package Evaluation & Selection: The R2ISC Method","review":"This book provides both selection criteria and a process in which to apply them. It's based on the author's R2ISC method. This method stands for Requirements (current and future), Implementability, Supportability and Cost. Both the criteria and the process are provided in detail and in a step-by-step approach, which has the following benefits:(1) Ensures that the major selection factors are thoroughly examined.(2) Reduces cost and technical risks by examining those aspects of the selection.(3) Addresses the alignment of requirements to business needs, which is often overlooked when IT is entrusted to perform selections (the main failure I've observed is that IT gets too caught up in technical details and features without looking at the way packages support business requirements - this book's approach will prevent that from happening if followed).Criteria in more detail are:- Current requirements: how well does the package being evaluated map to currentbusiness needs- Future requirements: can the package being evaluated be modified to support future business needs (which you will need to forecast).- Implementability: what is required to implement the package (how well does it fit into your existing technical environment and strategic technology plan)- Supportability: How much training is required? Are special skills needed that need to be hired or contracted? Are there impacts to existing systems, processes and workload?- Cost: TCO - total cost of ownership. What will ongoing support, including vendor contracts, cost. This is where the real surprises emerge because the initial costs of a package are but a fraction of the true cost.The R2ISC process is straightforward and looks deceptively easy at a high level. It consists of the following Set the Goal (rate each package under evaluation against the R2ISC criteria), Narrow the Field (the short list), Select the Winner and Sign the Contract. The last step is the one that is fraught with peril and can undo the best evaluation if the contract is improperly negotiated. The book gives excellent pointers.If you are faced with software selection this book will give you a clear set of criteria and a process. Be aware that the approach looks easier on paper than it is in practice. This is not a criticism of the book or the approach, both of which are excellent, but a warning that the process takes hard work and due diligence - two ingredients that no book can provide."},{"Title":"A Guide to Software Package Evaluation & Selection: The R2ISC Method","review":"This is a valuable tool for facing a software selection process.

The essays chosen for inclusion are thoughtful and varied. Just take a look through the table of contents and you'll understand its breadth. Its first chapter pays homage to some classical thinkers and their works. Its a respectful gesture that proves the enduring importance of works like The Republic, written in another context and before the style of modern academia came into its own. The next chapters deal with how we define and classify literature. More focused segments on the components of literature itself follow. The collection manages to maintain coherence and focus, so you feel the works were chosen intentionally. Best of all, the texts are condensed to be more focused and straightforward. It's a gift to be able to actually get through a piece in one sitting. The end result is that you can cover a variety of subjects and navigate adjacencies as you please. The goal of philosophy instruction, as I see it, should be to encourage exploration. This book allow that, meanwhile giving students a working knowledge of notable theorists and their works.It's also a rather significant volume, with a great deal of different texts. I could see it being used as a catch-all reference for beginning and intermediate students of the field. It gives you the foundation you need to advance to more specialized books related to your interest or academic focus. Since it's clearly marketed as an anthology, I am not going to insult the editors by pointing out minutia I would have liked to seen included. Frankly, I am nowhere near the level of expertise necessary to do so. I would prefer a general overview to obscure and narrowly-targeted pieces that were frankly never intended for mass audiences, and woud lose their intricacy if given a fleeting treatment.The font is readable and definitely aided by the two-column layout. Once again, the presentational approach foregrounds the content and gives it the attention it deserves. The book, because of its readability and core value, has deepened my interest in the field. I see reason for average people - especially those who value the arts in their daily lives - to pick this one up. It's thorough and comprehensive. It begs important questions about fiction, characterization, criticism, and more. Take a look, and think critically about what you read - in this volume, and everywhere else."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Literature: Contemporary and Classic Readings - An Anthology","review":"The size of this book and the subtitle give the impression that this book covers the whole field. It doesn't. This hodgepodge of Ordinary Language and other approaches to the philosophy of literature is not the whole picture. See \\"A Book Worth Reading\\" for a different and systematic approach to this new branch of philosophy.The articles in this anthology are almost all by philosophers who have only a passing knowledge of literature. The results are sophistic and at time sophomoric.Missing also are some famous contributions to the field, such as Sartre's What is Literature? a book which raises some serious problems for literature.

It is so rare to find a self-help book FOR MEN (most of that genre is very female oriented) and Dr Zilbergeld is very male-positive...I also liked how he discussed the socialization of little boys - how young males learn that they should supress their feelings - \\"boys don't cry\\" - and the doctor's theory that this is the cause of much misery for adult males...I heartily agree with Zilbergeld's conclusions here...I only have a few criticisms...Dr Zilbergeld tends to have a sociobiological view of modern behavior - he tends to present cultural gender roles as if they are biologically determined... This tends to undermine his arguments about male socialization (and, due to the radical differences in gender behavior in different societies, this view is fundamentally incorrect)Also, Dr Zilbergeld tends to assume that every male is in a long term monogomous relationship... This is far from true (hell, that's the reason that I brought this book in the first place) and it would be helpful if he focused more of his advice for guys like me who don't have a woman..Finally, the biggest flaw...Apparently, Zilbergeld originally wrote this book a long time ago (the copyright info says the first edition was published in 1992)... and it shows...Women (especialy women my age and younger - I'm 38) have changed a whole hell of a lot...When Zelbergeld did the surveys, apparently most women were still looking for love and didn't like sex for sex's sake, like men stereotypically do...THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE...In my experience over the last decade or so, many women these days basically dislike men...They need males because men, on average, make more money than women (but women have a higher cost of living) and, of course, most women want to have babies, and you can't do that without male DNA... other than cash and genetic material, they'd rather not be bothered with us...Also, many modern women can be as crass, vulgar and unemotional about sex as only men used to be...For instance, in the section on penis size, Dr Zilbergeld claims that \\"size doesn't matter\\" to most women and women are, supposedly, very understanding about males who are 'undersized'I beg to differ...In my experience, women are VERY much concerned about size... and you WILL get ridiculed if the woman you're with thinks you are inadequate in that department....The same for performance issues - if you aren't up to the task, many women will get really mad and start insulting you (they might even accuse you of being gay)Women aren't as nice as they used to be....There probably wern't that many of these women out there when Dr Zilbergeld did his original surveys....There most certainly are now (especially in places like Manhattan, where I live)...It's not as simple as it used to be... and assuming that all women aspire to a deep emotional connection above all else can be a very dangerous thing to do...Basically, I think that Dr Zilbergeld needs to do an updating of this otherwise excellent book (but with all new interviews of this new generation of women - who are VERY different than their mothers and grandmothers when it comes to sexuality)Still, this is an excellent read and a must buy for men looking for serious relationship advice intended for a male audience..."},{"Title":"The New Male Sexuality, Revised Edition","review":"I am a mental health professional and have required my male patients to read this work for many years. The best section is the \\"myths\\" about male sexuality. Highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The New Male Sexuality, Revised Edition","review":"This book deserves credit for addressing men's needs for good sex, but is hit and miss for women.A quote from the book:\\"We men have taken a lot of heat in recent years for our attitudes about sex. We are told that we are obsessed with sex, expecially sex without love and commitment; that we push too hard for it and in inapproporate ways in both new and old relationships; and that we pout when we don't get what we want. Such attitudes, we are told, are immature and maybe downritght sick. But I think the criticisms themselves are wrongheaded and destructive. Males can't help having their attitiudes, which are probably due at least as much to physiology as to learning. Sex, afterall is live affirming, and there's no point in feeling bad about that.\\" End quote.I believe that men have often hurt women (and their relationships with women) to fullfill their sexual urges, but author severely downplays this as if it were uncommon and less harmful than it actually is.The author gives a role-playing example on how to deal with conflict:MAN: I find myself in a strange place. I agree with you that it's your body and I shouldn't touch you in ways you don't like. So I'll do my best not to touch your breast roughly. But I can't guarantee never to do it. What feels rough to you comes from a strong feeling of lust. I'm not sure I can always catch this impluse before I grab you. I think I can do it most of the time. But there my still be a few occaisions when I don't catch myself in time. I may already be squeezing your breast before I remember. It would help me a lot to know that you're not going to get upset if that happens occasionally. Maybe you could just remind me of what I'm doing.End quote.In my opinion the woman SHOULD get upset to the degree that it makes her feel violated. If it does not bother her much, a reminder is all that is needed. But what if it really does hurt her?Women are very vulnerable during sex, and we need to feel safe. I would feel less safe with a man who read this book."},{"Title":"The New Male Sexuality, Revised Edition","review":"Although I was expecting a secondhand book I am sure I have received a stolen book from a US University.

This is not the case. I totally agree with writing a book concerning straight male sexuality but that should have been a subtitle to the book. The doc chooses to simply ignore bi and gay men as if they didn't exist. This is not the new male sexuality. Male sexuality is much more then five to eight minutes in the missionary position. Straight couples these days are experimenting with new ideas and techniques. The penis is only one component to the overall male sexual make up. there are other areas to be explored as well. If you want the straight nuts and bolts I guess this book will do but if yu are an adventurous male, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The New Male Sexuality, Revised Edition","review":"If you are looking for a healthy sexual life within the context of a loving relationship, don't look to this book for advice. This is not The New Male Sexuality, it is the same sexist thinking dressing itself up as something more evolved. Dr. Zilbergeld has no problem stereotyping and objectifying women, he is simply telling men not to let it pressure them. This book is not about mutuality. Excerpts(italics mine):Pg 121- Women like men who understand that women's orgasms are more problematic than men's. (problematic?)Pg 79- Even though we're not likely to ever have sex with fourteen Playboy bunnies at the same time, or even sequentially, it can feel very good to imagine doing so.Pg 47- Too much sensitivity can inhibit passion. Allan, a student in love with his partner Marie was always gentle. On vacation he met a seductive teasing woman who managed to get him to bed. Feeling angry toward her he thrusted hard and vigorously. He expected to be criticized for this and was surprised when she said it was terrific. When Alan returned to school, he decided to try this kind of sex with Marie. Her reaction was to ask why hadn't they always made love like this? (Marie was happy he slept with another woman?)And believe it or not, it gets worse than this. I feel sorry for the misguided people who have listened to his advice."},{"Title":"The New Male Sexuality, Revised Edition","review":"In a phrase, this book is dangerously disingenuous, painfullydisregarding honorable and edifying moral imperatives, venereal diseaseaware-conservatism and prudent common sense.

Thank you for pursuing quality and not just quantity!"},{"Title":"The New Male Sexuality, Revised Edition","review":"This is a great book as long as the author stays in his field and deals with what he knows. It gets shaky when he strays into sociology and history where his knowledge is too superficial and obviously influenced by the spirit of the age. He depicts men as being sad, hollow creatures unable to connect with others in meaningful relationships and striving anxiously to perform up to others' expectations. He then spends most of the rest of the book telling us how to perform so we can live up to women's expectations and thereby enter in meaningful face-to-face as opposed to empty side-by-side relationships. It never seems to occur to him that men (and perhaps many women) may not want the degree of control and lack of privacy inherent in face-to-face relationships. Perhaps men are satisfied with a much lower level of intimacy. Like most psychiatric professionals, the author appears to think that the generally unhappy people he meets in his practice are representative. He seems to have unconsciously adopted the patriarchal and now feminist attitude that everything that goes wrong for men is their own fault. All the problems in male/female relationships are male in origin. Men have to change (perform?). While finding this all-too-familiar litany distressing, I found a great deal of useful information in this book about what the author clearly does know about: male sexuality. He seems to understand how and why we are the way we are sexually. The practical suggestions on how to solve functional problems could be very helpful."},{"Title":"The New Male Sexuality, Revised Edition","review":"I am 20 and male, and I prefer reading about sexuality from women's books rather than this one. Zilbergeld's book was great for general practices and will probably be a great resource for sexual problems later in life, but his tone treats feminism as something males are still learning to accept. In general, there is too much about overcoming men's guilt that women should enjoy sex, too, (performance issues) and not enough about creating better sex by appreciating it for oneself and being responsive to one's partner. In general, women's books like Because It Feels Good by Debby Herbenick strike a more emotionally stable and exploratory balance which fits where I am in life."},{"Title":"The New Male Sexuality, Revised Edition","review":"I must be honest in that I have never read a sexual self help book before - however, my boyfriend, after enduring a terrible 15 year marriage was suggested by a therapist to read it.

For my husband and me we are using it to help us deal with him getting past problems that have occurred due to Low Testosterone levels and the E.D. that have followed after years of dealing with Low T. By him reading the book he has found that he is not the only man out there with a problem and that it is not something he has to deal with in silence. He also learned that worrying about fixing it or blaming himself for having a problem does far more harm that just dealing with it. The book has given him more confidence to approach the problem with his Dr. The only think I can say to you wives out there that have a husband that you love with a problem is read this book. For years I questioned weightier the problem was with me, if I was doing something wrong. By reading this book it has shown me that it is not a problem that you have to deal with alone. That there is a reason for his problem and gives you the tools you need to LOVE your man through them. Love is the best cure there is for ED problems and a multitude of other problems, problems that can be just as devastation to your relationship. With this information and the reassurance that you still love him you can give him more than some medicines alone. But if you take on the assumption that you're the cause of his problem or if he tries to make it about you so he doesn't have to face his own problem or feel less of a man because he has a problem.

Right from the beginning I loved this book and wanted to get a note to Mr. Tolkien asking that he finish another novel asap. It's suspenseful, and the story line and characters are well developed. The author takes the reader alternately from court scenes, to the murder scene and to past and present events in the characters' personal lives weaving together a story that kept me at the edge of my seat.I was leary about buying the audiobook because it is read by the author and I've been disappointed more than once when I've bought books read by their authors. I was pleasantly surprisedto find he has an enjoyable reading voice and accent.I highly recommend \\"Final Witness\\"!"},{"Title":"FINAL WITNESS","review":"First I have to say that the reviewers (some at Random House) that compared this author to his grandfather, JRR Tolkien, are comparing potatoes to mangoes. Not only do many families have more than one talented author, but these two are writing in completely different genres. If you're into fantasy and Lord of the Rings, this may not be for you. But Simon Tolkien is a British barrister practicing criminal law and he knows what he is talking about. As a lifetime fan of Rumpole of the Bailey (and a one-time visitor to the Old Bailey) I looked forward to this book.Here is why it rates over and above the conventional mystery or police procedural. Most mysteries are written from the point of view of the detective or other person investigating a crime, usually murder. The reader guesses who did it by process of elimination, although many authors put a good twist at the end. This book is written from the different points of view of all the characters, each of whom is trying to put himself in the best possible light. It's a lot trickier to figure out who is guilty, who is innocent, who is lying, who is mentally unbalanced. The suspense builds up with the minutes counting down to the final witness, after whose testimony no new evidence can be introduced. The lawyers and police are in the background. The case centers on the family members, who are not exactly likable people. The story begins with a terrifying incident and builds to a frightening climax. I think Mr. Tolkien has done an excellent job with this first novel and I will look for more."},{"Title":"FINAL WITNESS","review":"Although this is mainly a courtroom drama, there is a blend of other genres too, making this a very individual novel. It is part literary prose, part action thriller, part old-fashioned English mystery, part family saga to name a few issues. It combines various settings, from an old aristocratic mansion to cosmopolitan London, to dirty gangways and alleys. There is however a classic mystery structure, which is not lost in the study of various relationships (father-son, wife-husband, the ingenuous man and the seductive woman and many others). It is an intricate and multi-level story that offers enjoyment as well as serious reflection. I found that the author's ability for character development was amazing - an example is that although the accused has all the characteristics of a typical evil manipulative beautiful woman, she is often portrayed as sweet and vulnerable, arising a mixture of emotions in the reader. I reccommend this book to anyone who likes their mysteries complex and thought-provoking rather than action-based."},{"Title":"FINAL WITNESS","review":"Simon Tolkien makes a sparkling debut with \\"Final Witness,\\" an intense and often freaky legal thriller. His characters are very vivid and believable, the writing is solid, and Tolkien keeps unexpected twists in the evidence so that you won't be able to figure out entirely what is going on, or how the case will be resolved.Young Thomas Robinson sees his mother Anne brutally murdered by a pair of men named Rosie and Lonnie (he would have been killed too if his mother hadn't hidden him). What's more, he now says that he saw his stepmother Greta talking with Rosie, but his father Peter Robinson claims that his son is lying. A seductive social-climber who tempted the son and married the father, Greta claims that the sensitive boy is trying to blame her for the breakup of his parents' marriage.Now, a much-publicized murder investigation is underway. Thomas, his best pal, the housekeeper, and a few other witnesses are called to testify about the evidence about Anne's death, including a questionable first name, a dead dog, a stolen locket, a gate left open, and Thomas's vivid imagination. As the case progresses, the testimonies start to break down. Is the secretive Greta a murderer? Has Thomas made a mistake? And what will the \\"final witness\\" tell the court?Like his world-famous grandfather, Simon Tolkien writes about what he knows. While J.R.R. Tolkien's job and writing centered on language and legends, Simon Tolkien is a barrister in London. So it only makes sense that he wrote a legal thriller, and a good one too. (It also gives me extra respect for him as a writer and person, because some people would have just tried to cash in on the family name) Aside from the [love] content (which, while fitting for Greta and her effect on Peter and Thomas, is a little more than I'd like), this is a great book. Certainly head-and-shoulders above Grisham and similar writers.Tolkien's writing is solid and detailed; he has a very you-are-there feel to his book. He's at his best in the courtroom scenes, which are the tensest parts of the book. I got cold chills reading those parts. His descriptions of things like the \\"yellow dress\\" incident, the wind in the trees, a crowded house or a creepy courthouse are astounding.Thomas is the most likeable person in the book, very imaginative and sweet-natured. His father Peter is clearly experiencing doubts about Greta, but insists she's innocent less out of thought than wishing. The rigidly feudal housekeeper and rather fluttery pal Matthew are strong supporting characters. But where Tolkien really strikes gold is Greta: We see that she can be very sultry, nasty, and certainly we can imagine her killing someone (whether or not she did). But he gives the readers insights into her life and her vulnerabilities, to give her dimension. I hated Greta, but I understood her inside and out. Brilliant.Readers shouldn't expect something as groundbreaking as \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" (On the back cover, Tolkien even talks about his fears about being compared to his grandfather) But if you like a tight, tense, well-plotted and amazingly characterized legal thriller, this is the ticket. One of the best books of 2002."},{"Title":"FINAL WITNESS","review":"I read the book, like many, because of the name. I was throughly impressed with the story.

He demonstrated a real talent for descriptive prose; using it to make all of his characters and locations vivid. The story wasn't anything particularly groundbreaking, though it was interesting to get a glimpse into the less familiar territory of the British legal system. There were also elements of fantasy in the House of the Four Winds and the curse of the Sackville family's sapphire ring. (I thought that using the Sackville name was a nice and subtle homage to his grandfather!) Overall, this was a well-done novel."},{"Title":"FINAL WITNESS","review":"I have to admit that the main reason I picked up this book to read was the last name of the author...and an interesting escape route by the author's statement cautioning against any comparison with his famous grandfather....This novel is probably one of the better written legal thrillers with not as much emphasis on court room dramatics and unrealistic plot twists. The story is well-written - few characters (though the depth of character portrayal leaves much room for improvement) seen in the context of a murder..in different angles...legal, romance, family relations, and emotions...The story at times seems to be very predictable...but the author manages to sustain a high level of interest throughout the book. A worthy first effort by an author who has to live up to huge expectations imposed by his surname. Readers trying to find another Grisham will be disappointed...Simon gives uses the murder story as the canvas to bring to light some complex human interactions..."},{"Title":"FINAL WITNESS","review":"I picked up this book because it WAS a courtroom drama without knowing who the author was til I read about him in the back cover.I had no problem following the plot and knew that had to be the connection of the accused to the mystery man before it was stumbled on almost belatedly by the boy for the final witness.I found a few inconsistencies in the editing but nothing serious. Namely the ability of Sir Peter to reach his home by phone after it had been explained the phone lines had been cut outside the home requiring Tom to run to the neighbors to call emergency.All in all I think the author did a bang up job for a first novel"},{"Title":"FINAL WITNESS","review":"I hope Mr. Tolkien is at work on another novel.

This legal thriller is a pretty dry and pedestrian affair. It's cardboard characters, and contrived plot are matched with longwinded dialogue and luckluster ending. Good courtroom drama can bring oodles of suspense, but the bad and boring one can be nothing short of torture. Mr. Tolkin bemoans the trials and tribulations of an author who is related to a famous writer. My impression is that well known last name is the only reason that this book was published at all."},{"Title":"FINAL WITNESS","review":"With a name like Tolkien, any writer would be hard pressed to live up to expectations. I cracked open this British-style courtroom mystery leaving lots of room for grace.Indeed, \\"Final Witness\\" drew me into its mystery aspects quickly. I was intrigued by the murder of Lady Anne and the subsequent accusations by her son that Sir Peter's assistant/future lover was responsible. On the surface, things seemed straightforward, but the jacket cover and reviewers assured me that unexpected twists lie ahead. I plugged along, waiting for two things to happen: 1) for the characters to make me care about their individual fates, 2) for the plot to take me on divergent paths.Unfortunately, neither happened.Despite well-drawn characters, efficient prose, and a passable plot, I failed to be moved or surprised. I also had a hard time hurdling the issue of a man proposing to his lover on the day of his murdered wife's funeral.I seem to be in the minority, but \\"Final Witness\\" left me feeling strangely apathetic. Due to Simon Tolkien's writing ability, I'd try a second novel, but hope for more of the human touch.

Those who have only seen her in &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; and in more recent years as the docile housewife on &quot;The Ropers&quot; are in for a great surprise and a treat as they watch this film and it's sequel. She excels in the lead role of &quot;Mommy&quot;. What a supporting cast she has to play opposite her!! The legendary Mickey Spillane in a rare acting role as her attorney!! Scream queen Brinke Stevens as her half-sister!! Jason Miller (Father Karras from &quot;The Exorcist&quot;) as the police detective investigating the sinister goings-on and Majel (&quot;Star Trek&quot;'s Nurse Christine Chapel) Barrett as an unfortunate schoolteacher. The film also has a very wicked sense of humor and could certainly be considered as a very black comedy much more than as a horror film. It benefits tremendously from it's use of on-location filming and authentic details such as the inclusion of actual local businesses in writer/executive producer/director Max Allan Collins's hometown of Muscatine, Iowa. It is a real pity that it was never even considered for a theatrical release, but was primarily made for the home video/cable markets. The film makes great use of it's low-budget and exceptionally talented cast and very rarely has the look or feel of a low-budget film. Kudos to both Max Allan Collins and Patty McCormack as they combined their exceptional talents to make this film and it's equally good (and maybe even better!!) sequel true classics. Don't miss either one of them!!"},{"Title":"MOMMY","review":"It's great to see Patty McCormick back in her most unforgetable role, the little girl from The Bad Seed!

This was the movie that showed me you can make a decent, quality movie on video.

Watch this!"},{"Title":"MOMMY","review":"&quot;Mommy&quot; is an entertaining lesser known flick that is full of great acting and ambience. The acting by McCormack, Stevens, and the little girl was really good. McCormack was a joy to watch as the psychopathic &quot;mommy&quot;. I also liked the low lighting, and realistic treatment of the tale, as well as the hispanic Sherriff. The janitor provided some comic relief, too funny when she says &quot;yes'm&quot;. A winner."},{"Title":"MOMMY","review":"The straight-forward, no-nonsense approach that serves Mr. Collins so well in his novels works just as effectively for his movie work, at least as demonstrated in &quot;Mommy&quot;. This modest thriller doesn't try to wow you with flashy cutting, a pulse-pounding soundtrack, and other gimmicks, but rather draws you in with extremely solid acting, photography, and direction, as well as a decent story. Much care was also lavished on the DVD release, as it is clear Mr. Collins wanted to take advantage of the capabilities of this soon-to-be-dominant home-viewing medium. I especially liked the running commentary, where writer/director Collins seemed to re-assemble everyone except the on-site caterer to share anecdotes about the fun and challenges of putting together a movie in a rural Iowa setting not used to hosting many such productions. I also enjoyed the fact that the folks featured in the commentary were clearly all capable professionals, yet at the same time had almost a childlike giddiness about how they pulled off a particular shot, how an actor got an expression just right, where they got the new Cadillac to use as &quot;Mommy's&quot; car, and endless other little details. So, in short, this a both a fun movie and a fun DVD. I'm looking forward to checking out the sequel, which I understand is more of a straight mystery story than the thriller/character study/black comedy that is this first entertaining installment."},{"Title":"MOMMY","review":"Sounds like the person commenting above has a personal issue with someone in this movie. The ratings/review are supposed to be honest so that people can decide on whether to buy this movie not slam it unnecessarily......how sad to use this area in such a biased manner!

I was all set for yet one more dreadful disaster. Well, I got quite a surprise! This is a well done effort, especially considering it's budget constraints. Patty McCormack (Rhoda from the Bad Seed!) is perrrfectly eeevil as MOMMY. She has finally found the right follow-up to her original sociopathic kid role. Here we have Ms. McCormack seething, plotting, and ultimately killing anyone who dares to cross her! Rachel Lemieux plays her young daughter with innocence and realism. Jason Miller (Father Karas from The Exorcist!) is the cop who believes he knows what MOMMY is up to. Even Majel Barrett (Mrs. Star Trek herself!) plays a teacher, and Mickey Spillane is MOMMY's attorney! Oh yeah, and Brinke Stevens is more than just a pretty face as MOMMY's sister! MOMMY is a nice chiller / thriller w/ enough dark humor to raise a wicked smile on my face. Highly recommended..."},{"Title":"MOMMY","review":"Psycho moms are fun.

This audio production had me on the edge of my seat since tape one started rolling. &quot;Mommy&quot; is a suspense filled story about a loving mother who shall we say, wants nothing more then to do whats right for her daughter not to mention for herself. The story begins with an innocent visit to Jessica Anne's school by her devoted mother. As soon as mommy meets up with Jessica Anne's teacher and has a slight disagreement with her, the horror begins and doesn't stop till the very end. This is a story of motherly love, a daughter's affection and about the special bond between a mother and daughter, even though at times such a bond can take on dark connotations. After all, there is nothing a mother wouldn't do for a daughter such as Jessica Anne. Listening to this production one thinks of another special mommy who caused a lot of campers to retire rather early shall we say; indeed if that mommy and this mommy got together for tea, well what a truly horrifying scene that would be. Sunset productions did a great job with this story; the reader was good and gave the right amount of tention and suspense where it was needed. in addition the music and sound effects which are heard along with the reader make this production one you will want to listen over and over again, but do not let mommy catch you reading in the middle of the night, it can prove to be deadly."},{"Title":"MOMMY","review":"Hearing about this movie, I looked for it first in the horror section of blockbuster.

That underlying paradox provides the premise of this connected set of short stories. He travels the world at intervals, surveying the realm of unreason on each trip, and taking satisfaction in watching it shrink. Where he can, he applies his subtle magic in support of Reason's expanding domain.Brunner explores Chaos's control and degradation of humankind in several of its ways. The first story tweaks mindless religion. It might even show how one can choose atheism, after encountering a god face to face and finding him unworthy of belief. Another of these gentle stories undermines magical thinking - again, not because it fails, but because its success is not worth having. And so with the faith in luck that makes Las Vegas the holy city of Chance, and so the unwarranted sense of entitlement that demands ever-richer result for ever-poorer effort at earning it, and so for blind pursuit of power irrespective of the cost or of who pays it. Since these stories are built around layers of paradox, Brunner's mechanism is itself a paradox, the smallest of magics to achieve the largest of consequences.Brunner was one of the best SF writers of the 70s and 80s, author of \\"Shockwave Rider\\" and other stories of chilling prescience. Among all of his writings, though, \\"Traveller in Black\\" may be his finest and most under-stated, under-rated achievements. These stories have held up well over the thirty years since they were written; since they pass in a distant place and age, there is little in them that can look dated. I recommend these stories to any thinking reader.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Compleat Traveller in Black (Collier Nucleus Science Fiction)","review":"If you know John Brunner's other work, well, this isn't like that. Traveller in Black is a collection of several mid-length stories that fit together in a progression. The nameless eponymous traveller, an agent of order, goes about imprisoning various chaotic entities and granting certain wishes. This works on several levels to give you allegories for the unexamined life, as well as a gripping adventure yarn.In some ways, this book is a bookend to Larry Niven's &quot;The Magic Goes Away&quot; (and various sequels, etc.). The flavor and style is similar, although this book is very different. In any event, this is one of those touchstone books of fantasy: you'll see where other writers (including Niven's works cited above!) have &quot;borrowed&quot; some of the dazzling images in Brunner's classic. This gem is a great read and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Compleat Traveller in Black (Collier Nucleus Science Fiction)","review":"Very sadly long out of print, it's well worth it to track a copy down... An overlooked classic."},{"Title":"The Compleat Traveller in Black (Collier Nucleus Science Fiction)","review":"Although I've read some of Brunner's SF, I had not heard of this book until I started playing the White Wolf RPG game Exalted. That book lists The Compleat Traveller in Black as an inspiration, and so, even though it is out of print, I was inspired to eventually find a copy of this book and read it.It feels very much like some of Moorcock's Melnibonean work. The world is young, and still in many ways in the grip of the elder era of Chaos. The laws of science, logic and reason are still not in full evidence, with the laws of magic and chaos still trying to hold their ground.Enter into this realm the Traveller in Black. The Compleat Traveller in Black collects a number of stories Brunner wrote about a mysterious figure who works for Order and reason. In Moorcock terms, he is a definite champion for Law. The traveler encounters forces of elemental chaos, and by actions both subtle and gross, by himself and through sometimes unwitting accomplices,works to impose reason on the world. He often does this by granting wishes. One to a customer, but the results are not often what the wisher expects. Sometimes, not even the Traveler himself is fully aware of the consequences of the wishes...The stories have a unity of voice and vision even though they were written over a period of twenty years. The traveler is a character difficult to get to know, but we get an interesting portrait of him and the world he is helping fashion. We see through the stories how his actions shape the world around him, diminishing its magic, increasing its stability. And indeed, in the end, he creates a world that not only does not need him, but is positively opposed to his further existence.I found this an interesting counterpoint to Vance's Dying Earth, set at the opposite end of time. I think the Dying Earth is a better realized milieu, overall, but certainly, many fantasy fans will enjoy this look at the morning of the world by Brunner."},{"Title":"The Compleat Traveller in Black (Collier Nucleus Science Fiction)","review":"The Traveler in Black is a collection of stories that span the great transition from a world of magic, chaos, and random chance to a world of law and natural order. The Traveler is tasked with facilitating this transformation, yet is constrained to bring it about through the agency of human action - by empowering wishes. There's a saying that the gods curse us by answering our prayers, and there's a certain amount of ironic justice in these tales. Who he is, why he does what he does is the mystery underlying the larger story, one that comes to a fitting conclusion in the last story.

But that fly knows more than Sam could ever imagine.Meanwhile, an army in the state of Vermia in another world called Aurobon prepares for war against humans on earth. Their weapon: a virus to be spread by mosquitoes. As they refine their technique, word comes that \\"the Dreamwalker\\" has been found --- and that she has a son.

Pain stabs his neck, and then everything goes black.He awakens to nighttime in a strange landscape, marshlands lit with blue-green light. Confused and frightened, he walks toward distant city lights. But his travels are disrupted by a horrendous encounter with a slavering pack of creatures like no one has seen on Earth. The crazed beasts are intent on killing him. Sam realizes he will surely die, but then a group of soldiers appears. His relief is short-lived, however, when the soldiers act like he's a criminal, violently hauling him off to prison. What is going on?Vermia's enemy state is called Vahlzi, and the army is led by Commander Firebrand. Realizing the Dreamwalker's son has been kidnapped by Vermia, Firebrand decides to send a rescuer, Skipper, who is his best pilot despite her young age.In prison, Sam meets Skipper who gives him hope of escape. Looking through the window of his cell, he sees three moons and realizes he's in a whole new world. When Sam learns the truth behind his plight, he's shocked. He must fight the evil that seeks to destroy Earth's humans. Meanwhile, his damaged body on Earth remains in a coma.This original book is filled with ideas I found myself discussing repeatedly with family and friends. In the midst of an urgent plot fueled by a dangerous mission, we find humor, a gutsy female role model, friendship, family relationships, questions about the guardianship of Earth and the balance of nature --- plus a subtle, thrilling celebration of life itself.

He's also amazed, and slightly freaked out, that his fascination seems to be reciprocal. Insects follow him everywhere. They never hurt him, though, until the day he sees a strange cloud of wasps, feels a sting on his neck, and blacks out. The next thing he knows, Sam is in a strange marsh in the middle of nowhere, in the dead of night, and the only living souls around him are a pack of slavering dog-like creatures out for his blood.The action gets started in this book almost immediately, and it never stops. The story is told in alternating points of view of Sam, the leaders of two opposing militaries on the planet Sam has been swept to, and Sam's mother, who is the Dreamwalker of the book's title.There are some truly hideous villains in this book, and Sam is knocked around brutally. He's a very strong protagonist, though, and so is the young girl who is sent to rescue him by the leader of the non-evil army. Skipper is a crack pilot of one of the most unusual flying \\"machines\\" you will ever read about in a fantasy.There are a lot of insects in this book--the whole story is based around them. If you find the very thought of bugs repugnant, you might not enjoy this book. But since this book is primarily geared to adolescent boys, I don't think that will be a problem for them at all. I think they will love this book. The dynamic female character in the book will make it enjoyable for girls as well.For parents: This book has no sex, drugs, or alcohol, and no bad language.

The chapters in this book stem from a series of newspaper columns that the author wrote for a newspaper in The Netherlands, thus the style is easy to read and the content is relevant.While there is much in this book to recommend, one of the big pluses for this reader was the clear delineation of the differences between Geert Hofstede and Fons Trompenaars. One gets a chance to recognize the contributions of Hofstede and at the same time to see his limitations. While there is a certain amount of acrimony in this discussion, one still comes away with an understanding of the evolution and applicability the dimensions of Trompenaars and why they have surfaced to the top.What is different about this book from the basic Trompenaars/Hampden-Turner readers is that he addresses key issues such as: leadership; matching values; globalization; diversity; people; functions; corporate culture, identity, and change; and the dilemmas to be addressed in globalizing organizations. And in each of these section he iterates the need and provides the basis for the reconciliation of dilemmas.The chapters are full of practical examples from real situations involving real people. The author has a way of presenting a dilemma, explaining the paths to its reconciliation, andproviding documental anecdotes that illustrate successes.Early in the text, the author discusses the terrorism that the world and particularly the US is faced with. While not providing solutions, he does make a powerful case for the utilization of reconciliation techniques in order to best understand and perhaps work with these dilemmas. It is a powerful section of the book.For the ease of its readability, its potent substance, and its direct and insightful learnings, this book is a must for one's professional library."},{"Title":"Did the Pedestrian Die: Insights from the World's Greatest Culture Guru","review":"I have always found culture and textbooks on culture a difficult subject to get in to.

He lacks a structure or overall theme, in my opinion. He provides personal vignettes about cultures in different countries but no original statistics to back up his claims. He provides useless maxims about the need to make companies more international and to understand that cultures differ between countries (duh).The author seems very impressed with himself, quoting attendees from his workshops and mentioning several times that over 20,000 \\"international managers\\" have attended his lectures. He even has the audacity in the book's title to call himself \\"the world's greatest culture guru.\\" He seems to think that we are pliable disciplines that hang on his every word even if he lacks structure, themes and statistics.My impression is that other reviewers that liked this book had first read other earlier works by this author. Those earlier books may have established the author's reputation. And this book was a sequel that groupees want to read. Not me. I do not think that this book will establish anyone's reputation. It feels disorganized, subjective and lightweight.

Damask Aldon comes to Goose Creek, Pennsylvania, with her brother and sister to live with their Aunt Ada. Once they arrive, they find out that Ada has died. In her will, Ada gives the inn to the Aldon siblings--and Braden Franklin. Braden grew up poor and ridiculed in Goose Creek, left the town and made good while he was away. Now he wants to show everyone in the town just how wealthy he has become. He opens a department store--the first in the town-- and gets engaged to the town's spoiled beauty. Now all he needs is the perfect mansion to make his life complete. He wants to build the mansion on the site of the inn. Damask will have none of this, and the battle of wills ensues. Braden has to figure out what he really wants, and the rest of the townspeople must deal with their own problems. Goose Creek is a nicely portrayed town with several secondary love stories happening alongside the main one. A touch of the supernatural is icing on the cake. A most entertaining night's read."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Eastern Europe","review":"I recently lived in Bulgaria for several years, and can attest to the relative accuracy of the Bulgarian section of this book. However, it presents a somewhat abbreviated picture, as the inclusion of so many countries in one book means that some chapters are unavoidably short. For example, Bulgaria is chock-full of great restaurants (both in the capital Sofia, and in more picturesque resort towns such as Bansko) but only a disappointingly small fraction are mentioned here. On the other hand, this book DOES include Albania (approximately 40 pages -- quite impressive), a country with admittedly little tourism but where such a guide is worth its weight in gold. If you'll be spending long periods in one country where a decent, individual country guide exists (such as the superb Rough Guide to Bulgaria, which served as my constant travel companion and which I highly recommend), you may want to consider buying that country's guide. But if you're traveling extensively around the region, or visiting otherwise less well-documented travel destinations such as Albania, this book fits the bill."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Eastern Europe","review":"We purchased this book before going to three of the countries covered, because there are so few books that cover Eastern Europe as a whole.Although the information was limited, we found it helpful in general terms. It also whetted my appetite for going to the other countries in the book!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Eastern Europe","review":"I can only speak for the Yugoslav section in this book, since it is the country I am most acquainted with.Generally speaking, the LP team did an excellent job researching Beograd, but information on the rest of the country is poor. They don't mention a thing about Serbian institutions like Studenica monastery; they omit everything about the Fruska Gora and there's not even a word on the charming town of Sremski Karlovci.I wonder whether the information on the other countries is equally poor. If that is the case, I'd rather tour the region on my own without any book at all.However, one improvement with respect to the previous edition is they are now including Kotor (But Ulcinj is not so much recommended as before, which I don't know why since the beaches are much better than in Budva).With regards to Novi Sad, their suggestions are very poor, even in what concerns to lodging. My recommendations are: add the Fruska Gora, Srem Karlovci, Raska and probably Nis."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Eastern Europe","review":"I'm going to be a first-time Eastern Europe traveler this summer. However, I have travelled extensively and one of the first things I look for in a travel book is a book that offers information on all aspects of a country. For example, I felt the information on countries like Yugoslavia and Macedonia was a little abbreviated. There are some people out there who would actually like to do an &quot;off-the-beaten-path&quot; trip in those countries and Lonely Planet wasn't able to help me plan for this. The information on Greece was definitely helpful, but for those who plan to travel on their islands, I'd recommend Lonely Planet's Greek Islands which had exactly the right amount of information I needed to make my travels there worthwhile!"},{"Title":"Six existentialist thinkers (The Academy Library)","review":"Blackham offers a clear, concise, and well-written introduction to the often difficult works of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Sartre, Jaspers, and Marcel. He summarizes objectively, with no interpretation to suit his beliefs, but gives criticism which shows the weaknesses of their individual thought.At the end, he gives an overview of the existential philosophy. The tension between consciousness and Being, a mystery which cannot be defined, yet is the reality of humankind, is the preoccupation of these philosophers, as philosophy's attempt to rationalize the universe, eradicating being, has tottered and now crumbled.In brief, this is a helpful guide to works that can be cryptic or impenetrable.

Our website is at www.CitSov.org. Here's why I joined the effort.The Citizen Sovereignty Act, a two-part legislative proposal detailed in Voting With Dollars, would invigorate citizen involvement in politics and remedy cynicism about campaign fundraising.The Act would fundamentally reform federal campaign fundraising by extending voters the use of automated teller machines for publicly funded campaign contributions of \\"Patriot dollars,\\" and; by rendering private campaign contributions anonymous, mimicking the secret ballot as a safeguard to the integrity of the political process.A major benefit of these innovations is to allow a substantial increase in campaign contribution limits and associated free speech. Other, more incremental efforts to reform federal campaign finance fall short of the Citizen Sovereignty Act.* The Act eliminates the sale of political access for political funds while increasing the funding and opportunity for free speech.* The Act redirects the permanent campaign of political fund-raising toward all the nation's voters and away from the one-half of one percent who today make half of all contributions.* By potentially involving every American in political fund-raising, the Act increases voter participation on Election Day.Voting With Dollars details the Act and how it satisfies constitutional requirements. A model statute provides a concrete basis for an effort to restore faith in Congress and the Executive Branch.Read Voting With Dollars. Take a look at www.CitSov.org. Get involved in making it possible for everyone to participate in the money primary of American politics."},{"Title":"Voting with Dollars: A New Paradigm for Campaign Finance","review":"Voting With Dollars was a book that seemed interesting after reading The 2% Solution by Matthew Miller. Bruce Ackerman and Ian Ayres talks about the strong influence of money in politics and how we as citizens, can take back our politicians away from corporations (PACs, lobbyist, etc). Since money talks and BS walks, they have introduced the \\"patriot dollars\\" concept. This \\"dollar\\" allow us to give money to people who would normally not run for office because of the price tag of getting into office. We are still able to use these dollars for a Democrat or a Republican, but the option of helping a third party is made available. Ackerman and Ayres follow up the \\"patriot dollar\\" with their \\"secret donation booth.\\" This can be accessed through any ATM (which should be readily available in America). The \\"secret donation booth\\" is designed to limit the influence of wealthy donors (they are not proposing donation limits). By doing that, politicians are more focused on what the general public needs, not what \\"special interest\\" need. They readily admit that money will always be involved in political office but their goal is to minimize the influence of large rich donors and increase the influence of \\"average\\" citizens. Excerpt from their book: \\"Short of the abolition of free markets and private property, there is simply no way to eliminate the influence of private money on democratic politics-and to paraphrase Madison, surely this cure is far worse than the disease.\\" As for disliking the book or a negative feedback, I can't think of one because it has not been implemented. Every election cycle, we talk about campaign finance reform and still nothing happens. When a reform is suggested, lawyers find loopholes and exploit it. Ackerman and Ayres go through every possible loophole in their proposal and explain what can be done to make their proposal viable. Just as important, their proposal is Constitutionally sound."},{"Title":"Voting with Dollars: A New Paradigm for Campaign Finance","review":"The biggest problem facing Americans is this: Their government officials are bought and sold like commodities. You vote, sure, but wealthy interests vote many times more.Public financing, as it is presented in Voting With Dollars can work. I'm not sure about the anonymous component, but it is quite deliberate in manner. Sure, it is a little bit dry and some portions hard to get through but the idea is money."},{"Title":"Voting with Dollars: A New Paradigm for Campaign Finance","review":"An alternative approach proposed in this book is novel. The idea that campaign funding should be taken over by the citizens. As for the government campaign funds, the citizens should be in control to divert that money the best way they deem fit. Each citizen with a $50 government issued ATM directs their share of the funds to a political party or a candidate of their choice, and all this is done anonymously. If the recipients of these funds do not know who gave it to them (other than it generally came from the citizenry), then the need for special interests and political paybacks will not arise. Perfect! right? Yes, at least in theory it is.Practically it wouldn't work. Because such a change would require congressional passage, and common sense dictates that no politician will vote for such suicidal career killing bill. Special interests unfortunately have created a very influencial industry with epic powers to make or break politicians. He who has the deepest campaign finance pockets has most power, and congress will most likely never vote for a bill that eliminates lobbyists and special interests. They will all tell you it's a vice, but it's a vice they do not want to eliminate.To correlate an example: Would a police officer or a criminal justice official wish for less crime? Yes and no. Yes, in the sense that it makes society safer, and no because - in a twisted way - crime creates jobs, opportunities and (like it or not) it makes colorful and distinguished careers.In theory, we are the government of the people, for the people and by the people. But the prestige of power doesn't lie with the citizenry (even though our civic and history books lament as such). It rests with the politicians and with that, it extends to big oil, wall street, insurance industry etc. Our democracy is by far way ahead of most other jurisdictions around the world, but it is safe to say that the current US campaign financing has ultimately corrupted that democracy.In 2010 the Supreme Court extended the 1st Amendment rights to Corporate America in the sense that they too couldn't be prohibited by Congress for their association and engagement in political speech. Which simply translates \\"that the flood-gates that had prevented them from flooding Washington with money are now open.\\" I'm not a lawyer, but conventional wisdom tells me that the 1st Amendment wasn't created for Corporations, but for the human citizens, in the hope that they couldn't be prosecuted or persecuted for their political beliefs and speeches. Corporate speech and human speech are a complete antithesis. The recognition of Corporate speech as human speech is essentially selling access to the halls of power.I have never called a congressional office in DC, but I guess it would take weeks if not months for my congresswoman to get back to me. But Merrill Lynch or Goldman Sachs would have theirs returned in minutes, because access to power is sold to the highest bidder, and as such, it is an illusion to think that the power is with the people: by, for, of the people or any other colorful mirages in the civic books.I'm not really sure how this can be rectified. How do you rectify a system that has 'worked' for centuries? After all we are all humans and we make grave mistakes. Maybe eliminate campaign financing altogether? Free TV and radio spots, free newspaper ads? Cut Congress time into half with half the pay? And so I finish where I started, with just good ideas that look good on paper but will never pass Congressional floor."},{"Title":"Endymion Omnibus","review":"in some respects even better than 'hyperion'. though not as challenging a read. something akin to the wizard of oz.

Will shave years off the average Photoshop learning curve. The book allows the student to really see the true power and depth of the program, as well as introduction to special effects. All the matrial is presented in a light fun manner, by the books author. The down side is that the files are not always where there supposed to be or what they're supposed to be, but that's true of most of the lesson books from this publisher. At least this book has most the files even if they're not in the right folder, try the other folders and they'll turn up. There are also several Web sites and resources mentioned in the book that are helpful, including the author's Web site(where he features tutorials described in the book) Definately a great tool for learning Photoshop and there are also resources in the that offer guidance on where more advanced skills can be aquired.

It gets you start using Photoshop quickly, but if you want to go to a more of an advance level, you will need another book."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Adobe(R) Photoshop(R) 5 in 21 Days","review":"This is a very disappointing book and not recommended for someone who has not worked with previous versions of Photoshop, or anyone who is easily frustrated by poorly presented information. Although Mr. Clark appears to be knowledgeable about the content, he and his editor were very careless about the development of many of the lessons. Topics do no flow in a logical progression. References are made to tools or techniques that have not been covered in earlier lessons. References to tools are not easy to follow and are not supported through repetition or consistent visual clues. Several demonstrations are made without file references which makes it very difficult for the reader to follow along. Some files are in the wrong folders, some are missing and others are defective. There is a great deal of useful information in the book, but it was obviously rushed to press before it was ready for publication."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Adobe(R) Photoshop(R) 5 in 21 Days","review":"The book is very good as a brief introduction to PhotoShop, however if you are seriously involved into graphic design, you will need a lot more information.

I was wowed by this book. I finally understood why someone like me, who has a love of beauty but also has a need for quiet, introspective time (as a parent of children with disabilities) would want to really come forward and express myself. Put me under the heading of \\"Beading for Healing\\". The author, Deborah Cannarella, has a chapter titled that. Yes, put me there, and put this book in your cart if you wish to understand why you are doing what you do when you bead. It is a beautiful book in every sense of the word, anyway. Lovely photos, moving stories from the artists, and inspiring projects. I am grateful I chose this book as one of my New Year's gifts to myself."},{"Title":"Beading for the Soul: Inspired Designs From 23 Contemporary Artists","review":"Some artists derive simple pleasure from their beadwork; others find a much deeper meaning in the craft. In Beading for the Soul, you will find not only a fine selection of beautiful beaded projects to make, you'll also discover ways to infuse your creations with depth and spiritual substance.You will also gain from the insight offered by the contributing artists, who share the personal experiences, emotions and thought processes that support their creations.For instance, a visit to an anthropology museum in Peru led artist Susan Guagliumi on a quest to make a \\"votive offering\\" to her craft: a mesh bag with an ancient cat motif. Other artists work through health issues, celebrate our environment, harness energy, and reconnect with their faith through beadwork."},{"Title":"Beading for the Soul: Inspired Designs From 23 Contemporary Artists","review":"Just received this book yesterday and can barely put it down.

Honestly though, I'm just in awe of the gorgeous work in this book.It's not really a book for beginners,there is an appendix in the back that explains techniques, but a lot of the projects are a bit advanced, and laid out as guidelines, not finished projects, there are a lot of techniques and ideas in this book, I was absolutely stunned and inspired by Julia Pretl's gorgeously embroidered Heirloom Cube.I'm thrilled with this book."},{"Title":"Beading for the Soul: Inspired Designs From 23 Contemporary Artists","review":"Since I bead and find the process very meditative, this book sounded like an excellent choice.

Obviously, if the verbal standarized test section is difficult for native speakers, it is even worse for international students whose primary languge is not English.I find this book to be very user-friendly, it is not a list of words with definitions that a student must memorize as in Princeton's or Barron's verbal SAT review. Simon's Saga uses those difficult words in everyday context so that the reader slowly incorporates those words to his/her vocabulary and to understand the context in which they can be used. Standarized test do not test if you remember the definition of a word, rather it tests your ability to play with the words. This book, therefore, is suited for that purpose."},{"Title":"Simon's Saga for the SAT I Verbal","review":"We've all heard that practice makes perfect. And it's true -- except in the life of a student. For most students, anything even remotely resembling systematic practice seems to be automatically put into one category: BORING.Simon's Saga for the SAT I Verbal uses storytelling to introduce SAT words to students without making it seem like a chore. It gives them a familiar context in which to understand the words, as well as exercises to later reinforce this comprehension. The author gives us an irresistible tongue-in-cheek take on college life and its \`infinite' possibilities, while at the same time slipping in issues and concepts that appear in SAT reading passages. To make sure the words really sink in, important SAT words are regularly repeated.I don't know of any other prep guide that teaches students what they need to know in such a creative way. My students enjoy it, and I recommend it to any student looking for an interesting way to get ready for the SAT."},{"Title":"Simon's Saga for the SAT I Verbal","review":"This book is a great way to increase your SAT verbal score. The book is divided in to 37 chapters. Each chapter is about 4 pages long and has around 20 vocab words that are in bold.

After that is a review consisting of fill-in-the-bank, matching, True/False, and mutiple choice questions involving the 20 vocab words. I found learning the words in context easier than memorizing word lists. The exercises also helped me remember more words. The story isn't half-bad either, until about three-quarters of the way in. Then it got a little boring, but overall I enjoyed using this book as a tool to improve my verbal score."},{"Title":"Simon's Saga for the SAT I Verbal","review":"I used to fear the long list of words which are given in any other books for Standardized Test.

The approach is unusual, to say the least. On one level it's a fun story, but on another level it's a hilarious spoof on some interesting topics such as boy-girl relationships, the arts, creative writing, and education. Simon, the narrator, draws students in with his easy and open tone and students enjoy the witty repartee between the characters. Before they know it, they're thinking about political and other issues from new perspectives. A book that does this and boosts word power? Yes, indeed.Simon's Saga engenders lively class discussions on important topics that today's intelligent students are thinking about -America's role in the world, the effects of globalization, the role of the media, stereotyping of people, changing values, and cultural identity. This is the type of thinking students need to do to get a good score on the critical reading section of the new SAT.The book is packed with first-rate exercises that educate as they reinforce the SAT words. Cleverly, the author has made the exercises part of the story. My students look forward to answering the questions for Simply Simon and Axel Speaks that come at the end of each funny episode. I strongly recommend this book for all high school students preparing for the SAT and for classroom use by high school English teachers.

Nothing I've found mentions the weird 'twist' the story has.Basically, the world is infested by aliens and Simon has to murder 'the controller.' It's really, really odd. For a book about the SAT, it doesn't really make sense to have such a weird plot. It's not a novel, it's a freaking study guide! Besides, it advertises itself as a story about college life and mentions nothing about cracking open heads on sidewalks.END SPOILERS.Frankly, the tone of the author got annoying to me, fast.

The author has a very clear writing style--it's evident that he writes to help people to understand the subject, and not to show off his knowledge. The examples illustrating various principles are easy to understand, especially the ones used to illustrate adjoints, arguably one of the more difficult concepts in category theory.

However, I can say, with absolute confidence, that if you do the problems you will learn.Most everything I've seen on category theory is a confusing mixture of different notations with seemingly identical meanings (but in fact the meanings are totally different). This book is no exception. Often, I have resorted to IRC to sort things out when some notation is simply impenetrable to me. My mathematical training stopped at complex calculus, so this may not apply to you if you've had abstract algebra or something a little more 'meta'.There seems to be one typographical error, but I am not sure. In the example on the adjunction between products and exponentiation, the right adjoint is listed as \\"(_)^A x A\\" but in the diagrams it ends up as \\"(_)^A\\".

The author spends over 100 pages of the 158 page book recounting his experience at the home of Cynthia Dartman, a voluptuos widow living with a saucy Maid Lucy, and two young delinquent daughters ...At the suggestion of his respected professor a young Frank is basically blackmailed by the wily Mrs Datrman to take the job of a ttor and also, here's the yummie part, disciplinarian of the household.What I really like about this book is that the author writes the story of the spankings being more an erotic foreplay to normal sexual liasons rather than the 'razon de'tre' of the story. Some erotic spanking novels published today are nothng but S&M; volumes that only dedicate themselves to, ususally, young girls getting the living daylights beat out of them.Although they do have their purpose in erotica they certainly aren't the kinds of books that I personally enjoy.This is one of the better novels written, and even thought I thought the best part was Franks experience with Lucy and Mrs Dartman I do recommend it highly as a certain Victorian classic ....."},{"Title":"Jet navigator,: Strategic Air Command","review":"Follows the journey of an Air Force Officer who washed out of pilot training, but ended up as a navigator.

I found that if you stick with the relaxation teckneques and only one of their meditation methods consistantly every day, I have had better results."},{"Title":"Have an Out-of-Body Experience in 30 Days: The Free Flight Program (30-Day Higher Consciousness)","review":"Yes, I own two books by these two authors. This one and Lucid Dreams in 30 Days: The Creative Sleep Program. But my review now is for this book. I haven't yet fully read the other to give a detailed review. And on the subject of out-of-body experiences or astral projections I have 2 books, this one and Astral Projection for Beginners by Edain McCoy.Compared to Astral Projection for Beginners, this book is a shorter and more concise read, 94 pages versus APFB's 222 pages so one could read this book in the span of an afternoon. However the way this book is structured, its not meant to be read that way. The book is divided in 4 chapters which are the weeks of the Free Flight Program described in it. Each chapter is divided in seven subsections meant to be read one each day. So if you followed that formula, you'd read the whole book in 30 days. But the book does tell you not to take it all in a span shorter than a day. My opinion is you can read it all in the span of a day, but not practice all the techniques in the span of a day. It also teaches a critical technique called Alert Relaxation, which the body is deeply relaxed yet the mind is acutely alert. I know this technique has been used by stress researcher and sports psychologists for many years. You can find the instructions for utilizing this technique on page 6. But unlike Astral Projection for Beginners which teaches 6 different techniques for astral projection, this teaches only 1. But you are free to modify that technique to fit your needs.Now, I'm not saying one book is better than the other. In my eyes, both Have an Out-of-Body Experience in 30 Days and Astral Projection for Beginners are equal. Each book fits the needs of two types of people. If you are a very busy person with a very active lifestyle, I'd suggest this book. But if you are a very spiritual and more relaxed person who can make time in your daily schedule, I'd suggest going with Astral Projection for Beginners."},{"Title":"Have an Out-of-Body Experience in 30 Days: The Free Flight Program (30-Day Higher Consciousness)","review":"I have my own collection of books on the subject, an this one is way the worst.

Once the basic technique of &quot;alert relaxation&quot; is mastered, they show you how to use it to go into many different states of mind, from out of body experiences to lucid dreams to more focused states of enhanced memory and learning. It is a simple method, with special variations for each situation, and it is effective. This book is my favorite on out of body experiences. There are a lot of exercises but you can take as long as you want to do them. I worked with this book for months and also did many of the exercises more than once. I had several different kinds of out of body experiences, and continue to have them. I think this is the best how-to book on the subject because of the way it is organized, and especially because the authors do not try to impose a religious philosophy on the exercises or the experience, but instead bring the subject down to earth. And because the methods work."},{"Title":"Have an Out-of-Body Experience in 30 Days: The Free Flight Program (30-Day Higher Consciousness)","review":"I have been studying and exploring altered states for many years and find this wonderful little book to be the best on the subject of out of body experiences. The deceptively simple exercises are presented in a sensible and easy to follow format and really work. In my experience using these exercises and sharing them with friends and family, different exercises appeal to different people more than others (everyone has their favorite) but there are enough techniques presented that everyone finds their way and the results are great. I like the fact that the authors do what they say in presenting a sensible handbook of practical exercises rather than a lot of bogus mumbo jumbo. Anyone looking for phony promises or easy answers about the meaning of life should look elsewhere. The book is also clear in suggesting additional references for people who want to learn more about the lab research, including the groundbreaking experiments done by one of the authors. Anyone looking for an honest handbook presenting serious exercises for those willing to make the effort to have an out of body experience should look no further. This one is definitely the best."},{"Title":"Have an Out-of-Body Experience in 30 Days: The Free Flight Program (30-Day Higher Consciousness)","review":"Finally I've found a book that gives a clear, concise description about how to have an out-of-the-body experience. I have read many books in parapsychology that drone on with endless proofs that are supposed to make me &quot;believe&quot; in psychic perceptions, but this book helps you to have your own experience. To me, the ultimate test is my own experience. For anyone who wants to do it themselves and not just read about it this book is far superior to anything else out there. I got the book after I saw Dr. Harary on the Larry King Show talking about his involvement with the Stargate project, research conducted by the CIA at Stanford Research Institute to study remote perception. It shows that the authors know what they're talking about. Five stars for this book."},{"Title":"Have an Out-of-Body Experience in 30 Days: The Free Flight Program (30-Day Higher Consciousness)","review":"What is immediately striking about Harary's and Weintraub's technique is its utter simplicity combined with a no-pressure, no-nonsense style. Whether you complete the course in 30 days or 30 months, the authors allow for a great deal of experimental latitude and, in taking note of individual styles and personal limitations, suggest ways for readers to adapt the program accordingly. The book, unlike some others on the subject, makes no extravagant claims or promises. It does not guarantee its readers subsequent enlightenment or increased &quot;mind powers&quot;. In fact, it is refreshingly devoid of all such occultist, New Age and sensationalistic overtones. In not espousing any sort of dogma or unwarranted conclusions, it has the integrity of allowing us our own interpretations. Many points of interest are covered throughout the book, but especially intriguing is a short piece at the end, describing how OBE's may be enhanced via the use of &quot;extended perception&quot;. (Also known as &quot;remote viewing&quot;, this ability is best known for it's use as an intelligence gathering tool during the Cold War.) It can also be explored as a method to help determine if your OBE's are objectively verifiable and toward this end, the authors suggest a number of easy and informal experiments. The book has the benefit and credibility of having been co-written by a researcher, Harary, who has studied the area for decades and was a researcher/participant in the groundbreaking Duke University studies. A bibliography for further reading is included. All in all, terrific -- extremely satisfying and worthwhile."},{"Title":"Have an Out-of-Body Experience in 30 Days: The Free Flight Program (30-Day Higher Consciousness)","review":"I have been having out of body experiences for a long time and have read lots of books, but this is still my favorite. The authors are careful not to color your experiences with their suggestions. Instead, they give you great tools that really work to explore and discover the fascinating world inside yourself. Also, the authors obviously know their stuff. Other books borrow from their discoveries and methods, but then go overboard in making extreme claims that can't be proven. The techniques in this book are tried and true, and based on scientific research. The authors still manage to keep a refreshing sense of humor and provide good, practical advice without talking down to the reader. This is the one to buy for the intelligent novice and also for those looking to learn more about OBEs. I would not recommend some of the other well known books on the subject, because they take their ideas from this solid, pioneering little book, and then add wild claims."},{"Title":"Have an Out-of-Body Experience in 30 Days: The Free Flight Program (30-Day Higher Consciousness)","review":"I read this book, which was the first of its kind, when it came out in 1989 and looked through it again recently before lending it to a friend. Fifteen years ago, because of several profound personal experiences (dreams I had which came true), I became interested in altered states of consciousness, including out-of-body experiences and lucid dreams. I had had several spontaneous lucid dreams but never an out-of-body experience. I was a faithful reader of Omni Magazine and was happy to find an article on out-of-body experiences by Dr. Keith Harary, who was a researcher and the subject of the famous out-of-body experiments conducted at Duke University in the early 1970's (in which animals seemed to sense Harary's presence when he &quot;left&quot; his body and visited them in a distant location). I did the exercises in the article and had my first out-of-body experience following the exercise in which you go out into the world &quot;blindfolded&quot; and experience everything through your non-visual senses. A friend had to go with me to guide me, and it did take us the better part of the day (unlike most of the exercises), but it was fun, and interesting - an experience I will always remember - and it worked! Not long after that article, Harary and Weintraub published Have an Out-of-Body Experience in 30 Days, which I read and really appreciated because it told me so much about what is known of the out-of-body experience, without trying to tell me what it means. For me, the biggest problem in sorting out the literature on this type of subject is the fact that nine times out of ten, the author will try to tell you his or her version of the meaning of life. It's not that this book left me with the sense that the experiences are not profound; on the contrary, it respected me enough to allow me to explore the experiences myself and draw my own conclusions from them."},{"Title":"Have an Out-of-Body Experience in 30 Days: The Free Flight Program (30-Day Higher Consciousness)","review":"I was a complete skeptic of this sort of phenomena, but I was also interested in finding out for myself.

I have travelled back in time to visit my late brother, I have had two out-of-the-body sexual encounters (which where awesome), and have travelled to several other countries.

I currently also read William Bulman's book Adventures out of the Body and was very pleased. It's more detailed, the exercises are easier to do, you don't have to spend as much time to do them. It's gonna be just a matter of time before I can have my first OOB experience.

I can't say that I was walking through walls, or travelling through space. However, by trying the ideas suggested in this book I began to have extremely lucid dreams. I was able to become fully awake and alert in the dream state, and that was liberating in and of itself. I had never been able to do that before, and, until it happened, I didn't believe it was really possible. By the way, it's a lot of fun, but nobody will believe you if you tell them about it the next day (as I'm sure most of you reading this probably won't). It is possible, but you also have to psych yourself up for it somewhat mentally and believe. Sad to say, but I'm still in the cradle compared with those who are buzzing around their neighborhoods.

Includes very practical advice on how to maximize your Mac's speed and performance in an efficient way. All the features of the Mac are explained for the functional user. My favorite part--at the end of the book, there is a whole reference section of web sites for shareware, freeware, tech support, buying online, hunting for graphics and fonts, gaming, etc. The sites are, according to the writers, the best on the web. When I visited some of these tech support sites, I appreciated this book even more--many of the site developers who were providing support online have terminated their services because they weren't getting the financial support they needed and they were devoting all their energy into helping other Mac users. This book is a wonderful reference; even advanced users will pick up some tips. Keep in mind that if you need some troubleshooting advice for a serious hardware problem, you're likely not to be able to get online at all where you can usually find the advice for free--that is if you can find someone kind enough to help.

Bill Gates's Microsoft was still a sub contractor to IBM, and Steve Jobs had left Apple and was spending his wilderness years trying to sell the ill-fated NeXt computer. The name on everybody's lips at the time was \\"James Martin\\" - the \`Guru of the Information Age'.Martin had an amazing influence in selling the IT industry the waterfall model of planning, detailed specification, build and test. From his seminal 1983 book entitled \\"An Information Systems Manifesto\\", through to his huge 1,000 page, three volume work \\"Information Engineering\\", he convinced many that the way forward was to carry out extensive strategic reviews and build comprehensive designs before starting any practical work - in other words he convinced many people that a Big Design Up-Front was a precondition for success.And now 30 years later, Martin has given away $150m of his fortune to his alma mater, Oxford University. He lives in luxury on his private island in the Caribbean, and is still writing books - adding to the over 100 that he has published over the last 50 years.Problems that the early users of these structured methods encountered were widely put down to two factors: one, the paper mountains of documentation that they generated and two, their tactical nature. The designs produced were criticized as only being specifications for individual software modules, without a grand view of the end-to-end system.Two solutions to the problems of BDUF were proposed by James Martin. First, in association with Texas Instruments Corporation, he developed a Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool called the Information Engineering Facility' (IEF) to record the detailed documentation and ensure that cross-references were automatically updated. Second he created a strategic method called Information Engineering to encourage analysts to document a whole organization in complex diagrams and designs which would be typed into the IEF tool.IEF fastidiously documented designs from strategy to detail, and then generated mainframe computer programs automatically from those details. Martin proclaimed that the end of the programmer was nigh!Alongside the IEF, Martin's big-scale, top down Information Engineering method required a detailed waterfall of analysis and design activities. There were five steps to Martin's waterfall: Information Strategy Planning (ISP), then Business Area Analysis (BAA), then System Design (SD), then Construction and finally Cutover (together known as CC). The initial phases of ISP and BAA would typically take months to complete, after which more experts would be drafted in to spend months, and sometimes years on SD. Many customers gave up at this stage, not having seen any practical output from this work. Others, who persevered, found that the resultant systems that were generated at the end of the process would only work on mainframes, not on the more efficient and flexible personal computers and mini-servers that were becoming available.The high point of CASE tools was in 1990. As IT departments re-mained fixated on use of mainframes, end-users became increasingly frustrated and started to buy and program PCs and mini-computers of their own. This revolution in end-user computing started to eat into IBM's revenues, so it attempted a last ditch attempt to lock customers into the dying mainframe technology. This new method was called AD/Cycle, and was the last significant attempt to create a waterfall structured method with an associated complex and expensive toolset. AD/Cycle was abandoned after just two years in 1992 and signaled the death of the Information Engineering approach.Although he had belatedly become interested in iterative develop-ment, Martin's voluminous writings on Rapid Application Development (RAD) only contained a few pages on the topics of prototyping and timeboxing which are vital for iterative development. In fact, worries about the usefulness of outputs from RAD developments were a prime motivator for the development of DSDM.In an influential paper, Beath and Orlowski noted that Information Engineering was ideological in nature, not evidence-based. They accused Martin of using a patronizing tone towards users who they say were \\"portrayed as nave, technically unsophisticated and parochial\\". They note that the amount of action expected of users in the analysis stages was actually only about 2%, far below the level of user participation and collaboration promised by the method.Many empirical studies conducted found either very little or no productivity improvement from the IE code generation process. Some research at the Ford Motor Company in the UK showed an 85% improvement in output when they switched from using SSADM paper specifications to using Information Engineering supported by the auto-mated IEF tool. However, it is not clear whether this was just due to the dumping of the old method rather than the adoption of the new method and tools. It was certainly much less than the 300% improvement that Ford was promised.

Published in 1859, \`On Liberty' is one of the primary political texts of the nineteenth century; perhaps only the writings of Marx had a similar impact, and of the two, in today's world, Mill's philosophy seems the one that is triumphant.One of the interesting ideas behind \`On Liberty' is that this may in fact be more the inspiration of Harriet Taylor (later Mrs. J.S. Mill) than of Mill himself; Taylor wrote an essay on Toleration, most likely in 1832, but it remained unpublished until after her death. F.A. Hayek (free-market economist and philosopher) noticed this connection. Whether this was the direct inspiration or not, the principles are similar, and the Mills were rather united in their views about liberty.\`On Liberty' is more of an extended essay than a book - it isn't very long (104 pages of the text in the Norton Critical Edition, edited by David Spitz). It relates as a political piece to his general Utilitarianism and political reform ideology. A laissez faire capitalist in political economy, his writing has been described as \`improved Adam Smith' and \`popularised Ricardo'. Perhaps it is in part the brevity of \`On Liberty' that gives it an enduring quality.There are five primary sections to the text. The introduction sets the stage philosophically and historically. He equates the histories of classical civilisations (Greece and Rome) with his contemporary England, stating that the struggle between liberty and authority is ever present and a primary feature of society. He does not hold with unbridled or unfettered democracy, either (contrary to some popular readings of his text) - he warns that the tyranny of the majority can be just as dangerous and damaging toward a society as any individual or oligarchic despotism. Mill looks for a liberty that permits individualism; thus, while democracy is an important feature for Mill, there must be a system of checks and balances that ensures individual liberties over and against this kind of system. All of these elements receive further development in subsequent sections.The second section of the text is \`Of the Liberty of Thought and Discussion'. Freedom of speech and expression is an important aspect here. Mill presents a somewhat radical proposition that even should the government and the people be in complete agreement with regard to coercive action, it would still be an illegitimate power. This is an important consideration in today's world, as governments and people contemplate the curtailment of civil liberties in favour of increased security needs. The possibility of fallibility, according to Mill, makes the power illegitimate, and (again according to Mill) it doesn't matter if it affects many or only a few, people today or posterity. It is still wrong. Mill develops this argument largely by using the history of religious ideas and religious institutions, in addition to the political (since the two were so often inter-related).The third section is perhaps the best known and most quoted, \`Of Individuality, as One of the Elements of Well-Being'. It is perhaps a natural consequence of Enlightenment thinking that individuality over communal and corporate identity would dominate. Our world today goes back and forth between individual and communal identities (nationality, regionality, employment, church affiliation, school affiliation, sports teams, etc.). Mill's ideas of individual are very modern, quite at home with the ideas of modern political and civil individuality, with all of the responsibilities.Mill states, \`No one pretends that actions should be as free as opinions.' He recognises the increased limitations on individual liberty given that we do live in communal settings, but this does not hinder the idea of individuality and individual liberty, particularly as it pertains to thoughts and speech. Mill explores various ideas of personal identity and action (medieval, Calvinist, etc.) to come up with an idea of individuality that is rather modern; of course, this is political personhood that pre-dates the advent of psychology/psychoanalytic theory that will give rise to a lot more confusion for the role of identity and personhood in society.The fourth primary section looks theoretically at the individual in community, \`Of the Limits to the Authority of Society Over the Individual'; the final section looks at specific applications. Mill discounts the idea of social contract while maintain that there is a mutual responsibility between individuals and community. Mill looks at the Temperance movements and laws as an example of bad laws (not only from the aspect of curtailment of liberty, but also for impractical aspects of enforcement); in similar examples, Mill looks at the role of society in regulating the life of the individual, calling on good government to always err on the side of the individual.Mill puts it very directly -- Individuals are accountable only to themselves, unless their actions concern the interests of society at large. Few in the Western world would argue with this today; however, we still live in a world where \`thought police' are feared, and \`political correctness' is debated as appropriate or not with regard to individual liberties.Mill wrote extensively beyond this text, in areas of philosophy (logic, religion, ethics). The particular text I use here, the Norton Critical Edition, has a good annotated text of \`On Liberty', a copy of Harriet Taylor's essay, \`On Tolerance', and a criticism section, including five essays written against Mill's ideas and constructions, and four essays in favour. There is also a useful bibliography and index.This should probably be required reading in civics classes, if not in the pre-university years for students, then certainly in the early university years."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"J.S. Mill has written the best promulgation of classical liberalism in his book &quot;On Liberty&quot; (OL). Although a socialist himself, many of the ideas in OL are actually tenets of modern libertarianism (also called classical liberalism). Mill states that the only reason that force can be used on any man is to prevent harm to others. I consider &quot;focre&quot; to be either social or economic. Mill saw it as only social, which explains his socialism.Not to detract from Mill or OL, the book is a resounding defense of civil-liberties. OL completes modern democratic theory as promulgated by John Locke in his &quot;Two Treatises of Government.&quot; While Locke argues for some kind of democracy reminiscent of Athens, Mill qualifies Locke's point by protecting the minority from the majority. This book should be read by Americans who want to know more about freedom, and by our elected officials.Sadly, it's our elected oficials who probably won't get it."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"Few works argue as forcefully and eloquently for individual liberty as this one book. Written by one of England's greatest humanitarians, philosophers, and social scientists, this is one of the great classics in Western political philosophy. This book uses plain reason, clear logic, and objective reasoning to argue that the freedom of speech and its related freedoms such as freedom of assembly, press, petition, and religion, are ultimately beneficial to not only the individual, but to society as well. The latter argument goes as such; society is composed of individuals. Hence the knowledge and wisdom of a society is composed of the contributions of every individual. In order for a society to determine the truth, or best opinions on any particular topic, it must be allowed to see/hear all the opinions possible, which is only possible if everyone is allowed to voice their opinion.This reviewer read this book in high school, and was quite impressed with it back then. It is understandable by most high school seniors.

This is a vibrant and passionate defense about the thinking and expression liberties, a vehement apology of the tolerance and respect beliefs or dissident minorities, a fearless recovery around the human spontaneity and singularity against the exerted oppression by authorities, costumes or public opinion.Under the lucid perspective of the elapsed years, this was a visionary text whose importance perhaps still has not been evaluated in all its wholeness."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"What J.S Mill proposes in \\"On Liberty\\" is still now convincing and interesting and I believe it should draw more attention than is the case today. True, Mill's ideas are not easily applicable to practical problems and his arguments are sometimes so defective as to be justifiably called \\"fallacies,\\" but still his fundamental principle is noteworthy and defensible: You can think, speak and do, as you like, unless you do any harm to others. Mill claims that this freedom, rather than spoiling our society, contributes to the progress of human beings in the long run, and this in the sense that so long as we humans do not achieve absolute infallibility, it is nothing other than human diversity that prevents us from falling into limited attitudes and courting fatal consequences. I agree from the bottom of my heart with this idea of his, and hope more attention will be paid to the book and its philosophy."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"A very definite view of legal rights, in that no interference from government should be permitted, save for when the actions of one harm others. This, of course, brings in questions about what constitutes 'harm', but all in all, a forceful argument for absolute free speech, unhampered by any law. I think this is interesting given the later restrictions placed on free speech. I was also interested to see how this book is rated on the high end of the 'difficult to read' scale, because I found Mill easy to follow and quite straightforward."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"Have you ever tried to read that fun twentieth-century philosophy, especially the Frenchy-continental strain that is so loaded with jargon and neologisms that you feel as if it was deliberately created to make you feel stupid? The alternative is that the arc philosophy from structuralism through postmodernism is obtuse because there is nothing left to say so you have to hide behind \\"Being-in-itself\\" and you have to drink vodka until being becomes nothingness.Mill's masterwork is nothing of the sort. It is a short, structured argument written in defense of a premodern libertarianism as \\"liberty\\". I won't gloss on it too much here, since others more qualified can talk about his ideas. My copy is marked up with individual passages highlighted and !!!ed, but it is not in isolation that these passages have strength. Mill is able to define his conception of Liberty very directly, and he is not utopian since he senses the limits of Liberty as he defines them. These limits necessitate a state structure that in my reading, is incompatible with the modern conception of Libertarianism. The problems were evident 150 years ago, and I read it as more against bureaucracy per se than as against Government as a whole.Overall, readings and interpretations can vary across readers and across time, but this is a very important and interesting book to help build or challenge a world-view."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"An advocate for the development of individuality/ human potentials for social progress, the author believes and emphatically promotes liberty as essential foundation for freedom of conscience, free will as well as diligent exploration of diverse and opposing/contradicting ideas. He warns against mental complacency/laziness/conformity in many forms of public opinions, custom, doctrines and religioius dogmas with underlying notion of infallibility. He calls them \\"despotism\\" that hinders human advancemen and also quotes \\"slumber of a decided opinion\\" as dangers of uncontested ideas. Reading intoductory biography also helps to understand the personal background that influenced his political philosophy. His beliefs in liberty of one's actions are qualified in the sense and context of individual responsibility for self and \\"others\\", for example, he calls it \\"moral crime\\" against the offspring and society to \\"bring a child into existence without a fair prospect of being able to\\" provide education. In our current culture where McDonald (not individuals or parents) is blamed for obesity and some people claim entitlement about having multiple children even when they are being born into an environment that will most likely cause suffering and cycling through welfare system, John Stuart Mill's ideas of responsible liberty sadly cause feelings of disorientation. A psychologist once said, (perhaps, Rollo May?) we have to choose between \\"neurotic necessity and responsible freedom\\" This was a great read."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"\\"On Liberty\\" is one of the most important books on political thought of the nineteenth century. Fortunately for the 21st century reader it is also one of the most accessible. Mill was a libertarian who chose not to base his defence of liberty on natural rights but on his own revised version of utilitarianism:\\"I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions...grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being.\\"This enables Mill to argue that freedom is needed if man is to be able to explore all the avenues of human development that allow the human race to progress. Total freedom is impossible so what determines the legitimate boundaries of freedom? Mill distinguishes between self-regarding and other-regarding actions. The former should never be interfered with and the latter subject to limitation only if they harm the legitimate rights of others.For Mill free thought is a self-regarding action which should not be curtailed, and free thought is virtually useless without free speech. Mill then proceeds to add a utilitarian argument in favour of free speech: if an opinion is silenced then mankind is necessarily the loser whether the opinion is true or false. He advances a number of arguments to support this, concluding with the claim that a climate of freedom is essential for \\"great thinkers\\" and \\"it is as much, and even more indispensable to enable average human beings to attain the mental stature they are capable of.\\" He has no truck with paternalists seeking to guide people's thoughts in the \\"right\\" direction. He was equally hostile to the idea that people had the right not to be offended; hence he opposed the blasphemy law. The single case Mill gives of an acceptable limitation of free speech is the case of corn-dealers and an excited mob. An opinion expressed in a newspaper that corn-dealers are \\"starvers of the poor\\" is legitimate, but the same view stated to an angry mob outside the corn-dealer's home may be limited if it \\"is a positive instigation to a mischievous act.\\"Mill concedes that actions cannot be as free as speech and seeks to establish the proper limits of freedom of action. Mill proposes that \\"the sole end for which mankind are warranted...in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.\\" Because he rejects paternalism he opposes all interference with self-regarding actions. Mill would not have prevented people from taking drugs and he would have led the opposition to seat belt legislation. Mill even rejects state interference with liberty for the sake of crime prevention, e.g. poisons can be used for criminal purposes. Mill was willing to accept a register of their sale but not the banning of them. Mill believes we must not interfere with the \\"rights\\"of others but these are narrowly circumscribed and Mill makes it clear that \\"rights\\" are not the same as \\"interests\\". Hence cut-throat laissez-faire is legitimate. As for moral decency arguments Mill does say that sexual intercourse in public is unacceptable, and though fornication and gambling are acceptable he is in two minds about whether pimps and casino-owners should be allowed to operate. Mill says it is a difficult case that is on the borderline, but adds that in general we must resist attempts to limit behaviour for \\"moral\\" reasons because any such action is likely to be the thin end of the wedge.Though Mill is a very determined anti-paternalist he makes three exceptions: children, primitive societies and the disabled. Children must be guided until they reach maturity and they must be given compulsory education - something not given legislative force until 1871 in his native country. As for primitive societies we must resist the notion that Mill was a typical Victorian believing in the \\"white man's burden\\" or inherent differences between races. He simply observed the reality of the world in the mid-nineteenth century but made it very clear any intervention in backward societies must be temporary with the aim to bring about self-government as soon as possible.Hence Mill was a much more determined libertarian than most modern writers on the subject. There is just one example where, at first sight, Mill may seem reactionary to modern readers. He wished to restrict the right to have children to those who could prove that they could support them. However, those who today wish others to be allowed to procreate at will do so on the grounds of human rights. Mill based his theories on utilitarianism, and not on rights. There was no welfare state when Mill wrote \\"On Liberty\\" and he was concerned with the well-being of children born to people without the means to support them.In view of the growing restrictions on freedom in many Western nations this is a book well worth reading again. In particular I like Mill's argument that every restriction on freedom is the thin end of the wedge, providing a justification for further restrictions."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This is Mill's statement of the ' one very simple principle' he wished to establish in ' On Liberty' \\" The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion or control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. The principle is that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively , in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do, or forebear because it will be better for him to do,because it will make him happier, because , in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise or even right... The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society,is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself , his idnependence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.This is in a nutshell the creed of Mill's faith in ' On Liberty ' Gertrude Himmelfarb in her brilliant introduction explains how that faith developed in part out of the personal situation in which Mill found himself after years of close friendship with the - then married Harriet Taylor after her husband died, became his wife. One great controversy relates to the vast credit Mill gave her with being a full partner in every way in creating this work. The social isolation both suffered as a result of their relationship is an important element in Mill's fierce defence of the individual's right to be free of social coercion, and opinion. Another central element in the development of Mill's thought is his reaction to the Utilitarianism his father John Mill and Jeremy Bentham instilled in Mill from childhood. 'The greatest happiness for the greatest number principal' is rejected by Mill as first basis for social action. Mill in effect says that it is not society's business to be a Grand Inquisitor and bring it bread and circuses to make it happy. Happiness is not the first principle any longer in Mill's thought rather individual liberty is. The sole curb on such individual liberty is when it leads to the harming of others. This faith of Mill can be recognized today as part and parcel of the fundamental ideology of democratic societies.This work is thus one of the fundamental political classics which form the Western political tradition. And it is one of those works which should be part of the curriculum of any true liberal arts education. The question of the excesses of this principle and whether Mill in his thought has provided sufficient check to it by consideration of other human values isa very real and debatable one even today."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"In the Introduction to \\"On Liberty,\\" Currin Shields, an English egghead, bemoans the fact that Mill's most \\"famous\\" essay is \\"more talked about than read.\\"I'm surprised it is even talked about, and I am very much NOT surprised that hardly anyone reads it. Mill takes about a hundred and twenty pages to say what could be (and was) summed up in an epigram: People should be free to do whatever they want, as long as it does not harm anyone else.Not only does Mill subject the reader to pages and pages of supererogatory writing, but his prose is the epitome of Victorian verbosity, with more modifiers, clauses, footnotes, and parentheticals than there are alcoholics in Butte, Montana. (And there are a LOT of alcoholics in Butte, Montana.)I guess if you're studying philosophy, you're gonna have to read this thing sooner or later...likewise if you're an autodidact."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This book represents the beginning of the peversion of classical liberalism (Algernon Sidney, John Trenchard, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry) into the tyranny of modern day liberalism (socialism). Mill is the originator of the thoughtless confounding of liberal and socialist ideas that led to the decline of the living standards of the English people. Mill is the great advocate of Socialism. All the arguments that could be expounded in favour of socialism are expounded here. Marx, Lasalle and Engels are scarcely of importance. The blood of 100 million ultimately dripped from his pen (see the black book of communism). Liberty means freedom from taxes, too many laws and respect for property rights not the right to welfare or necessarily to vote. It is no surprise to see neo-con Himmelfarb enthusing over this book considering the Kristol family are fans of the tyrant Trotsky.Of course as an agnostic he advocates that socially, individuals should be privately able to do whatever they like. Unfortunately in order for a society to be free from too many laws the people must abide by unwritten laws and that means the laws of the Abrahamic God. If a village does not want to tolerate homosexuals then they should be free not to and be able to drive them out, it's called the social contract. As George Washington wisely put it 'in order to be a truly free people,we must be a religious people'. J.S.

The description on the back sounds like it was written by a young student, which makes me suspicious about the quality of the printing. The text is difficult to follow because of its arrangement on the page. The printers divide words whenever possible and use hyphens instead of dashes.My complaints may sound minor, but I have not seen problems like this anywhere else--certainly not from a company that calls itself an authority on \\"classic books\\" or advertises \\"beautiful\\" production.

Mill's encyclical is a perfect example of the tendency of the Enlightenment to believe something to be reasonable if it is couched in the proper language.Mill walks a tenuous path between Locke &amp; Bentham, taking up a defense of liberty, but unwilling to risk his utilitarian street cred. Thus, we have beautiful assertions such as &quot;the unchallenged idea is that which is in most danger&quot;, along side a perverse and logically twisted injection of &quot;duty&quot; into what is otherwise a syllogistic approach.Mill insists on a Lockian sphere of rights approach, then qualifies it in the cases of children (up to whatever age the law defines them), as well as in those societies that aren't developed enough for liberty (by Mill's definition?). Liberty is also to be restricted in such cases as a man might &quot;sin by omission&quot; and &quot;fail to help his Brother.&quot; These wonderful sentiments are followed by more cognitive dissonance, various ad hominem attacks on Christianity (particularly those sinister Catholics), and a lot of hand-waving about polygamy.As an aside, I imagine that G.K. Chesteron had Mill in mind when he wrote &quot;The worst judge of all is the man now most ready with his judgements; the ill-educated Christian turning gradually into the ill-tempered agnostic, entangled in the end of a feud of which he never understood the beginning, blighted with a sort of hereditary boredom with he knows not what, and already weary of hearing what he has never heard&quot;Throughout the work, Mill's passions and prejudices skew his arguments. It is a fascinating display of intellectual agility, to watch him extolling freedom while restraining it; to see him preach tolerance, and even go so far as to tolerate intolerance. Note that this last feat reminds me of the Kobyashi Maru Strategy - win the unwinnable game by changing the rules. The typical cultural relativist will divide by zero when approached with the self-contradiction of the tolerant society. Mill side-steps the issue and goes along his merry way, proclaiming not a full page later that &quot;there is always hope when people are forced to listen to both sides.&quot; It's refreshing to hear a champion of responsible liberty who's ready to practice coercion.Ultimately, Mill produces a monumental work that speaks volumes about more than its subject. His observations are supremely valuable, even when they are irrational, but most of the time he manages to define a system in which the interests of the state and the interests of the individual are balanced to his particular tastes.As a final note, unlike the introduction for Clausewitz' On War (another Penguin Classic), the Introduction here has value. Gertrude Himmelfarb thoroughly ties together Mill, his physical and intellectual parents, Mill's wife, his society, and peers, and manages to wrap the whole thing up in 42 pages."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This Kindle book was clearly created from a text file and little, if any, editing or formatting was done for the Kindle.Paragraphs are fixed width, so unless you size your screen to the paragraphs, you will have lines breaking all over the place.

His liberty concerns thought, opinion, sentiment, taste, pursuit and combination (freedom to unite and to trade).The limit to his liberty is based on one very simple principle: the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others.He has also responsibilities: it is a moral crime to bring a child into existence without a fair prospect of being able, not only to provide food for its body, but instruction and training for its mind.SocietySociety has jurisdiction over any part of a person\`s conduct which affects prejudicially the interests of others. Also, everyone who receives protection of society owns a return for the benefit (e.g., bearing one's share in defending one's country).But, the (majority of) people or the government has no right whatsoever to control the expression of opinion (media).

This is probably now his most famous work, and it is very easy to see why; his argument is not only compelling philosophically but widely applicable and, at about 140 pages, easily read by nearly all.

Many of Mills' words have passed into common usage in the years since the book was published in 1859. To quote one famous example: \\"Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\\"Mill writes in a florid, orotund style that often defies the rapid reader. One frequently has to plod through an over-punctuated verbal and syntactic thicket twice or thrice in order to extract the meaning of a passage. In this respect, Mill was perhaps no worse than other philosophical writers of his day - or indeed of any day.However \\"On Liberty\\" is definitely worth persevering with; not only for its exposition of the subject, but also for some wonderful passages of writing. Mill has a gift for simple exposition of complex philosophical questions.Liberty is always under threat, even in countries perhaps best known for valuing and promoting individual liberty - at least in the rhetoric of political leaders, if not in their practice. That might sound incredible, but one has only to reflect on the encroachments on liberty occasioned by the \\"war on terror\\" and the general support of the majority for such encroachments. In this case both governments and governed conspire to deny others liberty; the former by diktat, demagoguery and secrecy and the latter by strident bigotry.But, if I might be permitted a facetious remark, perhaps those countries have taken Mill too much to heart where he asserts that \\"despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided that the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end.\\"Such a patronising, indeed ignorant, view is repugnant to libertarians today, but it was a commonplace view among officials and churchmen in the high noon of the British Empire. But lest we feel too smug about the superiority of our own age, I will observe that we can see echoes of similar odious attitudes today in foreign policy, and the same will no doubt be true of future dominant powers yet to come onto the world stage.However, to be fair to Mill, his passing comment on \\"barbarians\\" is only one very minor part of this great book. More to the point, he asserts strongly in the book that views which are considered to be settled truth in one era may often be rejected in another. He goes on to say that conventional wisdom should always be rigorously tested and not merely assumed to be true on the authority of others.There are also large parts of the world where freedom of expression, and indeed freedom of thought, are suppressed. It is to be greatly hoped that \\"On Liberty\\" will one day be as influential there as it has been elsewhere. Mill himself states eloquently (but perhaps optimistically) that while the truth may be suppressed many times, it will ultimately prevail.After an introductory Chapter, Mill discusses liberty under four broad Chapters that I will touch on briefly below.In the Chapter on liberty of thought and expression, Mill has a swipe at the Christian faith. Some believers may be offended by this discussion, but why should they? The truth should be able to withstand the assaults of opposing views - indeed (as Mill says) it should welcome contrary views both as a means of strengthening the truth, and as a means of rooting out error.Moreover, Mill was writing in the middle of the 19th century, just before the publication of Darwin's theory of evolution, at a time when Christianity in England enjoyed many advantages and official protections. He quotes the example of a man who went to prison for writing an anti-Christian sentiment on a gate - an exemplary message to others who might be tempted to express their true thoughts.In the Chapter on individuality Mill maintains that liberty of thought and expression must necessarily lead to the desirability of people living as they choose, providing that they do not infringe the liberty or well-being of others. However, the arguments in this chapter are less well-presented than in the former chapter. Mill also makes an assertion that most people would reject today: \\"No government by a democracy.....ever did, or could, rise above mediocrity.\\" However it is important to remember that Mill wrote shortly after the extension of the voting franchise in Great Britain, when fears about democratic government were widely discussed, since experience of democratic government in modern industrial societies was quite limited at that time.In the Chapter on the limits to the authority of society over the individual, Mill makes the point that while the individual is sovereign over himself, the society in which he lives and from which he derives protection and other benefits also has rights over the individual. The individual is not accountable to society for his actions if they affect him alone; but as soon as one person's conduct adversely affects the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it.The wide-ranging implications of this principle are discussed comprehensively and lucidly - with good reason, because the allocation of rights and responsibilities between the individual and society is the most important business of coherent groups of human beings.In the final chapter, Mill discusses the practical application of his ideas, accepting that this is not always an easy matter."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"In many ways, one is tempted to think that there is no such thing as liberalism alive in America today. It would do many well to read the work of the Englishman Mill in order to understand much of what is called both \\"liberalism\\" as well as \\"individual liberty.\\" In addition, one of the growing issues of the contemporary political landscape in America is a polarization which is wholly unnecessary when analysis is applied the current plane of consideration. The reason for this conspicuous lack of reason for polarization is made obviously clear when one reads a work on liberal thought like that of Mill's. For Mill, individual liberty is a question both of social and political proportions, demanding a lack of interference by both government and social pressures. Additionally, he is keen in his analysis of the need for humility when it comes to humanity's apprehension of the Truth, thus necessitating free speech as a vehicle for the continual realization of those parts of the Truth which man so often forgets because of personal bias.However, the analysis is weak insofar as it also denies the need for structures to educate humanity in a fallen world. His criteria for legal and social sanctions does overlook the necessity to draw on tradition to properly shape those in the world (while maintaining individual dignity). While he acknowledges that it would be preposterous to deny the necessity of interrelationships and sharing of experience, Mill remains somewhat weak on the necessity of tradition and community as related to individual liberty. However, on the whole, the work presents a decent overview of the need to acknowledge individual dignity through the liberty of the individual. Indeed, all communal criticisms aside, On Liberty does indeed serve as a corrective against crass traditionalism which propagates itself without true individual consent and embrace. Therefore, even in its weakness, it remains strong as a key text on the primacy of the human individual as the recipient and follower of the Truth. In a day when liberty is shouted by groups who have no interest in talking to each other, such a small text would do well to make all groups realize that our American (and indeed Western) goals aren't that different, that we are united in trying to express human dignity through the individuals."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"Unlike the clueless and completely contradictory rantings of &quot;white_anglo_saxon_muslim&quot;, this book is entirely in favour of the freedom of the individual - personal freedoms that are entirely opposed to the thoughts of socialism and the notion of a government or body removing those freedoms in favour of a &quot;greater good&quot;.This book argues that it is not the role of anyone else to decide what is best for any one person, but that person's decision.

He believed that some worrying tendencies could be observed in the England society of his time, and tried to warn others about them.The author basically explains his ideas regarding the preservation of individual liberties, not only due to the fact that they are rights owed to everyone, but also because they benefit society as a whole.For example, when he says that liberty of thought and of discussion must be preserved, he tells us that &quot;Wrong opinions and practices gradually yield to fact and argument: but fact and arguments, to produce any effect on the mind, must be brought before it&quot;. How can mistaken beliefs or actions be proven wrong, if dissent is forbidden?. The loss for society is clear: &quot;If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth; if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error&quot;.In order to preserve the liberties included in the concept of Civil Liberty, the author points out that there must be limits to the action of the Government. He says that &quot;The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others&quot;. Any other reason is simply not good enough. Thus, Stuart Mill highlights the rights of the individual, but also the limit to those rights: the well-being of others.&quot;On Liberty&quot; is not too long, and I think you are highly likely to enjoy it, if you can get past the first few pages. The problem is that even though the ideas in this book are quite modern, the language is somehow dated. But then, we must remember that &quot;On Liberty&quot; was written a long time ago...Notwithstanding that, do your best to read the first pages, and you will realize that after a while it will be much easier. This book is well-worth the effort you need to make at the beginning, because it is even more relevant today than when it was first published, in 1859.Are individual rights important?. Why?. Do they have a limit?. You will found the answer for these questions, and much more, in &quot;On Liberty&quot;. What else can I say?. I believe this is a book that will help you to reflect on many important issues... I certainly can't think of a better reason to read it. All in all, recommended :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This Kindle edition has an introduction written more than a century ago that offers no insight into Mill's essay and deals almost entirely with the relationship between Mill and Harriet Taylor. It is therefore primarily of general rather than academic interest.\\"On Liberty\\" is one of the most important books on political thought of the nineteenth century. Fortunately for the 21st century reader it is also one of the most accessible. Mill was a libertarian who chose not to base his defence of liberty on natural rights but on his own revised version of utilitarianism:\\"I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions...grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being.\\"This enables Mill to argue that freedom is needed if man is to be able to explore all the avenues of human development that allow the human race to progress. Total freedom is impossible so what determines the legitimate boundaries of freedom? Mill distinguishes between self-regarding and other-regarding actions. The former should never be interfered with and the latter subject to limitation only if they harm the legitimate rights of others.For Mill free thought is a self-regarding action which should not be curtailed, and free thought is virtually useless without free speech. Mill then proceeds to add a utilitarian argument in favour of free speech: if an opinion is silenced then mankind is necessarily the loser whether the opinion is true or false. He advances a number of arguments to support this, concluding with the claim that a climate of freedom is essential for \\"great thinkers\\" and \\"it is as much, and even more indispensable to enable average human beings to attain the mental stature they are capable of.\\" He has no truck with paternalists seeking to guide people's thoughts in the \\"right\\" direction. He was equally hostile to the idea that people had the right not to be offended; hence he opposed the blasphemy law. The single case Mill gives of an acceptable limitation of free speech is the case of corn-dealers and an excited mob. An opinion expressed in a newspaper that corn-dealers are \\"starvers of the poor\\" is legitimate, but the same view stated to an angry mob outside the corn-dealer's home may be limited if it \\"is a positive instigation to a mischievous act.\\"Mill concedes that actions cannot be as free as speech and seeks to establish the proper limits of freedom of action. Mill proposes that \\"the sole end for which mankind are warranted...in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.\\" Because he rejects paternalism he opposes all interference with self-regarding actions. Mill would not have prevented people from taking drugs and he would have led the opposition to seat belt legislation. Mill even rejects state interference with liberty for the sake of crime prevention, e.g. poisons can be used for criminal purposes. Mill was willing to accept a register of their sale but not the banning of them. Mill believes we must not interfere with the \\"rights\\"of others but these are narrowly circumscribed and Mill makes it clear that \\"rights\\" are not the same as \\"interests\\". Hence cut-throat laissez-faire is legitimate. As for moral decency arguments Mill does say that sexual intercourse in public is unacceptable, and though fornication and gambling are acceptable he is in two minds about whether pimps and casino-owners should be allowed to operate. Mill says it is a difficult case that is on the borderline, but adds that in general we must resist attempts to limit behaviour for \\"moral\\" reasons because any such action is likely to be the thin end of the wedge.Though Mill is a very determined anti-paternalist he makes three exceptions: children, primitive societies and the disabled. Children must be guided until they reach maturity and they must be given compulsory education - something not given legislative force when he wrote. As for primitive societies, we must resist the notion that Mill was a typical Victorian believing in the \\"white man's burden\\" or inherent differences between races. He simply observed the reality of the world in the mid-nineteenth century but made it very clear any intervention in backward societies must be temporary with the aim to bring about self-government as soon as possible.Hence Mill was a much more determined libertarian than most modern writers on the subject. There is just one example where, at first sight, Mill may seem reactionary to modern readers. He wished to restrict the right to have children to those who could prove that they could support them. However, those who today wish others to be allowed to procreate at will do so on the grounds of human rights. Mill based his theories on utilitarianism, and not on rights. There was no welfare state when Mill wrote \\"On Liberty\\" and he was concerned with the well-being of children born to people without the means to support them.In view of the alleged growing restrictions on freedom in many democratic countries this is a book well worth reading. In particular I like Mill's argument that every restriction on freedom is the thin end of the wedge, providing a justification for further restrictions."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"In his classic essay \\"On Liberty\\", John Stuart Mill deals with the issue of \\"civil liberties\\" -not the metaphysical issue of \\"free will\\". While most attacks on civil liberties have historically occurred from the right within the context of a tyrannical or an aristocratic rule, Mill deals with threats against liberty from within the institutions of democracy itself. The issue is especially relevant at a time when widespread domestic wiretapping and surveillance violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.The aim of early libertarians was to limit the power of the ruler over those governed; Mill, however, identifies a need to limit the power of elected governments and officials as well. Mill is not merely addressing the issue of \\"who should rule?\\", he seeks to establish limits on the power that government may exercise over minorities and individuals. His work is more relevant now than ever.While \\"government of the people\\" is an ideal to be aspired to, Mill argues that such an ideal is often not the case in fact. He argues that those exerting the power of the government -elected officials, bureaucrats, the judiciary -often develop their own interests. They are sometimes influenced by those constituencies in ways that are at odds with the interests and liberties of individuals or other groups.Mill makes no distinction between a tyranny of one and a tyranny of many. A tyrannical majority running roughshod over the rights of individuals and minorities is no less a tyrant because it is a majority, because it is elected, or because it is elected by a majority.While society may not tolerate criminal behavior, for example, society may not legitimately interfere with or suppress all non-conforming behaviors indiscriminately or because a majority may not approve. What then are the powers that society may legitimately exercise over the individual? Mill answers:\\"The only purpose for which power can be rightly exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.\\"-J.S. Mill, On LibertyJames Madison -called the \\"Father of the Constitution\\" -may have anticipated Mill's ideas in his draft of the Bill of Rights -the first ten amendments to the Constitution. Implicit in the Bill of Rights is the recognition that the power of the state is a blunt instrument. Abused, it can oppress and repress individuals and minority groups alike. The Bill of Rights addresses this issue by guaranteeing \\"due process of law\\", limiting state power over individuals and groups, guaranteeing that groups and individuals may speak freely, worship freely.The Fourth Amendment specifically is a promise that our government made to us in its very founding:\\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\\"-Fourth Amendment, Bill of Rights, U.S. ConstitutionLet's make something abundantly clear: there are no \\"inherent powers\\", \\"Implicit\\" authorizations\\" that would, in any way, overturn, limit, or repeal the Fourth Amendment. Many politicians are not only wrong about that, they may have deliberately lied about it. Moreover, Congress may not overrule the Fourth Amendment with statutory law. Constitutional Law is supreme and provisions in the Bill of Right are valid until amended as set out in the Constitution itself. Widespread domestic surveillance is illegal whatever is done by Congress ex post facto -and until the Constitution is amended, it will remain illegal. At last, ex post facto laws, themselves, are expressly forbidden by the Constitution.Mill is all the more remarkable for his insight into issues that remain contemporary. In every literate criticism of \\"special interest groups\\", PAC's, the gun lobby, the tobacco lobby, the Military/Industrial Complex, one sees the lasting influence of John Mill.On Liberty is essential reading for anyone interested in law, the principles of government, political science, political philosophy, indeed, freedom itself. It is also essential reading for anyone interested in learning about the intellectual underpinnings of Anglo-American civil liberties."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This edition is subtitled \\"Optimized for Kindle\\". I was therefore quite surprised that it lacked a table of contents. What does \\"optimized\\" mean in this context?"},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This book deserves to be studied closely; I cannot praise too highly the man or his work. As Mill writes in his AUTOBIOGRAPHY, his education under his philosopher father James was perhaps the most tortuous experience imaginable for a young child, leaving the adolescent John with the impression that he was something of a facsimile of his father. Nevertheless, after much difficulty in assimilating what he was taught and defining who he was, the adult Mill respectfully stepped out from under his father's shadow and went on to make staggering intellectual contributions of his own. In this book, ON LIBERTY, Mill tackles the problem of \\"the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual.\\" With some reflection, it can be seen how important this question is, for its implications touch every part of our social and private lives. Unfortunately, few recognize its importance, and the question is more often decided by unthinking custom or self-interest than reason. With scrupulous rigor, and impeccable intellectual honesty, Mill asserts the absolute necessity of dissenting opinions, of diversity in all things, and the dangers of concentrated power, be it in the form of a dictator or a democratic majority. The problems treated in this short book are just as relevant today as they were in Mill's time. Perennial political issues such as education reform, gun control, abortion, freedom of speech, taxation, the role of government, etc., are addressed either directly or indirectly; the book abounds with other, more personal, lessons on life as well, not the least of which was later encapsulated by Wittgenstein as: \\"If you want to improve the world, improve yourself.\\""},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"In On Liberty, Mill attempts to define when the authority of society can rightly limit individuality and the &quot;sovereignty of the individual over himself.&quot; He writes that people are not accountable to society for actions that only concern themselves. The only means society has to express disapproval of such actions is through &quot;advice, instruction, persuasion, and avoidance by other people if thought necessary by them for their own good.&quot; He also writes that the individual is accountable for actions that hurt others, and society can punish a person socially or legally as is deemed necessary for such actions. Mill observes, though, that sometimes when an action causes harm to others, such as when a person succeeds in a competitive job market, the general social good is positive, and there is no right to punish people for the harm caused. Throughout On Liberty, Mill's argument proceeds with a discussion of the appropriate level of authority that society should have over the individual, along with particular examples and applications of the theory, to clarify the meaning of his claims. The examples are just as relevant today as they were in Mill's time. Continuing political issues such as education reform, gun control, alcohol, freedom of speech, taxation, the role of government, etc., are addressed either directly or indirectly. Mill was ahead of his time. His book was insightful, thought-provoking and ahead of its time. The questions and viewpoints Mill argued are the same issues in political debates today. When reading On Liberty, I found myself reading the same paragraphs over again to understand his main issues and points. Also, in parts of the reading Mill never really comes across and answers his own questions he argued, but his ideas and arguments leave the reader thinking."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"America's defense department should take some of the billions spent on the stealth bomber or the B1 and spend it to make Arabic and Farsi translations of this book in the hundreds of thousands. We could pack the bomb bays of a squadron of stealth bombers with the translations and carpet the cities of Muslim countries with this treatise on freedom. This is The Book, folks. You cannot read this little book without it changing your life. It is an extended argument about freedom, about true morality, about freeing your mind, about untrammeling the possibility of peace and prosperity in the world. This is the book that lays out the path for treating other human beings with respect and opening the way toward progress in any and all societies. For the discussion of the \\"harm to others\\" principle alone, this book merits the world's attention and praise.Perhaps the most famous aspect of Mill's extended argument about liberty is his discussion of the \\"tyranny of the majority.\\" His argument grows from the long history of religious persecution suffered throughout Europe that led to book bans, bigotry, and even torture and burning at the stake for people who did not conform to the majority superstition, namely the dominant form of Christianity wherever one lived. Mill lived in a time when even the staid and relatively moderate views of the English Church forced people to conform their lives or face public humiliation and financial ruin, and sometimes lynching. The resulting dynamic was that free thought was thus discouraged and progress thwarted. Mill's point is that in such a psychological milieu, people are not mentally free to seek a better way. They are rather trammeled to superstition and the concomitant tyranny of the majority, the majority being emotionally dependent and mentally ham-strung by religion and religious fears and prejudices.America today is witnessing the truth of this dynamic through the virulent and underhanded tactics of the fundamentalist X-tian political right who seek to thwart medical research and impose a legislated theocracy in parts of the country. The effort to put dark-age arguments about \\"intelligent design\\" on a scientific par with evolutionary theory is a perfect and alarming example. Mill's argument in On Liberty was prescient in demonstrating what can happen when people allow religion to influence political life. The brand of literalist religion we see in America has been the bane of societies throughout history and respresents a true pragmatic evil on a scale far worse than any imagined \\"Satanic\\" sinfulness that Christians associate with popular and secular humanism. Fundamentalist religion, especially in the forms of Christian and Muslim extremism, is a societal cancer when viewed through the lense of reason and of Mill's enlightened utilitarianism. No society that allows religion to make in-roads to politics can flourish. Proof is in the failed Middle East, where no country can manage to pull its people out of poverty and squalor in spite of sitting on the world's richest oil reserves. Mill's argument in this small book speaks volumes about why Muslim countries are doomed to failure and why the Christian right in America (the blood cousins of Islamic radicals) represent the biggest and most un-American evil in our country's history. If America represents freedom, there can be no room for the \\"ten commandments\\" in the county court house.Highly recommended as a must read for everyone."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"I agree, how hard is it to put a table of contents in, it is very frustrating trying to navigate through this book."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"John Stuart Mill, author of On Liberty, defines the nature of civil liberty, and most importantly, the harm principl. He aims to give readers a better understanding of the nature and limits of power that can be exercised by society over individuals.

By reading the book, the reader is able to apply Mill's message and examples to our lives in America today. The ahead-of-the-times ideas that are in On Liberty can be related to our world because it discusses controversies that are still seen in our courtrooms today. Mill is able to accomplish his purpose because he uses many examples, thoughts, and theories about individual and social rights. He works through each of his ideas, looking at both sides of the issue to enable the reader to make their own informed decision about each matter. This book has a practical meaning because it allows the reader to develop and reason ideas about government power and when that power should be exercised over the people. Unfortunately, this book does have one draw back. Mill was a very educated man and wrote very well for his time. Yet today, our style and writing techniques are not the same as they were in the nineteenth century. This makes On Liberty a difficult book to read. His book is very decriptive, yet his wording is not easily understadable and some paragraphs have to be read two or three times to fully understand what he is writing about. Aside from his writing style, John Stuart Mill has put together an essay full of educated ideas about society and individuals.

Those exerting the power of the government (elected officials, bureaucrats, the judiciary, etc) develop their own interests and are influenced by special interests often at odds with the interests and liberties of individuals. Writing as he did in the 19th Century, Mill is all the more remarkable for his insight in light of what is happening today. In every literate criticism of &quot;special interest groups&quot;, PAC's, &quot;over-zealous prosecutors&quot;, etc., one sees the lasting influence of John Mill. Mill may be considered the heir apparent to John Locke and his work is most valuable when it is considered in an historical context which includes Locke's influence on our own founding fathers and James Madison's authorship of the &quot;Bill of Rights&quot;, arguably the most effective limit on those forces tending to undermine civil liberties."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"Mill provides a brilliant analysis and commentary on the give and take between the need for government protection and the exercise od individual responsibility.

Mill's primary concern was to address the potential problem of the \\"tyranny of the majority\\" posed by the emerging democratization of society. His concern was prompted specifically by de Toqueville's account of the USA. Mill is concerned not just with the way government could impose conformity to majority views but also with general social pressures for conformity. In opposition to the dangers of majoritarianism, Mill proposes 2 versions of the Harm principle; the first the basic idea that whatever doesn't cause harm is permitted. The second and more restrictive version emphasizes violation of duties to others. Mill argues his case very well, addressing both general principles and specific problems of contemporary British society. In line with his utilitarian approach, he argues vigorously that human improvement requires the type of freedom and tolerance implied by his Harm Principles. This is also in a real sense the weakness of On Liberty. Mill's version of utilitarianism is not the hedonistic utilitarianism of Bentham and his father, nor preference utilitarianism, but a more vague assertion of what is needed for human progression. Well written, and often quoted, this is one of the accessible major texts in the canon."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"The modern age is a dangerous age, an age in which we might be alienated from that individual independence in work and in mind which defines our humanity. Confronted by this crisis, Karl Marx and John Stuart Mill offer the world diverging solutions: annihilate the existing world and march toward communism, or guard against the dangers of the existing world as we further embrace liberal democracy. Despite these divergent paths which arise from differing views on the driving force of history, both systems aim to rescue the supreme interest of our individual humanity-for Marx, this interest lies in reaching absolute prosperity for the material man, and for Mill, it lies in the search for absolute truth for the idealistic man.With its emphasis on individuality and diversity, Mill's theory is in a sense more encompassing than Marx's. Mill's theory, however, is fundamentally flawed in comparison to Marx's because of its ignorance of property as a danger against human liberty.Marx sees in the industrial age the death of the property-less class. This death is brought by the industrial age's five qualities: division of labor, accumulation of capital, competition, financial crisis, and monopoly. In this age, machineries and the division of labor reduce the skillful artisans to the proletariats who merely work on one monotonous element of production. The capitalists who own the machines enlarge their capital by exploiting the proletariat's labor, leaving them only with enough to eat. Competition forces capitalists to lower prices, but this is good only until each factory produces more than demanded and a financial crisis emerges. The small capitalists are reduced to the property-less as millions of workers are swept into deeper hell. Only the biggest capitalist survives, and he becomes the monopolist who can lower wages and raise prices at whim, destroying the lives of all. (Part 1, Bourgeois and Proletarians, Manifesto of the Communist Party)The above scenario is unavoidable because the accumulation of more capital is the only end of capital. If the capitalist stops investing capital for gains he ceases to be a capitalist, and becomes a mere consumer of goods, enjoying the fruits of old exploitations. Tragically, capital can only increase when it exploits the difference of what labor costs and labor produces, as Marx writes,\\"The modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.\\" (Marx p484)The rich man sitting in his patio who has inherited a million pound and who lets others manage his money has not done anything to deserve profits, indeed, since he himself did not work, his profits must come from the works of others who he exploits. In the capitalistic system, there exists no pity, only keen self-interest, \\"all are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use...\\" (Marx p479)The workers might die, but before their body ceases to be exploited, their mind is already died-capitalism has alienated them from their humanity which is defined by their creative productivity. This alienation from our humanity was Marx's greatest worry. Animals make nests and produce goods just as we do, however, as Marx writes,\\"...a bee would put many a human architect to shame by the construction of its honeycomb cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is that the architect builds the cell in his mind before he constructs it in wax... Man not only effects a change of form in the materials of nature; he also realizes his own purpose in those materials.\\" (Chapter 7, Das Kapital)In order to freely produce as the creativity of his mind directs him and as his productive ability allows, the material man must be endowed with control over the means of production. In the world of private property, however, the workers have turned from the master of production to the slave of the machine-they are reduced to programmed animals that produce merely for the end of survival.The proletariat can only reassert his humanity by violent overthrowing the capitalists and through the \\"abolition of private property\\" (Marx p484). Once in communism, the workers will own the means of production and enjoy the full produces of their labor. He will be motivated to constantly transform the world into a more prosperous kingdom. As Marx writes, \\"In communist society, accumulated labour is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of the labourer.\\" (Marx p485) The abundance of material goods will allow man to work not for survival, but for his own enjoyment. In this society, there will be no family and nor religion, everything is made for the love of all and enjoyed by all. Any vestiges of private interest would result in the return to capitalism with all its evils.To Mill, the modern life is also threatening because the voice of the majority might alienate men from their individuality. The differentiation of society is essential for the vitality of the society, and this vitality empowers men on their search for truth.Political debates, according to Mill, have been about striking the balance between the ruler and ruled. It is necessary for the ruled to have a ruler in order to preserve peace and law, yet the elected or unelected ruler's power must be restrained so that he does not abuse it against the ruled. In contrast to Marx's class struggle, this \\"struggle between liberty and authority\\" (p59) from Mill is more amiable. In the current era of democratic nations, however, since the ruled are also the rulers, the opposition no longer exists. People feel that all actions taken by the people's government will be good for the people, and hence they lose the old vigilance against the invasion of public power into their private spheres. The voice of the majority becomes the equivalent of the truth and justice.Mill is worried that this majority voice will obstruct man's search for truth, the attaining of which is the goal of life. Truth is not reached once and then preserved for eternity, it is an organic being with a thousand facets whose survival requires continued inputs of each person's active mind. This truth is the individual treasure of each being, fitting perfectly to his taste and preferences; yet it is also a truth for the whole community, since it is only through the struggles of different truths that humanity as a whole reaches a higher truth-a higher level for the activation of the mind. As Mill writes, \\"There is always need of persons not only to discover new truths and point out when what were once truths are true no longer\\" (p71) If the majority religion is the only religion and taste the only taste, then people will no longer think but simply follow; society will be bogged into the swamp of mediocrity with a mind that is dead. Marx also feared the death of the mind, the mind of the creative worker. Despite the differences, both philosophers are concerned about the destruction of man's defining qualities.To counter this, Mill proclaims that the only defense for \\"interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.\\" (p68). The government must be restrained in the sphere of public affairs, and individuals shall live as free as they want to following their individual passions.Marx and Mill both want to regain humanity. In one case, the enemy is the benumbing effects of majority rule, and man's mind for truth is debased forever into mediocrity, in the other case, the enemy comes from the benumbing effects of subjugation to the machine, and the man is turned from the master of production into the slaves of capital.The core difference between the two theories in practical operation arises from their different views on individuality (both systems serve individuals as their ends, however, individuality, allowing people to be different, are treated differently). For Mill, we must preserve individuality to bring truth (Chapter 3, On Liberty), but for Marx, the destruction of private property is the only task. The communistic society will be a union in which man can \\"...hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner...\\" (The German Ideology). This free life of a communist in communism is all good until one day the comrade does not want to be a communist anymore-but he must be one, there is no choice. In Communism, one does not have the individual liberty to have families, nor try to build a little store of private wealth.On the other side, if someone in Mill's world decides to be a communist, he has the full right to do so. He can even segregate himself away with his friends and enjoy the life of a commune. In another word, Marxism can not destroy Mill's democracy-it will just be one of the many ways of thinking allowed by the system-but Mill's cry for diversity will destroy Marx's world within a second.Confronted with the above, Marx would reply like he did in the Jewish Question, that the so-called liberty and freedom of the capitalistic world are nothing other than man's desire to keep himself a self-sufficient nomad. As he writes, all the rights of man are simply \\"the right to enjoy one's fortune and to dispose of it as one will; without regard for other men and independently of society.\\" (Marx, p42) Marx will say that only seeing the superficial political liberation is not to see the deeper human liberation which could only be achieved with the abolition of private property. Marx might not be completely right, but he does stand at a higher ground than Mill in this analysis of property.Mill in On Liberty is focused solely on avoiding the abuse of power through government, but he ignores the abuses that property owners are capable of against the property-less. In an agricultural society where everyone is equal and land unlimited, the government might be the only thing capable of suppressing individual liberty, but when one sees child-labor and 12 hour work day in modern industrial society, there is no doubt that capital could be a pitiless monster. Even when one ignores the industrial age, and tries to give Mill credit for drawing the best possible life for the pre-industrial man, one still can not avoid noticing the subjugation of the slaves, the suffering of the serfs, and all the other dark stories of the property-less in all the ages previous to the industrial one which Marx gives a full account of.Marx and Mill were faced with the same modern phenomenal, the danger of been alienated from the defining quality of humanity in the face of a new economic and a new political system. Marx might not have made the best analysis, but he did have a deep understanding of history and the problems in history. He stood at the level of the common people and tried to solve their problems caused by their material desperation. Mill did not stoop to the common people, he looked up into the sky of truth and tried to preserve the march toward truth first embarked on by Plato."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"On Liberty by Locke was very interesting and analyzed how humans see the world.

Mill's book about liberty was of vast importance in freeing the individual from the tyranny of communal opinion. Someone may dislike homosexuals, but has no right to harass them or pass ethical judgements on them for what is their choice, of no harm to anyone else. Those are opinions of an indeterminate validity. Socal intervention may only be used to protect someone from restriction of their liberties. What Mill lacks in rigour, he makes up for in persuasiveness. He has some great lines in defense of liberty, a pre-dominant value of human life. Although, it is to be noted that the book can be somewhat tedious in areas which it is repetitive. This book also illustrates what can be seen as a fault in utilitarianism. Utilitarianism takes no notice of other values, or of a conflict of values, such as liberty of existence over the majorities happiness, in which ethics slides into absurdity."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"Mill's inconsistent treatment of liberty is so schizophrenic that is seems to be written by two different people, a Dr. Jekyll and a Mr. Hyde. His flashes of brilliance are marred by his incongruous forays into authoritarianism. It is incredible to me how anyone can read this book and come away viewing it as a legitimate defense of liberty. Mill is clearly guilty of wanting to have his cake and eat it too, and the resulting work is a litany of completely irreconcilable rules for civil society.The brilliant:\\"If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.\\"How elegant. But Mill is a double-edged sword:\\"Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end.\\"And:\\"Though society is not founded on a contract, and though no good purpose is answered by inventing a contract in order to deduce social obligations from it, every one who receives the protection of society owes a return for the benefit, and the fact of living in society renders it indispensable that each should be bound to observe a certain line of conduct towards the rest. This conduct consists, first, in not injuring the interests of one another; or rather certain interests, which, either by express legal provision or by tacit understanding, ought to be considered as rights; and secondly, in each person's bearing his share (to be fixed on some equitable principle) of the labors and sacrifices incurred for defending the society or its members from injury and molestation. These conditions society is justified in ENFORCING, at ALL COSTS to those who endeavor to withhold fulfilment.\\"Mill at once complains about expected group conformity, then turns around and suggests that community scorn is a justifiable weapon to be used against non-conformists. He talks of liberty, then of the duties we owe for the \\"general welfare.\\" On Liberty could as just as well have been written by a Marxist theorist."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"John Stuart Mill was a liberal's liberal or a socialist's socialist- ahead of his times (or just hanging on Karl Marx's coattail.)

I don't find it a coincidence that Mill was described as a \\"very ladylike person.\\" That seems to explain a great deal of his writing style, which bespeaks a certain dizziness of the mind.Roger Kimball summed up Mill well:Together with Rousseau, John Stuart Mill (1806-73) supplied nearly all of the arguments and most of the emotional weather - the texture of sentiment - that have gone into defining the Left-liberal vision of the world.Mill's peculiar brand of utilitarianism - a cake of Benthamite hedonism glazed with Wordsworthian sentimentality - accounts for part of his appeal: it provides a perfect recipe for embellishing programmatic shallowness with a cosmetic patina of spirituality. It is a recipe that has proven irresistible to those infatuated with the spectacle of their own virtue.Another large part of Mill's appeal rests on his \\"feminism\\" - his conviction, put forward in The Subjection of Women, that differences between the sexes were accidental and that, as Leslie Stephen put it, \\"women could be turned into men by trifling changes in the law\\". Both are indispensable elements in the intoxicating potion that constitutes Mill's appeal and makes much of his thinking seem so contemporary.Mill's arguments and pronouncements about man as a \\"progressive being\\", the extent of individual autonomy, the limits of acceptable moral and legal censure, the importance of innovation and (perhaps his most famous phrase) \\"experiments in living\\" are all familiar to the point of invisibility. Likewise his corollary insistence on the poverty of custom, prejudice and tradition. Mill's contentions on these subjects are nowadays less objects of debate than of reverence. But the public success of Mill's teaching (especially in his manifesto On Liberty) says nothing about the cogency of his arguments. In fact, Mill's central arguments are open to - and have from the beginning been subjected to - serious criticism. Yet they have raged like wildfire through the Western world, consuming everything that stands in their path. Which means, among other things, that they exert an appeal quite distinct from any intellectual merit they may possess.As for the nature of Mill's arguments, consider, for example, his famous plea on behalf of moral, social and intellectual \\"experiments\\". Throughout history, Mill argues, the authors of such innovations have been objects of ridicule, persecution and oppression; they have been ignored, silenced, exiled, imprisoned, even killed. But (Mill continues) we owe every step of progress, intellectual as well as moral, to the daring of innovators. \\"Without them,\\" he writes, \\"human life would become a stagnant pool. Not only is it they who introduce good things which did not before exist; it is they who keep the life in those which already exist.\\" Ergo, innovators - \\"developed human beings\\" is one phrase Mill uses for such paragons - should not merely be tolerated but positively be encouraged.The philosopher David Stove called this the \\"They All Laughed at Christopher Columbus\\" argument. The amazing thing about the success of the Columbus argument is that it depends on premises that are so obviously faulty. Indeed, as Stove observes, a moment's reflection reveals that the Columbus argument is undermined by a downright glaring weakness.Granted that every change for the better has depended on someone embarking on a new departure: well, so too has every change for the worse. And surely, Stove writes, there have been at least as many proposed innovations which \\"were or would have been for the worse as ones which were or would have been for the better\\". This means that we have at least as much reason to discourage innovators as to encourage them, especially when their innovations bear on things as immensely complex as the organisation of society. In On Liberty, Mill presented himself as a prophet of individual liberty. But if liberty was always on Mill's lips, a new orthodoxy was ever in his heart. There is an important sense in which the libertarian streak in On Liberty is little more than a prophylactic against the coerciveness that its assumption of virtuous rationality presupposes. Mill hoped that liberty would replace the reign of prejudice with the reign of reason. In fact, it has had the effect of camouflaging prejudices with rational-sounding rhetoric. The effort to unseat customary practice and belief has resulted not, as Mill predicted, in encouraging a drift towards unanimity but in increasing chaos.Nor is this surprising. As Mill's great critic James Fitzjames Stephen noted, \\"the notorious result of unlimited freedom of thought and discussion is to produce general scepticism on many subjects in the vast majority of minds\\". Such \\"paradoxes\\" (to put it politely) show themselves wherever the constructive part of Mill's doctrine is glimpsed through his cheerleading for freedom and eccentricity.Mill claimed a monopoly on the word \\"rational\\". So long as that monopoly remains unchallenged our paralysis will be complete. The antidote to the moral helplessness that Mill's liberalism generates is not to be found by digging deeper in the trench of liberal rationalisation. On the contrary, it begins with the recognition that no \\"one very simple principle\\" can relieve us of the duties we owe to the inhabited world that we, for this brief while, share with many others.See Kimball's excellent November 1998 article in The New Criterion entitled \\"One very simple principle\\""},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"I don't really like the fact that Mill wasn't religious- I don't believe you can have a just person who doesn't believe in a higher power, but the economics in On Liberty and the politics are amazing.

In other words: government needs to get out of our bidness!"},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"Mill's book, On Liberty, tries to answer the question of what is the legitimate power that government can exercise over the individual . His main argument regarding personal liberty is the harm principle, meaning as long as the individual's actions do not harm other individuals, they shouldn't be restricted from that action. However, Mill doesn't only focus on the philosophical aspect of the role government should have in the individual life, but he also tries to answer more specific issues such as government policies concerning drugs, gambling, prostitution, public education versus private education, the importance of freedom of speech and more. If you're interested in such questions, this book is for you."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"As stated by Mill the topic of On Liberty is the role society should take in interfering with the liberty of an individual, that is, the amount of power that society may legitimately exercise over its people.The sphere of Mill's inquiry is the system of a democracy, where the main danger to individual liberty is that of the \\"tyranny of the majority,\\" in which minorities are subjected to the whims of the majority such that the \\"weaker members of the community\\" are \\"preyed upon by innumerable vultures.\\" Mill's argument is that \\"self-government\\" is not \\"the government of each by himself, but of each by all the rest.\\"Mill's main thesis is that society and the governing bodies have no right to interfere with the liberty of thought, action or individuality in any person save when those liberties may cause harm to others; that \\"over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\\" This is to say that society is unable able to interfere with individuals unless they're harming somebody, not including themselves - a person has every right to do harm to themselves and society may not intervene simply for the good of the individual.Apart from this, Mill also believes that keeping away the \\"tyranny of the majority\\" is good not only for the individuals and the minorities, but for society itself as well; that the argumentation/discussion which leads from freedom of thought is pivotal in the development of the society and truth. It is only in this that societies can avoid stagnation and people can truly learn; they must be able to see both sides of the argument (from people who truly believe them) and the ideas must be allowed to clash, thus, \\"genius can only breathe freely in an atmosphere of freedom.\\"In arguing for freedom of expression Mill argues that because the opinions of the individual may be true (or at least contain some portion of truth) and because human fallibility makes it so there are none fit to judge whether the opinion is true anyway, full freedom must be granted; not only this, but because there are none fit to judge, [according to Mill] there is no absolute certainty.This is all to lead into a sort of Hegelian system which Mill puts forth, noting that both sides of any argument generally only contain a portion of the truth and that it is only by bringing these two ideas together that the full truth can be found; a balance must be found between the ideas. The ideas must clash and in this clashing the synthesis between them will be found.Overall Mill's text is a good read even for people today. The ideas being presented are just as relevant now as they were during Mill's time, such the fact that the voice of third parties is all but crushed in the US's two party system or the discussions over gay marriage, abortion, or even something as small as free speech zones on college campuses. All of these feed back into the issue being discussed by Mill, that is, how much power society should be able to wield over its members and just what is the nature and extent of our liberty.Memorable Quotes:-\\"The liberty of the individual must be thus far limited; he must not make himself a nuisance to other people.\\"-\\"He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that.\\"-\\"If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one person were of contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.\\"-\\"What was not wanted was that the rulers should be identified with the people, that their interests and will should be the interest and will of the nation. The nation did not need to be protected against its own will There was no fear of tyrannizing over itself.\\"Specific CriticismsFrom a secular standpoint I'm not sure how much can be critiqued of Mill's ideas. From a Christian standpoint there are two chief issues which may be taken.The first issue that may be taken is with the idea that \`over himself the individual is sovereign.' This is exactly the mindset which Scripture rails against and sets up as the original sin, to think that we are our own sovereigns, to usurp the sovereignty of God over his creations.The second issue which may be taken is with lack of any solid judge for truth. Simply put, the Christian would argue that God is the standard against which we measure truth, and due to his immutability he stands as a very good standard by which to judge. There is still the factor of fallibility which Mill notes, however this is not to say that truth cannot be discovered or that no statements can be set as entirely false.More reviews at ellipsisomnibus.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"Good and Fast . ... ....... ... .. ..... ........ ...... ....... .. ....... .... .... .. ...... ... ....."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This is the only version of &#34;On Liberty&#34; that I own.

The beauty of this book is that the arguments are still relevant and directly applicable to the issues.

S. Mill published ON LIBERTY in 1859, he was then but the latest in a very long line of liberal theorists that stretched back to Plato and continued intermittenly for the next two millennia. These theorists as did Mill attempted to ascertain what if any was that fine line between the rights of the individual to live unimpeded from the caprices of a ruling state and the duty of that state to maintain the civil order necessary for those rights to exist. That we today still have not defined this line is a testimony to the never ending struggle of thinkers like Mill to present arguments of which each succeeding generation must be made aware.From the day it first appeared in print, readers have been entranced by the clarion call for unrestrained liberty. Mill wrote ON LIBERTY in such a manner that to argue against it suggests that to do so renders one as either a tyrant or a boor. Further, those who question Mill must walk a fine line between not supporting the very tyrannical state against which Mill rails and carrying out the the logical conclusion of accepting his definition of liberty at face value. I question Mill's underlying if unnoticed logic even as I applaud his cheerleading.Mill sees society as a perpetual repressor of the liberty of its citizens. For him, liberty consists of the ability to think and do as one pleases. Barring certain exceptions this liberty is the very foundation of any society that dares to call itself free. Society, then, must bend over backwards to ensure that all possess it. The chief stumbling block in this quest lies less in the individuating traits of people and more in the the tendency of rulers to rely on the heavy hand of custom to maintain its own existence even at the cost of denying liberty to their subjects.Mill sees \\"custom\\" as a dirty word that is all that is wrong with society. Nowhere does he concern himself with any positive connotations. He limits its use only to describe that which has the potential to stamp out every last smidgeon of creativity that might otherwise emerge. He fears that it will be the ruled, and not the rulers, who wish to crush dissent. To protect individuals from custom, Mill states that only those who are daring enough to defy society may do so. He calls such dissenters as \\"eccentrics.\\" For him, it is a term of praise that brings to mind heirs of a very long line of liberal thought from ancient Greek days. Just as Mill ignores the reality that custom has two divergent senses so does he similarly ignore the same about eccentrics. Clearly, if history proves anything, it is that those who have differed in ways that are bestial are about as numerous as those that are beneficial. When Mill champions the absolute right of eccentrics to challenge custom, he opens the door to tear down the bonds of society and not erect anything of a compensatory nature. When he argues that liberty must not be used to harm others, he is using a red herring to divert attention from the grim realization that to be different means far more than than saying so."},{"Title":"The reformers and their stepchildren","review":"A group of us studied this relatively unknown book several years ago, and I delight in giving copies to selective readers."},{"Title":"The reformers and their stepchildren","review":"Verduin's thesis in The Reformers and Their Stepchildren is the Church at large should reach back to the \\"stepchildren\\" of the Reformation to more fully appreciate the origin and meaning of many of the beliefs about soteriology and ecclesiology that we take for granted today. The author begins his work with a grand introduction, outlining what he has set out to accomplish in his writing and the course he intends to take to illustrate his thesis. In this introductory material, he also explains who the Stepchildren of the Reformers were -Christians who objected to the combination of state and church power-- and why he calls them \\"stepchildren,\\" rather than some other name.Once he has introduced his topic, Verduin lays the material out by examining the meaning and background of various terms the Reformers and Catholic churches used to refer to these believers outside their folds. In each case, he describes the theological position the various groups outside the state approved churches took as a reflection of a term of derision.In his first chapter, called Donatisten, for instance, the author begins at the beginning of the Donatist movement, explaining their origin in relationship to the merging of church and state power under Constantine. Verduin explains while the Church was persecuted, Christians felt no need to align themselves with state power -in fact, they believed themselves to be set apart from the state, using Jesus' statement, \\"give unto Caesar that which is Caesar's, and unto God that which is God's,\\" as their basis for taking this view.With the conversion of the leaders of the Roman Empire to Christianity, however, everyone was made to be a Christian whether or not they liked or believed it. The Christian religion was turned to the same purpose as the Roman religion before it had been, to bring together disparate people into a single body. The Donatists rebelled against this idea, stating this merging actually was a form of a fall, harming the purity of the cause of Christ.Verduin calls this combination of state and religious power sacrilism, after the concept of sacrilizing an object, or rather making a secular object an object of religious worship or affection. He carries this terminology throughout the rest of the book, with chapters on the name Stabler, Catharer, and others.The primary strength of Verduin's argument is his command and use of the original source materials combined with his understanding of the problems with combining religious and secular power under a single structure. He understands his topic well, and uses his understanding to present the best possible argument against combining church and state.The strength of his argument is also undergirded by his ability to understand why the Reformers took the opportunity to combine state and religious power in a single structure; it is easy to look back with disdain on these mistakes, it would have been far harder to undertake a course that is any different in the actual circumstances the Reformers faced.He is also able to understand and explain the connection between this choice to connect church and state with its theological implications. For instance, the tie between baptism and circumcision was primarily conceived as a way to bring people into a common bond of experience, and the importance of infant baptism related to its value as a rite of passage from outsider to citizen. That baptism became a major battleground between the Reformers and their Stepchildren is no wonder considering the implications for state solidarity placed on the shoulders of the rite of baptism.The two primary weaknesses of the book are its repetitive nature -primarily brought about because of the organization of the material-- and the final chapter, where the author attempts to construct a case for Christian socialism. Given the climate of the times in which the book was written, the middle of the 1960's, it's understandable Verduin thought socialistic governmental systems were bound to be victorious, and that these systems were actually supported Scripturally. Looking back from the vantage of 50 years of communitarian history, combined with a better understanding of the nature of the book of Acts, today's reader can see the weakness of this argument.The point Verduin is making throughout this book is of great relevance to the climate of the United States in the first decade of the third century, as well as to my study of Christian history.The first point I confronted reading this is the modern church must be very careful of using state power to achieve its ends. The more moral the ends might seem, the more strongly the Christian must resist the temptation to use state power to achieve those ends. A careful separation needs to be made between evangelism, theology/ecclesiology, and building a society with acceptable moral boundaries. While the third is a responsibility of the state, the first two are clearly not.The second point I confronted was the impact of mixing the state and religion on Christianity itself. When the state and Christianity combine, it is always the state, the political power, that wins. Theology is always and ever bent to the shape the state most wants to support the survival of the power of the state itself. This might even be seen in the high decades of church influence in modern America, when there were censors on television and only Protestants could be elected to high office. How much of the thinking of theologians of that time impacted by their desire to use the levers of state power to encourage Christian belief?Finally, there are grave lessons to be learned in the current state of America, and the probable outcomes of our current trajectory in regards to state and religion. When Christianity was dispensed with as the national religion, it was not replaced by nothing. In Christianity's stead a new secular religion has sprung up. This new religion is using the power of the state to destroy Christianity in a Biblical sense, and replace it with a substitute more acceptable to the continuance of state power in its current form. Christians in America might soon find themselves in the same position as the Stepchildren were in relation to the Reformers in the near future.A sobering thought indeed."},{"Title":"The reformers and their stepchildren","review":"Take note please - these are the views of an unregenerate Gentile.POTS/OSAS means 'Perseverence Of The Saints'/'Once Saved Always Saved'.I am not keen on the term 'Stepchildren' - I feel it implies inferiority to the 'Magisterial Reformers'. In denying themselves,taking up their cross and following Messiah Jesus,the Anabaptists (among others) were simply measuring up to His yardstick (Luke 14:25-35).Leonard's book is a rich crop of nutritious information. In order to reap the full benefit,read it through the first time at a BRISK pace,in order to break up the soil ; in order to aquaint yourself with his keywords/terms/phrases (e.g. 'sacralist'). Read it through a second or even third time at a SLOWER pace,in order to harvest all the information.Consider these quotes in regard to COERCION :They [the leaders of the 'Magisterial Reformation' - the men behind POTS/OSAS] constantly urged the magistrate to draw the blood of the opposition' (Chapter 1).Zwingli's successor,Henry Bullinger,said this : 'It is wrong,say they [OPPONENTS of the Magisterial Reformation],to compel anyone by force or coercion to embrace the faith,or,to put anyone to death because of erring faith'. (Chapter 2).If Leonard has his facts straight,and if a spade is still a spade,what is to be OBJECTIVELY made of that fruit information? Many POTS/OSAS-adherents are unaware of the coercive methods used to establish that teaching (and those who taught it). This book tells the story.Consider this quote in regard to CONDUCTUAL-AVERAGISM :'To Schwenkfeld...Luther acknowledged that \\"among us there is no betterment of life.\\" ' (Chapter 3)That is a comment of great significance ; it shows (I believe) there is something SERIOUSLY LACKING in 'Reformed Theology'.Is Messiah Jesus likely to build His Body by the very means for which His Father brought the flood ?! (Genesis 6:11-14 - see also Proverbs 6:16-17,Psalm 11:4-5,Zechariah 4:6.) In the light of Matthew 12:33-37,would it not be a step in the right direction for admirers of the 'Magisterial Reformers' to humbly and objectively consider the horrendous means by which 'Augustinianism' and 'Calvinism' got established in the first place ? Given the very HEART of the narrow Way is AGAPE (Matthew 22:34-40,1 John 4:16),why would any authentic disciple of Messiah Jesus want to sit at the feet of men of violence ???The discussion of coercion and conductual-averagism is very important reading indeed. Leonard's book is strongly recommended in itself,but complemented by another three :Our Hands Are Stained with Bloodby Michael L Brown,Lost Heritage Pbby Kin tan,andPagan Christianity?: Exploring the Roots of Our Church Practicesby Frank Viola and George Barna.A well-rounded,WEIGHTY (outside the box/wineskin) understanding of the narrow Way comes from OBJECTIVE personal study of Holy Scripture ; outside of those INSPIRED words,some books (like bricks) collectively serve to build a fallible but robust defence against some of the (sincere or insincere) SUBJECTIVE misconceptions that have arisen over the last 1900 years. Everything written in that collection (indeed in any book about the narrow Way) must be tested by Holy Scripture,by God's TRUTH - not men's (well-intentioned,but) UNINSPIRED wineskins ; above all,by the words of the One Teacher - Messiah Jesus (Matthew 23:8). One side of the INSPIRED Bible coin (so to speak) can lead to legalism or license - it takes BOTH sides of the TRUTH to properly nourish and equip a Second Covenant soldier of Messiah Jesus. This book on COERCION and CONDUCTUAL-AVERAGISM,is one of the collection.(The Bible coin : Matthew 4:5-6/Matthew 4:7 ; Galatians 3:15-18/Hebrews 8:8 ; John 3:17/Acts 10:42 ; John 3:16/Luke 13:3 ; Mark 8:12/Hebrews 2:4 ; John 6:37/Luke 14:26 ; Matthew 11: 30/ Luke 14:25-35 ; Acts 2:38/Acts 19:2 ; 1 Corinthians 14:18,26-33/1 Corinthians 14:19,40 ; Titus 3:5/Ephesians 2:10 ; John 1:17/Matthew 28:20 ; Matthew 7:1-5/1 Corinthians 5:9-13 ; John 10:11/John 12:24 ; John 10:10/1 Corinthians 5:14-15 ; Matthew 25:31-46 / Revelation 20:1-10 ; 1 Thessalonians 1:10/Revelation 6:9-11 ; 1 John 1:6-9/Hebrews 10:26-31 ; Romans 8:11/John 15:6 ; Romans 8:30/Romans 11:11,19-22 ; 1 John 4:18/1 Peter 1:17 - and so on.)Take note please - these are the views of an unregenerate Gentile."},{"Title":"The reformers and their stepchildren","review":"I found getting past the first chapter horribly painful. A required read for school, this is hthe only arena I woud read this book. Graduate level writing doesn't always mean you have to have your readers keep a dictionary with them to get through every other sentence. The account of history was written in a very boring fashion. I issued three stars because I love the topic."},{"Title":"The reformers and their stepchildren","review":"Leonard Verduin's work, The Reformers and Their Stepchildren, is a rather sweeping work, examining the theology and practice of the Anabaptists (and other reformational and pre-reformational \`heretics', all lumped into the general category of \\"the Reformer's stepchildren\\"). He explores the historical foundations and reasoning behind all their nicknames by a clever examination of all the slanderous descriptors used in reference to them.In the first chapter, Verduin delivers an explanation of Donatism in the times of Constantine and examines how many opposed the idea of Christianity becoming the new sacralism of the Protestants. He explains how there always, in some way or another, was a remnant who challenged the institutionalization of the church under Constantine, instead claiming that the true church consisted of only the believers, and how this remnant then emerged in the reformation and was called Donatisten.The second chapter explores the Stabler, or \\"staff carriers\\". He comments on how the Anabaptists and others did not want to allow the state the carry the sword for the purpose of coercing people to belief in the gospel or suppressing heresy, but instead held to an idea of voluntary belief, for which many of them were killed by the state.The third chapter brings the discussion to the Catharer (\\"the cleansed\\"). He states that the Catharer rejected perfectionism but also rejected the idea of conductual-averagism, with was essentially righteousness judged by the \`lowest common denominator'. In opposition to this, the Catharer taught that those that claimed to be Christians needed to behave like Christians, and pagan priests were no priests at all.The fourth chapter examines the Sacramentschwarmer (\\"Sacramentarians\\"). Verduin explains that Sacramentarianism was a flat denial of salvation by sacramental manipulation. Beyond that, he comments on how the \`stepchildren' opposed the administration of communion as an act that had any power in itself for the administration of grace.In the fifth chapter Verduin discusses the Winckler (\\"those who met in the corners\\"). The Winckler were those who met in \`house churches', having unsanctioned communion and religious gatherings. Beyond that, they were those who preached without commission from the church.The sixth chapter addresses the Wiedertaufer (\\"Anabaptists\\"). He explains how the administration of pedo-baptism was an issue of societal control, and interesting how many of the reformers \`towed the party line', though they secretly disagreed with the teaching of pedobaptism. Verduin also explains the difference between anti-pedobaptism and anti-Constantinianism, the latter of which was really what was being rebelled against.Chapter seven observes the Kommunisten (\\"the community of goods\\"). He explains how they Kommunisten idea was a reaction to the excessive wealth and pomp of the clergy, who lived in luxury while all other people lived in squalor. Also, he comments on how this idea led to common accusation of the communal sharing of wives.The eighth chapter closes out the book with examining several of their peculiarities. Verduin talks about the Rottengeister (\\"people who agitate within a society to form a party\\") and comments on 4 distinct, separate marks of the \`Stepchildren'. He gives time to their refusal of oath taking, Menno Simons neo-docetic views of Christ, cross bearing and suffering and the missionary nature of the Rottengeister.On the whole, the book was quite a strong work, with strengths that far outweighed the weaknesses. Verduin seemed to take a fairly balanced approach to history, attempting to have objectivity in areas where it would be easy to want to tread lightly out of fear of mass offense. I respected how he admitted some of the failings of Calvin, Luther and the other reformers, and that he admitted how today we would be embarrassed by some of the things that they did and wrote. One can only imagine how any \`foul' talk of John Calvin could offend the pants of some people in certain theological circles, but Verduin seemed to be quite accurate and fair in his laying forth of history \`as it was'. I also appreciated how he commented on how the reformers were so emotionally involved with the battle of the second front that they were unable to pass a fair judgment on it. It's easy to look back, see all the blood that was shed, and point fingers of judgment (that are fairly deserved). One must remember the time in which those men lived, the unfathomable task of ecclesial reform that was ahead of them, and the threat of death that loomed over them from the Roman Catholic Church. Beyond that, for all the possible finger pointing to the past, one could definitely argue that many from the past could equally point ahead in shame at the modern church that tolerates everything and anything, and places issues that they deemed worthy of defending unto death \\"on the $.99 menu\\" of theology.For all his strengths, Verduin had a weakness or two. He did seem to be superlative with the descriptive language at times. An example is his comparing the medieval church to a totalitarianism, complete with \\"brainwashing\\" (45). Leonard may be correct in his assessment, but his articulation carries connotations that seem a little too Hollywood and are easily make the middle ages sound a bit like a comic book. I was also wondering exactly what he meant when he commented how the Old Testament was exceeded by the New (211). Not a big deal (most likely reflecting a covenant theology understanding), but just a question.On the whole, I found that I learned much from The Reformers and Their Stepchildren. I really appreciated the opening explanation of the sacral society, explaining how a society was \\"held together by a religion to which all the members of that society are committed\\" (pg. 23). I also enjoyed the explanation of the idea of idolothyta; how in a sacral society, all meat was placed before an idol (27). He had an interesting take on Constantine's adoption of Christianity as a new sacralism in order to unite the empire (31), and it was certainly interesting how he explained the significance of the Anabaptists speaking, praying and reading the scripture in the vulgar tongue. The most dominant lesson I learned from Verduin was the one that resonates throughout the entire semester: heresy is always accompanied by trifling or acrobatic hermeneutics. With the improvement of proper, applied hermeneutics always comes improvement of doctrine (on paper and in flesh). I must include final thing that I learned:\\"When the Waldensians wish to go to their conventicle they first rub an ointment on their palms...as well as on a stick, and ointment supplied to them by the devil. Then they straddle this stick and fly to whatever place they wish to go, over cities and forests and lakes...They congregate about the tables decked with wine and bread. Devils in the form of billy-goats, or dogs or apes are present; sometimes in the form of a man...They worship these, kissing the billy-goat's derriere, with candles in their hands...Then they tread on the cross, spitting on it despite of Jesus Christ and the holy Trinity. Then they present their buttocks to the sky, in derision of God...\\" (175)That is definitely something new that I took from Verduin. The Anabaptists were the original 'witches' ('Wicca' in it's modern sense didn't exist back then; 'Wicca' was simply run-of-the-mill 'Paganism'). In one sense, it's simply ludicrous and an entertaining quote, but on another sense it's hard to believe that sane people would invent such bizarre and unbelievable stories in order to attack a deviant sect of theology. The outright propagation of clear and explicit deceit, especially in the form of such \`fantasy', amazes me almost as much as the penchant for the proletariat to believe such nonsense. Sadly, that kind of horribly baseless exaggeration exists to this day."},{"Title":"The reformers and their stepchildren","review":"Around 10 years ago I borrowed a copy of this book to read.After reading it once I borrowed it again to re-read. The authordid a great service in uncovering the European historical records on Christian sects which, during the 400AD to post-Reformation period, were accused as 'heretics' by the 'church'(the one wielding worldly power and influence). It is an excellent scholarly book(the author has the entire text and footnotes in the original languages) covering in detail much of the historical context for the doctrinal fight which the followers of Jesus Christ have had in 'contending the faith' since the Apostle-age. Highly recommended!!- and I hope it's obvious historical value can merit a reprinting."},{"Title":"The reformers and their stepchildren","review":"Leonard Verduin seeks to explore many facets of Anabaptist history, beliefs, and relationship to the mainline Protestant Reformation. He does so by examining a number of derogatory terms applied to Anabaptists by the leaders of the Protestant Reformation (e.g. Luther, Calvin, & Zwingli). The whole book seeks to portray the Anabaptists as existing primarily as a protest against \\"Christian sacralism\\": the unscriptural system in which church and state are united (beginning with Constantine, carried forward by the Roman Catholic Church in the medieval period, and emulated by the Protestant Reformers). There is certainly a wealth of historical research here, but there were a few things that took away from my enjoyment of the book.1. The author views virtually everything about the Anabaptists through the lens of \\"sacralism vs. separation of church and state\\" which means he just argues the same point over and over again from slightly different points of view rather than actually examining various facets of the Anabaptists.2. The author is so obsessed with showing that most groups labeled as \\"heretics\\" down through the ages espoused major Anabaptist doctrines that he glosses over major doctrinal aberrations in some of these groups (aberrations that probably would have horrified the Anabaptists).3. Major quotes in the frequent footnotes are left untranslated. I could pick my way through the French and Latin ones, but I could not read the far more numerous Dutch and German quotes.Overall: Lots of great historical research, but the author's obsession with the evils of \\"Christian sacralism\\" is more on display than the actual history and beliefs of the Anabaptists, and unless you can read Dutch and German you will miss out on many crucial quotes"},{"Title":"The reformers and their stepchildren","review":"By the author's own admission, the radical reformers (\\"the stepchildren\\") receive a more sympathetic treatment in this book than that which is common. But, as the book amply demonstrates from direct quotes from all sides, there are two good reasons for this treatment: (1) the history as written by the \\"winners\\" at the time (the mainline reformers) is largely slanderous--ungenerous and inaccurate; this brings some balance. (2) History has largely proved the radical reformers correct. Little by little, conservative evangelicalism has adopted the very precepts for which these radical reformers stood, and for which they were persecuted--and at times murdered--by the popular heroes of the reformation.It has given me a great understanding of the historical background of the Reformation, including the pre-Reformation ideals of the radicals that can be traced back to the time of Constantine. It has also given a better understanding of what was at stake and in the minds of the founders of this country where--finally--the great experiment of a non-sacralist state was attempted and blossomed.It also serves as a warning to all generations that otherwise noble men can have blind spots that make them wrong, embarrassingly wrong, in certain areas. Unfortunately, such men can argue for such false views with just as effective rhetoric as the truth, and lead the impressionable masses to do unspeakable horrors. For the committed evangelical Christian, it is a warning to be wary of those with eloquence of speech and always search the Scriptures as the final authority--much like the radical reformers were committed to."},{"Title":"The reformers and their stepchildren","review":"This book is a worthwhile read on the subject of Anabaptism and the Reformers. Rev. Verduin has done considerable research. However, with respect to a related matter, infant baptism, the book contains a flaw. It attributes a quote to the Reformer Zwingli incorrectly. The practice of infant baptism should be cleared of this error. Dialogos Studies has done research into this matter. Don't let this error mislead you!"},{"Title":"The reformers and their stepchildren","review":"This book was recommended to me by my pastor, and I actually got it from the publishers - The Baptist Standard Bearer. Amazon sells it for a few bucks less, I think. I have read several works on non-conforming or dissenting Christians, and this one is probably the best so far. Basically, author Leonard Verduin traces Christian dissenters and non-conformists throughout history beginning with Rome becoming a \\"Christian\\" empire under Constantine. From then on, he argues, there has always been an underground \\"Free Church\\" of believers who have consistently resisted the abuses of the church/state societies of Europe. He gives these dissenters the names \\"Second Front\\", \\"Restorationists\\", or \\"Stepchildren of the Reformers.\\" They eventually became known as Anabaptists. Up until very recently, church history has held Anabaptists in contempt, either for being too radical or for espousing outright heresy. They were an embarrassment to the rest of Christendom for their uncompromising views about what the church believes and how it should behave. Verduin's overarching goal is twofold: First, to prove that the Anabaptists have been wrongly maligned because of the gross misunderstanding of their theology and practice. Secondly, he tries to prove that those past and present churches (and specifically the Roman Catholic Church) who either try to dominate or capitulate to secular governments are not true churches (though he never asserts that all members of these churches are not Christians). He says that Martin Luther, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin, and the other major Reformers ultimately failed to fully restore the church to it's original and truest form - that of the primitive Christian church. He divides the chapters of the book into 8 basic distinctives of the Anabaptists and their like-minded contemporaries (Waldensians, Donatists, etc.).Verduin's basic theory throughout the book is not new. It is loosely related to the Old Landmarkist Baptist theory called the \\"Jerusalem-Jordan-John\\" (JJJ) hypothesis. Landmarkists claimed that the Baptist church has always been the only true church of Christ, arguing that it was Baptists, though not always in name, who had existed all along since the baptism of Christ by John the Baptist. Of course, this fallacious \\"JJJ\\" theory has long since been abandoned by all but the most hardcore Landmarkists. Verduin's more moderate theory here cannot be so easily dismissed. His points are very well documented and he argues for them convincingly.I gave the book four stars because a novice to this subject would have a rough time reading this if he/she were not familiar with the subject already. Verduin assumes the reader knows much about the Reformation and about theological issues of the day, like transubstantiation, \\"sacralism\\", pedo- versus credobaptism, and hermeneutics, to name a few.

Its vocabulary and syntax are meant for the more educated reader, and it is a shame the foreign-language footnotes are not translated for the English-speaking reader, but the message of the book is one that should not be lost.

One enjoys being the observer to a fascinating colloquy between a French Buddhist monk and a Vietnamese-born astrophysicist who compare and contrast the teachings of Buddhism with the latest theoretical understandings of quantum physics. Like most intelligent dialogues, it is an exploration and sharing of ideas, and as a result, one comes away not only with more answers but even more questions.Comparisons to Fritjof Capras 'The Tao Of Physics' are inevitable, but this reminds me more of a little known film called 'Mindwalk', which is esentially a trialogue between a scientist, a poet, and a poltician. While I enjoyed that film very much, 'Quantum and the Lotus' is the exploration I'd hoped to see when I first watched 'Mindwalk'.In 'Q&L;', you see more ways in which East and West are coming together and interacting. We get a brief glimpse of science and spirituality co-existing peacefully and begin to see the outlines of how the two domains might even inform and nurture one another. It is another example of the Integral approach that is so needed at this time in the world.The conversational quality of the text gives it a liveliness and spontaneity that often lacks in books of this sort.

Reading this dialogue between a French Buddhist monk resident in Nepal, trained as a molecular biologist, and a Vietnamese astrophysicist raised as Buddhist and now teaching in America, I found a similar meeting of minds, enriched by the depth three hundred pages can offer for such wide-ranging explorations into the infinitely small and infinitely large, as Heisenberg and Bohr meet Einstein or Plato before all bow to the Buddha.So Ricard would have it. Fifteen topical chapters progress through the Big Questions as science tries, for Thuan, to live up to the Platonically inspired models that appear to underlie the visible realm for many physicists and mathematicians. He articulates this worldview eloquently, as when citing Einstein's vision of viewing the watch's face, watching its hands move, and hearing its ticking without ever being able to open up the mechanism inside. Ricard counters this doggedly with a dual vision of impermanence underlying all existence, and interdependence on the quantum level linking all the universe. This precedes the Dalai Lama's 2006 \\"The Universe in a Single Atom\\" (reviewed by me 9-2011) but compliments it well. In fact, it betters it, for the back-and-forth between monk and scientist pushes both farther; also see Ricard's spirited discussion with his father, political philosopher Jean-Francois Revel, in 2000's \\"The Monk and the Philosopher\\" (reviewed by me 2009).Both Ricard and Thuan explain their concepts energetically, and I was never bored, even if this took me awhile to finish, as many pages merited close attention. I found clear presentations of Bohr's Compatability and Heisenberg's Uncertainty principles, as well as astutely delivered summations of astrophysics and time-space from Planck measurements onward. Thuan insists it seems on a Big Bang and leans towards a Big Crunch, but he accepts a Big Expansion as also possible--as of the writing of this book ca. 2001 it appears the data's still debated. Ricard defaults often to Buddhist cosmology not in its classical sense, but in the manner in which nothing's inherently existing, and no steady states endure. He tends to get the upper hand in the dialogue, and I wondered if he had final say over the book--it felt as if tilted towards his stance.The chapters do roam about, and some topics such as the beauty of mathematical theories or the structure of mathematics vis-a-vis Godel's Incompleteness Theorem appeared underexplored. Some chapters end a bit suddenly, and I was curious if the authors were discussing this and making a transcription, or if, given the heavy use of quotations, sending each other drafts of talking points that they edited into one document. However produced, as they note, we are limited in what we conceive to how we perceive, and one closes this thought-provoking exchange wondering if Ricard's \\"dharma\\" itself is but a limited creation of the human longing for meaning, compared or contrasted with the laws that Thuan values in his everyday analysis as a scientist, far from Ricard's Asian monastery."},{"Title":"The Quantum and the Lotus: A Journey to the Frontiers Where Science and Buddhism Meet","review":"This book started very disappointingly, with what I felt was a lot of leading the reader to conclusions. However, the authors seemed to abandon that tendency after the first few chapters. Certainly, there is a lot of text that reads like a sales brochure for Buddhism. There are a number of areas where they run off on tangents about loving your fellow man and achieving enlightenment and nirvana.Ignoring all that, there are many really thought-provoking and interesting discussions within, on the nature of the universe and our place in it. These authors get much more philosophical than the typical science text would, and that presents a much different perspective that's worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Quantum and the Lotus: A Journey to the Frontiers Where Science and Buddhism Meet","review":"A book that most people should read as it is a book most people think about once in their lives.

Their dialogue covers a broad range of ontological philosophies and questions such as: what does it mean to be human; the origin of the Universe; the existence of a creator; interconnectivity and interdependence of the entire Universe; the nature of atoms and subatomic particles; string theory and impermanence; levels of consciousness and reincarnation; objective and subjective reality; the illusion of time; cause and effect; consciousness in machines and reflective consciousness; mathematical principles; contemplation through scientific principles; relativity of beauty; and the nature of spiritual and altruistic paths.The Objective Perspective (I have many contentions with this material, so skip and go to another review if you are looking for brevity and simplicity):In the initial chapters of the book some of the Buddhist's arguments are so vague and verbally nullifying that it makes it difficult to ascertain complete meaning. It is as if he is merely a philosophical riddle generator and produces a product of incomprehensible and proliferate analogies and metaphors. As the book progresses, these become less abundant and more along the lines of comprehension. It makes one wonder if this is some inherent property of being a Buddhist.Also, early on, it appears that the conversations are far from an exchange of ideas but dominated by Buddhist principles and ideology. So, in the beginning, there is no \\"Quantum\\", there is only \\"Lotus\\".The reincarnation subject is a bit of theory that I cannot attend. While I do believe in Jung's collective unconscious, reincarnation is outside of this realm. I believe that no properties of consciousness can be transferred to varying levels of existence, or lateral transfer for that matter. Consciousness in the sentient and reflective beings is cultured in the somatic vessel to become what it is; in this sense consciousness has an exclusive \\"serial-number\\" that will never be replicated. This is the only impossibility that I believe exists in the Universe, the replication of a personalized consciousness. As close to concurrence with the idea of reincarnation that I can get is that I do believe that We (sentient and reflective beings-note this is not necessarily an anthropocentric version) are the Universe's consciousness manifested, and thus we are the gods. The somatic vessel is a way to culture energy of the Universe and exert its force upon the evolution of it in a NOVEL way. My theory on death at the moment is that when we, the personalized consciousness, die the essence that is this energy retreats into the \\"void\\" of the Universe through the vortex of the DNA (influenced by an excerpt from the book \\"The Human Antennae\\") and subatomic particles. The nature and culture of the personalized consciousness affects the nature of action in the Universe, so the acceptance into the Void is objective, good or evil flows into this and has influence upon the Universe. So in summary the energy goes back into the SYSTEM. This is more inspiring than becoming an animal if we do not \\"purify our consciousness\\" (196) in this life.Another area that I disagree with Mathieu is on the developing format of consciousness and machines. While it is obvious that we are eons from creating conscious computers or robots, I do not believe this is impossible. What if computers are able to have billions of years to evolve, obviously by our science and intervention, could one day they reach the complexity of what is needed to develop consciousness? Has not the inanimate become the animate through this course of evolution, in relation to the extent of time needed for complexity to arise? If consciousness pervades the Universe, what principle of nature would inhibit computer systems of billions of years of evolution from tapping into it? How will the pervasion and immersion of the internet aid this? How will this affect the evolution of the Universe itself? If we do not know how consciousness has arisen in humans then consequently we cannot know whether computer and robotic systems have the potential of being self-aware with further evolution.The end notes are a bit irritating, I prefer footnotes. The end notes in this case are utilized too excessively for continuance of a point, that obviously they feel is not essential but important, rather than simply references of material. This is exploited in this book. Actually this is probably the most flagrant use of this I have ever seen. Personally I like reading the continuances of explanation, which is why footnotes are more convenient.Karma does not exist; it in itself is an illusion. Karma is not a physical law of the Universe; it is merely a psychological law that is based on the interpretation of the event that has occurred. If one has a level of guilt residual of an action the entity has committed they are likely to see a negative occurrence as a \\"karmic debt or penitence\\" If one has a level of elation from doing something altruistic then the result of something positive happening is going to be interpreted as a \\"karmic dividend.\\" This is the nature of psychology, not the nature of the Universe.On page 201 Mathieu erroneously concludes that, \\"Enlightenment means that the darkness of ignorance has been eradicated.\\" The \\"darkness of ignorance\\" is an excessive and rampant infestation. The more you endeavor to learn the more knowledge you procure, but ironically and simultaneously you inseminate a level of ignorance as well by invoking wonder and further questions of new which the subject you are ignorant. Enlightenment is elusive. Who determines who is Enlightened, because are we not all ignorant to some extent, ergo, \\"the darkness of ignorance\\" cannot be eradicated, for if Enlightenment could be eradicated, NOVELTY would cease. In defense of the idea of seeking spiritual and intellectual accordance I would pose a more holistic axiom: \\"[Clarity] means that the darkness of ignorance has been [Mitigated].\\" Obtaining spiritual and intellectual serenity is an indefinite process, not a destination, but nonetheless, not a futile pursuit; the two paths are indivisible and eternally intertwined. To choose one as immanent over the other states that \\"the ultimate nature of reality\\" (208) has been discovered, if it has please inform me of what it is rendered as.Lastly, Mathieu has a devoid and stereotypical view of psychology. On page 249 in the chapter titled \\"Reason and Contemplation\\" he, in the first paragraph, disparages psychology by conjecturing: \\"The cognitive sciences try to explain the mental processes...[and] their principal aim still isn't to transform people.\\" To me this is odious for an intellectual to make such an insolvent conclusion. Apparently, he does not know much about the varying fields of psychology, especially a specific one called Humanistic Psychology.The Subjective Perspective:Earlier I alluded to the enigma of the Buddhist's use of metaphors and analogies in the early chapters, later in other chapters they are more comprehensible and avail understanding of the material.I did not know how enthralling reading a dialogue would be, but it was quite interesting and held my attention. This format influenced me to think about my perspectives on some of the issues and some of them are represented above. This book has aided my understanding of both Buddhism and quantum and relativistic physics in a very general way that has intrigued my interest in both. Now that I have some insight into these facets I am going to continue further study in them and the references from this book have given me direction.Mathieu has altered my perspective of objective reality and I now see \\"things\\" as manifested actions. While I do view the Universe and its \\"things\\" from an interdependent perspective, I never correlated that to the quantum level. It makes so much sense from a quantum perspective, everything is in a state of motion; we just perceive in the relativistic form that things are solid and stationary for the most part. The book proves its thesis, which is displayed in the subtitle, and it does this by and through showing the holistic side of the Universe and that objects are actions that are interdependent and not intrinsically existing itself.Overall these philosophical discussions are beneficial to the thinking mind and incites one to think outside of the context that we have been taught and have become disillusioned to believe. In closing I will leave the reader with a few, of many, profound axioms that I found to be highly resonant from the book:\\"Because of a lack of inquiry, we eagerly accept that things are as they seem.\\" (90)\\"[It is] our understanding that determines our universe.\\" (226)\\"Science can operate without spirituality. Spirituality can exist without science. But man, to be complete, needs both.\\" (282)[This is book #1 of The Academy of Philosophical Rapport's monthly book choice.

Most of the many books on this subject deal with religion in general terms or concentrate on Western theistic religions (primarily Christianity and Judaism.)This book is a fascinating discussion of Buddhism and science told through articulate and intelligent exchanges between Ricard and Thuan. Ricard earned a PhD in chemistry in France before leaving a promising career to become a Tibetan Buddhist monk. Thuan is a Vietnamese who became enamored of at an early age and is a world-renowned astrophysicist and writer.The most important sections of this book are the introduction, which sets the problem, and the conclusion. Science does not satisfy the spiritual needs of man -- his need to end suffering, understand himself, and the nature of his world -- to find meaning. How is it possible to find religious meaning in a world where science seems to be the only source of knowledge?In his introduction, Ricard argues that science and Buddhism approach reality in different ways. He finds Buddhism non-dogmatic, willing to accept scientific findings and based on an introspection into the human condition with Buddha as a guide. Thuan agrees that human beings need spirituality as well as science.There are fifteen chapters discussing with impressing erudition specific scientific issues and how Buddhists might view them. We get discussions of the &quot;big bang&quot; theory of quantum mechanics, the nature of time, computers and thought, and the nature of consciousness, among other topics. For a book cast in the form of a discussion, the references are copious.There is a great deal of discussion of Buddhism's focus on indeterminacy and change and its relation to science. Also, Ricard focuses of the deep and difficult Buddhist teaching of dependent arising. He tries to argue that this teaching shows the untenability of scientific (or metaphysical) realism -- the view that science describes an independently existing reality.Ricard also takes issue with theism and here he gets something of a disagreement from Thuan who believes in a Spinozistic concept of God (which needs explaining) and is something of a scientific realist.There is a wonderful summation by Thusn: &quot;Made of stardust, we share the same cosmic history as the lions on the savannas and the lavenders in the fields. We are all connected through time and space, and thus interdependent.(page 280)Some of this book is highly technical and Ricard, is spite of himself is over dogmatic in places. This is still a wonderful book. It teaches a &quot;secular spirituality&quot; in the words of Ricard and may be read with benefit by those with no particular commitment to Buddhism."},{"Title":"The Quantum and the Lotus: A Journey to the Frontiers Where Science and Buddhism Meet","review":"I was a bit skeptical upon first seeing this book. I worried about another floofy book about New Age/Western Buddhism. Thankfully, my fears were unfounded. This book is a fairly dense \\"argument\\" between the present positions of astrophysics/quantum physics and the Buddhist metaphysics. I'm a philosopher by trade and I read a lot of popular science books (especially in physics) so I managed well with the text. However, I think it may frustrate some persons without any background. So, ultimately, unless you are somewhat familiar with contemporary physics, you might want, regrettably, to skip this one.The Buddhist in the book is a very intelligent chap, more than capable of explaining/defending his position. And he successfully presents Buddhism in a very intellectual manner. I learned a lot about the Buddhist position with regard to cosmology - which is wonderful because that's what I hoped to get out of the book. I think this book should quiet some of the stereotypes of Buddhists... and it would be most enjoyed by persons who do not draw a hard absolute line between natural science and religious practice."},{"Title":"The Quantum and the Lotus: A Journey to the Frontiers Where Science and Buddhism Meet","review":"I found this book frustrating pretty much from start to finish, but I was determined to persevere until the end, and I'm glad I did. My frustration was caused by several factors:- The book is presented as a dialogue between a Buddhist (originally trained in science) and a scientist (mainly an astrophysicist), and it often seemed like the two authors were talking past each other, rather than really communicating.- The dialogue format often seemed like a disorganized way to present the ideas, making the presentation fragmented and repetitive.- I particularly felt that Ricard's presentation of Buddhist ideas was overcomplicated (compared to other books I've read).- For the sake of coherence and clarity, it seemed that the book would have been better if written by a single author well acquainted with both Buddhism and science, and organized in a more \\"standard\\" way, rather than a dialogue.- Because of the relatively high intellectual level of the book, a considerable prior knowledge of both Buddhism and science (especially physics) is needed to really benefit from the book. My background was enough to get me past this hurdle, but this definitely limits the audience for the book.- Largely for the reasons noted above, the book took me a fairly long time to finish.So, considering all of these apparent negatives, how did the book manage to earn 4 stars? In an odd way, somewhat reminiscent of Zen koans, the struggle involved in reading the book made me work especially hard to understand the authors, and in the process I definitely learned something. I ultimately found that there is indeed much wisdom in this book, but it's somewhat buried, so one has to do some mining to bring it out.Overall, I can recommended the book as a useful resource for readers with a sincere interest in Buddhism and science, and especially comparison between the two.

The authors explain modern quatum mechanics and shows how the notion of&quot;inherent emptiness&quot; is reflected in a scientific theory that has been rigorously tested.What I learned from this book is a new way of looking at reality.This reality is a non-material , non -linear reality that somehow coincides with modern scientific test results.

To get you in the mood, here is a quote:&quot;The mind is behind every experience in life. It is also what determines the way we see the world.

The middle way of co-dependent origination may be the answer, but it is tricky and subtle and not supported by our mental habits.While both men are well versed in their respective fields and are open to learning Thuan appears at an intellectual disadvantage in these discussions because while Buddhism tends to be non dogmatic it does have the weight of 2500 years of being on track in the search and application of the truth. Ricard does an excellent job of presenting the Buddha's intent, and the Buddha's teachings (on the co-dependent nature of all things) cut through the many intellectual layers and tangled web of discursive scientific thought like a knife through warm butter or a master key opening any lock. But each system of thought presented here comes across as being bound by it's own view, definitions and motivations (science to explain and control, buddhism to experience and be free from). So, while the dialogue is always respectful, and intelligent, in depth and clear I'm not sure there is ever truely a meeting of the minds. What there is is a meeting of east and west, and a challenge and opportunity for modern science (and any mental activity rooted in appearances) to find a middle way out of it's habitual metaphysical underpinings and into a way to unify theory without looking for concrete answers, with practical applications rooted in compassion. This is the contribution of Buddhism here, a non contradictory union of form and emptiness, compassion and wisdom - a spirtual type of scentific inquiry.The two points of view may not meet but at least there is this dialogue!

What makes this little-known county such an interesting subject is the contrast between its records in the War of Independence and the Civil War: like Mayo and Wexford, Sligo showed little fight during the struggle against the British from 1919-21, but fought bitterly against the Free State from 1922 to 1923; in fact, the resistance of the Anti-Treaty IRA was never overcome by the Free State Army. Farry explains the first part of this contradiction in his Introduction, which briefly describes the War of Independence in Sligo. According to Farry, the growth of the IRA in Sligo was retarded by the county's conservatism and parliamentarism: the people of Sligo were unusually attached to the old Irish Parliamentary Party and were reluctant to embrace Republicanism and revolution. As a result, the Sligo Brigade was slower than others to organize, gather arms and ammunition, and attack the RIC and the Army.Despite its poor record in the War of Independence, the Sligo IRA emerged as the dominant organization in the County after the Truce of 11 July 1921. Ch. 1 of _The Aftermath of Revolution_ describes the five and a half months between the truce and the peace treaty of late December. &quot;During this period,&quot; Farry concludes, &quot;the IRA took charge in County Sligo, brooking no opposition, especially from mere politicians, and basked in the glory of a war won.&quot; (p. 35) This long afterglow was ended by the bitter dispute over the Treaty, which gave up the six counties of Northern Ireland and created an Irish Free State rather than the Republic that many IRA men had fought for. Chs. 2 and 3 describe how Sligo, along with the rest of Southern Ireland, drifted toward Civil War in the first half of 1922, as many Republicans refused to accept either the Treaty or the central authority that it created. Finally, after the Free State forces attacked Republican positions in the center of Dublin in July 1922, the Civil War began. In Ch. 4, Farry argues that the Republican &quot;Irregulars&quot; were as confused and ineffective in County Sligo as they were elsewhere. Instead of taking the offensive against the Free State army, they adopted a strategy of passive defense, and when the Free State forces attacked the IRA abandoned its positions and returned to a more familiar style of guerrilla warfare. What had worked against the British in an island united, however, did not work against their fellow countrymen in an island divided. Though the Free State never succeeded in defeating the Sligo Irregulars, it was clear long before the IRA's unilateral cease-fire of 24 May 1922 that the Republican cause in Sligo, as elsewhere, was lost.Farry follows this narrative with two chapters on the 'structure' of the Civil War. Interestingly, in Ch. 5 he shows that while the IRA dominated inaccessible areas like the Ox Mountains, most of the fighting took place &quot;in the areas of better land where towns with government posts were situated.&quot; (p. 114) The reason for this was simple but interesting: the Free State army had &quot;fixed positions that were susceptible to attack&quot; (p. 104), while the Republican Irregulars did not; when the Free State army swept through their remote and mountainous base areas, the IRA simply avoided fighting. Farry also concludes, surprisingly, that recruits for both sides came from every part of the county, but the biggest surprise in his book comes in Ch. 6, &quot;Sligo County Participants.&quot; Most historians have agreed that the split over the Treaty reflected social class divisions as well as political and constitutional differences: the Treaty, they argue, was supported by the more prosperous and opposed by the less prosperous. Farry, however, examines the occupations, land valuations, and house valuations of the participants and concludes that &quot;the Civil War division in County Sligo was not based on social standing or relative wealth.&quot; (p. 129)Farry follows these revelations with three chapters on the impact of the Civil War in Sligo. In Ch. 7, he describes how &quot;the disruption in communications together with the general lawlessness led to a major decline in the social and sporting life in the county,&quot; (p. 156) while the conflict made a bad economic situation even worse. Similarly, in Ch. 8 Farry shows how the decline in law and order that marked the War of Independence continued and worsened during the Truce, Treaty, and Civil War periods. &quot;Agrarian unrest, intimidation of Protestants, robbery, petty crime and hooliganism became widespread,&quot; (p. 176), and after the outbreak of the Civil War wide areas of the county were reduced to anarchy. As the preceding quote suggests, Sligo's Protestants were especially vulnerable in such a situation, and though Farry finds no evidence of &quot;a concerted anti-Protestant campaign&quot; (p. 201) he does show in Ch. 9 that the fear and insecurity of the Civil War accelerated the decline of the county's small Protestant community. In each of these chapters, Michael Farry shows the strengths of the &quot;war and society&quot; approach to military history, by looking behind the movements and clashes of military units to show us a county torn apart by violence.Michael Farry's _The Aftermath of Revolution: Sligo 1921-23_ is a superb book that combines conventional political and military history with social history to provide a deep and enlightening analysis of a community at war with itself. Farry's book is a model both for local histories of national events and for histories of that notoriously difficult subject, guerrilla warfare. By concentrating on a small area-one county in northwest Ireland-Farry's book illuminates some very large themes: his case study of insurgency and counterinsurgency is more instructive than any number of more general works on the same subjects. His writing is clear and readable and his use of evidence is both imaginative and judicious. Besides its value as a contribution to Irish history, his book is an important addition to the social history of war and the literature of low-intensity conflict and guerrilla warfare. Though intended for an academic audience, Farry's book should appeal to anyone with an interest in the subject matter, and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Case of the Haunted Husband","review":"This case is one of the most convoluted of the Perry Mason series by Gardner.

When she resists, the car is involved in a fatal accident and Stephane is charged with vehicular manslaughter. One of Stephane's friends asks Perry Mason to take her case and although it is out of his normal mode, he agrees to do so.The case quickly becomes one familiar to Mason as one of the key players is murdered, leading to the involvement of Lieutenant Tragg. The best part of this book is when Mason and Tragg find common cause, even to the point where Mason, Della Street, Tragg and Paul Drake go out to dinner together and Tragg dances with Della. When Mason and Tragg verbally spar, probing each other for information, it is clear that both men do respect each other personally and that respect transcends their natural adversarial roles.The agreement between Tragg and Mason to cooperate is a refreshing aspect of this story, as Gardner so often portrays Mason's adversaries as self-serving stooges that never seem to learn from their failures and Mason's successes. In this case, Tragg is depicted as an intelligent and competent officer just trying to do his duty and see justice served."},{"Title":"The Case of the Haunted Husband","review":"The Case of the Haunted HusbandStephane Clair quits her job as a hat check girl, and hitch-hikes to Los Angeles.

He doesn't gloss over Lincoln as a man. Instead, he gives a wonderfully well-rounded portrait of one of our greatest presidents, warts and all."},{"Title":"The Great Airport Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 9)","review":"This is a fascimile of the original book. A nice copy and a nice idea. So far they have released about 8 of these fascimile editions in the Hardy Boys series and several in the Nancy Drew and Tom Swift series also.The Great Airport Mystery is a tale of early flying, mail plane robberies, and races across the countryside in a roadster. It was a long ago time when kids had to pass exams to graduate from High School. No revisionism and mindless updating to make the stories &quot;relevant&quot; to the contemporary reader. This is not great literature, but updating is really little more than colorizing black&amp;white movies.This is just plain fun, and thanks to the publishers for giving us an opportunity to see what fun was for kids 75 years ago."},{"Title":"The Great Airport Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 9)","review":"This tells the story of a group of thieves who steal platinum. The Hardy Boys track the thieves from Bayport to Ile de la Mer, an allegedly uninhabited island, to a mountain hideout in Montana. While solving the case they also find a hidden cave, the ghost of a dead pilot who haunts his guilty former partner and a plot that incorporates airport workers on every level. Thrilling and entertaining. Good for people of all ages."},{"Title":"The Great Airport Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 9)","review":"This book was okay, just okay. In my opinion, it didn't have as good adventures as the others books had. There were some exciting parts, true; but to, me the whole book wasn't worth it. The end was disappointing and somewhat predictable.Try reading: \\"While the Clocked Ticked\\" the Hardy Boys book #11. Now that is some really good fiction."},{"Title":"The Great Airport Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 9)","review":"Frank and Joe Hardy are amateur detectives that have successflly solved many cases. Of course, this story starts out normal enough. They are just driving home to assist their professional Private Investigator father, Fenton, in another case. Then something really strange happens when they decide to take a short cut. They stumble upon what turns out to be part of their case. From there, it is pure excitment andsleuthing.I thought this book was an enjoyable read. I loved all the twists and turns and suspensful moments. The only reason I took of the fifth star was it went too fast even for me. One moment the hardys could be sitting eating, and then boom! Something completely big will happen. The point is the plot was sometimes filled with holes. Other than that, I loved this book"},{"Title":"The Great Airport Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 9)","review":"This book is about a man called Clint Hill who supposedly drowned in an aviation accident.Instead he was cared for by some natives and eventually got back home.The man who was in the aircraft with him took the only life raft and left Clint to drown because he wanted Clint's job.When clint got back home to the United States he sent some eerie messages over the radio because he wanted to scare the other man,Len Peterson.This is a great book and I reccomend it to anyone between the ages of 10-15.Although this was published 67 years ago it's still relevant for the nineties.ENJOY:))"},{"Title":"The Great Airport Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 9)","review":"This review concerns the original 1930 edition. Frank and Joe are arrested following the theft of valuable mail bags from the airport and must track down the real thieves in order to clear their names. While there is nothing spectacular about this book to make it stand out from the rest, it is by no means a bad book. The mystery is interesting and there is a decent amount of action. One thing that I did like about this book was that the criminals were featured prominently thoughout the book, unlike in some other volumes where Frank and Joe don't come across the criminals until the last few pages. Many readers will find it odd that the Hardys and their friends graduate from high school in this book (especially since in #10, they are back in high school), apparently, with the beginning of the Great Depression, the author must have been unsure as to whether or not the series would continue. This is an above average book any Hardy Boys fan would enjoy reading."},{"Title":"The Great Airport Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 9)","review":"This review concerns the revised 1965 edition. Mr. Hardy asks Frank and Joe to help him on a case concerning the theft of platinum containing electronic parts from company called Stanwide. Frank and Joe go undercover at the company to find out who is behind the thefts and soon find a number of suspects. They also find another mystery about the ghost of Clint Hill, Stanwide's chief pilot, who died in a plane crash at sea, who has been harassing one of the company's employees. This was a rather interesting book; I thought that it had one of the better plots of the books in the series. The book had plenty of action and the Hardys came into contact with the criminals quite often. I liked the part where the Hardys went undercover at Stanwide; unfortunately, it was much too short. I was a little disappointed with the ending. I found it to be rather quick and I thought that the Hardys were able to find the criminals too easily. Also, the \\"surprise\\" at the end of the book wasn't much of a surprise. Mostly; however, I enjoyed the book and I think that any Hardy Boys fan would like it."},{"Title":"The Great Airport Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 9)","review":"You can keep saying that this book is cool! Franklin W. Dixion really showed a good plane story. This was my fourth book, and I just couldn't stop dreaming about flying a plane. Someday I'm going to be sure I do just that. Anybody who likes ghost stuff, action, and planes should read this. And as for the ghost, it didn't seem real near the ending. I knew Clint Hill might have lived, like some plots on Scooby Doo. But, ghost or not, it's a teriffic book that's worth reading."},{"Title":"The Great Airport Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 9)","review":"This book is one of my favorite Hardy Boys mysteries.
