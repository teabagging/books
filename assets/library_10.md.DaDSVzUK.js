This mystery was very well-written. She doesn't muck about setting the scene for half the book before anything actually happens, and though I guessed a couple of the twists/surprises well in advance, it wasn't enough to give away \\"whodunnit.\\" The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that I feel that just about anything in the mystery genre has a rather low re-read value...good thing Dame Agatha has so many more books out there!"},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"Summary from Amazon:\\"The first Miss Marple mystery, one which tests all her powers of observation and deduction.\\"Anyone who murdered Colonel Protheroe,\\" declared the parson, brandishing a carving knife above a joint of roast beef, \\"would be doing the world at large a favor!\\"It was a careless remark for a man of the cloth. And one which was to come back and haunt the clergyman just a few hours later--when the Colonel is found shot dead in the clergyman's study. But as Miss Marple soon discovers, the whole village seems to have had a motive to kill Colonel Protheroe.\\"My Thoughts:Murder at the Vicarage begins with the death of an unliked man where everyone in the village becomes a suspect in his death. This was my 1st Miss Marple read and I found it to be an enjoyable mystery. Agatha Christie was a very talented mystery writer and one of my favorite things about her is her ability to make all of her characters seem guilty at some point. This leads the reader into suspecting anyone and everyone which is exactly what I did :) In the case of this book I guessed the killer at the beginning but Christie had me so turned around as I was reading the book that by the end I didn't even suspect the killer which made the ending still come as a surprise. There was a colorful cast of characters (otherwise known as suspects) that all had reasons for wanting the victim dead that played various roles in the story. My only complaint was that I was taken back a bit by the fact that at times it seemed like Miss Marple didn't play an important role in the mystery that was going on. By the end of the book though, she shines as the reader sees how much of the mystery she was able to solve on her own.This was a fun mystery that kept me guessing the entire time that I read the book. I'm looking forward to reading more Miss Marple mysteries and hopefully I will read everything that she has written at some point. And although this wasn't my favorite book by Christie, I found it to be a really solid mystery. Recommended!Bottom Line: A great beginning to the Miss Marple series!Disclosure: I checked this book out from my local library ;)"},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"This, the first of the Miss Marple series, is a classic.The Marple of this book is a bit more vinegarish than she comes off in later stories. But the nosey old biddy with binoculars at the ready and sharp mind amply demonstrates her ability to unravel a complex crime.Personally, I've always preferred Marple to Poirot--a statement that may be blasphemy to the latter's fans. Having known a few of her type, she simply comes off as more realistic to me than the talented Belgian.Christie demonstrates her legendary skill in detailing the murder of a man despised by all, planting a variety of red herrings to throw the reader off the trail, seven suspects and three confessions before the case is solved. In addition to Miss Marple, this novel also introduces the vicar, Leonard Clement, and his wife, Griselda, who show up in later stories."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"This one was not well-received when it was published -- for good reason. There are some major leaps a reader must make to believe in a lot of what transpires."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"I read the reviews so I got this book, as I had read almost all of the Christie book and this was Miss Marple first book. I found it very boring and disappointing compared to all the ones I read before."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"In this novel published in 1930, readers were introduced to Miss Marple, an enduring, endearing fictional character who, according to the official Agatha Christie web site, was not planned by that British Dame to be an ongoing sleuth like Poirot.As creative spirits learn from writing fiction (especially a lengthy novel or a series of them), some characters aren't molded from the writer's flesh, blood, & brain waves. They forcefully, almost immediately, steal away from the author's plan and initiate a separate life. The author has a choice to either work from that character's direction, or lose the living, energetic force of one of those precious gems which sometimes slip into our gravity-lush worlds from surrounding ethers.Yeah, I'm one of \\"those,\\" an author/parapsychologist. But that's beside the point. Getting to it ...At first I assumed the \\"I\\" in the narrative was Miss Marple speaking to the reader. On the opening page of this pilot for what became this spinster's series:\\"I had just finished carving some boiled beef (remarkably tough by the way), and on resuming my seat I remarked, in a spirit most unbecoming to my cloth, that anyone who murdered Colonel Protheroe would be doing the world at large a service.\\"My literary lunges began wavering as the word, \\"cloth,\\" registered.Say what? Is Marple a NUN? Maybe with Vicarage in the title ...My brows nearly ran onto each other and sneezed from their vice-like scrunch. Old assumptions don't die, they just go into hiding in the unconscious mind. Have you ever wondered what the purpose is for that huge, supposedly unused, 95% of the brain? It's very possible it was allocated ages ago for storage of useless jumps-to-conclusions which never stop jumping (picture them as pink w/huge, flopping feet).I did get enough of a clue to begin looking for a \\"he\\" or \\"she\\" gender in reference to the First Person in the Narrative.\\"My wife ...\\"Oh.Read on... Okay. So this \\"I\\" is the vicar. Interesting. Very. So, when is Miss Marple going to do her scene entry?In a somewhat awakened state due to the discomfort of my tense brow line, my reading approach became highly investigative of this vicar being the \\"I.\\"Why. Why tell the story from his perspective instead of Miss Marple's.I began seeing the genius of this use of narrative and character, as I observed how Christie subtly began introducing brain-twisting ironies in ethical issues, and exposing philosophical nuances in the vicar's character by choosing him be the eye through which the story was told.And, of course, throughout the book I wondered (eyebrows joined) what slight shifts in plot might have occurred as a result of Miss Marple's character-take-over machinations within Agatha's rich & complex unconscious mind. As I read, I was fascinated-ly fixed on the fact that this book hadn't yet been consciously slotted for it's grand expansion into at least a 12 novel series, paralleling Poirot.In order to establish a few basics for literary-clue-contemplation, maybe I should expound a bit:The classic Narrative Voice for detective fiction has long been established as First Person, so, of course I wasn't surprised that this pilot used that potentially fascinating, mood-rich, diary-like, narrative style. Most often the blues/jazz feel of this story telling perspective...\\"I walked (slip-slid-ed? strutted? sauntered? swaggered? slithered?) along the wet, slimy streets under cover of The Long Lonely Night...\\"Most often this type of hauntingly heady voice is used by the featured P.I., Scotland Yard Inspector, or amateur sleuth who carries the mystery series through his moaning, echoing soliloquies. Due to this custom of the \\"I did this, by myself, alone & lonely\\" narrative style being almost always and absolutely executed by the main male detective (I had temporarily forgotten that female sleuths were not quite yet crawling out of the ethereal woodwork in happy hordes, not by a long shot, in 1930), I was indeed shocked and intrigued as I continued reading this novel's First Person Narrative perspective and realized it was voicing from the throat of a Vicar, rather than from Miss Marple's lack of Adam's Apple (as you would now realize I had anticipated from my 2005 perspective of what's commonly done in the detective genre).Due to the above mentioned intrigue and more, I believe this pilot may be one of the most enlightening mysteries to study, in Christie's repertoire of rare gems. This First Person Narrative dance may be even richer than the Roger Ackroyd sawdust-slipping waltz with Matilda.The above sketched situation alone exposes the cunning complexity of Christie's mind. Reading this novel with these questions in mind could provide the height of cerebral & cultural entertainment:- Why use a vicar (instead of Miss Marple) as the First Person Narrator, and expose his vulnerabilities and foibles, his more human and less godly personal thoughts?(As I've hinted rather extensively, for me the answer to why use 1st Person Narrative at all in a mystery is found in its prevalence and preference by so many writers of detective novels who seek to slip into the melancholy mystique expressed so exquisitely by Mickey Spillane's moody/broody Good Man, Mike Hammer, as he purrs out his stories in perfect \\"panhandler\\" pitch... and heard so eloquently in the voice of (Robert Urich) in the TV series of Robert B. Parker's Spencer For Hire.)- Why keep Miss Marple so much in the background and introduce her so slowly.- Why use a cunningly contrasting collection of elderly ladies (and a sprinkling of young ones) to expose & expand details & clues.- Why begin the plot of this pilot with conversations and cultural exchanges at a luncheon table (before culinary cozies had been coined or had tastefully captured the mystery market)?- What is accomplished by the Great Gatsby feel in this novel's introduction, effected by using a \\"proper\\" personality for a 1st person narrator, a low key character who naturally makes crisply simple-and-direct observations of psychology and philosophy, a genuinely gentlemanly neighbor of the main character (or main sleuth)?Yeah, in some ways these are dumb questions which could be answered easily by a surface read the novel.Yet, focusing on them through a leisurely read of this convoluted tale, and relishing the discoveries made by that viewpoint adjustment might enrich an awareness of how Christie so (seemingly) easily executes mysteries echoing mysteries, mirrors reflecting mirrors, and might begin to expose why she frequently focused mirrors in titles and plots.Loved the sensory-lush descriptions in the opening scene at a luncheon table at the vicarage, especially this:\\"Mary (serving the meal)...merely said, in a loud businesslike voice, \`Greens,' and thrust a cracked dish at him in a truculent manner....setting the greens on the table with a bang, proceeded to thrust a dish of singularly moist and unpleasant dumplings under my nose...and she deposited the dish with a clatter on the table and left the room.\\"The verbiage within and around the dotted exclusions of the above quote from the opening page are as primely plush as the syntax which was included. Please do pick up the novel and be rewarded by reading the whole of page one to observe how precisely and primly Christie develops characters with a mere word or three.As you read on in the plot, note how often a word or its synonym (like \\"sympathetic\\") is used perfectly to reinforce an evolving image. Note how colloquialisms are used lushly, like the simple, very British, \\"Oh!\\" which embellishes many a dialogue entry.In this novel Christie exposes her moral attitude, which may be one of the major facets of her tangy talent which has endeared her into the minds and spirits of readers:Agatha is a rebel (likely forming her values well prior to the 1920's) against strict, ignorant, and overwhelmingly controlling, cultural mores.What's uncanny is how easy it is in 2005 to understand the issues underlying Christie's views, formed at the outset of the previous century, on the mysteries of death, immortality, immorality, and murder. Like Miss Marple, Agatha was an eternal student of human nature, and that study clearly evolved to a professorial level; the proof is in the pudding of the series.In this series I lip smacked another pudding proof, proof that the attention span and cerebral stretch capacity of the current reader market can easily hold a thought and plot beyond a Quantum-Split-Millisecond. This pudding can be taste-tested by observing the pages and pages of naturally-flowing dialogue in this novel. Today's publishing industry pundits seem terrified of too much dialogue, terming novels with more than a few lines of conversational quips between a hundred pages of ACTion, \\"talking heads\\" books; they steer authors away from that style as if it were synonymous with Zero Sales or bankruptcy. You tell me. Is it?Honestly, it's a relief to read a novel written in a less chaotic age and culture than we're steeped in at the moment, to read a complexly constructed novel conceived in an age past, with long, sensual, contemplative pauses allowed for the reader, actually encouraged between short rushes of life, in contrast to the contemporary style of heart-attack-action shoved through a plot so fast-paced the ending butts out the beginning. (Einstein, did you hear that, from wherever the back of your head is?)Whatever happened to the pause button in life, and in fiction? Who initiated the idea that the only antidote to boredom is shock & speed, running non-stop as if the planet's revolution would halt if we didn't manically continue pushing the ground with feet hanging over the edge of the red wagon's spinning wheels?Whew. Let me out of that cart.Don't get me wrong. I can do fast paced novels; I can run with an abundance of action now and then (in a book). It's just that I haven't lost the need to savor time, to burn that contemplative candle at one, quiet end, with a good mystery in hand.Mystery is in the mind; not in the foot.It's obvious I'm not Confucius; but my reverence for leisurely does seem more Oriental (or British) than Western. Sunrise. Sunset. Both are good in their own times. As the world turns, it's a wonder we don't all fall off.See my Listmania on the Miss Marple series, and my review of At Bertram's Hotel.Pausing with hat held in hand, in honor of happy hesitance & a harridan author born yesterday, still living today through her talking heads,Linda G.

My typical novels are non-fiction or realistic fictions- mostly narratives.This may be the reason why I've had this Agatha Christie book for over five years and cannot get passed the first 50 pages.

I came away with a very enjoyable reading experience, and I will probably read other Miss Marple books in the future.This book is an easy pleasure read. The story is easy enough to follow, and it isn't too long winded. I actually read the whole book in one sitting (although \\"locked up\\" in an air plane).As far as classic mystery characters go, I still like Holmes and Poirot better, but I ended up pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"While this book is definitely an original Christie's, it is hardly a vintage.Writing from the perspective of the vicar of St Mary Mead village where Ms Jane Marple lived, the writer unfolded a scene of a little village's usual &quot;transquility&quot; being disturbed by an outsider in the form of Mr Lawrence Redding, an artist who drew various local ladies. One of the ladies was Griselda, wife of the vicar, and another was Anne, second wife to a not generally loved Colonel Protheroe, the latter being a murder victim found in the study of the vicar.Rounding up the usual suspects, there was the victim's daughter, Lettice, nearly as old as her stepmother and hated the latter utterly, a ne'er-do-well local by the name of Archer who was jailed by the late Colonel who happened to be on the bench, plus a mysterious Mrs Lestrange, a recent reticent arrival to the village.Instead of treating the readers to a conventional detective story, the writer described everything from the eyes of the vicar, a possible suspect himself if not for a cast-iron alibi, he had been calling on one of his flocks. The narrator attempted to clear the mystery himself, unsatisfied with the effectiveness of the investigating police officer, a certain Inspector Slack. Together with the local doctor Haydock, they spoke to almost everyone imaginable in the village, trying to reconstructing the truth from various perspective.As a detective novel, it did not help that the star sleuth Ms Marple was herself a witness, her residence being right next to the vicarage. Readers would get a feeling that they are not being treated fairly in terms of the information being provided, depending instead on evaluations provided by Ms Marple.Several red herrings of course were thrown in, which made the story more life-like. As the investigation proceeded, new clues were revealed which oft led the amateur sleuths on wild goose chases. It was only when they returned to re-examine the scene of the crime that the truth finally came to light.Readers who loved mysteries would find nothing to complain about, except that they had been led on a wrong trail and for most of the book, missed out on the real mystery."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"1930 was not a great year as the Great Depression put the damper on humanity. However, in Great Britain there was a new Agatha Christie for sale at the bookstalls and shops. \\"The Murder at the Vicarage\\" is the first novel to feature the inimitable Miss Marple of St. Mary's Mead. Along with Belgian Detective Hercule Poirot the venerable Miss Marple is one of the two iconic characters created by the brilliant mind of Agatha Christie. It is a delight!The Plot: The story is narrated by the Rev. Lem Clement a Church of England vicar in the small English village of St. Mary's Mead. Clement is married to the much younger Griselda. Griselda is a beautiful woman of 25 with a keen wit who always manages to say or do the wrong thing in the confines of a small parish made up largely of gossippy old women!One night Colonel Protheroe comes to the vicarage to meet the good reverend. Protheroe is wed to Anne who is carrying on a love affair with local artist Lawrence Redding. Protheroe is noted for his furious temple; he is not liked. His daughter Lettie is eager to flee the family home where she feels restricted by her grouchy father and stepmother Anne. Colonel Protheroe is found shot to death in the vicarage. Though Anne Protheroe and Lawrence Redding confess the murder the indefatigable Miss Marple considers there to be at least seven suspects. She. Rev. Clements and local police investigat the nettlesome case. A key suspect is the aristocratic Mrs. Lestrange, young Gladys Cram and Dr. Stone.The case is replete with red herrings and complicated plot developments. As so often in Christie's work the answer to the murder puzzle lies buried in the past. Passion plays an important role in this well written and fascinating early work by a British murder mystery doyen. There is no better book to pick up to begin acquaintanship with the inimitable Miss Marple.Enjoy this one!"},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"I loved this book. I adore Agatha Christie, especially Miss Marple. I do have to say, however, I wish this book had had more of Miss Marple in it than it did. I suppose the case could be made that it was written in such a way as to introduce the character gently, but I would have preferred more about her, even for a first book in a character's series. I am guessing that this was a common practice in the era in which this book was written. I obtained this book for free for my Kindle when it was offered earlier this year in 2011. I recommend that any mystery fan, especially of early 20th century fiction, read it and I believe he or she will enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"This is a review of the Kindle version.I've never been a huge fan of Miss Marple, but when this showed up as a free version, I had to download.It's an enjoyable mystery, well worth the time. The characters are interesting, though I wasn't a huge van of the Vicar. Much more amused by his wife and cook.One very nice thing is the the maps and floor plans in the story do show in the Kindle version. This is often an issue, but not in this Kindle version.If you like mysteries, definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"This is the first of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple mysteries. While the story is good, it's also a little rough around the edges, and lacks the deft handling visible in later stories. Of course, that's perfectly understandable, even Miss Marple did not emerge fully-formed from her creator's head (she's no Athena!). The recurring characters from the later Miss Marple mysteries have not yet been introduced (or if they are introduced in this book, they're not fully fleshed-out).The story is interesting, and well-done. There are a lot of clues scattered about and the reader will feel that they're one step ahead of the vicar in identifying them (which I like, I'm bad at picking out clues!). There are several possible murderers and plenty of red herrings; the ending comes as a bit of a surprise.If you like Christie's mysteries, you will probably enjoy reading about Miss Marple's debut as a detective.Note on Kindle formatting: Very good. I did not notice any issues whatsoever."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"\\"Murder at the Vicarage\\" was the novel in which Agatha Christie introduced her old maid of a detective, Miss Jane Marple. While authorities are confounded by a baffling murder in the small town of St. Mary Mead, Miss Marple knows the real murderer from the start, except she has no proof to back up her theory. Narrated by the vicar, Len Clement, who serves as an amateur sleuth in league with Miss Marple, the mystery becomes even more convoluted before the facts are revealed at the end. \\"Murder at the Vicarage\\" is a delightful read, but definitely an understated introduction to the inimitable Miss Marple.Colonel Protheroe was not well liked, and when he is found shot dead in the study of the vicarage, there are a plethora of suspects who may have wanted him dead. It seems as if the case is immediately solved when two people confess in quick succession - the artist Lawrence Redding, who was having an affair with Mrs. Protheroe, and Mrs. Protheroe herself. Yet both are just as quickly cleared of any guilt and that means that the police must look for suspects and proof elsewhere. Admist an alarming amount of testimony, threatening letters and phone calls, and numerous red herrings, Christie throws suspicion upon almost everybody in the village, causing readers (as usual) to be led far off the track of who the actual murderer is.\\"Murder at the Vicarage\\", like the best of Christie's mysteries, is a fast-paced whodunit that will leave readers guessing (incorrectly) until the end. The ending seems a little too hasty after such a great amount of buildup. Vicar Len Clement is a likable narrator and worthy confidant of Miss Marple. There are many characters to like (and several to dislike) in this tale, but Miss Marple outshines them all, cementing her future place in the pantheon of literary detectives."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"This title is not particularly often fted when Agatha Christie's name crops up during literary discussions but it should be -- I would assert that it falls handily within the leading twenty percent of her lifelong account of over eighty mysteries, romance novels, and plays.THE STORY: Old Miss Marple resides next door to the Vicarage in the sleepy English hamlet of St. Mary Mead where she loves to toil away in her garden. Her vigilant scrutiny of Vicar Len Clement's comings and goings, and those of his household and their numerous guests, validates her local status as a celebrated repository of village gossip. And what she doesn't actually view with her own eyes, she quickly deduces with an accuracy and preciseness which would astonish even Sherlock Holmes.Following multiple complaints from the congregation, Vicar Clement is concerned that the church's books might not be in the best of order. One self-assured and particularly noxious parishioner, Colonel Protheroe, has made it his personal business to ferret out any financial inconsistencies and, if there be one, a culprit. Following a purported emergency telephone call received by the tireless Vicar, the Colonel awaits his return in the Vicar's office to commence an accounting of the church's finances. It's just during this period when the supercilious old autocrat's life is snuffed away by a well-placed revolver shot to the back of the head... a revolver which happens to belong to transient artist Lawrence Redding, who happens to have recently quarreled with the Colonel, who happens to be painting the Colonel's wife's portrait, who happens to be in love with said wretched wife, who stands to financially profit (by marrying the Colonel's wife) if the Colonel is put out of the way, who happens to have emerged from the Vicarage just before the Colonel's death is discovered by the Vicar. And if all that did not provide adequate motivation for the murder, Redding walks into the police station and confesses to the crime!A bounty of additional and worthy suspects prevail though, such as a nefarious and hostile old poacher by the name of Archer upon whom the Colonel, in his capacity as local magistrate, had only just dropped the gavel just prior to the latter's untimely death. There is the strange Mrs. Lestrange for whom the local doctor seems to be fabricating an alibi for her whereabouts during the window of time in which the murder occurred. And then there is the pensive archeologist who, along with a young female assistant, spends his days toiling for artifacts in a barrow on the Colonel's estate - the anomalous behavior of the two following the murder begins to capture the attention of village gossips. Oh yes... and there's the house maid, the Vicar's wife, the Vicar's assistant, Colonel's Protheroe's wife, his impish daughter... and on and on.Inspector Slack, an offensive but forceful investigator, immediately chastises just about every soul in St. Mary Mead as he initiates a cycle of badgering prospective witnesses and suspects. As a consequence, most of the local rumor-mongers seek to burden the Vicar with their salacious tidbits and he is subsequently forced share this vague hearsay with the venerable Colonel Melchett, a notably more urbane and thoughtful policeman. But as the clues begin to amass and as a solution becomes ever less discernible all three men discover that old Miss Marple's contributions toward solving the case cannot be so easily dismissed -- she artfully maneuvers Slack, Melchett, and the Vicar back on the correct path as this curious affair of murder draws closer to a surprising finale.The story here is conveyed in the First Person writing style, (a difficult technique of which Christie was an acknowledged master), from the perspective of narrator/protagonist Vicar Len Clement. Christie has also included three maps/floor plans to aid armchair detectives in solving the case prior to the book's conclusion -- but I don't anticipate that most readers will succeed in this endeavor even though the clues are adequately provided. That signature Christie cozy murder atmosphere punctuated with the colorful ambiance of her characters is found in abundance here.This 1930 whodunit stands as a classic example of the author's much-lauded early period and serves equally as a poster example of the \\"golden-age\\" British mystery. It doesn't get much better than this but subsequent Miss Marple equivalents were, in fact, penned by Christie such as:The Moving Finger: A Miss Marple Mystery (Agatha Christie Collection), akaThe Case of the Moving Finger(1942).Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":".... this is not the best Christie book. While Miss Marple is my favourite detective of all time, Agatha Chrisitie's MIss Marple novels sometimes leave something to be desired. Miss Marple deserves more exciting plots, i sometimes feel. (Although, i know that is silly to suggest. She's an elderly woman. The plots Agatha Chrisite chose for her are of the perfect tone to match the old-lady.) but sometimes they feel a bit laclustre. Indeed, in this one, the first Marple book, she uses some of the same devices she used in the first POIROT book. Mind you, they are not hugely noticeable as repetitions, and the book definitely does not suffer for it.The characters are good, the writing sharp, the plot typically Marple-esque. Relaxed, in comparison to the Poriot mysteries. Miss Marple is a brilliant creation, and it is a great shame that Christie did not write as many books about her as she did Poirot. She is a hugely enjoyable character, and wonderfully original detective. The way she solves crime is entertaining, but doe slack something which the Poirot novels have. (I can't really put my finger on it...the only thing i can think of to describe what i mean is possibly saying that the Poirot novels are more in-your-face, whereas with the Marple books, the peaceful nature of the villages is brought across in the plot.)While this is not one her best best books, it is still a very good one. The solution contains none of the great shock value that some of her books do, but it is still a surprise, and this book is still worth a read."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"My two favorite British detectives are Miss Jane Marple and Lord Peter Whimsy. If you prefer action filled American mysteries or fast moving Sherlock Holmes tales, Agatha Christie is probably not for you. She creates mind puzzles in which you are given all the clues while the author tries to confuse and mislead you into suspecting the wrong person. No one has ever been better at red herrings and misdirection than Agatha Christie. If you enjoy glimpses into British life in the 1920's combined with enjoyable characterizations and creative plotting, settle down to enjoy an excellent example of the cozy mystery genre. The Murder at the Vicarage combines all of the best characteristics of vintage Agatha Christie without the sometimes annoying presence of Agatha Christie's more famous detective, Hercule Poirot."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"The Murder at the Vicarage is the story in which Agatha Christie introduced her detective Miss Marple; other than that, it really has no stand-out features and is a fairly ho-hum story. In spite of the excellent narration, I found this a very slow-moving and dull book. It was difficult for me to follow what was happening, since the story often failed to hold my attention and my mind wandered.It is interesting that, in this first Miss Marple story, she figures as little more than a background character until the last chapter or two. The focus of the story is the vicar (who narrates) and his investigations and that of the police officers. Although I particularly like Miss Marple, I found her a slightly different (and less likeable) character in this her first appearance. She is less personable and more snoopy and gossipy.Recommended for avid Christie fans, although others will probably find this one dull."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"This made Miss Marple appear as a noisy neighbor and an old \\"pussy\\" as she is called.

This one kept me guessing who had murdered that man most people disliked. But for the murder to take place in the vicarage, now that makes for lots more questions. Miss Marple of course has questions that lead the reader one way and then another. It's not till the end that the truth is exposed. Lots of well written characters and Miss Marple words of wisdom along the way."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"The idyllic village of St Mary Mead is the setting for this classic murder mystery. Colonel Protheroe is found shot dead in the vicar's study much to the incumbent's distress and embarrassment. Fortunately the vicar's next door neighbour is Miss Marple, that ever inquisitive spinster who sees everything and understands human nature better than most.There are plenty of suspects in this well constructed story. Half the village, including the vicar, has at one time or another wished the victim out of the way permanently, not least his own second wife. I enjoyed this well written mystery with its evocation of a simpler age when Chief Constables became involved in murder investigations and amateur detectives were given more leeway by the police.The story is narrated by the vicar himself which gives an interesting view of the story and of Miss Marple. He makes an amusing and insightful narrator but it will take an insightful reader to see beyond his narrative to what might be happening without his knowledge. This is a very well plotted crime novel from a master of the genre and will appeal to anyone who enjoys village mysteries where the amateur sees more of the game than the police."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"This enjoyable mystery set in the iconic English village of St. Mary Mead introduced acutely observant Miss Marple to the world. The story is told from the point-of-view of the vicar whose household is upset when the most disliked man of the village is murdered in the vicarage study. We see Miss Marple through his eyes and although she seems at first to be a peripheral character -- which, after decades of our knowing and enjoying Miss Marple, we know she is not! -- she is the one with the keys to unlock the mystery of who killed the victim.We follow the vicar through his days as he talks to witnesses, suspects, and the police. He's a sympathetic character and not a stereotypical \\"upright\\" vicar whose every thought is pure! Indeed, he often has rather uncharitable thoughts about many of the people he encounters, although he tries to behave well.Not as complex as some of Christie's later Marple mysteries, but still a fun read, and at the current freebie price for the Kindle, it was a \\"must have\\" for my Kindle library! I'd originally read it about 35 or 40 years ago, and have read it at least once or twice since, but it was still a pleasure to revisit St. Mary Mead!One other good thing about this Kindle version: it has the diagrams included. So when the vicar mentions a drawing of his house or of the village, you will see the diagram, very clear, at the end of that chapter."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"I first read this book back in the '70's. When I re-read it on my Kindle, I thought it was a much better story than I remembered. There is a lot of humor in it. Miss Marple admits in the book that her habits of snooping on her neighbors, thinking the worst of their behavior, and gossiping about them have made her unpopular in the village. Unlike one of the other reviewers, I think Christie's early books are better, and more fun,than her later ones.The Murder at the Vicarage (Agatha Christie Mysteries Collection)"},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"It's been years since I read a Miss Marple mystery. Because my teen \\"reads\\" were based mostly on what the Bookmobile had \\"in stock\\" at any given time, I'm not sure that I actually did read this one. And I should have! The writing is delightfully wry with biting comments that barely graze the surface adding pithe as well as subtlety--a welcome respite from the in-your-face approach seen in much contemporary writing. Today's teens might even take this leisurely read as a couch-potato approach to SAT prep. Where else could one find such saucy terms as defalcations, shemozzle, and inamorata used correctly and in context? The bigger draw, of course, is the lovely logic and attentions of Miss Marple herself. After all, there really is, \\"No detective in England equal to a spinster lady of uncertain age with plenty of time on her hands.\\""},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"This is the first of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple books, and what I love about it is that it isn't in Miss Marple's Point of View. We see Miss Marple through the observations and reactions of other characters--principally the vicar who narrates the novel. The vicar sees her as just another of the village's busybodies, albeit the shrewdest of the bunch. The police investigating the murder condescend to her and dismiss her theories. Even Miss Marple reveals her thoughts and observations in a self-deprecating way (\\"I'm so stupid about these things...\\") but deep down she surely knows herself as the smartest person in the picture (\\"my hobby is--and always has been--Human Nature\\"). The whodunit aspect of the story is appropriately convoluted with plenty of red herrings along the way. Only Miss Marple has a clue what all the clues mean, but once she explains it, it all makes sense. The author's portrayal of village life in St. Mary Mead, where everyone knows what everyone else is up to, is perfect and perfectly absorbing. All in all, a very satisfying mystery."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"Everyone else has gone into detail about the story. I just wanted to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

The clues and \`Peculiar Things' clarify and bewilder. And the story certainly shows the aggravations of finding oneself stuck in a small, cozy village that has just suddenly borne out its first murder in a long, long while.Smack in the middle is the village's highly likeable, dryly humorous, and long-suffering vicar who has the inconvenience of finding the village's least favorite member slumped dead in his own study, of trying to prevent his incompetent housekeeper from quitting just to appease the missus, of hearing out in a day-to-day basis the suppositions, observations, and indignations of the more well-meaning, elderly women of his parish, and of agonizing if his younger, vivacious wife is actually having an affair...All the while doing a not-inconsiderate amount of sleuthing on his own - with the valuable aid of the redoubtable Miss Marple, whose spot-on observations and insights on the village folk has made her a point of disgruntlement for the police constables.With one or two more incidental plots thrown in into the mix, The Murder at the Vicarage is a story that subtly lures one to keep a wide-open eye on everything said or done - coz you have no idea which of these are really worth paying attention to.I have to admit being near-driven bonkers with trying to keep up (especially when the \`time' aspect is factored in), but that just really makes me more glued to the pages.The ending and exposition of what all the fuss is about may come out as a bit anticlimactic...but still, the entire detective-experience of getting into that point was well worth it. Another enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"This is the first of Agatha Christie's \\"Miss Marple\\" mysteries, and a fairly typical one--a murder in an English village, baffled authorities, and Miss marple, who doesn't know law, forensics or police procedure, but who thoroughly understands people. This one takes place in Miss Marple's home village of St Mary Mead, so there is an overlap of setting and some cast with several other Marples, including THE MIRROR CRACK'D and THE BODY IN THE LIBRARY.

That is why she was and still remains the best of the genre. This is our intro to Miss Marple and her amatuer sluething. The best thing you can say about any mystery writer is her/his solutions are well hidden yet, totally believable when they are revealed. That fits this story to a tee. The story is narrated by the vicar who is not only unlucky enough to have a murder commited in his home but, is also one of the main suspects. Tough day for anyone unless your next door neighbor is MISS MARPLE.

So we have Hercule Poirot himself in the person of David Suchet doing &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; for instance, and &lt;Murder at the Vicarage&gt; on six cassettes with James Saxton doing the honors.Now any review of a book on tape must consider the book itself and the reader separately. The latter might lack the vocal variety of Suchet--that is, he does not change his voice all that much for each character However, &quot;Vicarage&quot; is told in the first person by the Vicar himself, and so Saxton's voice is quite appropriate if one keeps in mind who is supposed to be speaking. In this way, he does a very good job indeed of keeping up the listener's interest, although this particular Christie novel is not quite as spellbinding as was &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; for example.The tale itself was dramatized very well on PBS a while ago as part of the Joan Hickson &quot;Miss Marple&quot; series, but it did leave out a good deal of the adverse opinions that other residents of St. Mary Mead have of her. None of the male characters seem to like her very much, but that is because they recognize her ability to see through the lies with which most of them surround themselves in even the most routine of days, let alone those that involve a shocking murder in the Vicar's own study. Not really a comic creation, Miss Marple still elicits broad smiles as she free-associates the present events and the people with those from her past experience and usually manages to come up with the solution on that basis alone. At any rate, this tale is just a tad padded and perhaps would have profited from a slight abridgment; but I am grateful to have a full edition, as it were, on this Audio Partners tape."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"No complaints. As usual, Christie delivers on a satisfying mystery."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"The Murder at the Vicarage was a very slow book and you have to have logic to figure it out but once you get past the slow part it progresses very fast.

I highly recommend this book to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"The Sherlock Holmes everyone knows is not quite the same Sherlock Holmes that appears in the very first story; ditto Father Brown; and ditto Miss Marple. In the latter two cases the original character is more intriguing than what follows.In later books Miss Marple solves crimes in part because she is wise. In this book she isn't wise. She's just a shameful snoop, who trains her binoculars on everyone who steps outdoors in St. Mary Mead, and has been doing so for half a century. In many ways she leads an empty existence. But she's much more endearing here than the Miss Marple of later books, who is so very wise.The usual Christie twist is good, too. It's one of those primeval detective plot devices that Chesterton and Christie between them appear to have exhaustively copyrighted."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"A.C. is my favorite author. I don't usually get excited about books but I've never read a bad one by her. Fantastic writer. Great Book. She wrote a ton of great books so check it out."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"Though Agatha Christie had featured her amateur detective Miss Jane Marple in a couple of short-stories prior to this, \\"Murder at the Vicarage\\" marks the first appearance of the elderly spinster with an eye for solving mysteries in a novel-length story. A quintessential \\"cozy\\" mystery set in the picturesque village of St Mary Mead and told in first-person narration by its local vicar, \\"Murder at the Vicarage\\" serves as a nice introduction to Christie's second-most famous sleuth, even as she plays a relatively minor role in the story itself.Colonel Protheroe is not a popular man; a loud and boorish presence in his community who is disliked by everyone, including his wife and child. Reverend Leonard Clement is among the many who (half-seriously) wish that he would get murdered, and yet it still comes as a shock when he returns to the vicarage one night to discover Protheroe dead in his study, shot through the head. Immediately, his unfaithful wife Anne Protheroe and her lover Lawrence Redding confess to the murder, despite several discrepancies in their stories.Soon enough it's proved that it was impossible for either of them to have pulled the trigger, and they admit that they confessed in order to save the other, each believing that their lover had murdered the man standing in the way of their happiness. Inspector Slack is rightfully irritated by this setback, and ropes in Reverend Clement to show him around the village. In lieu of Anne and Lawrence there are still suspects a plenty: the mysterious Mrs Lestrange, the flighty Lettice Protheroe, and the erratic Mr Hawes, the church curate. Not to mention a smattering of old ladies, all of whom have their own opinions as to who committed the crime, among them Miss Marple, the eagle-eyed spinster who lives opposite the vicarage and had a front-row seat to all the comings and goings on the day of the murder.Plenty of clues pile up, though most of them leave the police baffled as to their meaning: a gunshot in the woods, a tennis racket on the lawn, a slashed portrait in an attic, a prank phone-call to an elderly woman - only Miss Marple seems to be capable of fitting them all together in any coherent manner.\\"Murder at the Vicarage\\" is not my favourite Agatha Christie novel, nor my favourite Miss Marple mystery. The plot is quite a complex one, relying heavily on time of death, incorrect clocks, intricate plotting, and the careful positioning of various characters at particular places and times, all to the point where it can be quite difficult to keep track of everything. It also involves a couple of subplots that have little bearing on the central mystery, and which do little but provide red herrings for the more important plotline.Partially based on the character of Caroline Sheppard (who appeared in one of Christie's most famous novels,The Murder of Roger Ackroyd) Miss Marple's characterization is slightly different here than it is in later mysteries; her nosiness and sharpness is toned down considerably in later stories, perhaps due to Christie realizing that she would not make for a particularly appealing protagonist (or perhaps not wanting a repeat of her infamous dislike of her other famous detective, the fastidious Hercule Poirot). However, Christie *does* establish Miss Marple's trademark technique of deduction: where Poirot had psychology, Marple forms analogies between village life and the various motivations for murder, often claiming that human nature is the same across all walks of life.As it is, Miss Marple is a periphery figure throughout most of the plot, and though she provides the solution and the method with which to catch the killer, she's relatively low-key. Instead, the focus lies with its narrator Reverend Clement, and offsetting the more serious drama is his dealings with his much younger, rather scatterbrained wife, as well as his love-sick nephew Dennis who is prone to say the worst things at the most inopportune times.Though it's involves a somewhat convoluted plot, \\"Murder at the Vicarage\\" is a fine introduction to Miss Marple, providing a starting point for the eleven novels (and collection of short stories) that follow."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"&quot;The Murder at the Vicarage&quot; is memorable because it introduces the delightful Miss Jane Marple. With her love of gardening, binoculars for bird-watching close-at-hand, and an uncanny ability to find similarities between the present situation and her past experiences and acquaintances, Miss Marple is introduced in her home village of St. Mary Mead. We will return here many times and reacquaint ourselves with the characters introduced in this mystery---the vicar Leonard Clement and his wife Griselda, Mrs. Price Ridley, Colonel Melchett, Dr. Haydock, and others.The murder victim, Colonel Protheroe, is a hateful man disliked by everyone he had dealings with. Therefore, the list of suspects is much longer than usual. There is the victim's second wife, the visiting artist she loves, a mysterious lady with the telling name of Mrs. Lestrange, a teenage daughter, an archaeologist, and a secretary.There are plenty of red herrings in this one and it is up to Miss Marple to reveal if the most likely suspect is also the guilty one in this cozy read for those of us who thrive on evil in small village life."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"Like many other writers, Christie went through an apprentice period during which she created the particular style we recognize as unique to her work. Novels from this early period are hit and miss--and MURDER AT THE VICARAGE, which introduces the famous Miss Marple, might best be described as a bit of both.VICARAGE offers the story of the widely unpopular Col. Protheroe, who seems determined to vex every one he encounters--including his daughter from a former marriage and his current wife, the latter of which has undertaken a liaison with a local artist. One evening the Colonel pays a call to vicarage only to find the Vicar out on a call... and while waiting is shot dead under what seem impossible circumstances. No sooner is the body discovered than people who could not possibly have committed the crime begin to confess, and the Vicar and his neighbor, the meddlesome Miss Marple, form a somewhat uneasy alliance to ferret out the truth.The Miss Marple of this particular novel is not the character we know from later books; although the outlines of the character are well established, she is not greatly sympathetic and she lacks the disconcerting twinkle found in such works as THE BODY IN THE LIBRARY and A MURDER IS ANNOUNCED. Moreover, the other characters, the setting, and the plot seem extremely stiff. The solution, when it comes, is also rather gimmicky in a way which Christie cannot yet make entirely plausible. I would not recommend this particular Christie to newcomers--but I do recommend it longtime fans, who will enjoy seeing how Christie developed the character of Miss Marple and how she herself evolved as a writer, particularly since the outline of the plot is a device to which she would return with considerably greater effect in later and more substantial novels."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"Our narrator, Rev. Clements is articulate, self-deprecating and an able Watson to Miss Marple's Holmes. The locale is the village St. Mary's Mead; the victim is the detestable Col. Protheroe. In their proper places are Flighty Wife, Handsome Artist, Ethereal Ing&eacute;nue, Gruff Physician, Gossipy Maiden Ladies, Timid Curate, and Mysterious Lady. They need no proper names for they appear over and over in Ms. Christie's novels with new names, but are essentially the same people.Col. Protheroe is shot in the back of head while apparently writing a note in the Vicar's study. On the face of it, this seems impossible. Though there are people all about, no one heard a shot from the house. No one saw anyone go near the study. The maid let him in just fifteen minutes before the body was discovered. A pretty kettle of fish! Two false confessions quickly muddy up the waters, and it is discovered that most everyone had a motive for killing the good Colonel, except Miss Marple, who, if truth were told, didn't like him very well either.The intricacies are many, timetables are crucial, but Miss Marple is up to the test. I particularly liked the leisurely lives and pace of St. Mary's Mead. Everyone had servants, you could not move from room to room without being announced. There is some nice humor that runs through regarding the surly maid who runs the vicarage. She is a diffident housekeeper and appalling cook. But the vicar's young wife determinedly keeps her on, for if the maid improves, Griselda fears she would be hired away from them. The vicar bears up as well as he can. People only call upon the police when they feel like it, usually after much discussion with friends and neighbors. The lead policeman has the unfortunate name of Inspector Slack, and Miss Marple gently chides him while he disdains her advice (to his sorrow of course.) The vicar walks everywhere because he cannot master a bicycle. I guess a car would be unthinkable, because it is never mentioned.It all works out to Prime Dame Agatha. And lest you get too comfortable, she will definitely fool you once again. As always---sigh."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"Ms.Marple did it again!. This time, our favourite detective had to deal with a murder in her own village, St.Mary Mead. The victim, Colonel Protheroe, was not a very nice person, so his death almost acceptable to everyone in the village. There's a widow, a daughter, and a mysterious lady from his past, plus a number of people who had a very strong motive to do the murder. But once again Ms.Marple discovered the real murderer with her own old-way. The basic idea of this story is not very special, but the plot is. We'll get some laughs as usual and a satisfaction in the end. Two thumbs up for Agatha Christie!!"},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"As told in the point of view of the vicar himself, The Murder at the Vicarage is an interesting whodunnit whereupon the reader is kept in the dark and enlightened only to be misled again.Unlike Christie's And Then There Were None, the clues aren't dealt out, so it would be nearly impossible for the reader to figure out what is going on. I myself suspected someone from nearly the very beginning, only to find that, had I been a police inspector, I would have quickly lost my job for nearly imprisoning an innocent character.But then, this is true for nearly the entire police force here (and in other Marple books), for it always comes down to Jane Marple's discourse on her facts and her timeline that sets everyone down the correct path. And while in The Body in the Library (third in the series) Miss Marple waits for proof before opening her mouth, here she must speak up in order to... well, you will just have to see.The book is fun, and the vicar's opinionated personality makes for a very intriguing read (what do these religious personalites really think about everyone?). What immediately stood out was how Christie is able to make nearly everyone (this is a dozen characters!) quite possibly the murderer! The finale is, of course, the best part, and I would think to myself, \\"Ah that explains it, but then what about...\\" to which I would find the answer. This occurs four or five times, and even then the reader will have two pages to go to wrap up little details that he or she may have quite forgotten about!The book drags in some areas probably due to our modern requisite for instant gratification. And it was a joy to compare the book cover's painting to the goings-on in the text. I read the 1979 Dell edition.My dictionary dash consisted of only badinage (131) and vituperation (180).Aside: I found a receipt tucked halfway through the book; the price being $1.95, tax 13 and dated 18Oct75. The book, however, was published in 1979. Odd."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"It's no secret that no one in St. Mary Mead likes Colonel Protheroe. He is strict, somber, and by the numbers. But when the vicar returns home late for a meeting, he's surprised to find Colonel Protheroe shot through the head. The local police are called in and two people confess. Yet something doesn't seem quite right. Fortunately, Miss Marple lives next door. With her sharp mind talent for learning gossip, she just might make sense of everything that's happening.Ok, I confess. I love a good cozy mystery but have yet to read much Christie. I can tell I need to change that. This book had me confused from the get go. There were so many red herrings it was hard to tell what was really happening. Yet it all came together at the end in a logical conclusion.I checked this audio version out of the local library for a trip and only after listening to it discovered that it was abridged. While disappointed, I never would have noticed. It was expertly cut, and everything was there I need to enjoy the story. Ian Masters did a great job of bring the characters and story to life.Agatha Christie is a class mystery writer for a reason.

Miss Jane Marple is an elderly spinster of modest means,a life-long resident of the tiny village of St. Mary Mead, an advid gardener and bird watcher and a most astute observer of human nature. Many of the residents and visitors of St. Mary Mead that will return in later works are introduced here, the gentle vicar and his lively younger wife, Raymond West, Jane's novelist nephew and others.The story is told by the vicar and gives us many insights into his homelife. Col. Protheroe is found murdered in the vicarage, much to the delight of his wife and daughter and embarrassment of the vicar. As the local police try to solve the crime it become apparent that Col. Protheroe was not going to be missed and that nobody really had an alibi. As the investigation progresses it seems that more questions are raised than answered. Ultimately it is Miss Marple who resolves the issues of love affairs, mysterious strangers, and assorted lies to uncover the true culprit.This is a perfect gem, Christie at her best. The characters are well written and the descriptions of the lack of privacy in a small are incredibly accurate and a recurring theme of Christie's. In typical Christie style of the rules of detection are flirted with but the clues are fairly laid out for the reader to follow, if they can be separated from the red herrings."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"I do love a good mystery, but I'm afraid I'm just not the target audience for Ms. Christie's crime novels.When I read a mystery, I need it a little grittier. I like hardened detectives or brilliant young hackers, and I like modern stories. I would never argue that Agatha Christie is not a prolific, talented writer, because duh, look at her legacy! But Miss Marple is just too stuffy for me and the writing is too dated, and not in a romantic way. The book is good, just not my cup of tea. I was just bored with it and I wasn't a fan of the language, and by the end, I didn't really care who murdered Colonel Protheroe. The last chapter was sweet and I did smile at some of the subtle jokes, but all in all, I don't think I'd read another Miss Marple book.

For any fan of Agatha Christie, Miss Marple, or English Detective fiction, this one is a must-read.

Flying under the radar, if you will, she is able to pull clues out of people's behavior, and tie together disparate facts, until she has a solution.She is never nasty, always kind, and always right.

I am always trying to figure out the ending, and who did it. This one had me guessing, like they all do.I like Agatha Christie because she is not too formulaic, and her works are always entertaining. It seems like so many books nowadays are the same book with the names of the people and the town changed, making them tedious and predictable. Agatha Christie is decidedly not afflicted with this problem.Overall, I rated this book four stars, because it was interesting, puzzling, and well written, but it wasn't one of her best. The setting was good,(the Vicars study in a tiny village full of busybodies) and the characters were just disfunctional enough (the mostly intelligent vicar being saddled with the shallow, silly wife). But, the twist ending was the first one I ever saw by her that went toward mundane, which is surprising for AC, but it was still good, and sort of a double twist."},{"Title":"The Flathead Saloon and Cathouse","review":"Being from the Flathead, I found the book very accurate and described the area well.

The main character's intended strength is forever applied in his words to others, and these statements are more air than action, so that strength comes out as weakness.

He is also blind.Fascinated with his mother's account of the chalenges of raising a special-needs kid, Sullivan interviewed 200 parents and selected six remarkable families of children with disabilities. Special Parent, Special Child shares the stories of how these parents overcame their personal tragedies and became nurturers of and advocates for their children. The families dealt with diverse circumstances: cerebral palsy, blindness, leukemia, deafness, attention deficit disorder, and Downs syndrome. The insights the parents offer about dealing with educational bureaucracies and medical personnel are valuable to anyone who loves a differently abled or seriously ill child.Sullivan records several guideposts along each family's journey: their reactions to the initial dignosis (and the professionslas who made them); phases of denial and grief; impact on the family unit; how the parents learned to &quot;work the system,&quot; becoming their child's advocate; dealing with the loss of personal identity; socialization; relationships with professionals; and sources of strength and hope. The parents candidly open their hearts, sometimes confessing attitudes of which they are not proud, but which other parents in the same situation would acknowledge as real. But best of all, in sharing their stories, they serve as role models for parents facing the same challenges. They demonstrate how to persevere for the sake of the child, how to search out better alternatives when what's offered isn't satisfactory.Sullivan's style reads like a transcript of a television interview. It's sparked with banter between him and his subjects, and it's occasionally circuitous and redundant.Andrea R.

This is surely one of the greatest true life adventure stories of all time. Even though I knew the eventual outcome of this survival tale, I was kept completely captivated by the events as they unfolded, and the almost unbelievable conditions that these men faced. Lansing's well written book presents the facts in a story form that flows easily from event to event. I purchased the illustrated edition, and the wonderful photos were well worth the extra cost. Hurley's photos illustrated the book in a way that no words could, and I found myself frequently turning back to review them."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This was the first book I read about The Endurance and Shackleton and it's because of Lansing's introduction that I was compelled to read the other Endurance books currently available.

Normally, this story would make a good made-for-tv movie, but this book goes beyond that. The difference is in the details of the participants of this expedition, and on the small details throughout the adventure that provide the reader with a vivid idea of the challeges encountered by the expedition. Also, the writer does an excellent job of puting the reader in a time when radios and aircraft were not in existence and the only hope desperate men could count on was their strength, daring, teamwork, and stubborness. I recommend it even more for those familiar with sailing and nautical adventure, who will enjoy an even more vivid description of the obstacles faced by Shackelton's expedition.

Lansing makes clear the motives that drove the men to take on such a journey and analyzes the personality and ambition of the only man who would take that risk. Fore it was none other than Sir Ernest Shackleton who dared to take on this challenge because no one else had the heart or the audacity to do it first. After their ship, the Endurance, got stuck in the sea ice and was eventually crushed by the immense pressure that it created, the men had no choice but to carry on foot with three small vessels. They had no control over their Fate, and they simply had to battle whatever Mother Nature heaved their way. And Mother Nature did not spare any mercy for the men. However, despite all the times they could have given up, the men held on to a certain faith and hope that everything was going to be all right, and it is bewildering to ponder where that inner force came from. Alfred Lansing does an excellent job to portray and let the reader feel the desperation the men could of had in that situation. Usually its the reader that tries to subconsciously reassure the characters that in the end all will be well, however in this suspenseful adventure, its the men on board the Endurance that reassure the readers with their optimism and trust that they will be all right. Until the final moment of rescue, Nature did not give the men any slack, and instead she seemed to slap them in the face every time they came close to a major step in their journey. Yet in the end, the men defeated all the odds against them, which there were many, and embraced civilization with a deeper understanding of themselves as well as the forces that run their lives. Lansing makes us realize that in the end, we are so small in the scale of life, and we seem to think that the existence of the world revolves around us. Yet, we forget that there is another world that is bigger and more powerful than ours and in the end it will leave us dumbfounded and in awe with amazement. This amazing power, however, can only be understood through the compelling and powerful words of Alfred Lansing."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is one of the best books that I have read.

I found myself just trying to find time to read this, and looked forward to when the kids got to bed so I could get stuck back in.What an epic struggle, this is beyond anything anyone can imagine what they had to go through, and I just can't believe how they all survived in the end. The writing is first rate, and there's no point where despite being marooned for a long time that one feels one is marooned in the book waiting for it. Pacing is excellent.If I was to make one critical comment is that at the end, one feels a bit empty, because the story is over, and I felt connected to the people in the book that I wanted to know a little bit more of what happened after.

It is clear that the author did an incredible amount of research, and though this book doesn't read like a novel, its presentation is much more powerful this way, giving a panoramic view of the whole terrible and desperate situation of these men.I don't have any experience even comparable to what these men went through, the closest I've ever come is rowing down the coast of Maine in the summer in a 30 foot pulling boat, and I'll tell you, this guy gets every detail.Anyway, an absolutely incredible look at human endurance, at what a person will go through if he must. I definitely recommend this book to everyone.One note...make sure the version you buy or get at the library has expedition photographer Hurley's photographs in it. Some paperback editions don't, and you're really missing part of the experience without them."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This book is one of the few exceptional -absolutely execptional- tales of survival and it proves the maxim that nothing is so bad that it can't get worse. But also it proves that you can know the end of a story - it is a well known fact that Shackleton brought all his men through this arduous trial and all survived - and it doesn't spoil the story at all. Truth is not only stranger than fiction, but it is a good deal harder.The bare-bones of the story are that Shackleton and his team left civillisation in 1914 in the Endurance to travel to attempt to reach the South Pole - a trip he had tried and failed by only a couple of hundred miles or so to achive in 1908. Amundsen had already reached the pole first but for Shackleton it was unfinished business. The Endurance had been built to push through the pack ice, but conditions proved too much and it was trapped in pack ice. Summer wore on and there was no escape - the winds were in the wrong direction - then winter hit and they were trapped in their boat. They settled in to a routine until the ice went against them and cracked the Endurance. Shackleton realised the only way out was on their own, so they abandoned the boat and made for the pack ice at first dragging the boats, then relying a floe to carry them north where they might find more supplies, or be rescued.In the end they had to rescue themselves and this is the story of their indomitable courage and strength to survive under incredibly harsh conditions and in grave discomfort. We are talking about camping out in antartica - in less than adequate shelter, with essentially starvation rations, no heating, barely adequate clothing.Lansing tells this story in a sparing style and it really works. He has had access to (I think) all the diaries available from men who kept them on the trip and they are very revealing of both personalities and foibles of the various characters who made up the trip - and these aren't all a bunch of saintly characters pulling together for the sake of their team and mutual survival - they fight, some are occassionally selfish, they love their dogs but have almost no compunction of putting them down when they have to - and they are very real and human.Lansing also brings to light some of the things you wouldn't think about it - the incredible boredom that they all felt, that they were generally alternatvely wracked by either gripping hunger or desparate need for survival and how to escape - the one emotion replacing the other depending on conditions. He also explains some of the things you wouldn't even think to ask - how they went to the toilet for instance, the conditions inside the huts and the tents and so on. It brings a very vivd picture of life as it must have been for the group.And really, nothing isn't so bad that it can't get worse. Each time you think that Shackleton is about to win there is a small disaster, or the elements go against them - they are constantly battling for their lives with decreasing odds of their survival. Even once they make it off the floe and onto land they have to move again to a safer landing place - and then they must work out how to get help. The nearest land is Chile some 500 miles away but it is almost impossible to get to because of wind and current, so they must try to South Georgia, over 800 miles away and a tiny speck of an island 25 miles across and they only thing in their way between Antartica and South Africa. Hardly an easy thing find in an open 22 foot boat. I know recently they tried to re-enact the voyage of Shackleton in his tiny boat - the James Caird - but without success as storms forced them to abandon the attempt. And that was a luxury trip compared to Shackleton's - the conditions on board were appalling - with stones for ballast - very little room and the ever present rotting reindeer hair from their sleeping bags. It is all credit to their navigator Frank Worsley that they reached South Georgia at all....but then they had had to land on the wrong side of the island due to conditions......but read the book - definitely read it.....This book would make a great adventure book to introduce Antarctic exploration for younger children or teenagers as it is so vivid and so exciting. They are chased by killer whales and leopard seals, they are constantly fighting the elements and they are if nothing else a very human group of people. This is one of the best books of survival I have ever read and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I first became interested in Shackleton's incredible story after seeing photos and a short version of Caroline Alexander's book in the National Geographic a couple of years ago. Since then, I've read and reread Lansing's account, as well as Alexander's, and twice seen the new Butler documentary which incorporates the photos and early film of the expedition's photographer, Frank Hurley.This is quite simply one of the most amazing stories I've ever read. Survival in the face of incredible hardship. Astonishing bravery, persistence, and resourcefulness, all in the face of unimaginable bad luck. This story should have ended in death at least five times. Instead, after 16 (or 20, depending on who you're counting for) months marooned in the antarctic circle, not a single member of Shackleton's crew was lost.Lansing's account is creditable and more interesting than Alexander's, though her book has the better pictures. I'd suggest buying both."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Whew!! That's the first word that comes to my mind. It surfaced in my thoughts numerous times as I was reading this tale. This book is overwhelming. I had always heard tales about Shackleton and this was a most compelling read. I found myself unable to put it down. It just grabs a hold of you and won't let go. Alfred Lansing did a superb job of storytelling here. It is one of the most amazing tales of human courage and endurance ever written. This is a fabulous story. Sir Ernest Shackleton truly displayed extraordinary mettle in spite failing to achieve the initial objective. His leadership is undeniable. He held a crew together to endure the harshest climate on the planet. That the entire crew survived the venture is testament to the power of the human spirit. The will to survive can attain soaring heights as this tale suggests. Lansing attempts to get into the nature of the different men but he allows their diaries to dictate the writing. This is great because supposition by authors of nonfiction can be fatuous. Drawing excerpts from the diaries of the men is a way to draw upon the incredible human drama and psychology that must have unfolded in this venture. The obstacles encountered by the crew are staggering. The wind, the dampness, the bitter cold and the long months of darkness in the winter seem like more than any man should be able to stand. They slept in wet sleeping bags in sub-freezing temperature; ate unappetizing foods; and still managed to keep their hopes alive. These were not accommodations up to Hyatt standards. One wonders how many people today would be tough enough to triumph over these hardships. The pain, ennui and discomfort must have been staggering. I found myself just shaking my head with awe at numerous passages in the book. These are men who went to Hell and came back alive. That is remarkable in and of itself. This book is a classic account of one of man's most remarkable journeys. Read it and discover for yourself."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Endurance by Alfred Lansing was first published in 1959. The copy I have is a 26th printing which indicates how popular this book has been. It is an adventure story that is entirely historical. It covers the 1914/15 attempt of explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton and his crew of 27 to be the first to cross the Antarctic continent overland west to east. This goal was interrupted for good when their ship, the Endurance, became trapped in ice in the Weddell Sea. The call for adventure soon became a constant struggle for survival that lasted ten months. The crew set up camp on various ice floes only to be forced to move when the dreaded cracks appeared. Their progress towards land is controlled by the direction and force of the gales. Conditions change almost daily in the chaotic and brutal Antarctic climate. When the ice floes were no longer an option, the crew set out in three small boats taken on the voyage hoping to find land. Once land was found, the crew split up as six members took one of the small boats into the dreaded Drake Passage in the hopes of finding help. Both groups were in danger of not surviving the unforgiving environment.Lansing bases his work on interviews with survivors and the waterlogged diaries several of them kept. He is thus able to provide the reader with details of the crew's day-to-day life. Everything from the personalities of various members to their diets, clothing, attempts at building shelters, etc. are described. I do not have knowledge of seafaring vocabulary or conditions, but Lansing is able to describe such things as the pressure caused by broken floes of ice (p.47) in a clear manner. As an historical event, this story needs no poetic license. It is one of the most suspenseful history books I have read. Just when things looked good for the crew, the tide turned and vice versa. After reading what all these 28 men went through, the ending, although surprisingly brief, was very moving.The only part of the book that disappointed me was the ending. I wanted to know what happened to some of the main characters after their ordeal. The epilogue just covers the attempt to rescue the 22 members left on Elephant Island and goes no further. It seemed unfair to leave the story like that. Despite this shortcoming, I definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in historical adventure. It is one of the best books of that ilk one will read. One interesting note: Shackleton's goal was not achieved until 1958, 40 years after Shackleton set out on the Endurance and a year before this book was first published. It is 282 pages and includes a short section of b&w; photos and illustrations."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"On the basis of Amazon reviewers, I got a copy of this book from my university's library. After reading it, I've ordered a personal copy. Lansing's a marvelous writer. His prose is elegant, powerfully and wonderfully descriptive, and he knows how to hold the reader as captive as Shackleton's crew on the ice flow. The Amazon reviewers who mildly complained about the book becoming somewhat bogged down about two-thirds through are right--but in no way does that compromise the essence and thrill of this adventure story. I read it wanting to know more about Shackleton's leadship philosophy and strategies, but what I came away with was an unbridled appreciation of the composition and virtues of his crew: how they managed to get along, their infinite patience, and their quiet courage in what must have been--despite all the description--an utterly unimagineable ordeal. It is exceedingly odd and wonderfully paradoxical that Shackleton totally failed in his objective to cross the South Pole--he never got close. But he had this extraordinary adventure. I don't see how a person can be unaffected after reading this book.Readers who really get into this book should also get a copy of Shackleton's own account, which I think is entitled &quot;South.&quot; The reason is that that book is full of black and white photographs of the adventure which add immensely (and that's putting it mildly) to Lansing's prose. The photos show a world of startling beauty and grandeur, and they provide new meaning to being &quot;up against the elements.&quot;Last, one has to be grateful to Amazon.com for enabling readers to review books. I would have never stumbled upon Endurance without the readers' reviews section."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Everything that defines courage and leadership for our age and any other is within the 280 pages of this wonderful book. For nearly two years, in conditions of constant zero and below cold, freezing wet, and often hunger, Ernest Shackleton kept all 27 men who sailed with him on the Endurance alive to eventually return to the England they left on the verge of World War I. That single-minded devotion to his men should make this book required reading for every would-be politician and corporate executive before he dares ask for the faith, trust and respect of those he would lead.Lansing dedicated the book &quot;In appreciation for whatever it is that makes men accomplish the impossible.&quot; He wisely and without flourish often lets the men's own words -- through the journals that many of them kept at the time and in interviews forty years later -- tell their extraordinary story, each stage of which reads more harrowing than the last. On an expedition that would have attempted to cross the Antarctic on foot (a feat not accomplished until four decades later), the Endurance is trapped in pack ice before it can reach shore. Shackleton's perhaps foolhardy original goal thus turns to keeping his men alive until they can be rescued. After ten months locked in the drifting pack, the Endurance is crushed and the men forced to abandon her for an ice floe, then several weeks later a smaller floe still. Eventually they take to three boats to reach forlorn Elephant Island from which Shackleton takes a skeleton crew of five and in a 22 foot open boat navigates the enormous seas of Drake's Passage to South Ascension Island. Once there he only (only!) has uncharted glaciers to cross to reach the whaling station on the other side of the island from which rescue of the Elephant Island castaways is eventually launched. The only other crossing of South Georgian Island by foot at the time Lansing wrote in 1959 occurred on a &quot;easier&quot; route with equipment and time. Shackleton had neither, only a fifty foot piece of rope, a carpenter's adze, and the knowledge that to stop moving was to invite death by freezing. At journey's end, to the astonished manager of the whaling factory, he says simply, &quot;My name is Shackleton.&quot; I would have liked to have known him and all his men."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is a superbly written account of an Antarctic expedition led by Sir Ernest Shakleton on a ship named Endurance. It is trapped by ice and eventually crushed by it. In order to survive, the crew look toward it's leader for answers and the only chance at rescue is to make it to a whaling station that is more than 1500 miles away. Everything is frozen, the weather is the worst on earth and thats just the begining. It's all here, the amazing spirit that some humans show when pushed to the brink of death, starvation, freezing, thirst, tiredness to the deepest parts of one's existence, humor, friendship, respect, leadership, etc. How it must have been for these men to survive such a harrowing experience is beyond belief. If not because it was so well documented by the individual crew members who kept journals, indeed no one would beleive it. To have survived so many months floating on a moving, cracking, shifting, crushing ice floe only to have to undertake an 800 mile sea voyage in a 22 foot lifeboat in the most brutal ocean in the world where winds rarely fall below huricane force, find and land on a hellish coast of a small island easily missed. Then on foot and starving have to coss it on ground so treacherous that no one had crossed it before, or would dare again for another 50 yrs. A brutal reading that will leave you exhausted. Pass it on and share with your friends and family."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I literally couldn't put this book down. And that rarely happens. Yes, the story begins slowly as Lansing has to give us some background on the crew and some context for the expedition, which goes as planned for the first few months. But both the story and Lansing's telling of it become increasingly compelling as the events become more and more unbearable.I mean, think about being stuck on a floating island of ice for 5 months, eating seals and penguins, exposed continually to sub-freezing (even sub-zero) conditions roughly 1000 miles from civilization's last outpost. And the truly horrendous conditions are yet to come! The story pushes you well into the territory of the unimaginable... and just keeps going. There seems no end to their trials, no constraints on the degree of their suffering. And yet all survive.Others have said the Lansing version is the best, and I was very satisfied to read it first. It has narrative power. But I would also recommend you buy Caroline Alexander's book as a companion, mainly for Hurley's amazing photos but also for even more context on the flawed aspects of most expeditions during this period and the class differences among the Endurance's crew.Still, this a story everyone should know. It really stretches the limits of what one imagines is humanly possible for one to endure. It's as if Shackleton and his men made definitive claim, for all time, to some capacity for survival that should make us all potentially much stronger than we tend to think we are."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"It's been a long time since I came across a book that I couldn't put down. Despite all the more recent books about Shackleton, Alfred Lansing's book is still wonderful. He creates a sort of suspense so you are constantly wondering what will happen next to this band of star-crossed but determined explorers, what harrowing hardship will they overcome next? . I couldn't help musing whether I would behave as bravely in their situation. A great read!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Back when there were 109 reviews and I contemplated adding one, I asked myself &quot;Why would someone add the 110th review for a book that already had 109?&quot; Now that there are 302, and I'm finally getting around to adding one, the answer is the same as it was then: because the story is that compelling.I'll leave it to others to fill in the details of Shackleton's 5 ordeals: months on the Antarctic ice in fabric tents; 100 miles in the frigid seas in 3 open rowboats; crossing 800 miles of the Drake passage---the only area of the globe where the lines of longitude are uninterrupted by landmass---in a 22-foot lifeboat with a meager sail... surviving not only 60-foot swells called the &quot;Cape Horn Rollers&quot; but a hurricane that claimed a 500-ton steamer; traversing 12 miles of the uncharted 6,000-foot glacier mountains of South Georgia island with only a pick, 50-feet of rope, and nails in their soles; and finally persisting 4 months through 4 attempts to rescue their comrades.Here's my contribution. Where others have equivocated, let me clarify for you, this is Man's greatest story of survival and rescue. And Lansing's novelized account is the one that captures the story in its full drama and will etch it indelibly into one's mind.I recently sent a copy of the new, pictorialized edition---my first reading was of a text-only 1959 library copy---to a friend and apologized that the pictures might make it hard to let the imagination do its full work. I encourage you to enjoy the unadorned story, as a novel, first if you can. If like me, you are of a mind to value resourcefulness and indefatigability, then you too will probably find yourself under Shackleton's spell for your remaining days. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Endurance is a true story about an explorer named Ernest Shackleton who tried to cross Antarctica. While traveling to Antarctica, his ship got trapped in ice. He was stuck on the ice with his crew for months until his ship, the Endurance, was abandoned. They then lived on the ice until they attempted to escape back to civilization. They hiked across miles of ice and sailed in life boats to Deception Island. Shackleton sailed to an Island nearly 500 miles away, then crossed the islands uncharted interior by foot. Finally he stumbled into the whaling station with his two companions and sent a relief ship to the rest of his crew on Deception Island.This was a great book. It kept me on the edge of my seat through the entire book. The odds of the entire crew surviving was astronomical, and to think that Shackleton actually pulled off the rescue is amazing. It was a gripping story about survival. I would recommend this book to anybody who likes history, and to anybody wants to read about a truly amazing adventure."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is one of the 10 best books I've ever read; among such treasures as &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; and Upton Sinclair's &quot;The Jungle&quot;. For these men to have survived the harshest conditions known to man is an inspiration to people everywhere that, where there is a will, there is a way. When I go through a bitter cold Wisconsin winter again, I will never look at it in the same way I did before. The agony, frustration and longing these men endured was truly more than most men are capable of overcoming. In an age of modern conveniences where not having cable is considered a hardship, this book brings back the tough spirit of men who tested every fiber of their being. This book should be mandatory reading for all school-age children so they know there is a world beyond PlayStation and all the other trappings of our sedentary society. The adversity these men faced is beyond my comprehension. Buy the book! You won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Due to the braveness shown by the men throughout this book, and it being a true story I gave this book a 5 because it couldn't have been written in any other way. It shows the hardships the men had to face. The details about the men's desparity to live and how they had to kill their own pack of dogs were gruesome, but show the hardships the men had to face. Alfred Lansing made the moment by moment details make the book come to life along with the seemingly doomed men. His own personal hands-on research on the ship and the voyage make it a very honest story to believe. The wind, the dampness, the bitter cold and the long months of darkness in the winter seem like more than any man should be able to stand. They slept in wet sleeping bags in sub-freezing temperature; ate unappetizing foods; and still managed to keep their hopes alive. It is only the resourcefulness of Sir Ernest and the hand of God that allows these men to avoid a certain death. These are men who went to Hell and came back alive. At the end of the book all 28 men who started on the voyage survive. This is one of those books that truly puts life into perspective. What these men went through--had to go through--simply for survival is utterly amazing and inspirational. I could not imagine any more desolate and hopeless conditions. The book speaks a lot for the endurance of the human spirit, its willingness and strength to continue on at all odds as long as a shred of hope still remains. Having the photographs from the voyage included in Alexander's book adds an important extra advantage point to the story. This is a must-read book about leadership and courage in almost incomprehensible circumstances. I have NEVER stayed up all night reading a book and admit I read for extra points in English class, but once I started, I couldn't put this one down. I was exhausted the next day from lack of sleep, but enjoyed the journey."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Full disclosure: I read Caroline Alexander's book prior to Lansing's, and strongly believe - despite the hype surrounding Lansing's supposed classic retelling - that Alexander's is the superior work.This opinion is in some part based upon the impact of the lavish reprinting of Frank Hurley's photos in Alexander's book. By contrast, the poor reproductions appearing in Lansing's work are notable only by their odd selection. The small set does no justice to the tale at all. To think that the full impact of these photos was not revealed until the '90s in the form of Alexander's book and contemporaneous exhibits!!Lansing's book also perpetuates one of the big lies of Hurley's work: for some reason, the famous picture of the Elephant Island crew waving at a boat in the distance is termed as &quot;The Rescue: Help comes at last.&quot; Instead - as Alexander clears up - this picture depicts the James Caird *leaving* the island on its start of the epic journey to South Georgia.Through the photos, Alexander's book gives you a better feel for the distinct personalities that make up the crew of the Endurance. But to give credit to Lansing, his effort certainly does a much finer job at detailing the deprivations and tribulations faced by the crew and throughout his tale, death seems a more probable outcome (and realistically so).Lansing seems to lose steam at the end: the trek across South Georgia and the trip back to Elephant Island is wrapped up in 20 pages, when it could easily make up an entire book. Then it's left to the publisher to add a couple of comments about some significant events after the journey is wrapped up.Good thing Alexander's work exists to feed the answers to the obvious question: how did life play out for these amazing inividuals?"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This book tells the story of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914-16. Lansing wrote the original manuscript in 1959, based on the diaries and recollections of the expedition's members. He tells this gripping story in a spare prose that only adds to the story's terrific suspense.Shackleton's aim was to compensate the Empire for the American Robert Peary's being the first to reach the North Pole in 1909 and for the Norwegian Roald Amundsen's beating Robert Scott to the South Pole in 1912. With 27 men, Shackleton set sail in the Endurance from Buenos Aires in October 1914, seeking to make the first overland crossing of the Antarctic - an ambition not achieved until 1958.They left the island of South Georgia in December, but in January the Endurance became trapped in pack ice in the Weddell Sea, and stayed trapped for nine months until she sank in November. They were 1200 miles from the nearest human beings. They had no radio transmitter and no hope of rescue. The crew now struggled North for six months, travelling 400 miles, walking and dragging their three boats, drifting on fragile ice floes.They launched the boats after the pack ice finally released them, and made a six-day voyage to Elephant Island, where Shackleton left 22 men camped. Then he and five crewmembers sailed 850 miles back to South Georgia - sixteen days, in an open twenty-foot boat, across the stormiest ocean in the world. Shackleton and two others then trekked across the mountains and glaciers of South Georgia, a crossing next made in far easier conditions in 1955.The tale shows how all the men discussed what they had to do next and how, once they took a decision, they implemented it. It also shows Shackleton's extraordinary powers of decision and judgment. Despite their appalling ordeals, they didn't lose a man. No wonder that Chris Bonington called it \`the greatest survival story of all time'."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Earnest Shackleton's 1914 Antarctic expedition has recently become a sort of mini-industry on PBS, A&E;, History Channel, BBC along with an embarrassment of riches in books, photography, websites, clubs, museums. Certainly the attention is warranted, it is one of the most incredible polar survival stories ever. However it was not always that way - after the expedition returned in 1916 it was largely overshadowed by World War I, and besides, Shackleton never even reached Antarctica, much less the South Pole, it didn't capture the publics fascination. Not until 1959 when unknown journalist Alfred Lansing published his first and only book Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage did the world really start to notice this incredible story.Lansing's account starts with a bang and never lets up to the last sentence - it is a thrilling edge of the seat ride where, when things can't get any worse, they do. There have been a number of other re-tellings since, including most recently by Caroline AlexanderThe Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition(1998), however none of these match Lansings for its energy and drive. Most importantly some of the original crew members were still alive when Lansing wrote his book so he was able to get first hand accounts - more than an archival history, it is a primary source of not only the officers but the entire crew. Based on an informal survey of Amazon best-seller lists and LibraryThing library holdings, this book is probably the single most widely read account of any polar expedition, a canonical leader of its genre. Still, for the serious student, Shackleton's own version of events inSouth: The Last Antarctic Expedition of Shackleton and the Endurance(1919) and Worsley'sEndurance: An Epic of Polar Adventure(1933) are required reading and very good in their own right, I look forward to continuing my \\"Shackleton journey\\" with those books next."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"What strikes me so profoundly is the leadership study the book almost unitentionally provides in its views of Shackleton. Over and over he makes seemingly intuative choices that are really well thought out, showing his intimate study of the men in his crew and they prove perfect for maintaining peace and harmony amoung his men stuck in very close quarters for the better part of two years. That there was so little tendancy for rebellion speaks volumes about his character and what he inspired in others. He was careful when need be and seemingly reekless when the situation called for it such as his decision to slide down the mountain in the final stage of the rescue trek.This alone would make for wonderful reading, but you live the life on the men on the ice suddenly finding yourself running for your life from a Leapord Seal that came lunging out of the sea planning to eat you. We are not talking about a cute little Sea World animal, but a twelve foot creature that out weighs you ten to one and will catch and kill you unless you companions can shoot it in the next few moments.Even though you know the outcome this book never lets go of its grip on you until the end which is unsettlingly sudden. The lives of the men demonstrate the values and importance of things too often neglected in our day and age. A tremendous tool to teaching values!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I saw a documentary on the Shackleton Voyage on PBS and decided to read the book.

I was enthralled then and after recently reading again must confirm my initial impression.Since then I have also read his book on the 1908 - 1909south polar expedition, and although not as exciting asEndurance, is notable for its level of detail.

I highly recommend this book as an interesting and engrossing tale of the enduring human spirit."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"It was an unbelievably thrilling book. Ernest Shackleton was a man for the time; perceptive, decisive, and commanding. Some sections of the story were tragically sad and I quickly skipped over those parts.

Circumstances make for human adaptation and this is the key to survival, even on the most desperate conditions. When a team has a leader that knows this, and also has the strength and will to survive, social dinamics start working towards this comon goal.This book is a reflection of the great dificulties that a real explorer, and his team, endure to survive whilst traped by the inmense icecap of the Wadel sea in one of the most remote regions of the world, the antarctic."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Very comprehensive and well written.

The author does a great job of bringing to life many of he key characters. An amazing story of survival."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyageis a great story and a great read. The sheer strength of will exhibited by Shackleton and his expedition are the stuff of legend. The legacy of their \\"failed\\" expedition so exceeds the intent of the original endeavor to make the reality of their adventure greater than any conceived plot device or television game format. That is to say, \\"You can't make this stuff up\\"!Alfred Lansing's treatment is a superb and objective story telling from the real life accounts of participants. The story is rendered with great skill and relates the big picture of the events without any forced drama or exploitation other than the true facts of the story. Such is the depth and thrill of their tale. The only negative may be the lack of details provided as to the fates of most of the expedition members. However, I believe the author refrained from the inclusion to allow the story to stand on its own as a tribute to the collective effort of the men and Shackleton's leadership.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book in the hot sun with an endless supply of cold cervaza in Cancun, Mexico. The juxtaposition of my own condition with that of the of cold terror of the ice floes and endless penguin hoosh made for a great vacation read and I cannot give a higher recommendation."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it was amazing what they went through and that they all survived.

But my niece (she's in the Navy) said I had to read Endurance. She lent me (unknown to her) a hardcopy first edition. As other reviewers have said, no one could have made-up this book. It is *way* too unthinkable.I got to the last page of the book, read the last sentence, then turned back to the first page and started the whole thing all over again. Really. I've never done that with any book--ever.Anyway, I bought another four copies from Amazon and gave two to my niece when I returned the original (and told her to stop lending out the first edition). That leaves me with one for myself and one to lend out. Barely enough.The hardcopy (out of print) edition has some awesome pictures and a map on the inside cover. The paperbook is missing both. Hopefully someone will reprint this book again with the pictures and map included.You might be able to find the pictures somewhere on the Internet(I haven't yet)"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"A stunning achievement!!! ...not just the feat, but the novel.

One of the absolute best books I have ever read, hands-down, period...dot. Order this book right now!!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I really enjoyed this book. At first I had my doubts only because the events took place between 1914-1916, and I was interested in a travel/adventure story that was more up-to-date. However, I'm very glad I purchased this book, and I'll bet that little has changed in the remote and harsh environment of the Antarctic since the early 1900's.This book is about the adventures of a group of 27 men (and one stowaway) who set sail for the Antarctic continent in an effort to make the first Trans-Antarctic voyage under the leadership of Edward Shackleton (i.e., sail to the Antarctic, cross the continent by foot, and board a ship which had landed on the opposite side of the continent).This is a truly riveting adventure story. I'm amazed at the teamwork and long-suffering of these men. If such an adventure was attempted today without the aid of technology, there would be tragic loss of life. Certainly God was on their side. Even though they endured incredible pain and hardship, God was merciful time and time again. Many things went wrong, yet there were many other perils which they were saved from. Unfortunately, people like this either don't exist any more or are extremely hard to find.There's only one nagging question in my mind concerning this book: Whatever happened to the ship and crew which was supposed to meet them on the other side of the Antarctic and make provisions along the land route which they were to travel?If you've read \\"Into Thin Air,\\" then you'll find the teamwork of the men on the Endurance to be a refreshing change from the \\"every man for himself\\" attitude of most of the climbers of the Everest expedition.I highly recommend this book. And if you like this book (and I'm sure you will), then you will also like \\"Into Thin Air\\" by Jon Krakauer (another book which I highly recommend)."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I learned about this book from hearing the CEO of Amazon.com speak to the Commonwealth Club of California, two weeks ago. His enthusiasm for this book caused me to immediately go to the library for it. How lucky I was to hear about it. This book is truly one of the real &quot;finds&quot; of all time. Although I had known of Shackleton and of his feat, I did not know how he had accomplished it.Now Im still not sure, and afterward,Im sure, neither did he. It just one of those incredible episodes.Suffice to say that he was able to keep the respect and obedience of his men through some incredible times. I was particularly impressed with the writing of the author. His description of the &quot;rollers&quot; off Cape Horn was great. How he conveyed the lifting of the small boat to the heights of these tremendous waves, and how , after a time, the men allowed it become commonplace, &quot; a thousand times a day&quot;, and how the author has Shackleton quickly convince his two companions to join together to negotiate a steep mountainside &quot;like tobogganeers without a toboggan&quot; is thrilling stuff.

More exciting than John Krakauer's &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; (even I find that hard to believe), more eyewitness accounts than in Sebastian Junger's &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; and overall more gripping than Robin Knox Johnson's &quot;A World of My Own&quot;.

At first it was slow to develop but like all non-fiction, you need to get the technical jargon (i.e. ship specs, crew, supplies, history) out of the way before the true adventure can begin to unfold. The adventure and misery builds and builds until you almost become numb (pardon the pun) to the low level misery such as cold, wet, and hunger which lasts throughout the journey and expect greater and greater problems to occur, which they do. Then at the end of the book, it brings you back to reality by placing everything in clear perspective by comparison and leaves you with a true sense of awe and respect for these people. A good analogy would be to compare them to astronauts somehow returning from the moon without their ship.

Incredible tale of perserverance, luck, and faith! I think I've read this story 3 times over the years"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Shackleton's Voyage by Donald Barr Chidsey is the most dramatic tale of survival against all odds that I have read since Gary Paulsen's Hatchet. The thing that fascinated me most in this book was the fact that after Shackleton had failed on his first attempt to discover the South Pole, he proceeded to try again, some six years later, with a crew of 26, aboard the greatest ship of the time, the Endurance. It fascinated me because I couldn't understand why, after seeing the devastation and hardships that could, and would be faced, he would do it again. The best part of the story occurs in the last 30 pages or so, when Shackleton decides the only way they will ever make it out alive is by walking out of their own icy tomb. There's a quote in this section that I especially liked, where things finally turn around. It is the last paragraph, on page 161. &quot;Why not? Somebody had to go and get help. The men might survive a winter on this highly inhospitable island, but with the coming of spring in September, they could not reasonably hope to be spotted and rescued by some stray whaler. So they would have to go and get their own help; and the person to do that, obviously, was Earnest Henry Shackleton. They were his boys weren't they?&quot; I was mesmerized by this quote, because it shows that these explorers were finally taking things into their own hands.The theme of this story is that no matter how bad things are, you should never give up hope. The commitment to hope, to overcoming what seems impossible, is something that I feel very strongly about because it is a decision to always push forward, to go on with life, to not surrender. The only thing that these stranded men had left was hope, and with no safe shelter, inadequate clothing, nothing but pemmican to eat day after day, and sheer, unbearable boredom, hope was the only thing they had left. With things going so horribly, if they gave up hope, they might as well have given up their lives. This theme relates to me, being the eternal optimist that I am, because I hold hope close to my heart. As an optimist, and also an athlete and a person with a learning disability, I have found over and over again, that it is the belief that things can always be better that keeps you in the game of life. Without hope that belief would be gone.This is a book well worth the read. It is an exciting and intriguing adventure that introduces you to the early exploration of the Antarctic. It is an awesome adventure where 26 ordinary men battle the elements and themselves . I recommend this book so strongly because it's one that even if you're not an explorer you would like to imagine yourself as one."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This book is spellbinding, and I'm trying to figure out why so many people like it (myself included). Yes, the endurance; yes, the determination; but still. . . Plenty of other stories like that.It reminds me of another astonishing book which Amazon.com also discovered, about several canoe journeys across Labrador about the same time (&quot;Great Heart&quot; by James Davidson and John Rugge). I think that's because both books start with failure rather than success. Shackleton never gets close to accomplishing his original goal; Hubbard (an adventurer who attempts to cross Labrador by canoe) starves to death. Yet by choosing stories with failure at the center, I think each resonates with so many who read them. We all make miscalculations, get in over our heads; so the story becomes how individuals cope with adversity. Hubbard starves, but in failure he utterly transforms the lives of the people closest to him. Shackleton is trapped by the ice, but leads his men on a mission that defines the human spirit."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The book could not keep my attention.

The reason that i think that is the ideal audience is because it is a awsome adventure that has to do with all male characters in the great outdoors. In my opinion this is a great non-fiction book. it tells about Shakletons great adventure from personal accounts and also from mony of the diaries kept on this impossible voyage.The plot of the book is exactly what happened in the best order that the author could get his information. After going through all of the diaries and interviews this author put together a great book discribing the true trials and tribulations of a voyage that would seem nearly impossible to any one at this day and age. One of the things i thought was not so great aout the book os how redundant it was but it infact had to be that way to show how incredibly long and exhausting this voyage was. Shakleton takes his crew on past the limits of man in his advanture to cross the south pole on foot. However on his way to accoplish this goal for his country he comes acros a road block in which his ship is stuck and stranded in enormous ice drifts untill it is completely crushed. Throughout the book it tells how him and his crew survive going from ice flow to ice flow occasionally using there boats to find some place somewhere in a climate intalarable where they could get help to survive.the emothions in this book were not all good and not all bad. Most of the men throughout that book had a feeling of hopelesnessBut even then when they had few tings to look forward to and they made the best out of something miserable. i think tha6t this book is great and very intersting to anyone who likes the outdoors and is into real stories of impossible accomplishments."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Although Lansing's text is excellent, I could hardly get past the forward written by James C. Dobson, who somehow got limitied publishing rights for this book and had it published by Tyndale. It appears that he could not tolerate Lansing's failure to provide overwhelming evidence that these men constantly and frequently turned to God in their travails. The forward and the afterword are nothing short of Christian proselytizing. As a Jew I am not interested in Dobson's religious beliefs and in his comparisons of the heroism of Shakelton and the rescue of his crew to the 2nd coming of Christ. Nor am I interested in purchasing a book that has been &quot;edited in content for a Christian audience&quot;. What the hell does that even mean? Did they eliminate &quot;dirty words&quot; from the diary quotes? And why are we not told by Amazon.com that of the two paperback editions, the Tyndale had this offensive (to some) Christian forward and afterword - and who knows what editing in between? Please inform your customers!

But having said that, they got into their predicament because Shackleton chose to ignore reports of bad ice starting out and forged ahead hoping that things would get better instead of safely delaying. This is an attitude that seemed to be pretty normal with the explorers of the day and which earned huge success and much glory when lucky and dead otherwise. Still happens. Not a place to push your luck.The account of how the sled dogs where treated and often casually disposed of in those days helped illustrate the bad situation. The men obviously cared for their dogs but didn't hesitate to shoot them when Shackleton ordered it.Finally, Shackleton's 32 mile traverse with Worsley and Crean to reach the Stromness whaling station on the South Georgia Islands is amazing. I've been there and at the base of those mountains and glaciers you get the impression you're on another planet. Stark and rugged is an understatement.The expedition pulled off a highly unsurvivable adventure all the while lacking any of the gear that we consider essential these days for Antarctic work. Well done all around - author and participants."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is an excellent adventure tale with strong characters, strong plot, excellent antagonist, and in a well developed (very realistic) world. Foolish words aside (I've been reading too much fantasy recently) I greatly enjoyed reading this book. For anyone with even a remote taste for outdoors I would say this is required reading for sure. There are few non-fiction tales written this good with such high quality description and detail.

A great read!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This fast-paced story is one of the greatest adventure stories of modern history. Ernest Shackleton's crew spent over one year trapped in the frozen Weddell Sea. In the end every member of the crew survived.The most puzzling part of this story, though, is the mystery of &quot;The Extra Crewmember&quot;. The expedition began with a total of 28 men, but returned with 29. Nobody could account for the extra person. Crew manifests were checked and double-checked, and each crew member was interviewed in detail about their recollection of who was in the group at the beginning and end of the journey. There are many theories to this day that a French fisherman, who was eager to thwart Britain's attempt to be the first to cross Antarctica, snuck abord the Endurance at night just after the crew departed from South Georgia Island. Unfortunately, this edition does not address this mystery, which is detailed in the book &quot;Shackleton's Little Friend&quot; (1974)."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"One of the most rewarding books I have read in the past few years. If you think you have read adventure stories, think again.

Not only true, but took place in a period of little technology, in what is still the most inhospitable place on Earth. I literally could not put it down (I finished it while landing at the Albuquerque airport, and did not get out of my seat until I was finished reading--and the plane was completely empty!) I tell everyone to read it. It should be required reading in school. It should be required reading before ever complaining about how hard life is. This is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"What a great book. I read this while sitting in a center seat on a 19 hour flight Hong Kong. Under such conditions, it is rather difficult to be on the edge of your seat. But, this book managed to keep me there.I think the thing that most amazed me about this story is the courage of the men as they went through this ordeal."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This book should be assigned reading for high school and college students. I wished I had read this book earlier so I could have seen how trivial people's everyday problems were compared to what Shackleton and his crew faced. It is an incredible story of survival and leadership. Even though this book was written so many years ago, it is in accessible language and it draws from the diaries of the men in the crew. It doesn't have pictures but I thought it was better that way because I could focus on the story itself. Alfred Lansing's language is very accessible and although some of my friends mentioned that the navigation/boating language was sometimes too much for them to follow, they appreciated it nonetheless because it made everything more real. It immersed them into the story. The book does rush through the last part of the rescue process a bit, but there are other books out there that can fill in the gaps. This book is a classic, if you are looking for a book to begin to get to know Shackleon, his crew and their incredible voyage, this is it."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Wow! What a powerful story. If this book was fictional, you'd say it was too impossible to be true. But it is true. The story is the book. Shackelton and his men endure almost two years of amazing danger and hardship. You can read some of the other 200 plus reviews for details.I haven't read any of the other versions of this story. I'm just glad that somehow a 1959 book found it's way back to the lists of books to read. Is it dated? Possibly. I can only suspect that Lansing sugarcoats some of the tensions that surely existed. However, unlike more recent versions, there were still living survivors of the party at that time. The book benefits from Lansing's ability to interview them but one suspects that he also edited the book to honor their sensibilities.Bottom-line: Don't complain about your heating bills or not being able to decide what to wear until you've read this powerful tale."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Amazing, awe-inspiring, gripping. Expertly explores the immensity of the human spirit. Condenses a huge subject matter into a heart-stopping escape. Ideal as a vehicle for getting anyone interested in the history of polar exploration. The Best of the Best.It's been years since I last read this account, but it still causes me to shiver when I recall the adventure of the men of the Endurance.It is mind-boggling that men such as these existed less than 100 years ago. Daring, heroic, determined, and intelligent...and caught up in a time before the widespread use of some of our most common and powerful technologies...like internal combustion engines and instant communications...their story is practically without equal in the annals of adventure writing.Whenever I feel I am having a difficult time, I think back to this story and these events, and it certainly helps me to put things in perspective.People who have never known a time without radio, motorized travel, telephones, 911, or rescue helicopters will hardly be able to believe the true events chronicled in this book.A more exciting, tension-filled, true-life chronicle will be very difficult to find."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"\`Endurance' is a great thriller made more so by the realization that this isn't fiction. I've read many novels about characters that manage to do the impossible but, until now, I have never read a nonfiction account of the impossible.

Definitely 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This book is about the English explorer and his crew of 28 surviving in the Antartic and finding his way back. They Planned on sailing to Antartica by the Endurence, A wooden ship originally named Polaris,but changed to fit Shackleton's family motto of endurence. From there they would cross the contient with a 6 man sled team with their dogs. They did not accompolish this goal. Their ship was trapped in the Wedell Sea in an ice flow. For the longest time they couldn't get free. Finally they got free, and when they did, they were trapped between about three flows. It put enormus preasure on the ship and left them waiting for a southern gale. It never came. They finnaly had to abandon the ship that would later be completly submerged. They had to go on foot in the direction of South Georgia Island. With them, they dragged the three life boats, hoping to come across open water. Several times they could not go on because the ice was too thin. When they reached water only about 5 men could go because two of the ships were needed to streghthen the strongest one. Then they came to another stopping point and only three men could go on. They were Crean,Wild,and Shackleton. They had to cross the Island that I think is Elephant Island. No one had done it before, the land was too treacherous,but they had to be quick and therefore they couldn't go around. They made it not one of the crew dyed during the Antartic journey that lasted over a year.This voyage had actually brought the men together, though there were disagreements. The author told about most of the crew in detail. They had good traits and bad. The crew was strong and they still recorded in their journals comments such as what a nice day it was. They wanted very much to go home,but they still had grown more used to this way of life. One man actually recorded in his diary that he liked the roughness of his newlife.They also survived the Antartic Winter which had no sun. Many would have gone crazy as previous men had done on somewhat similar expeditons. Shackleton was careful to prevent fights among the men. One thing he feared was the spread of depression and hopelessness from one member to the whole crew. If this happened the crew wouldn't work as hard or they might totally give up, but this didn't happen and every one supported each other to get back home.I recommend this book to everyone. It is a great story about a struggle against nature."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"If you think the T.V.

While it is true that Lansing's book is very good and does capture the spirit of Shackleton's leadership and the incredible courage and endurance of the entire crew, I would recommend Alexander's book over Lansing's. Her book does a better job of personalizing the crew members and also reporting on their lives post-survival. She also includes some details of the journey which were left out of Lansing's book and which have led me to think that Lansing was &quot;protecting&quot; Shackleton in some way from any negative or potentially critical views--an entirely unnecessary thing to do given his incredible leadership of this voyage. Also, having the photographs from the voyage included in Alexander's book adds an important extra vantage point to the story."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"THIS BOOK WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME AND TO BE QUITE HONEST I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO READ IT.

Amidst the on-ship shots of sailors playing cards or the dramatic pictures of the ship stuck in the ice, perched on a brilliantly white field of snow without a cloud in the sky, there was one two-page spread of Elephant Island seen from a distance. It looked like Seward or Whittier on a _really_ bad day, threatening clouds ringed towering mountains, the sea was dark and cold, and the overall impression was of one of the most inhospitable environments I've ever seen -- and I didn't have to cross the island in 7-month-old gear with threadbare supplies and waning spirits. The first word of the caption is &quot;Salvation!,&quot; which was presumably the sailors' reaction to seeing this veritable sanctuary appear out of the icy mist.This ia an admittedly indirect approach to a review, but the previous 112 readers have already explained how this is a gripping tale of survival and indomitable will. I couldn't agree more."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I cannot add anything to the other reviews.

I'm so glad she did. This story is amazing. The extent of the hardship these men endured is just unbelievable. Truely humbled by the attitude and fortitude of these men. If you get the chance I also recommend you watch the documentary on this incredible ordeal. It is on the internet, about an hour and a half long, and really helped me to visualize the descriptions in the book as it has some footage of the actual voyage spliced in with more current footage of the same area. Much more intense after I had a better idea of what an ice floe really looked like and how small a 22 foot boat is in comparison to the Drake Passage!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Alfred Lansing does a superb job in telling the story of the ill-fated Trans-Antarctic mission lead by Sir Ernest Shackleton. I was told about this story of survival against all odds by a friend and so I searched Amazon for the best book to read about it. Trusting the reviews I downloaded \\"Endurance\\". To be honest I've only read about 5 complete books in my life because I tend to get bored of books pretty quickly. Alfred Lansing's book, however, had me reading on the train wishing the trip would never end, it had me up late at night wishing I didn't have to go to sleep - I just wanted to know what was on the next page. I've now read it twice and will read it again! An absolutely astonishing feat of survival is told in such amazing detail, which from another author may well have lost its sense of achievement. A truly inspiring story that must be read to fully appreciate."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Undeniably one of the most amazing stories in human history. Lansing's writing truly brings it to life. Leave yourself a good eight hours, because this one is hard to put down. Be warned, the story is not for the weak at heart."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is one of the most fascinating adventure stories I've ever read.Expeditions to Antarctica in the 20th century did not always turn out well. And this is one of many that did not achieve its objectives. The idea was to cross the Antarctic continent. And I do recommend the book by Vivian Fuchs and Edmund Hillary on the first successful crossing of Antarctica, which was completed only in 1958.This book is about the 1914-1916 Shackleton expedition, which attempted to start by reaching Vahsel Bay in Antarctica using a strong 144-foot, 350 horsepower wooden ship named the Endurance.But the Endurance never quite reached Vahsel Bay. Instead, it became stuck in the ice near the Antarctic coast and eventually had to be abandoned. That left the crew having to find a way to reach land, survive on that land, and find a way to send for help so that it could be rescued. Even for a crew that had been prepared for being in cold weather and difficult circumstances, this turned out to be tricky. It makes one amazed at how able people are to survive in extreme environments. And, of course, this book is a testament to the leadership of Ernest Shackleton.Not only is the book very well-written and suspenseful, it also includes some terrific photos about the expedition. It's a great work of non-fiction, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"There have been some amazing personalities in the roll call of great explorers, and Ernest Shackleton is near the top of the list.A traveler with Robert Falcon Scott in the first quest for the South Pole in 1902, Shackleton's expedition with the \\"Endurance\\" was a terrible story that may have ended in failure to make the pole, but a success in survival.The writings of Shackleton and a number of his shipmates make for an intriguing and insightful narrative; how Endurance was caught in the polar ice, spending more than a year on an ice floe, marooned on a lonely rock of an island and the amazing journey in a life boat to a whaling station...it's all too incredible, yet it happened.Shackleton was a real swashbuckler, not always the best judge in talent for his expeditions and the best planner, but as many have said, when adversity arose, he and his people rose to the occasion again and again.A great read for anyone interested about the \\"Heroic Age.\\""},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Not only was the ship named Endurance but the human spirit is defined here by that very word. Over a year on a floating piece of ice would drive anyone mad. These 28 just endured the most terrifying thing anyone could ever experience - being alone in the antarctic with no contact with the rest of the world. How would it be to be so isolated that no one knows where you are and if you died wouldn't know it for years. Shackleton is the pillar of optimism to be optimistic in circumstances that would have broke even some of the best men today. This author has done a great job deriving the story from the surviving documents and journals of those that survived it.

The writing puts you aboard ship to experience your own feelings of doom and survival. The circumstance of being onboard a ship that's stuck, embedded in nearly one million square miles of ice, 60 miles from the nearest shore, below zero temperatures with a sunless winter upon you sounds more like fiction than fact. As the ship's storekeeper would say:\\"frozen like an almond in the middle of a chocolate bar.\\"Author Alfred Lansing, through crew diaries, logs, letters and survivor interviews, has recreated an event so frightful that you shudder while reading its pages. You actually find yourself enduring with the crew. So looking forward to continuing this courageous story.Fortitudine vincimus - \\"By endurance we conquer\\"Note: After finishing this gripping book and enduring the challenge of the Antarctic with Shackleton and crew, only one word comes to mind when reflecting on their journey; INCREDIBLE!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This well written exposition of one of the most challenging encounters with the violence and indifference of nature truly captivates and draws you deep into the experience of the Endurance crew and officers. Lansing is an excellent story teller and has done a tremendous service for the remembrance of these men who fought back and won.Shakleton's leadership and the men's determination to survive and overcome all challenges as one, proves the depths of bonds in the depths of the human heart. It is a study in human character to observe how different men behaved and how Shakleton and the others learnt how to deal with each other yet remain committed to the preservation of each other's life. True courage and character.Highly recommended for all ages, especially anyone interested in the strength of human endurance, commitment, and the ability to overcome under the most challenging of circumstances."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"It's been so cold outstide. Yesterday morning when I left the house at ten it was 1 degree outside. There is a crusty snow covering everything and that biting chill in the air. So, of course, it's the perfect weather to read about Shackleton's Incredible Voyage to Antartica and simultaneously feel grateful for my warm home and cozy bed.My friend Jen gave me a copy of Endurance : Shackleton's Incredible Voyage by Alfred Lansing for Christmas. Obviously, my friends know me. When there are true stories this amazing, who needs fiction?Sir Ernest Shackleton and his team of explorers planned and hoped to cross Antarctica. They set off on their ship from the island of South Georgia on December 5, 1914 and by January their ship was stuck fast in the ice of Weddell Sea. The men weathered the coming winter on their ship until it was crushed by the ice and had to be abandoned that October. Their survival is truly super human and simply amazing.I was most impressed by the general morale of the group of men, their continual respect for their leader and the willingness to follow his lead in this long period of miserable conditions and peril.I watched a movie with Utah Dad last night and it was late before I got to bed but I felt it absolutely necessary to finish this book before I could sleep. I just had to get those poor men rescued and safe. With little help from Mother Nature, who seemed most determined to destroy this band of explorers, the men were finally saved on August 30, 1916. That is a long time to be constantly cold, wet and hungry.Lansing had access to the diaries of the men and frequently interviewed one of the survivors (the book was written in 1959) so that he could write this accurate and exciting account of this most incredible adventure."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is the most exciting book I believe that I have ever read. Yes it is non-fiction but no author could be imaginative enough to create this kind of excitement. After the first six pages I was convinced that everyone was going to be dead and the rest of the pages of the book were just going to be blank pages. I envy the person who is going to read this book for the first time. Like the other 500 odd reviewers I can not recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I am generally averse to any material, in film or literature, that deals with ice--sorry for the pun--but it leaves me cold. However, after thumbing through the opening pages of ENDURANCE, I was hooked by Alfred Lansing's vivid account of the Shackleton expedition to the Antarctic. With over 400 plus reviews, all offering superlatives for this engrossing real-life adventure, the only thing that I can add is that reading it can be a kind of test of endurance. I'm one of those few who'd heard of Shackleton but somehow managed to avoid knowing how the story ends; by the time I'd reached the final words of this epic tale, I wept."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Product arrived as described, well-packed and fairly quickly. I will gladly buy from this seller again."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This was a great book. Thanks for shipping it right away. It was great doing business with you."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Very well written and documented account of one of the world's greatest pioneers and expeditions. \\"Endurance\\" was the name of the ship, but the book will forever define the meaning of endurance and the will to survive against impossible odds."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I have this strange attraction to books that revolve around survival in inclement weather conditions. Books like In Thin Air both fascinate and unnerve me, in that I can't figure out *why* someone would want to go through that potential experience. But all those mountain climbing books pale in comparison to the incredible story of Ernest Shackleton's expedition to cross the Antarctic on foot. Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage by Alfred Lansing takes you along on a two year journey that captures man's will to survive in conditions that are unimaginable.Shackleton started out from England in August of 1914 with a ship laden with the supplies they'd need to make it to the South Pole. From there, they would use supplies stored by another ship in preparation for the rest of the trip to the other side of the continent. Tragically, they never even made it to the coast to start their expedition. January 1915 found them stranded in pack ice, with no way to free the ship to continue or escape. The ship became their home for the next 10 months as they wintered through the dark Antarctic nights, ever vigilant for potential escape or danger from their ice floe breaking up. The extreme pressure of the ice pack finally won out, and the Endurance was crushed and sunk. This left the 28 men stranded with three smaller boats, dwindling supplies, and little hope of long-term survival.The breaking up of the ice pack forced the group to launch the boats to make an attempt to reach an inhabited portion of land in order to be rescued. But even that didn't go as planned, as the weather and seas conspired to push them away from the more probable points of rescue, finally stranding them on a small sliver of land known as Elephant's Island. Again enduring harsh weather, the decision was made to send a small group out on the last seaworthy boat to make an 800 mile journey to the nearest whaling station. Shackleford pushed off, knowing that his own survival chances were slim, much less those of the group that was being left behind on the island. But against all odds, they were able to make it to South Georgia, cross a number of inhospitable mountains, and arrive at a whaling station... four very grimy, tired, and left-for-dead individuals. Even more surprising, they were able to secure a ship, head back to their shipmates and rescue *all* of them. No one was lost on a two year ordeal that should have killed them all.I was amazed at what Shackleton and his crew were able to do in order to survive. Nearly a century later, with technology and gear that would be unthinkable back then, I'm not sure you would be able to put 28 people in the same situation and have them survive. What they did could be considered miraculous. I was even more struck about how far we've come in terms of transportation and communications since then. There were no search parties to send out, nor could you radio for help. The fact that you hadn't shown up anywhere in over a year was proof enough that you had been lost at sea, and your story would never be told unless some explorer came across your remains years later.This would be a really good book if it were a fictional adventure novel, although we'd say it was a bit over the top and not very realistic. The fact that it was a *real* story just makes it all the more incredible. Great read..."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is the older edition, and it's much cheaper, (around $2), but it's no different than the newer versions, besides the cover design.It's a great book, very entertaining. It takes a while to get into it, but it's an amazing story of survival over nature, prevailing against the odds, and excellend leadership.The \\"Odyssey\\" of our time.Highly reccomended."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This book is about Shackleton and his incredible voyage to Antarctica. In the beginning he gets all of his crew and his supplies then he was off to his voyage. On December 11, 19i4 they entered the ice, 6 days after they left. After about 2 months the ice started to get thicker and it got harder for the endurance to break the ice. On January 19, 1915 they spot land, then about 2 weeks later they lost spot of land. Then on October 27, 1915 endurance got abandoned and then crushed, after on November 21first endurance sinks. Then Shackleton has to take his crew to safety so he leaves most of his men at Elephant Island then to 5 men and him on a lifeboat to get men to help. They got safety and got help. Then took 4 tries to get to all the men to safety.The sentence structure is long and use's a lot of comas and quotes. The word choice in this book is pretty big and extreme. This book is very descriptive and explains every little detail.I found this book to be very active and every entertaining. I also found this book to be very sad and emotional because they had to kill the dogs they had for food to live. I also found this book to be very true to life that was happening in the old days back then. What I would like to change in this book is ending because it never told what happen to the crew after they were all saved. What would say about this book for an ending I would tell what happened to the crew and Shackleton. This is why I liked this book. This book is for about the age of 10 and up."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"There is no story that has ever been told as amazing as the one told in &quot;Endurance.&quot; I try and try to comprehend some of the obstacles that this crew overcame, but it is totally uncomprehendable. This book and this story is proof that the human spirit can endure the unimaginable and that willpower alone is more powerfull then any tangible substance.This story makes Kraukauer's &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; look like a summer picnic. This is not a story of one particular event in which people were able to overcome one inpassable obstacle, yet it is a story whereby a crew overcomes obstacle after obstacle after obstacle. This book makes the movie &quot;Rudy&quot; laughable as a story of overcoming all odds. WOW!! If you havent read this book, buy it imediately."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"What a great example of heroism, bravery and God's protection. Shackleton's true story is far better than any fiction could invent, and Lansing's account is quite readable. This is one I'll introduce to my boys when they're old enough."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"True account of Ernest Shackleton's 1914 expedition to Antartica that went awry. One of those stories that were it fiction, you would consider it too improbable. But it really happened.It's unbelievable the ordeal the men went through, floating on an ice floe for months without any ability to control their fate, then traversing 850 miles of open sea in a 22 foot boat.The author's writing style is a bit weak, but the story is so compelling that it is easy to overlook.Recommended."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I read this book at night and I must admit, I have never appreciated a warm, dry bed more in my life!I found this book enthralling. Lansing really gives the reader a feel for the brutal conditions these men suffered through. 2 years of that??? Unbelievable!And strangely enough, the excitement these men felt when they were able to kill a seal for food actually made me want to try some hoosh."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Captian Worsley noted that this story came so close, so many times to never being known to the world. It makes me wonder of all the tales of shipwreck and heroism that will never be known. This book is like a roller-coaster ride. From the heights of the human spirit to the depths of human misery, I was amazed over and over again of what and how much these men were capable. Truely inspiring. I think twice now before complaining of being cold. I have no idea. A good map of the area would have been a helpful addition. Also would have enjoyed a few words on how some of the crew members fared after their return."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I read this book not knowing what to expect. At first, it started out slow and then suddenly I found myself visualizing the plight of these courageous men that survived one of the most unbelievable adventures of our time. One is drawn into the book not by the glamour of it all rather, through the simple manner in which the storey presents facts that enable the reader to glimpse the essence of the human will to live. Great book to read and reaffirm one's faith in the human spirit."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Amazing and powerful tale of men enduring the unendurable. Sadly missing from this edition are the photographs and the all-important map."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"If you liked this book, be sure to read Tim and Pauline Carr's new book, Antarctic Oasis: Under the Spell of South Georgia, for a modern-day adventure in the same setting. This book has maps and extraordinary color photography. It will knock your polar fleece socks off!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I first read this book about 15 yrs ago on a hot summer day and I felt cold the whole time I was reading it. The simple and matter of fact way Lansing describes the events made the courage of the men speak for themselves. Like other reviewers, couldn't put it down nor get it out of my mind for weeks. My husband had similar feelings. We unfortunately lent our old copy to a friend, and it disappeared into the lost book dimension. Our luck turned, when I found an old copy at the Strand Bookstore in NYC. Alas, also lost over the years. Since then, we have read other Arctic and Antarctic stories, and Shakelton's lengthy biography. This year, my husband picked up an abridged version of Endurance at a book sale. Anyway, I am happy to get a new copy from Amazon.com! And now there is a new book out written by a cat that was on the Endurance!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I thought &quot;the Long Walk&quot; was an excellent book, but this might surpasses even that! The only bad thing about reading a book like this is that it has an ending!!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Even though I'm a fan of the genre (man against the elements and against all odds) I did nothave high expectations for this book. However, once I started I could literally not put it down. Part of that compulsion was, of course, due to curiosity about what happened to the men, but part was the sheer, gripping drama of every single page. The subtitle of this book is &quot;Shackleton's Incredible Voyage,&quot; and what a voyage it is. Perhaps the only problem with the tale is the fact that, if this story were presented as fiction, it would be dismissed out of hand as too implausible."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Endurance was a great book. In my school we made hoosh just like the men of the Endurance. The scrumptious vegetables, the juicy blubber and penguin (chicken and bacon) were YUMMY. When you read this book try the &quot;hoosh&quot;"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I think the book Endurance was an action packed thriller full of non-stop adventure. This book was so intense that the whole time I was holding my breath; it was totally unreal. The men on this mission were courageous and bold. They never gave up through the whole adventure. These men must have had the hearts of tigers to be able to stand the hellish weather of Antarctica. If you're looking for a good book, then you want to go to the book store and pick up this one"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is by far one of the best adventure stories, not only of its day, but of all time. It captures man's struggle against the elements as well as any book ever has. Gripping, Compeling, are terms that can only begin to describe it properly. An amazing voyage for the reader.J.H., Jackson Hole 4/11/97"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Shackleton was a courageous leader who endured through the worst of times. Shackleton was the best leader to ever live. This was my favorite book of all time. I hope that it becomes a movie; it would be a great movie because the whole thing is adventure. They should have Sean Connery as Shackleton"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I started Endurance on March 6, 1997 and finished it quickly. I really liked this book by Alfred Lansing because there were a lot of facts throughout it. Endurance was about leadership, luck, and courage. Sir Earnest Shackleton was a good example of leadership; he did his best to lead his men, guide them, and help them. I thought Endurance had a lot to do with luck; it was on their side. Courage also played a big part in this story because it helped them to survive on this, the coldest continent. I would recommend Endurance to anyone who likes adventures and fact filling books"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I ran across this book five years ago in my public library and realized what a treasure of adventure and inspriration it was. My heart is pounding again with this paperback edition. I couldn't wait to get my hands on it and then to heartily recommend it to my friends. Shakleton is the man. He demonstrates a depth of leadership that we long for today. His was a triumph of man over the forces of nature and deprivation. My only regret was that this edition lacked the suberb original art and photography of the hardback. You really must find a copy and see the grim, courageous faces of those men and the desolate landscape of their ordeal. Lansing puts you there and makes you long for a personal meeting with Shakleton and his men. What a splendid lecture it must have been when the crew of the Endurance returned with it's story of survival. I have never read a more inspiring account of leadership and heroism. Pass it along."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I read a lot of travel books but had no specific interest in the geographic, adventure or exploration aspects of this subject. I had never heard of the author and ordered the book on the strength of the glowing customer reviews here on amazon. This book has everything a discerning reader could want, from solid historical information to keen description and exquisite style to pathos to gripping suspense. It's rare for me to find a piece of nonfiction that I literally can't put down. In the closest comparison I can come up with at the moment, Lansing has written this account at least as beautifully as John McPhee might have, and more passionately (and my admiration for McPhee is practically unbounded). I am delighted but not surprised that Lansing's wonderful accounting remains in print and popular after so many years."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"OK. Add mine to the list of 10's. Put me on a desert island if you like but pack me off with a copy of this book to read over and over and over....Nothing more to be said but fantastic writing and a great story."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This has to be one of the most amazing stories ever told, the usual superlatives are simply not enough to describe it. You must read this book... and then read it again, and again..."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"When I finally forced myself to put the book down at 3am, I lay in the dark for an hour with my heart pounding. A daily source of inspiration and a great read!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I first read this book about 30 years ago as a graduate student when I found a copy at a field station on the shores of Chesapeake Bay. Subsequently I often thought of the endurance of the explorers when I was faced with very uncomfortable conditions as a field biologist, including time on research vessels at sea in the cold waters off Labrador and Newfoundland. I was able to put up with more discomfort than I might have otherwise. About 15 years ago I read the book to my wife and pre-teen daughter and son. I wanted the children to know that dogged persistence often overcomes difficult situations, but it was also an enjoyable adventure story for them. I am still moved when I recall the account at the end of the book of the homage paid to the explorers by the tough Norwegian whalers. They knew hardship, and celebrated the endurance of Shackleton and his men."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The age-old clash between man and nature is timeless. The triumph of the explorers over the elements is a tribute to our spieces. If you have any sense of adventure, then you will not be able to put this book down. When you finish reading Endurance, you'll spend many pleasurable hours day-dreaming about the bleak conditions of the Antarctic, and the brave men who survived."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I give this factual book a nine.Do you want to know about Antarctic ice floes? Read this book and you'll learn. Do you want to know how to truly survive? Read this book and you'll know. This is an exciting book that keeps you on the edge of your seat. In almost every chapter the crew from the ship Endurance faces a new danger, but their belief in Shackleton guides them through. I couldn't put the book down even; I had to know if they made it or not. I recommend this book to anyone who likes non-fiction, adventure books. This is a book that you would want to read more than once"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is required reading for anyone intestested in the outer limits of human willpower. 'Endurance' is the true story of one of the greatest survival storys of all time. It shows how leadership, teamwork and attitude can prevail over the most impossible situations. I am surprized that this book is not more widely known. It easliy qualifies as one of the best books I've read. I think our world would be much better if furture leaders of our country were more familiar with the lessons of this book. After reading this, you will have difficulty feeling sorry for yourself"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"After reading this book you'll never complain about being too cold, too tired, too hungry, too bored - again. I think the story itself deserves 5,000 stars. I'll only give the writing 4 stars - it got the job done, but I wasn't blown away enough by the writing to give 5 stars. But now, back to that story - AMAZING!!! - all the more so for being true. I'm really just writing this review so I can tell the reviewer who said it's a boring story because all it does is talk about the crash that he/she is an idiot. First of all, it's not a crash, and second of all, that's not all the book talks about, and third of all, even if that WAS all it talked about - so what? - isn't that what this story is all about? If he/she wants romance or mystery, they picked the wrong book. But if they want solid edge-of-the-seat courage and adventure, this is the place."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I found this story so fantastic that I immediately bought more copies to give to others! The National Geographic article of Oct/Nov 1998 is the perfect co-read; illustrated with Frank Hurley's photographs and Society maps. If you liked this story of the triumph of the human spirit, try The Forgotten Soldier, or, for a related fiction read, try The Birthday Boys."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"An amazing and utterly fantastic book of an extraordinary adventure! The best book I have read in a long time, and the most extraordinary adventure story I've ever read. The ill-fated expedition across the antartic continent ends in probably an even more extraordinary trial of courage and strength. The survival in the frigid anatartic caught on the ice float; the trial in some of the roughest seas in the world in no more than a life boat; and the mountain expedition with little more than an axe and some rope - present three incredible adventures full of risk, daring, ingenuity, and strength. A great book for anyone who likes adventure. An even better book for anyone who desires insight into extraordinary leadership, courage, and strength of character."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I went into this book, after reading the jacket, thinking, &quot;Oh, this sounds interesting.&quot; By the end, the book had moved me to tears three or four times. I cannot say enough about this fascinating, unreal, unbelievable story and the powerful effect it had on me. Never before have I read of such fortitude and awe-inspiring strength than that exhibited by these brave, amazing men. It was such a terrific read, I didn't want the story to end! But thank God, for those who lived to tell it, it finally did. If you like true-life adventure, even just a little bit, then you must read this tremendous story. Remarkable and unbelievable from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Endurance is far and away the most gripping, excruciating, and mind-blowing adventure story ever written. If this were fiction it would be laughable because it would be too unbelievable. I got so keyed up while reading about the journey through the Drake Passage that I would periodically have to put the book down and pace around my house. They just don't make men like this anymore. The so-called &quot;heroes&quot; that stumbled up and down Everest in Into Thin Air should read this book and be very, very humbled."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Rarely do I read books that make me feel as if I am actually part of the story, but this is one such book. From the opening of the book to the end, the story grips one's mind like a Grizzly bear trap can envelope one's body and soul.It is a remarkable story told by a remarkable story teller, and anyone who likes adventure will be hard pressed to put the book down once they have started reading it.This book was truly a forerunner to such books as &quot;The Perfect Storm,&quot; or &quot;Into Thin Air.&quot; The amazing thing about this story, is when it all took place. Shackleton was one tough hombre, as were the men he lead. There are a few tough sea lions as well.Your eyes and mind will be frozen to the pages, (just like their ship Endurance was frozen in time) until you have finished the book. By far one of the greatest stories of mans survival against one of the planets most deadly environments."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"FOR ALL THOSE WHO THINK ON ANY GIVEN DAY THE WORLD HAS SUDDENLY TURNED AGAINST THEM. READ THIS BOOK! THIS BOOK SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING IN ALL SCHOOLS TO SHOW WHAT SHEER WILL AND DETERMINATION CAN ACCOMPLISH. A TRULY INSPIRING TALE. YOU WILL FOREVER USE THIS CHRONICLE AS &quot;THE&quot; EXAMPLE OF TRUE HARDSHIP."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The best a book can get. It is a page-turner. The content of most adventure books would only equal a single chapter in Endurance. A truly remarkable true adventure told with an understated style that made the story of the leadership of Shakelton and the amazing endurance of his crew come alive. If you only read one book this year, make it this one. Make it an 11!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This well-written account of the Shackleton expedition to the Antarctic paints a riveting portrait of a diverse group of men and there lengthy struggle for survival.Shackleton's goal was to be the first to cross the Antarctic continent by way of the South Pole. It might be difficult for us, people of an age when every mountain has been climbed, every noteworthy spot on the globe reached, to understand his motives, but Lansing examines this issue thoroughly. Fame, fortune, and thirst for adventure all played a part, but nothing could have prepared Shackleton's crew for the trials they would face when their boat was trapped in, and crushed by, ice floes in the Weddell Sea.Thus began a struggle for survival which lasted nearly two years. Shackleton leads his crew of scientists, sailors and adventurers on an epic journey back toward civilization. They are at the mercy of dramatic weather conditions, the unpredictable drifts of the ice floe, and primitive equipment. The situation demands leadership, and Lansing examines Shackleton's skills in this area. He takes us virtually day-by-day though the decisions that must be made when any single wrong choice could mean disaster.I highly recommend this book to anyone with a thirst for adventure but the common sense to avoid life threatening situations. It is an enjoyable escape and an inspiration. Makes &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; look like a Sunday walk in the park. (Hey! This thing had paragraph separations when I submitted it!)"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"In the summer of 1978 while hiking in the Adirondack Mountains, I literally stumbled upon an old, soiled copy of Endurance. I was only 10 years old at the time, but what an impact this book has had on my life. The lesson of survival, and to never let go is so important. Today,as a physician, I see so many patients who suffer from pain or the loss of a loved one, that you realize just how precious life is. Endurance taught me so many lessons, that I am forever grateful to Alfred Lansing in telling this story.I was so happy to see that it was still in print.My copy, found on a trail in upstate New York sits behind my desk in a glass case. At least now I can have one for the home. There is a message in this book, with such importance, that it should be required reading at the grade school level.Please enjoy Endurance. I would welcome comments from other readers."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I would rate Endurance, Shackleton's Incredible Voyage, a 9. I like non-fiction stories, and this book was really one of the best that I have read. I really enjoyed it when the author personalized the situations the men are going through.One example is on page 205, and it's about the amputation of Blackboro's frostbitten toes. Another example is when Shackleton and the five men are on the Caird. Water is coming into the boat and ice is forming; the men needed to chip the ice away.I also liked this book because of the men's journals describing what was going on through the expedition and how they felt. Example: August 19 (Orde-Lees) \\"...There is no good in deceiving ourselves any longer.\\" I think the way this book was written really showed the reader what was happening and gave me a great mental picture.If anybody asks me about this book I would say to read it, you'll have a different picture of life"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The first half of the book is very interesting and well written.

The writing is excellent! Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Incredible book.

Shackleton manages to ensure the survival of everyone aboard for ten months before rescue. The day-to-day details are available thanks to Lansing's research, but its not boring at all, even if you aren't a history buff! How to lead in a crisis - and the power of determination and the human spirit.

It is a powerful story and very well told. Factual but not at all dry, the author does an excellent and respectful job of conveying exactly what these men went through, and how they beat seemingly impossible odds again and again. It is truly unforgettable.If you don't know who Ernest Shackleton was, you must read this book. I agree with the reviewer who said to make sure to get the version with the photos."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Just when you thought it couldn't get worse, it would.

The descriptions of the things that they had to overcome was quite good, giving me a sense of actually &quot;being there&quot;. Not only that, the photos in this book, taken by crew member Hurley, were breath-taking.So much has been written and produced about this voyage, but this is the signature book. I have a more &quot;coffee-tablish&quot; book, and it is one that I will treasure. The writer makes you feel like you really are there. This was a total joy to read. I really enjoyed the background information on the crew members. My next task is to read one of the &quot;leadership&quot; books that describes the things that Shackleton did to keep his crew engaged in survival, and getting back home.I am an avid reader of these types of books, and it continues to amaze me that voyages like this one, as well as Lewis and Clark's, had little, or no, loss of life during some amazing times in our world and history."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I highly recommend this book - for those of you thrill junkies it's a tale that shouldn't be overlooked. It would be difficult for modern man to relive what Shakleton and his men went through with modern equipment. Simply amazing."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"In simplest form, \\"Endurance\\" is about a group of men fighting against the elements to reach home. But the book is so much more than this.The book holds within its pages the wonder and magic of the real true-life adventures, as if they were told from a fellow sailor.Alfred Lansing has the amazing literary power to bring to life one of the most stunning survivor stories in the history of the world."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"308 reviews and I am adding another? Incredible. Yet I cannot resist. The is an account superlatively well-told of an impossible story which simply bowled me over. I could not stop reading it and read it in less than 24 hours. One's admiration for the super-human feats which Shackleton and his men performed and endured, capped by the events on South Georgia Island, make for a fantastically exciting and memorable read. I doubt I will read as good a book again this year. I can find nothing negative to say about this book and will look if there is anyone who gives this book less than five stars--after I post this."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This book chronicles the true saga of Mr. Shackelton and his group of hand-picked Antartic explorers in one of the greatest survivalist stories in history.With detailed descriptions of the day-to-day struggles of a group of marooned men and several historical photographs, this extraordinary book is a tribute not only to these men in particular, but to the human spirit in general.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in reading an uplifting non-fiction adventure story with a very positive sense of life."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Lansing writes an unbelievably compelling book about this extraordinary journey. What is amazing about Lansing's writing is that he includes terrific detail but it is absolutely NEVER boring. The time on the ship, the ice floes, the open boats, the islands are all beautifully described so that you have a detailed sense of the setting and can appreciate the gargantuan task that layed before these men. The film by Branagh doesn't even remotely come close to how amazing and exciting this story is. A must read for anyone who likes nonfiction adventure and history."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The author has assembled details from all reliable sources to create a picture of the adventure complete in every detail.It is a great story, if you don't know it, your jaw will drop while reading this book."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"And the raves continue.

However, from a leadership, historical and outright human struggle to survive perspective this book is five stars in all categories. The details of Shackleton's decisions as a leader are well documented as are the historical accounts. The book draws from the journals and interviews with the men who suffered and endured this captivating story. It depicts in detail their will to survive against all odds. A must read for leaders and outdoorsmen."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"All I know is that &quot;Endurance&quot; is too soft a word to describe what this crew went through. &quot;Superhuman perseverance&quot;? &quot;Beyond All Odds&quot;? Maybe these sum up this true story more accurately. Readers will never guess how old this book is since it reads like it was written this year. While at times very detailed, especially at the beginning, you will find yourself craving the details as the journey of these adventurers goes on and on. The outcome seems so unlikely that it's apt to whet your appetite for more information about Shackelton and his crew. This particular edition has terrific photos and is worth paying a little more for than the regular paperback. This story turned me into an Antartica nut- buying just about everything I could get my hands on. I've recommended this book to lots of people and everyone thought it was utterly amazing. Don't miss this real life adventure story. It'll leave you shaking your head in disbelief!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"In 1915, Ernest Shackleton boarded the Endurance and left on his attempt to cross Antartica, a feat that had not yet been accomplished. Somewhere in the Weddell Sea, Endurance was caught in the ice. The floes of ice kept the Endurance for nearly a year, during which time, Shackleton kept his men together and alive. Finally, Endurance was crushed by the ice, and the real adventure began. Shackleton and his men, using the lifeboats from the Endurance traveled to Elephant Island. From there, Shackleton and 5 crew members embarked on an 850 mile open sea voyage in one of the lifeboats to bring back a rescue party for the remaining 22 men. The voyage is considered one of the most remarkable voyages in seafaring history.This is a good book. I really enjoyed reading it. It doesn't flounder about with long-winded descriptions of everyday life, but you get a real sense of what these men went through. This was definitely a more rugged era! Mr. Lansing brings this entire adventure to life and once the final voyage begins in the book, it was extremely hard to put it down!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"If the reader is a scientist, as I am, he will be rapt with the descriptions of physical phenomena: the variatons in ice forms, the extreme weather caprices, the landforms, and the awesome power of the ocean. If the reader is a biologist, or in any way interested in wildlife, he will experience the entire range of human emotions in the descriptions and events dealing with a wide variety of animals. Finally, as a human being, the reader will draw tremendous inspiration from the characters and their experiences in thier perilous struggle to survive in one of Earth's most extreme environments. Lansing's prose is excellent; his words carefully chosen and orchestrated, with religious adherence to his diligent, extensive research. Upon finishing the book, one has more profound appreciation of the word &quot;Endurance&quot; and Sir Ernest Shackleton as one of history's most extraordinary heros."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The story of the Endurance and the courage of its crew is one of the most amazing adventures of the 20th Century.

This book is as much a story of leadership as it is survival. The inner thoughts of the crew are shown in an amazing series of exerpts from journals and interviews. This story is one that many people will be hearing about over the next few years as major television and movie productions are based on it."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The story of Shackleton's expedition blew me away. It is truly unbelievable what Shackleton and his crew went through and survived. This story will inspire you, shock you, and leave you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what will happen next. This book is well-researched and well-written to keep the reader engaged. I highly recommend this account of the expedition. You will be amazed at what these men accomplished, even in their failure."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is truly one of the more amazing stories I have ever read. In August, 1914 Ernest Shackleton set out on a Trans-Antarctic Expedition, sending two boats out to reach opposite sides of the Antarctic, and then send a crew out to cross the 1800 Antarctic Shied. But before Shackleton could ever get his men to the Antarctic, the boat he was in, the Endurance, was caught by the ice, and the men were marooned on board for a year. Then, the following winter, the ice crushed the boat, forcing the men to flee. What follows is a tail of survival that is unlike any I have read before. Shackleton and his crew lived on the ice flows that filled the Weddell Sea. Their hope was that the flows would take them toward land. When the flows broke, they had to enter the turbulent ocean on life boats. What is so stunning about this expedition is not only the trials and hardships faced by the twenty two crew members, but that each and every member survived. It is a testament to fortitude and leadership. Get the book with the pictures. The photos were taken by Frank Hurley, a member of the crew, and at Shackleton's insistence, the heavy camera and glass negatives were carried with them the entire way. Remarkable story. Engrossing read."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Lansing's telling of the circumstances of the Endurance and E.H. Shacklton's Antarctic expedition is simply powerful. Only a few words do justice to this incredible tale, \\"wow\\" being one of them. The reader truly \\"feels\\" the constant pain, suffering, and utter despair that plagued the crew throughout their stranding in the Antarctic ice floe. The cold is palpable, the wind echoes in your head, the hunger twitches in your gut, and the contact fear heightens the senses. Throughout the story the reader cannot help but feel for the crew, who are thwarted over and over again at every turn. Each time you think things are getting better, they only get worse. This carries through to the very end. The reader is caught in the despair of the crew who, by their own strength never give up hope. These men shine through as the true definition of survivors. In times where we tale so many conveniences for granted, these men dealt with circumstances that would crumble lesser souls. This is an absolute MUST READ! No adventure traveler or explorer should venture out without having first read Lansing's book or at least packing it along to remind themselves how bad things can really get and what it truly means to have the will to live. HIGHLEY RECOMMENED!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"An absolutely fantastic account of an ordeal almost beyond belief. The reading was wonderful, because the writing was impeccable. Granted, one can't really go wrong with a subject this fascinating; Shackleton's voyage (actually several voyages in one, or so it seemed) is something that is hard to fathom. How he actually accomplished what he did in those conditions is something I don't think we'll ever really understand, unless you believe in miracles. And Lansing's account of it is flawless."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"There are a few books we can consider required reading of a modern educated person. Anne Frank's diary would be one, and I think this version of the Shackleton drama would be another. I have a friend who reads it every year.Because there are so many strong reviews of this book, I'll speak briefly of something that might be overlooked.In the eyes of most readers, the most astonishing thing about this adventure is that not a single life was lost. And that truly is amazing. Obviously, things could have gone much worse with just a tiny bit more bad luck. But I'd note something that might be just as strange. In all of the grueling and painful twists in this adventure, Shackleton seems never to have lost the trust and respect of his men. Think of that. Every little decision he made was potentially fatal for the whole crew, and he often had to make decisions that had every chance of being lethally wrong. And yet his men stood stoutly behind \\"the old man\\" and were prepared to die with that kind of total trust.Anyone who wants to be a leader should read this book annually and think about what qualities were present in Shackleton that allowed him to be such an effective leader under such wretched circumstances.Sometimes our minds can be our worst enemies. Rational thought can save the life of an explorer caught in a life-threatening crisis. But when the situation we are in is apparently hopeless, rational thought is our potential enemy. There were many times during the Shackleton adventure when a rational person would have to conclude that the story had no chance of getting a happy ending. That is when \\"endurance\\" becomes a queer virtue, when you put one foot in front of the other in spite of the fact that you are suffering hugely in an effort that is \\"surely\\" doomed to fail.I am not a great fan of adventure literature, and yet the best of it is utterly captivating. In a sense, extreme adventures can be like laboratories that experiment with human nature, testing the limits of what it can do. Nobody would ever get permission to put humans in such grim and painful circumstances as they chose to put themselves in for these grand adventures. Since they do volunteer to do dangerous and painful things, we can take advantage of the chance to see how the human spirit fares when exposed to the worst possible tests.And that is the particular gift of this book. Without blinking in its description of the hell these men experienced, the author shows us how magnificently they were led and how courageously they fought to keep alive. In the end, they proved that the human spirit can soar above threats and challenges that seem perfectly invincible. The salvation these men ultimately earned was bought at a terrible price, and yet we can thrill with them when we see them prevail when it was surely \\"impossible\\" that they would."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"An earlier reviewer, with experience of frigid conditions in Alaska, cast some doubt on the ability of these men survive while wet in below zero temperatures and howling wind chill factors. It does sound incredible, especially when they were in the boats with no source of heat. But I note that they wore mostly wool undergarments, trousers and sweaters, with gabardine overcoats. Also fur-lined boots. Gabardine, at least back then, was made of worsted wool. Their sleeping bags, often soaked as well, were made from reindeer hides. Fur-lined, that is. I also note Allan Frey's excellent survival book, based on 40 years of living in the Yukon territory, often in a teepee. He prefers wool as well -- and I have cashed in some of my outdoor gear for wool pants and parka. It retains insulating qualities even while soaked and compressed. How else do you think the critters who originally wore it survived outdoors without tents or roofs over their horned heads?Had these men slept in and been garbed in what most outdoorsmen wear today -- down shrouded in nylon or polyester -- we wouldn't be reading this phenomenal book because they would all have perished in the first year. Even the newest miracle fillings -- Hollofil and the like -- would have blown out of their shredded shells like that down wafting from weeds in the Spring. I don't think they had duct tape for patching such shells back then -- a common site among modern outdoorsmen in their Michelin-man coats.Yes, in a long, dire emergency -- give me Shackleton every time. And I had btter be clad in leather and wool."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is one of the very best \\"adventure\\" stories of all time.

Sir Ernest Shackleton's expedition planned to be the first to cross the continent of Antarctica. Instead, he and his men found themselves trapped in the frozen sea and eventually had to abandon the ship as it was crushed by the ice. They spent well over a year drifting on ice flows and braving the rigors of the Weddell Sea and Drake Passage, surviving some of the most inhospitable and savage places in the world. Amazingly, not a single member of Shackleton's crew was lost.This is a absorbing look at the conditions and hardships faced by the crew: sub-zero temperatures, starvation, frightful storms, unstable ice and hostile seas, and in the end they had to rescue themselves as there was no way to alert the outside world of their plight and they'd been assumed lost. But it's not all doom and gloom as the best part of the story is the amazing fortitude of the men and their will to survive. There were times of intense suffering and intense boredom told with excerpts from the diaries the men kept.

That is the mark of both exceptional talent, and of exceptional maturity. Lansing is wise enough to know, and mature enough to accept, that this story is so compelling it is best told quietly and calmly. The conditions endured are so extraordinary that a simple recounting of them takes the breath away. Only a very good author would trust his material enough to become essentially invisible.Secondly, what these 28 men endured beggars description. I happened to read it during a 24-inch snow storm which added greatly to the intensity of the experience.This is a compelling and worthwhile read and I recommend it to anyone.

I couldn't wait to see how the author was going to finish even though I knew the outcome. The author described in great detail how the sailors survived this undertaking."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The first I had ever heard of Sir Ernest Shackleton was on a PBS special a few years ago. The special dealt with the Endurance voyage and prompted me to find out more.What an adventure! What a story! What a book! Lansing's book reads like a suspense novel -- a page turner of high quality. His reliance upon the personal journals of the men provide such a wonderful flavor to a story that is, in its own right, nothing short of unbelievable. He pays attention to detail, but just enough to keep the pace of the story just right. He provides concentrated character portraits that enhance the story rather than tax the reader's attention.This is an adventure of the first degree -- survival against all odds, human endurance on a level never before seen. It is hard to believe that this actually happened. It is equally interesting that this voyage comes at a time when a romantic age of daring and adventure was giving way to the madness of the First World War. A handful of men proved that leadership, sacrifice, diligence and will can overcome incredible circumstances. If only their leaders, a world away, could have learned from their experiences."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Lansing's use of the diaries of the men as his primary source, along with interviews of survivors of the expedition, results in a detailed yet vivid and eminently readable account of this most fascinating survival story. You are able to gain an understanding of all of the men and how they came to be chosen so intuitively by Shackleton, using his unerring sense of not only their particular skills, but also how they would all work together as a team. Lansing also gives you a good sense of their interrelationships as the hardships mounted, along with a real feel for the sheer length and depth of their struggle to survive. You are drawn into the day-to-day struggles the expedition faced and the truly heroic nature of the effort put forth by all - particularly Shackleton. In Lansing's hands, you are able relive the sheer terror and utter exhaustion and deprivation the men faced - especially in what is perhaps the most unbelievable part of the entire adventure: The voyage in a small boat by Shackleton and a few of the men the hundreds of miles from Elephant Island - through the hellish Drake Passage, no less - to South Georgia. He also gives just the right amount of detail regarding the many, many months the men spent on the pack ice, then on Elephant Island while Shackleton made his way to South Georgia and back, and the means they all used to stay alive and relatively sane in situations that would, let's face it, send most modern-day men crying to mama and reaching for the nearest gun to blow their brains out. Also, his recounting of Shackleton's astounding mountaineering feat in his crossing of South Georgia to the whaling station was given its proper due - truly an incredible accomplishment in its own right.Lansing's wonderful account really gives you the full flavor of the incredible hardships and sheer terror faced by Shackleton and his men. This is the best true-adventure novel I have ever read. Outstanding!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Ernest Shackleton is one of the most amazing explorers ever to have lived. I think his accomplishments are underrated, and his place in history deserved.This is a story of a shipwrecked attempt to traverse the entire Antartic continent. After Shackleton's boat, The Endurance, was caught in dangerous pack ice the crew was forced to abandon the ship. For 2 years, they lived in the harshest climate in the world, subsisting on seals, penguins, and \\"hoosh.\\" Their spirits were kept high by the commanding leadership of Sir Ernest Shackleton.In an almost unbelievable tale, Shackleton realizes that they stand no chance stranded on the pack ice waiting for rescue. After several failed attempts to trek his men and all of his equipment across the ice, it was decided that some of the men would have to sail for the whaling stations of South Georgia Island. Shackleton, and 4 men set sail in one of the rescue boats, promising to return for the other men. After many days of gale force wind and swells that easily could have capsized their boat, they arrived at South Georgia Island. Upon their arrival, they realized that the winds had landed them on the wrong side of the island and they would have to traverse a mountain range to get to the whaling stations. Leaving 2 more weak men at the landing site, Shackleton and the others spent 3 days without sleep trying to get across the mountain range. After many wrong turns, and having to back track several times, the finally made it to the whaling stations. They quickly gathered the rescue team, and retrieved the 2 men left at the other side of the island. Then they set sail for the ship wreck only to find the pack ice was too dangerous to get close enough for a rescue.After 3 attempts and several days at sea, the men are finally rescued.What is more amazing than the leadership and courage that Shackleton and his men displayed, is that not one of them died. It is truly a testament to the explorer's spirit that Shackleton kept his men together and their morale high to get them through this nightmare.This book is a must read."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"If ever a ship was aptly named, it was the Endurance!I sat up til 2 in the morning to finish this book, I just had to do it. I wish I could give it seven stars.Any single part of the crew's journey would have merited being a major achievement of survival in any age, but they strung together a year on the ice, then dragging their boats across the frozen flows, sailing to Elephant Island as the ice broke up, a party then sailing over 1000 km to South Georgia (through a major storm in an open boat) largely through dead reckoning, being able to take only three or fourth sightings, landing on the wrong side of the island and then marching across to raise the alarm. Incidentally, as I read the account of the crossing of the island (albeit at 1.30 am) I had the impression that it was all a bit of a stroll in the park compared with what they had been through previously,.... and yet, they had only 18 month old fur suits, minimal food and a few lengths of rope,........and yet they had been on small boats in freezing weather for months ....and yet they made the first crossin of the Island, which was not crossed again until the 50's, by a fully equipped team of mountaineers and no-one has managed the crossing in a shorter time than they managed...... and yet less than a day after they crossed a blizzard came in from the Antarctic that would have killed them in the open... and then later I saw photos of the \\"park\\" they strolled!! ice covered crevasses, sheer cliffs and icewalls....It then took months and four attempts to rescue the remainder of the crew on Elephant Island. And Shackleton did not relax until he had retrieved the rest of his crew, all alive and largely well (one had had a frostbitten foot successfully amputated, using only a little chloroform and a scalpel), nearly six months after he set off for South Georgia.Read this book, you will not be disappointed&gt; It will give you a sense of perspective and reality, as you fume in traffic or about the dropkick at the other end of the phone. When an athlete or celebrity, politician or other minor achiever is cited as someone or other's hero, you can think about a real hero who provided indefatigable leadership under the most trying circumstance for nearly 2 years, and who brought his whole crew back alive, who showed courage and never, ever gave up; Sir Earnest Shackleton."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This harrowing memoir is written predominantly through the diaries kept by the men aboard the Endurance. The diaries were barely ledgible at times, according to the author, but were invaluable in terms of information. Other sources for the book were &quot;eyewitness&quot; accounts from the survivors of the journey, including Dr. Alexander H. Macklin. Thus, creating a very accurate and dramatic &quot;true-life&quot; story. Not only is the story told, but the atmosphere and emotions of the crew and their surroundings are shown, and one gets the feeling of what is was like for these men in the early 1900's adrift on ice packs and marooned on unliveable land for more than a years time. The story is well written, fast paced and tells several parts of the tale at different intervals during the book which makes it very easily followed. If you enjoy historical accounts or are fascinated with Antartica itself....this is a must-read book."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"As of this writting, I am the 218th person to review this book. The 218th person to tell you that Lansing's account of the epic voyage of The Endurance is possibly the greatest true life adventure story ever written. You just wouldn't believe this actually happened if it weren't so well documented. Soon to be a major motion picture, this story is one for the ages. How the hell did it remain obscure for so many years?"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Anyone who doesn't give this book 5 stars is crazy. It's a short read (only 276 pages), but is just enough to tell the story with detail. Anyone who can read should read this book; you'll realize how good you have it. I was outside recently in 10 degree weather and thought it was cold which makes it even more remarkable to think that 10 degrees was a warm day to them and they were wet most of the time! Unbelieveable story!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I don't normally read thrillers, or adventure stories, but this recounting of the Shackleton ruin and recovery in the Antarctic is not to be missed. It manages to be both a heart stopping page turner, and a reasonably legitimate history. This is the book I passed around to my friends and family. Shackleton is a dreamer, publicity seeker and adventurer who planned to explore the Anarctic for less than entirely noble reasons at about the same time WWI was taking over the front pages of the world. Instead, he and his crew have to watch their beautiful ship be crushed by the ice. (The photographs are stunning.) The most dramatic description is a miracle of navigation of a long boat by the stars to get through the coldest and most storm toss'd ocean in the world to try to find a rescue. You'll read it through once fast, nearly as seasick and sore as the crew, and then have to read it through again to see if you really read it right the first time. The crew is a blend of the gentleman explorer of the (last) turn of the century along with the more rough and less educated crew that in combination manage to maintain the discipline and comradeship that is the basis of survival. Lansing gives high marks to Shackleton's leadership, as the crew is forced to abandon generous ships' stores, supplies that become 'luxuries' and even the sled dogs. The later Carolyn Alexander book has more of the fabulous pictures taken the ship's photographer, but the text is comparatively tepid compared to this version of the tale. I could have wished for more detail and rounding out of the personalities of the stranded men (including more 'backstory' and epilogue) but these are small complaints when compared to the tale itself. You will enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"My wife had to grab my leg and ask me if I was alright while I read about Shackleton's troubles on the bus ride home. Even knowing the ultimate outcome did not make me any less nervous when the crew of the Endurance faced each incredible challenge. Lansing's prose captivated me and took me away from a warm Seattle Metro bus and put me there in Antarctica floating on Camp Patience and gasping for breath after escaping a leapord seal attack, shivering with anticipation as our craft rushed up each icy fifty foot swell, I was there! Everyone should read this to escape into a world of adventure that cannot be matched again!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"When the Endurance steamed south into the splitting ice pack of the Weddel Sea in the summer of 1914, she carried aboard the renowned British explorer Earnest Shackleton. The Endurance was specially designed and massively constructed by one of the world's finest shipyards, staffed with scientists and qualified volunteers and outfitted with meticulously tested equipment. Shackleton himself was an experienced polar veteran who had once come within a day's march of being the first to reach the south pole. But in spite of careful planning, the Endurance was doomed, and this expedition would be Shackleton's last Antarctic voyage. Unexpected cold weather froze the ship solidly into the ice, and 7 months later, the mounting pressure of millions of tons of ice crushed the three-foot wooden hull. The Endurance sank into the black water, and left the 30 exhausted men marooned on the treacherous melting ice flows of the storm-churned antarctic sea. For six months the poorly-equipped castaways would struggle under inconceivable hardship until the drifting ice broke up enough for Shackleton to lead his expedition in three open lifeboats through freezing open water to a lifeless bit of rock called Elephant Island. With 5 companions aboard the remaining battered lifeboat, Shackleton left his crew and stuck out across the open ocean in a desperate attempt to reach a remote whaling station to obtain help. His faithful men would remain behind to weather the winter storms sleeping under the upended wreckage of a lifeboat -- their lives dangling by the frail promise that he would someday return. Alfred Lancing is an experienced journalist whose detailed research combines with direct and perfectly-paced prose and a handful of the expedition's original photographs. It is a tale of leadership, unflagging courage, and determination in the face of impossible odds. But maybe the real definition of heroism is to be undaunted by the impossible. After sixteen days covering 900 miles of water in an amazing feat of open boat navigation, Shackleton struck land at South Georgia Island -- and after a three-day sleepless march over the 10,000 foot mountains in the huge island's interior, Shackleton and his remaining companions finally stumbled into a remote whaling outpost. And 450 days after being shipwrecked, after 5 attempts in three different ships, Shackleton managed to return to Elephant island to rescue his 22 remaining crew members in a tugboat borrowed from the Chilean government -- finally delivering all 29 of his men without the loss of a single life -- and making Endurance one of the most inspiring stories of human survival every written.--Auralgo"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I read the book in two nights, it was riveting to see the trials these men endured to survive.

A must read for sure by any adventures sole."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Although I knew the story, had seen the original film made by Frank Hurley, and also the biopic \\"Shackleton\\" with Kenneth Branagh as the Boss, I still was incredibly moved by Lansing's account. The level of detail culled from the diaries and first hand interviews with some of the men (the book was originally published in 1959)lend complete authority to the recounting. Especially gripping storytelling are the detailed descriptions of the two sea voyages and the final push overland in South Georgia Island to rescue. Put your 21st century self on the boats and through the rescue trek, dressed in what amounted to heavy wool clothing covered with a raincoat, soaked through, freezing cold, dehydrated, starving, with frostbite, dysentery, and no sleep. And I mean no sleep, period. You are sailing in an open boat through the worst ocean in the world. You have to cross a completely unknown antarctic terrain blind (it was terra incognita). You have never climbed a mountain in your life. You push on for 36 hours straight, never stopping for more than 5 minutes. I cannot imagine even the most intrepid of adventurers today able to live through even a fraction of what Shackleton and his men endured. Their survival boggles the mind.Quite simply: this is the most heroic effort in recorded human history. Read it."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I just finished reading this book and I'm just in a state of awe and amazement, and with full respect for these men.

When you consider the intense physical and emotional hardship that the Endurance crew suffered, it is beyond amazing. And, when you stop to think that almost everyone survived, the story becomes almost unbelievable. But the story is true and we get all of the details thanks to the diaries of the crew, the photos taken by ship photographer Hurley, and the excellent writing of Alfred Lansing.This is definitely a book for everyone regardless of your literary interests."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I read this book before going to Antarctica and Shackleton is my hero. Few like him before or since. In modern times, people have been known to go mad while wintering over in the 24-hour darkness of an Antarctic winter. Shackleton's entire crew survived TWO Antarctic winters after the loss of their ship.The entire story is one jaw-dropping, incredible episode after another, finishing with a mountaineering achievement as stupendous as it was unexpected.I have seen the boat, the James Caird, that carried Shackleton and the astounding Frank Worsley (see \\"Shackleton's Captain\\" by John Thomson) and six others on the final voyage from Elephant Island to South Georgia. It's hardly bigger and looks no stronger than a rowboat you might take out on a quiet lake.(It was on display at the American Museum of Natural History as part of a Shackleton Exhibiut in 1999.)For a heart-thumping adventure that leaves you in awe of what at least some men were capable of in terms of courage, resolve, and yes, Endurance, you need look no further."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Without a doubt Lansing's book chronicles the top adventure of all time! Rarely, if ever, in the history of survivability have so few men battled so many challenges. A classic Londonian \\"man vs. nature\\" theme immediately thrusts the reader into the heart of this quest. The technological advances enjoyed by modern action/adventure \\"extreme\\" explorers always seem to fall short of Shackleton's journey given his resources at the time. A true test of personal perseverance--the adventurers simultaneously endure being wet, cold, hungry, and abandoned without hope of rescue in a barren, desolate area of the world. There are so many things to like about this adventure, particularly noteworthy, however, is Shackleton's reliance on his leadership ability not only to motivate but also select the right people at the right time to do the right task. Some may view the whole quest as foolhardy to begin with and therefore dismiss it with a wave of the hand, but remember this--the truest test of a man's spirit may indeed be his ability climb out of a situation spiraling out of control while all the while maintaining steadfast integrity. In my view--> The Top Adventure of All Time--5 Stars!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Shackleton failed to reach the South Pole in 1902 and stopped 460 miles from the Pole; six years later Shackleton turned back 97 miles from the Pole after realizing it would be certain death by starvation if he continued. King Edward VII recognized as a hero Shackleton and knighted him.1914-1916 Endurance expediation lead Shackleton and his men 1200 miles from civilization and in one of the worst situations possible. Pack ice had trapped, dragged the ship for ten months, and eventually crushed the ship. The men had to rely on life boats salvaged from the ship. The men endure temperature far below zero, four months of darkness, survived on a diet of penguin, seal, and sometimes dog. Once the ice began to melt the men moved to the life boats and spent week fighting for their lives before hitting land, Elphant Island and at Elephant Island the men spent most of their time huddle under overturn boats. The men suffered extreme boredom, starvation, extreme discomfort, and lost of hope. Shackleton offer his men hope. Shackleton was charming both a poet and adventure. His men never doubt Shackleton's discipline and Shackleton's brotherhood with his men help overcome intense boredom as they sang songs, played games, and wrote of their experiences.Shackleton decided to take five men and sailed 800 miles in the most sever weather and oceanic conditions to South Georgia and return and rescue his men. The interesting fact about the journey was Shackleton planned to succeed by sailing to South Georgia using Star navigation, and if, the navigation was any degree imprecise their deaths were sealed. The Altantic has some of the harshess waves, it is amazingly cold, and no modern expediation has successfully completed the Shackleton crossing to Georgia. The Altantic ocean was too much.Upon reaching South Georgia, Shackleton realizes they are on the wrong side and proceeded to accomplish another amazing feat, the crossing over of the South Georgia Mountain, at the only time of the year possible for the crossing. The whalers were in awe of Shackelton and his partners as they walked down the mountain. They seemed invincible. Shackleton turns right around and launches a rescue mission for his trapped men on Elphant Island. Not one man was lost in the expedition and his men shout for joy in seeing their captain Shackleton approach to rescue them.\\"I love the fight and when things are easy, I hate it\\".British explorer Apsley Cherry-Garrard, \\"For a join scientific and geographical piece of organization, give me Scott; for a winter journey, give me Wilson, for a dash to the Pole and nothing else, Amundsen; and if I am in the devil of a hole and want to get out of it, give me Shackleton every time.\\"\\"By endurance we conquer\\". Shackleton replaced the War Hero of World War I with the exploration hero. Shackleton gave hope to the world. Men died for honour, instead of fearing death. Europe and America were invigorated with Shackleton's courage.\\"He had a quick brain, and he could visualize things a head, and as far as he could he safeguarded any eventuality that was likely to occur\\" - Lionel Greenstreet\\"His method of discipline was very fair. He did not believe in unnecessary discipline.\\" - William Bakewell\\"No matter what turns up, he is always ready to alter his plans and make fresh ones, and in the meantime laughs, jokes, and enjoys a joke with everyone, and in this way keeps everyone's spirits up\\" - Frank Worsley."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I'm a fan of survivalist accounts such as &quot;Seven Years in Tibet,&quot; and &quot;In the Heart of the Sea.&quot; And I loved this true account of the voyage/survival of Shackleton's crew in the Antarctic.Asking friends and relatives if they've read it, I've heard, &quot;I started it, but I didn't want to see everyone die!&quot; So here's the *spoiler...nobody dies! *The capacity of the human body to survive and of the human brain to figure out how to do it never ceases to amaze me.Lansing's account ingeniously pieces together journals of the men involved and includes riveting details without ever being too gory. Even knowing the ending, it's a page turner. I've heard that this is the most involving of all the accounts published...coming across more like a story and less a documentary.The images of the men on the ice have completely captivated me...the sounds and the movement. Be prepared to grab a blanket and a snack as you read (something not made of penguin)...you'll feel like you're there."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This isn't the type of book that I would normally read, but someone loaned it to me and I was hooked almost from Page 1. It's an awe-inspiring portral of the human spirit enduring incredible suffering and tribulation in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. It truly puts our own lives in perspective and demonstrates what humans are capable of when put to the test.My only gripe is that the story ended rather quickly. I would have loved to have had an additional chapter that detailed the aftermath of their journey, along with additional information about what happened to these men subsequent to their rescue.Overall, one of the most fascinating stories I've ever read."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Unfortunately we live in an age when the word \\"Hero\\" is used to describe some footballer for scoring a goal; or an actor that says something marginally controversial; not a man who drags himself and his comrades across the worst, most lethal terrain known to man. That tabloid overuse of the word \\"Hero\\" is to the detrement of the English language, as comparing men like these to a sports man is like comparing chalk and cheese. To read of their feats of bravery is an honour, few are worthy to stand in their shaddow.I must admit that I have always considered Sir Ernest Shackleton to be one of my all time heroes (along with Sir Douglas Barder), his tale of leadership, courage and endurance is covered well by other reviews, I would just like to say how much of an inspiration and enjoyable read Mr Lansing's book is. I came across the story of Sir Ernest when visiting the Fram museum in Norway (the Fram was Amundsen's ship that got him to the South Pole) and picked up the book as soon as I could; I was not disapointed!The book ends in tragedy. After achieving the impossible they returned to an England loosing over 5000 men a week to war in the trenches of Flanders. That such brave men volunteered to fight for King and Country after their horrendous ordeal is a tribute to their valour."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"...because I would still be thawing out from Shackleton's wild romp in the Antarctic. And a few years have passed since their adventure and those fateful seventeen months in 1914-16 when Shackleton and his men encountered the worst Murphy's Law could throw their way. The book is a testament to human endurance, to Lansing's writing, and the leadership of a man like Ernest Shackleton. It is an enjoyable read from front to back, from launch to recovery, from freezing to thawing.As far as adventure/disaster books go, I would rank it behind Jon Krakauer's &quot;Into Thin Air.&quot; Though the author Lansing does an incredible job placing the reader &quot;there&quot; with Shackleton's men as they get their ship stuck in the ice pack in the Weddell Sea, float on ice floes, launch across treacherous seas in lifeboats, and go where no man has gone before on a last ditch desperate land jaunt, the fact doesn't change that Lansing, himself, wasn't there. I think no matter how hard an author can apply his trade to a story, it is difficult to relay to the reader the immediacy of impending doom and the cold and dread and the spirit that drives men to survival. Don't get me wrong, Lansing does a fine job bringing off this task, but it is short of the immediacy Krakauer gives the reader of putting you &quot;there&quot; in the desperate situation and knowing what it is like to survive from the worst nature and man has to offer.If you want to read the best in adventure/disaster writing start skip by Junger's somewhat thrill-lacking &quot;The Perfect Storm,&quot; and head straight for &quot;Into Thin Air,&quot; followed by Lansing's &quot;Endurance.&quot; Be warned though, you will be losing out on some sleep in the process since these books absolutely prove impossible to put down. Stoke the fire, turn the thermostat up, because you will be chilled to the bone and will probably have nightmares of Sea Lions chasing you across ice floes once you finish the book and finally get some sleep."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The story of the ill-fated 1914 Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, bent on glory, but ultimately humbled to the barest thread of survival. The Endurance becomes locked in an ice pack in the Weddell Sea, and is eventually crushed and sunk. The ship goes screaming into the icy deep. The men scurry for safety onto the surrounding ice. And that's just the beginning. I'm frankly surprised ANYONE survived this horrendous ordeal; if this were a novel, I'd say it's far-fetched. But it happened, and all hands survived. Imagine an acute scarcity of food, months on end in darkness, an interminable landscape of featureless whiteness, no sanitary facilities, and all through this you're cold and wet, and it's windy, and the temperature's below zero. You eat your sled dogs. You're nauseated from undercooked food. Your face and hands are frostbitten. You shiver even in your sleep. And no one knows you're marooned. Your only escape is to travel by open boat through the gale-wracked Drake Passage-the most treacherous body of water on Earth. Imagine your fingers are frozen numb, and yet you must chip off ice from the sail, and raise the sail, and tie the lines fast. Otherwise you'll sink and die. These men did the impossible-and they lived to tell about it."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Absolutely the greatest adventure and survival story ever told...and its all true. Alfred Lansing does a masterful job of telling this compelling tale of Ernest Shackeltons voyage to the Antarctic in 1914. The book reads like a page turning novel and you wont be able to put it down. I recall thinking after the first hundred pages..\\"well what can happen now because Shackelton and his crew are doomed\\". I couldnt understand how there could still be 200 pages of book left. But what a story, at every turn you cant wait to find out what happens next. After reading it i bought 3 more copies to give to friends!

Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Two weeks and I devoured this book. Riding the Long Island Railroad helped.

AWESOME!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"If you, like I, have been trapped in the Bermuda triangle of testosterone books lately (The Perfect Storm, Into Thin Air, Young Men and Fire, Ship of Gold, etc...) then read this book and tremble. The degree of hardship these men endured, as well as their incredible will to live, transcends all other adventure tales and will help you break out of the Bermuda triangle rut. This book will be the one from which you judge all other books that have to do with the human spirit. It will be your frame of reference. Through Lansing's unflinching and stark prose, you will see yourself in a different light, and see mankind from a different perspective, when you finish this read. It is humbling, terrifying and true."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I bought the book on the basis of the reviews on AMAZON.COM. At first I frankly wondered what the fuss was all about. By the end of the book I vowed I'd recommend it to everyone I know. If this were a novel or a movie, no one would believe it. The number of hairsbreadth escapes, the impossible feats performed by men who had already suffered immeasurably, the sheer audacity of the things they did, all beggar the imagination. At point after point one is vastly impressed by what they accomplished, only to find that they had to do something even more difficult. There is no doubt that this is a &quot;must read.&quot; This is among the handful of books I will always treasure."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"A Perfect Storm, Into Thin Air neither can top the raw adventure and true courage of the men of the Endurance."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"A well-written true adventure story about men surviving against all odds, as told in their journals and pieced together by the author.

As the darkness deepened, the wind increased and the temperature dropped ever lower. An actual reading was impossible, but it was probably at least as low as 8 below. It was so cold that the seas that broke over them froze almost as soon as the hit. The boats, the mean-- everything was soaked, then frozen. Most of the men tried to shelter themselves under the tent cloths, but the wind repeatedly tore them loose. There was only room enough for the men to sit upright, huddled together with their with their feet squeezed between the cases of stores. The seas that came on board ran down into the bottom of the boat, and since most of the men were wearing felt boots, their feet were soaked all night in the icy water. To keep their feet from freezing, they worked their toes constantly inside their boots. They could only hope that the pain in their feet would continue, because comfort would mean that they were freezing....&quot;Oh Ya! Oh baby, action and excitement. You must read this book. And it's not all just them being miserable, there are some really happy times out there in the middle of a frozen ocean. It gives clips of journals from he men and what they were thinking, how they got along or annoyed each other.. that kind of stuff. Very descriptive writing style.

Very strange).Anyway, just search on &quot;Endurance&quot; and you'll see a link to Caroline's book. Worth every penny of $30. The fact that Amazon is only asking around $20 is why we keep coming back...As with the Lansing edition, you will likely find yourself buying multiple copies of this book.

That 30 men could survive for 3 years with only the loss of one man's foot under such conditions is an incredible tribute to the human will to survive. I am currently using the internet to try to track down relatives of survivors, or anyone who has additional information about the event. I would like to add to the knowledge of this event if possible. If you are such a person with info, please contact me by email at sgsull@aol.com Thanks."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"First I would like to thank all the people who had went on line and wrote their reviews for this book. Without them, I would never known there is such a book out there waiting for me to read.Read it and you will know why there are so many people love the book. One of the experiences you will not want to forget and it will always remain in your mind. It IS AN INSPIRATION book!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I like this book Endurance very much; it is very phat and has a lot of action. I told everyone I know about it. Some have read it and it got rave reviews"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"First off, I have to give this book two thumbs up. It's an incredible story and a real page turner. But I have to point something out. The description states that the castaways ate polar bear? Did the reviewer even read the book? Polar bears don't even live in Antartica."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I don't disagree with the rave reviews about this book as a incredible story of survival, but the main thing I got from it was Shackletons ability to create and redefine teams is what really makes this story a standout. As the story unfolds, from the interviewing process which he used to build the initial crew, down to the determining who would be in which tent, this is a story of a leader that knew how to build teams that worked."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I purchased this item for two reasons: it was recommended by one friend and coz I heard it was really useful for managers. At the end I did not find it so useful, it has some basic lessons to do good management, all of them draw by you beacuse it does not have any specific section with such a purpose. The really good thing is that the real story is amazing."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I have always enjoyed adventure stories, the type written by Jules Verne or Jack London. None of those fictional stories can possibly compare (in my estimation) with this true and very well documented adventure involving 27 men on an Antarctic expedition which becomes a harrowing and incredible tale of bravery and stoicism.I have read different editions, and they do not all have many photos, but some have a great many. All the photos are fantastic.One of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This book is well written and gives a harrowing account of early explorers to an extreme and inhospitable place. The author doesn't cut corners or use unnecessary literary devices, because the truth is way too interesting to bother with embellishments. I wouldn't hand this to a 10 year old, but jr high or older would enjoy this history adventure."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I can say with confidence that this is the best book I have ever read. From page one you are at the edge of your seat, reading voraciously to find out what happens next. I bought four copies of the book--one for myself, two for my two best friends, and one for my dad. Everyone was as addicted to it as I was. The fact that its a true story is just amazing."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Like almost every other reviewer here, I regard Shackleton's odyssey has one of the most incredible tales of human endurance...ever. His men...survive months of exposure to the Antarctic cold, on the floating, shifting ice pack...and nobody dies. If it weren't thoroughly documented it would be an unbelievable tale. As it is, it is a tale both remarkable and wonderful and is a testament of Shackleton's leadership and the grit of a remarkable crew.Still for me, there was one thing that it is difficult to regard as literally possible...wet sleeping bags. If I can remember rightly the author states that most of the men's sleeping bags...bed rolls...were wet during most of the ordeal. I just don't believe this. I was stranded in Alaska in conditions far less horrific than the one's encountered by Shackleton's expedition. Nevertheless, the thing I feared the most was getting my sleeping bag soaked [it rained most of the time]. I truly believe that...although the temperatures were in the 30's and 40's...that I could not have survived 2 nights in a wet bag. All the sleeping bag's insulative properties would be lost and there would be nothing to protect me from the cold.In the case of Shackleton's men, their sleeping equipment was reported as uniformly wet from their dousings in the frigid sea. Yes, given the extreme low temperatures, these bags would have frozen right up and it would have been possible to knock some of the ice from the surfaces of the bags but internal ice would have stayed and thawed on contact with warm human bodies. The crew would indeed have 'slept wet'...for months. It's scarcely credible unless their's something I'm unaware of...Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--'Skull Rack' and 'Hummingbird God'--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"came on time and in good condition!

It is the true tale of a group of men trying to explore the antartic in 1916. How their ship gets trapped in the ice and how they manage to survive until they are rescued or I should say, how they rescue themselves. This is really a gripping story that I would recommend as an excelent read."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"if you like \\"call of the wild', 'to start a fire', or 'into thin air' this is right up your alley. the descriptions of this harrowing journey into the arctic are vivid. i'm so glad someone survived to tell this incredible true story!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The Endurance, Shackleton's Incredible Voyage, by Alfred Lansing is a great book. It is a great story. This is about Ernest Schackleton's greatest adventure. It is an excellent book. The book is an account of an event. This does not mean the book is boring. The story is real, but the events that take place in the book are unreal. For example, the story takes place over a period of two years, and the crew never touches or sees land, and lives solely on the boat and ice. The story also changes a lot because it is told from various perspectives, which makes the story move along, and gives each character a certain attitude, because a lot of the story is taken from. For instance, when the crew is on the boat, some of the men do not mind, while others think differently. This makes the story change, which makes the book interesting, and not monotonous unlike some other books of this genre. The book is also well written. Although the author was not on the expedition, he has done interviews with the crew, and has obtained all of their journals which was one of the few things they were allowed to keep. This book is not very new. It is similar to some of other adventure stories, like Into the Wild, The Perfect Storm, and Into Thin Air. The difference is that it brings the genre to a new level. It is more interesting, and has a better story that it was based on. I had never read anything on Alfred Lansing, but this book may make me want to read more. Overall I like this book. It didn't get the last half star because I thought it was too long, but I don't like anything over 200 pages, so that is my own personal bias."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I can not believe that this is a true story! It is unbelievable!Very interesting!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Ummmm...to say this book rocked would be an understatement. To say that this book is worth the blood of an smallish harmless animal, well then we'd be in ballpark. If Ernie Shackleton were alive...I'd be his lover, his follower, his servant, maybe even his concubine. I mean this dude was nuts (in a good way), conquering the Antartic is a feat that only demostrates this man's sexual potential, and the power of this great leader's pelvic thrust. But don't take my word for it. Buy the dang book (and then go ahead and read it). If it doesn't change your life (in a good...homo-erotic kind of way) well take two advil and re-read it. You can thank me later."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The title &quot;Endurance&quot; is appropriate - it required this to plod through the book.

But Lansing interviewed most of the voygers still living and was able to inject some of the uncertainty and fear that drove the mighty party after their hapless little ship was crushed and sunk 1000 miles from civilization. This made it more human and powerful than Shackleton's &quot;South&quot; where he glossed over these issues. If you are going to pick only one version to read... this is it!

I found the story of Shackelton and his men an engaging and awe inspiring piece of literature. I have read Jon Krakauer's novels and although I find Krakauer a more accessible and exciting writer, the story of the Endurance is far more jaw dropping than anything in Krakauer's books.

These guys didn't have any kind of luck but bad. First their ship gets stuck in the ice for ten months, then the ship is crushed in the ice, and then they float on the ice for another five months before taking to the small boats. And that's just the beginning. Given up for lost, it would be 20 months before the rest of the world knew they had survived, against every imaginable force the sea could throw at them. Whenever you think you can't do whatever it is that you must, read Endurance by Alfred Lansing."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Endurance by Alfred Lansing is a truly wonderful story. I am an eleven year old sixth grader who thinks every talented reader 10-81 would enjoy Endurance. The vocabulary is exquisite and the writing is advanced. The quality of the story is such that you feel like you're right there in Antarctica! You begin to form strong connections with the characters as well. One of the greatest things about it is that this is the true account of the Imperial Trans Antarctic Expedition. All the toil the crew went through really happened. If you choose to read this book, be ready for an amazing story where you'll be on the edge of your seat the whole time!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"People bandy about the word \\"classic\\" without considering its significance, but this all-time bestseller will remain in print many more years. It's a true classic, ranking among the top adventure books. Nowhere will you find a more gripping account than Endurance, the survival story of polar explorer Ernest Shackleton and his crew of 27 men, in 1915. This cliff-hanger of a book stays with you. Could it be that today's leaders pale beside the likes of Shackleton?"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is an amazing story of leadership, and man's ability to persevere under extraordinary circumstances. It is really unbelievable. I was staggered by the odds these men overcame and their determination to press on.

Imagine being cold, wet, hungry, tired for basically 2 years while in the back of your mind you know that the chances of ever seeing the civilized world is remote at best. These men handled it well. Very good historical account written based on interviews, historical accounts, and actual diaries of the men on the journey."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This true story of Ernest Shackleton's journey to the Antarctic in 1915 is a great preview to a trip to the White Continent.

Good preview to Antarctic travel."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This classic from Alfred Lansing (first published in 1959), has been reissued as a special edition with a forward and epilogue by Dr. Dobson (of Focus on the Family fame).This true story follows Shackleton's attempt to sledge across Antarctica in 1914. That adventure ends well before it even began when the ship was beset by ice in the Weddell sea. The new adventure - survival - takes place over the next 17 months as the team experiences the most extreme conditions this planet has to offer. That anyone survived is a miracle. The fact that everyone eventually gets home alive is almost beyond belief.The photographs and many diaries kept by the men on the voyage allowed Lansing to cover this epic adventure in amazing detail. A must read."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The author has clearly been rigorous in piecing together diary extracts and interview notes to put together this account of an adventure, or perhaps ordeal, which required of its survivors a degree of courage, composure and determination that cannot fail to humble yet uplift and inspire the reader. The style of narrative is rather matter-of-fact, rather than dramatic, and its coverage is limited to the expedition itself without dwelling much on the lives of the key players before or after."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"For anyone unfamiliar, the story of Sir Ernest Shackleton and his crew is one of the greatest true tales of desperation, determination, and tenacity of the 20th century. The author does a yeomans job of distilling stacks of diary entries and hours of interviews into a thrilling volume about the ill fated but ultimately successful voyage to Antarctica."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Truly an inspiring and incredible true story. Knowing that they survive makes the hardships they go through that much more amazing."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is one of the most incredible stories of survival ever! The book is well written and goes into great detail. I listened to the audiobook and found myself sitting in my car after reaching my destination just to hear more.

The story is tremendously fascinating. Take a trip to Antartica."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is a must read! This book leaves you feeling like there is nothing the human spirit cannot accomplish or live through. This should be mandatory reading for all teenagers. It is well written and I could not put it down until I turned the last page."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"So much has been already said about Shakleton it would be preseumptuous of me to try to add anything. This book does justice to a great leader. Yes he made mistakes, and might have misjudged his goal to begin with. But Shakleton was unsurpassable when it came to leadership. Having given up on his initial goal because of force majeure, he displayed unparalleled cold blood, sound judgement and navigational skills in taking his whole crew back home alive.Lansing's prose is fascinating, he takes the reader right onto the ship, and then in the midst of the crew for the trek across Antarctica. This book is history but reads like a thriller.It is amazing that such heroic feat was accomplished in the face of defeat: Shakleton had set out to cross the Antarctic continent, the last major polar expedition waiting to be completed after Peary had conquered the North Pole in 1909 and Amundsen had reached the South Pole in 1911. Crossing the continent would have been an even greater journey. In that, Shakleton failed, but in defeat he became a legend."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Lansing brilliantly weaves the actual accounts recorded in the diaries of 28 men into what reads like a novel of an expedition of Antarctica in 1914. Earnest Shackleton led the men on the ship Endurance, which became the title of the book and the best description of the quality the men needed to survive their nearly two-year journey.The book is a thrilling account of how the crew survives shipwreck, obtained food and water, avoided freezing and boredom, and move across ice, land, and ocean. Endurance teaches many lessons of survival, perseverance, and leadership in the middle of a situation that constantly offers disappointment and frustration.You won't want to put the book down after you start. I recommend the book."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"read this book in the the middle of a snow bound winter and it will seem like your on a tropic island."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Adventure/Survival novels are my preferred genre and this one takes the cake. Simply the most amazing story of them all.

The early black and white photos included are also astonishing. Great book, great read."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Good read, good service. I bought the book used in \\"good\\" condition. I'd say the condition was better than good. Book was non stop action all the way through. Very historical story.

Extremely inspirational and told in such a matter of fact kind of way, that you are left trying to fully grasp the situation on your own. This may sound like bad writing, but it's actually great writing. There is no way the author could have accurately captured the essence of the situation, so he just tells the story and it's not very hard to fill in the blanks.Just incredible!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This really is an incredible story. I would recommend this book to everyone. It is truly, truly incredible that any person could survive this and to have the story told so well in this book is really something to read.

I couldn't put the book down, and I can't get the story out of my head."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Admittedly I tend to gravitate toward fiction and only like nonfiction when it's written like a novel - this book did not disappoint! Once I started reading it I literally couldn't put it down! From the moment Shackleton's ship is locked in ice, to them living on an ice floe, to them trekking across land and sea and they're eventual and dramatic attempt to sail away in search of a rescue party.The book is incredibly well written, the story is mesmerizing and it's amazing what this group of men lived through, endured, and accomplished while stuck in Antartica. I cannot even imagine what it was like but this book gives an excellent account of the events as they unfolded.For a history buff looking for a good read, snatch this book up. For someone like me who prefers fiction, snatch this book up. I'm an avid reader (averaging 5-6 books a month) and this one ranks high on my list of must reads and must tell everyone else to read. You'll be amazed at the strength, determination, attitude and fortitude of Shackleton and his men as they set out to do the impossible and survive against all odds."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read, and I AM A READER.

He was a remarkable man."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I picked up this book for $1 from a Kindle offer and knew very little about the story.

They would bring it to him reminding him that is was time to read.The writing is excellent and the story is timeless.You may need a dictionary to help with some of the words!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Alfred Lansing has captured the essence of Shackleton's failed Antarctic expedition like no one else I've read. He goes into the journals, the ones that made it home, and pulls together the thoughts, emotions, and experiences of this unbelievably brave group of 28 men. Their personalities and life experiences were as varied as the winds that determined their fate. And, yet, they pulled together as a team through thick and thin. They faced isolation, below zero temperatures along with above 100 mph winds, hungry predators, starvation, drowning, illness, etc., and they pulled through without a single lost life.Shackleton was an amazingly motivational individual who when 99% of people would have given up; never showed an iota of fear or depression.When you read this book you will find out what true heroes really are and you will be amazed."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I had my expectations before reading this book, and I felt that what I already knew (or thought I knew) would be all that was presented in the novel. I WAS WRONG! I knew of the story of Ernest Shackleton and I knew roughly what had happened, but I was only aware of the story, as anyone might tell it to someone else in under 3 minutes. By the time I finished the book, I was like \\"Is this the same story I was aware of before I read the book?\\" It most certainly was, but I was astounded by the balance of detail. The detail isn't overdone or underdone, but rather just enough to get the point across, captivate the reader, and get you moving on to the next bit of info. I enjoyed the writing style as much as I did the story itself. I wouldn't have minded if I had read a two-bit story written by such a fabulous author. Later I found out that there were books already out describing the adventure, one by the same name written by Frank Worsely, the Endurance's captain, and \\"South\\" by Ernest Shackleton. However, neither of these men are renowned authors, and their stories do not encompass the stories of others except maybe a few. It is written like a fiction novel, with all the emotion and suspense as any ordinary fictional piece, but it has that element of realism that makes you realize every so often that what you are reading actually happened, and it happened the way it was told. No matter HOW you tell this extraordinary story, this will always be the winner. For those of you who are interested in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration (as I am), this book is for you!!! GET IT!!! Get it NOW!!!!! For those who like a good read to captivate your mind even further, this will not disappoint, I guarantee it."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"If this story were fiction I would tell the writer that the tale was too far-fetched and he needed to tone it down a little in order to make it believable. Shackleton and his crew's feats are THAT amazing!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This book is an in-depth account of Shackleton's ill-fated Antarctic expedition in 1914.

It is hard to comprehend what unbelievable hardships these men went through, but the author brings it home in a compelling manner.In these days of high tech solutions and all manner of equipment we often forget how a leader can pull a team through an incredibly difficult situation. Shackleton must go down as one of the world's great hero's and this book as a must read for anyone interested in history and peoples achievements."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"One of the best-known of the many books about Englishman Shakleton's 1915 expedition to cross the South Pole, this is essentially a quick, easy-reading adventure story. Aptly titled, it's a pretty gripping and amazing story, and will put to shame any bad camping story of one's own.

When you sit back and think about what they went through, the book becomes even better. Shackleton, although he failed his mission, should be considered a true hero for what he did."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"As you have read all of other the wonderful reviews, mine will be the same. I am sad because I am only 26 years old, and know there will probably never again be another real-life event (or book about that event) that can even come close to matching what Shackelton and his crew accomplished. After you read this book, don't bother trying to find a book about a &quot;greater&quot; feat, because there isn't."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Compared to what Shackleton and his crew endured, the 1996 Everest expedition was a sunday picnic. The story is so remarkable, I doubt you will be able to put it down. And, in constrast to The Perfect Storm, etc., this book is very well written -- the kind of lyrical and literate writing not at all typical of this genre. This one will stay with you."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Lansing's tale will grab you and never let go, as it did for me 25 years ago in my first reading and every re-reading since. While other accounts of this heroic journey are also compelling, Lansing's version is easily the best. Beyond the gripping descriptions of incessant danger and threats to the human psyche, Lansing lays out the foundation for a Shackleton theory of management:Prepare for contingencies and then prepare again; Value attitude over technical competence in selecting people for work; Emphasize role over rank (the CEO takes the soggiest sleeping bag); Don't be afraid to do nothing, for you can lose your head (and those of your crew) by forcing action to conquer boredom; And (shades of Apollo 13) Failure is not an option.This book alone was enough to launch a decades-long fascination with Shackleton. This book alone inspired me to travel 2,700 miles from Boise to New York just to see the fabulous Endurance exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History. For anyone with an interest in survival sagas, psychology, or management theory and practice, this book should be in anyone's top ten."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"To say this is a book about a polar expedition is to say that &quot;Lear&quot; is a play about a king going mad.

I read this right before we traveled around Cape Horn, so it was very a propos!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"There's been a seeming flood of books and movies about the 1915-6 Shackleton polar expedition in recent years, but this 1959 account is probably the best and most concisely written. Great pacing, and character development throughout. The agonizing slowness of the disaster, the recovery and the almost two years it took for the crew to escape the Antarctic are nail-bitingly well done. If you only read one book about Shackleton, this should be the one."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This book was referred by a friend and I truly grateful. I was hooked just by the concept of the storyand to learn that it was a true story was amazing. A true page turner and uplifting as a testimonyto the human spirit."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"It's amazing to be stuck for 2 years without rescue but it's even more impressive that no one died. The book follows the masterful leadership of Shackleton as his ship gets stuck and eventually crushed in sheets of ice. The writing is non sensationalized and feels like it came from a member of the crew. To clear any confusion, this book was originally written in the 1950's which explains how the author interviewed the original crew."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Great read. Love the diary inserts. Very detailed account of an amazing journey that recognizes Shackleton leadership but more importantly what an excellent crew he chose."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I started to read the book and it was starting out to be very good. The map included in the book was unreadable on my Kindle DX. I talked to Amazon and was told it is for newer kindles with a touch screen, not for the older kindles. They were unable or unwilling to fix the map to make it readable on my kindle. I still hope to read the book someday, if I get a newer device or pick up a paper copy."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I was looking for something different to read and decided on this. The Good: Well written with a good pace. Filled with diary ertries, and very factual information which I found amazing since Shackleton's journey was almost 100 years ago. The Bad: Some nautical terms I was not familiar with. Character development was not strong, but with a story as momentous as this, I understood. I recommend this book even if you do not think you would enjoy it. The 3 books I read prior to this were Robocalypse, The Night Circus, and a Sandy Koufax biography, just to give you an iddea of where I am coming from.

A truly amazing story but told in such painstaking detail that you nearly have to possess the same endurance as the characters to finish it. Almost unbelievable."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"MUST READ! Amazing account of one of the most heroic survival journeys ever completed. Everything we go through in life will pale in comparison."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"What are you waiting for? Don't delay any longer. Probably the best and most exciting book I have ever read. Not one dull spot in the whole book. Total engrossment word by word. From what I can tell this book is the most free flowing account of Shakelton's expedition, leaving out no major events from begining to end. This book makes you want to know what happened to each of these men after they all were rescued. It also leaves you wondering what happened to the other support boat that was part of the expedition. So now I'll have to read Shakelton's own book &quot;South&quot;."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Alfred Lansing subtitled his book, Endurance, as \\"The Greatest Adventure Story Ever Told.\\" That's a tall claim, and he may be right. In terms of the limits of hardship the human body can endure, only one book rivals this incredible true story: Slavomir Rawicz's \\"The Long Walk\\" (which I enthusiastically recommend).In 1914, Sir Ernest Shackleton, a veteran of two previous Antarctic expeditions, and his crew of 26 men and an eighteen-year-old stowaway-who later has his frostbitten and gangrenous foot amputated-set sail for Antarctica aboard the worthy ship, Endurance, determined to be the first men to sledge across the full breadth of the continent. They never get there. Beset in ice floes just off the coast of Antarctica, ship and crew begin a two-year ordeal of cold, hunger, monotony, loneliness, and despair as they are dragged helplessly around the vicious Weddell Sea by pack ice. The ship is crushed by the ice before the first year is out, forcing the crew onto the ice. This begins an excruciating existence of basic survival against all odds as the pack drifts slowly north, forcing them onto ever diminishing floes, and eventually to the ship's life boats.Near death, the crew finally reaches hellish and uninhabited Elephant Island after nearly two years. This is before functional radio. There are no satellites, no phones. No one in the world knows where they are. They have been given up for dead by the civilized world thousands of miles away and preoccupied by World War I. Their only hope for salvation is for Shackleton and five others to take the best of the three boats, an open, 22-foot life boat, and sail it 870 miles across the worst seas on earth to the whaling station on South Georgia Island and return to rescue the others before they freeze or starve to death. After landing on South Georgia, they're forced to trek on foot across the frozen island to reach the whaling station, a feat never before attempted and rarely since accomplished.The scene Lansing paints as Shackleton and two others trudge into this camp as gaunt and grimy, bearded and long-haired living ghosts in rags, is so moving I had to get up and walk around for a while after reading it. I got seasick on a cruise ship in the Caribbean once, and wanted to die. What these heroes stoically endured is simply beyond comprehension. And hurray to Lansing for his research and writing effort. As a writer myself, I see one of the major challenges in writing this book as how to keep the text fresh and the excitement going, when in reality each day of the expedition was a boring repetition of cold, hunger, worry, ice, and more ice. But this is the epitome of a page-turner. Why isn't it a major movie? -Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Excellent reading. I am an avid reader (about one book a week) and this certainly ranks near the top of what I've read this year. I was first turned on to the general subject after reading &quot;The Worst Journey in the World,&quot; the story of Scott's ill fated South Pole expedition. Although I found that book a little long winded, there was no doubting the passion, courage, and emotions of the setting.I found Lansing's book to be a very easy read mixing just the right amount of detail and back story. Although you do not get a good picture of all 27 survivors, you do get a strong picture of the dozen or so key men. That would be the only fault in this narrative, but I suppose there are other sources to get the whole shabang. I would have like to have seen a &quot;where are they now&quot; sort of afterword, but nonetheless, the story is a solid, adventurous, unbelievable exhibit of man against nature and will against calamity.The story is very easy to follow. It has perhaps one of the greatest opening lines to a book ever &quot;The order to abandon ship was given at 5:00 p.m.&quot; It is a real page turner.Highly recommended reading. I don't think I will ever utter the words &quot;I'm freezing&quot; or &quot;I'm starving&quot; again.Also, you must rent/buy the Enurance DVD narrated by Liam Neeson. This is an amazing DVD. Besides the beautiful tale that Lansing has brough to us, the only thing more amazing is to see the actual pictures and movie footage taken by Hurley (one of the survivors). Some of the shots are simply breathtaking. The DVD is the cherry on top."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Reading the reviews of this book, I expected a thrilling, well-told adventure. It exceeded my expectations and, like many other reviewers, I found that after a certain point in the book I simply couldn't put the book down. It would have been like leaving those brave men alone in the freezing ice and water. The events described in this book are so well known, suffice to say this is the story of Earnest Shackleton's 1914 Arctic expedition, in which Shackleton and his men hoped to cross the continent on foot. They never even made landfall, and their ship was trapped, and then slowly crushed in the ice. Thus begins the incredible story.One of the strengths of the book is the elegant, slowly building power of Alfred Lansing's prose. He hits the perfect pitch, not sensational and yet not a dry retelling of facts. His writing is very clean, cuts right to the quick, and is full of perfect details. The book is also full of journal entries from several of the men, and most of these are masterpieces of understatement and courage. I won't even begin to describe the elements and details of the hardships these men faced. I simply don't know how they kept going, kept trying, in the face of such awesome, soul-crushing circumstances.This book, to say the least, is a testament to the survival instinct in men - the surprising deep need the human animal has to simply stay alive, no matter what. And, of course, the book is a testament to the men of the Endurance. The author puts it best in the book's dedication: \\"In appreciation for whatever it is that makes men accomplish the impossible.\\""},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The suspense is real - it is cold as ice - and it builds and builds, in Lansing's superb retelling, until the final climax.Many Amazon.com readers will realize that Lansing's tale is actually a fairly old book right now. It was written after World War II when many of the members of the expedition (but not Shackleton) were still alive and could be interviewed. This book is their story as much as that of the author, Lansing.In their stories we see a bunch of men from the Edwardian British Isles - one of the most class-ridden societies the world has ever seen - learn to work together. These men were not perfect. Every reader will find someone in the &quot;Endurance&quot; whom he or she will identify with. Whatever their flaws, they were able to accomplish the impossible.Most people who read this review will know how the story ends, so I am not giving anything away when I say that it is just as much a triumph of the human spirit as it was when it was first told, decades ago. Today Lansing's book is both a classic and a best seller, a tribute to the fact that we need stories like these, and are not ashamed to admit the fact that we need them."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Yes, I know I'm just another one, continuing the string of raving reviews, but I couldn't resist putting my two cents in. This truly is an incredible adventure story. Growing up in the comfort of the late 20th century, it was nearly impossible for me to even try to place myself in the situation described in the book: a man and his crew, struggling for their lives in one of the harshest environments on earth, with the knowledge that no help from the outside is coming, the outside world not even being aware of the predicament. I imagine it would be hard for a great deal of us to understand the feeling of having one's very life in their own hands, having to survive solely on one's own mental and physical strength, and that of the few companions that become one's entire world. At times the whole thing feels like too much; I had to remind myself that this really happened, people really survived this, otherwise I would have started to assume it was straight out of Hollywood.The book is well researched and well written by Lansing, and the use of journal entries and interviews makes the crew become real people, rather than just names. The story of Ernest Shackleton and his crew is one of the greatest adventure stories I know of, in book, film, or any other form."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"What was supposed to be an exploration of the Antarctic turns into a fight for survival for famed explorer Ernest Shackleton and his crew. Trapped in an ice flow, their ship destroyed, forced to live on ice flow, crossing open seas in small boats. For two years they lived in bitter cold and constant dampness. They battled starvation, thirst and illness. Every other day the unpredictable Antarctic weather would descend upon them. Still they battled on in an effort to reach civilization.. Undoubtedly one of the most amazing non-fiction stories I ever read. The writing draws you in, makes you experience the crews' struggles first hand. Find out what it's like to sail a boat through horrid weather when you are dead tired and soaked through the bone. When you read this, you will feel guilty about complaining the next time you drag yourself into work fighting a cold. A stellar example that, even against the most impossible odds, people can still triumph."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"A fantastic story about a fantastic journey....the aborted attempt by Shackleton and crew to cross the continent of Antartica in 1915. I gave it only three stars because I found the writing to be a little dry and repetitive, especially in comparison to other great non-fiction stories I have read. Also I thought the book ended too abruptly, without much followup on the characters I had come to care about. However, the story itself is so strong that I would recommend the book. It about the triumph of Shackleton's leadership and his crew against unimaginable conditions. It demonstrates what can be achieved with spirit and discipline, even when pitted against the most inhospitable landscape on our planet!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Forgive the cliches, excuse the platitudes. This tome is a must read. This story proves beyond any doubt that truth is indeed stranger than fiction. If it were a work of fiction, nobody would buy into it. What happened to the men of this expedition far transcends any reality we could possiblly comprehend. The men of this ill fated Antarctic expedition endured more hardship in any one week over an almost two year period than one would think even a super human being could handle. Day after day; week after weeek, month after month in miserable condtions, never knowing what misfourtune the next day would bring and all the while knowing that nobody else in the world knew they were even alive. I highly, highly recommend this incredible story of human courage.UNDAUNTED COURAGE by Steven Ambrose is also a great testament to the spirit of human survival, but ENDURANCE is even better, and believe me, as a huge fan of Ambrose, I do not make that statement without great thought and introspection.It's been a while since I read ENDURANCE, but it still astounds and inspires me. Read this book. Pass it on to a friend. You will never regret it; you will never forget it."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Endurance is one of the most incredible stories of human courare and perseverance on record. For those who enjoyed Endurance you should also read &quot;The Last Antartic Heroes&quot; - It is the story of what happened to Aurora, the boat sent by Shackleton to lay depots on the other side of the Antarctic for Shackletons' trans-continnental crossing which never eventuated. Like the Endurance part of the expedition, the boat was lost, this time with most of their provisions, yet they were bound to try to complete the mission (by laying the depots) so that Shackleton and his men would not starve to death when they came accross the continent.It is a tale of remarkable courage, borne of the men's commitment to Shackleton and unwaivering faith in human endurance in the face of impossible odds. If you loved Endurance, read it. In its own way it's as remarkable as its more famous stablemate."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"After turning over the last leaf of Lansing's riveting account, I was compelled to drop everything I was doing and get on a ship headed to South Georgia, where I humbly paid my respects at Sir Ernest Shackleton's idyllic resting place right on the shores of Grytviken Harbor. This remote island figures prominently in a story that gives revitalized meaning to words like &quot;adventure&quot;, &quot;hardship&quot;, &quot;soul&quot;, and of course &quot;endurance&quot;. From the book's very first proclamation (&quot;The story you are about to read is true&quot;) to its final implication (&quot;These were men!&quot;), Lansing engages the reader with successively awe-inspiring and head-shaking tales, anecdotes and journal quotes. Lansing's narrative is also more engaging than personal accounts written by the protagonists themselves (Shackleton's &quot;South&quot; and Worsley's &quot;Shackleton's Boat Journey&quot;) because their very acts of heroism are modestly downplayed in the first person. Lansing holds nothing back in his respectful tribute. The only drawback is a lack of illustrations and maps on the original hardcover version."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Alfred Lansing's &quot;Endurance&quot; is quite simply the definitive version of Ernest Shackleton's ill-fated 1914 expedition to Antarctica. He was supposed to lead the first people to cross the Antarctic continent, but his ship, the &quot;Endurance,&quot; was trapped and crushed in the polar ice, leaving his group stranded and entirely on their own. It's quite possibly the greatest polar adventure story of all time.Based on numerous interviews and other meticulous forms of research, Lansing tells the story in great but not stupefying detail. He draws the reader in and makes you feel like you are actually standing on that ice floe with Shackleton, watching the ship disintegrate. He does a much better job of telling the story than Shackleton himself did in his book &quot;South.&quot;Although there have been many retellings of the &quot;Endurance&quot; story, both on page and on film (most recently A&amp;E's &quot;Shackleton&quot; dramatization), none are as compelling or as readable as Lansing's book. Check it out; you will be enthralled."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is a story anyone evenly remotely interested in high adventure should make time to read. And you think you have troubles? You need to read this amazing story. It is full of incredible events and stars some of the most interesting and powerful characters. Ernest Shackleton has got to be rated one of the top five leaders in all history. His concern and dedication toward his crew astounds. Just when you think that things are getting better for the crew of Endurance.......wham, another major hurtle. You can barely put this book down. It is unreal how strong and durable these men were during the most adverse of conditions. The story is well written by the author and what a story it is. He makes you feel like you are the 29th crew member with his phrasing and with his descriptions of Antarctic exploration. &quot;Endurance&quot; is the perfect word for it's title. I hope you will not miss this epic adventure. These were men like no others I know of, during a time when they didn't have the modern adventurer's high tech systems of communication and rescue. Their bravery and their physical powers are off the scale. I can't recommend this book more highly to you. If you even half-like adventure, this one's for you. It pales our modern day adventurers. I think it is the Adventure of the Millenium, bar none. Read it."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"....OK, just go order this book right now and read it.Now that we have that out of the way. Wow what a story! Ernest Shackleton what a man. Since the south pole had already been \\"discovered\\", in 1914 Shackelton decided to dog sled across the continent of Antarctica! Unfortunately opon reaching the east coast his ship became locked in the ice eventually completely demolished by the ice flow. Cast out they lived on a floating ice pack for five months! When they were down to one small berg they abandoned the ice and sailed in very small lifeboats to a barren rock Elephant Island. Here the majority stayed behind and Shackleton and small group sailed again in one of the lifeboats over 600 miles to a whaling port! Talk about endurance, the word pales in the accomplishment of these men. And mostly in the fortitude of will that one man Shackleton had.Some enlightening aspects:The men on Elephant Island so desperate for cigarettes they smoked the inside packing of their boots.Shackleton dirty, stinky and having just climbed over impassible mountains knocking on the door of the whaling portmasters door and stating:\\"My Name is Shackleton\\".I highly recommend this white-knuckle, bone crunching, gut-wrenching adventure story that you will not be able to put down and will enthrall you.

This adventure sets the benchmark all other pretenders to the title. Ten stars would be due, but alas, only 5 to give. To think that, through this terrible ordeal, not one person was lost is just plain unbelievable but nevertheless true. The pages dealing with the sailing of the Drake passage make all other sailing/sea adventures seem quite tame. No other book that I have come across can convey the incredible suffering, fortitude and bravery of Shakleton and his men. This book is a must-read for anyone that has any sense of adventure, and if not, they will surely find one within these pages. What truly amazed me is the fact that Shakleton managed to preserve all of the photographic and film records of this adventure. This would at first seem to indicate that the hardships were not as great as at first perceived, but after thinking about this feat, it becomes more, not less, incredible. To have such high adventure actually documented is rare.READ IT !!!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Whew!! is right. Reviewer Mr. Schaefer says it all. I have NEVER stayed up all night reading a book. But I couldn't put this one down. I was exhausted the next day from lack of sleep, but more from trekking with Shackleton and all those amazing men. Whew! Alfred Lansing was brilliant in his ability to combine all the diaries and interviews--to state a story simply and leave the reader breathless."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The foreknowledge of the happy ending cannot dim the majestic horror of this book. Shackleton's men take every imaginable punishment, and are stretched beyond all conceivable limits (a few seconds in the icy cold water of the Antarctic would be enough to finish me off!). They endured the cold and wet for two long Antarctic winters, and somehow made it out alive, aided by little more than their wits. This is a good book to rub in the noses of small children (or employers) who are fussing and whining about tiny trivialities.I don't know why, but back in the U.K., the Shackleton story is not as widely publicized as Robert Falcon Scott's ill-fated voyage. Shackleton appears to have had a better understanding of Antarctic conditions, and his men were at least somewhat better nourished (blubber to keep out the cold, instead of the plum pudding which the barmy Scott fed to his men on one occasion).Buy, read, absorb, and learn!Neil L. Inglis ninglis@erols.com"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Lansing's tale will grab you and never let go, as it did for me 25 years ago in my first reading and every re-reading since. While other accounts of this heroic journey are also compelling, Lansing's version is easily the best. Beyond the gripping descriptions of incessant danger and threats to the human psyche, Lansing lays out the foundation for a Shackleton theory of management:Prepare for contingencies and then prepare again; Value attitude over technical competence in selecting people for work; Emphasize role over rank (the CEO takes the soggiest sleeping bag); Don't be afraid to do nothing, for you can lose your head (and those of your crew) by forcing action to conquer boredom; And (shades of Apollo 13) Failure is not an option.This book alone was enough to launch a decades-long fascination with Shackleton. This book alone inspired me to travel 2,700 miles from Boise to New York just to see the fabulous Endurance exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History. For anyone with an interest in survival sagas, psychology, or management theory and practice, this book should be in anyone's top ten."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"After reading Alexander's book (The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition) I was anxious for more of this adventure so I read this version by Lansing. I was completely absorbed by this wild story for a second time! Lansing provides quite alot of new and different angles on the story. He spends more time on the incredibly harrowing boat journeys and less on the personalities of the various crew members. It reads more like a novel, whereas Alexander's account seems more journalistic. I would highly recommend Lansing's version as a follow-up since Alexander's has the fantastic pictures and map which set the scene."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Thoroughly fasinated while reading of the unbelievable ordeal those men went through.

He doesn't do a good job of sharing an opinion on what it must have been like to be going through all of this. I kept wondering, \\"I wonder what Ambrose could have done with this?\\". The author spends a great deal of time (too much, frankly) detailing their see voyages, but I never felt like he was trying to put me, the reader, on the boat to go along for the ride.The other issue I had was what I considered a rather abrupt ending to the story. There should have been a short bio on each of the characters and what became of their life. Nothing in depth.

The ship's destination was Vashel Bay, Antarctica, where the expedition hoped to start the journey to become the first to cross the continent on foot. Six and a half months and over 95,000 miles later the Endurance was declared hopelessly locked in the pack ice of the Weddell Sea. Thus begins a harrowing tale of survival in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. It is also the story of one of the greatest leaders in modern history, Ernest Shackleton, commander of the ill-fated expedition. Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage chronicles the crew's year and a half long struggle to survive in one of the world's harshest environments and the decisions Shackleton makes that will ultimately decide their fate.Shackleton, a Sailor with England's Royal Navy since the age of sixteen had a great deal of experience at sea and with polar expeditions. He had twice been part of voyages to Antarctica, once getting within 97 miles of the South Pole before he was forced to turn back because of a lack of food. Four years later the South Pole was reached for the first time by Norwegian, Roald Amundsen. This and the successful expedition to the North Pole by American, Robert E. Peary in 1909 led Shackleton to believe that the last great Polar journey that could be made was the crossing of the Antarctica on foot.Once icebound in late February 1915, Shackleton was forced to make a series of tough decisions that he felt while not popular with the crew, would give them the best possible chance of survival. The Endurance lay only 60 miles from its destination, the starting point of the overland expedition and Shackleton could have easily decided to leave the ship and crew behind, taking only his exploring party with him in an attempt to cross the continent. Though this would have been a rough 60 miles to the original starting point, once there, he would have been able to successfully complete the expedition and return to England a national hero. He realized though, that this would leave the remaining men very little chance of survival and that staying together and forsaking glory would give his entire crew the best chance at returning home to England alive.Throughout this astonishing tale Shackleton displays the all hallmarks of a great leader; commitment, forethought, decisiveness, calm and perseverance. Shackleton knows that their situation is dire, but he also knows he must put on a brave face or the men will lose hope. He realizes that he must make tough decisions and not be swayed by popular opinions because he alone will be held accountable for their fate. He knows he must get to know his men but at the same time keep his distance so that he can be objective when the need arises. Shackleton makes firm decisions guided by sound reasoning and follows through.This book should serve not only as a testament to the perseverance of man in the face of great adversity, but as a lesson in leadership fundamentals. It should be required reading for leaders of all levels. Even though very few will ever be forced to endure even a fraction of what the crew of the Endurance did or will ever have to make the life and death decisions that Shackleton had to make, we can all learn a great deal from this epic adventure."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Having undergone the trials of Job, Shackleton emerges as a flawed yet courageous human being. Anyone who loves tales of adventure, exploration or courage should read this book. I was so in tune with the crew's plight that I read the book in early March with the windows open, fan running and only lit with guttering oil lamps. Read it and realize man's weakness in the face of nature. It makes the plight of the folks from 'In to Thin Air' seem miniscule."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"If you like real-life adventure (as I do), then you can't go wrong with this book. &quot;Endurance&quot; is definitely the keyword here - the awe of the reader increases with each obstacle the crew of the doomed ship have to overcome and with the sheer duration of their hardship. The pace of the book is slow to begin with, but builds contantly towards it's nail-biting conclusion. Would today's man (or woman) have survived given the same conditions and equipment? I doubt it."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"If this were a work of fiction, it would be unbelievable.

This really makes the experiences in &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; seem like an easy weekend away. I had to keep reminding myself that all this actually happened and wasn't just an exaggerated piece of fiction. Though I found the entire tale engaging, the pace definitely picks up in the second half of the book. What it made me cognizant of the most was how determination and leadership combined with spectacular luck to produce an amazing tale of survival. Definitely worth putting at the top of your list."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The story of Shackleton and the Endurance makes the Into Thin Air climbers look like a bunch of schoolgirls.

Take care, you may not be able to put this one down until you finish!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The most amazing thing about this book is the upbeat attitude these guys maintain- they're trapped in the ice with no hope of rescue, facing the Antarctic winter without gore-tex or thinsulate, surviving (barely) on seal blubber (and worse), and yet they perform skits for one another and play practical jokes. I wish I could've hung out with those guys!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"If you are an adventurer at heart, Shakleton will make you want to travel again. Some might call him crazy, but I think he understood the purpose of life.

I also recommend a fiction novel set in Antarctica-- ETERNITY BASE by Bob Mayer. He weaves a modern day tale of intrigue around the last continent.

Those two were suitable warm-ups for 'Enduranc'e a book so engrossing as to make one never think the same about warm bed sheets or dry clothing ever again. What unthinkable hardship these men faced! One of the many great highlights are the wonderful journal exerpts that describe in the men's own wonderful and very elegant words the unending harships they faced. Shakleton's leadership, too, is awe inspiring. Fantastic through and through. A unforgettable reading experience."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I could not put this book down. What a horrible existence these men lived. It made me wonder how I would have reacted to such challenges. I was amazed by how happy they were a lot of the time. In the face of such danger, they occasionally felt the warmth of the sun on their faces and realized how wonderful it was to be alive. The author does a great job of recounting the details, but I was left longing for a more personal account. I wondered what the men where thinking and feeling. If you love adventures stories, you will love this book."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"If you enjoy the outdoors or just love to read about man's struggle to overcome adversity, I suggest this book.

Should be (IMHO) in everyone's library."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This has to be one of the greatest of all adventures.

Excellent,descriptive and hard to put down."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"It does. Schackleton and his men just never gave up. It's hard to believe that this story is non-fiction! In the face of much smaller problems, most people throw up their hands and give up. Not the crew members of Endurance. This was one of the most inspiring books that I've read in a long time. Even though the author's writing style drags at times, the story never fails to amaze. A must read!!!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The Endeavor story is a page turner to rival the best mysteries....and it's true! What was lacking was character development. Lansing quotes others as calling Shackleton one of the great leaders of men in history, but then fails to explain how his leadership skills managed to keep his crew together through their remarkable adventures without a single loss of life. Even afer reading about it, it's still hard to believe what Shackleton and his crew accomplished."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"it is hard to believe that Shackleton and his crew had the stamina and mental strength to survive for so long. indeed flawless navigation by Worsley under impossible conditions and the worst seas on the planet in a 22 foot boat to bring help for his men! men like these shall not be seen again. the endeavors were largely ignored due to england's involvement in world war I"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The unbelievable hardship faced by a small group of men on this voyage cannot be described. Only a handful of the crew had ever faced a polar expedition. They all took a a chance on an adventure that, by all rights, they should never have survived. A triumph of will."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Not only is this an all-time great adventure story, but Alfred Lansing does a masterful job of being true to the facts while also bringing out the suspense of a gripping story. I couldn't imagine living ONE DAY under those conditions... yet for months and months, just when you thought it can't get worse, it does! But it's not depressing at all. In fact, it's a testament to human's adaptability and optimism. Shackleton's leadership is inspiring. A real page-turner!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Although I have the previous edition of the book without the maps and illustrations, I would highly recommend this book to anyone. It is much more than just a tale of bravery, courage and hope. Anyone who knows of Shackleton's voyage realizes that it is one of the most incredible survival stories of all time. This book brings the story to life because it is a literary gem. The author is able to paint real characters with feeling and depth because he had access to diaries and interviews with 10 of the survivors. (The book was originally written in 1959.) I rarely have the treat to read such beautiful prose. Please buy this book. I promise you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The book gives a gripping account of Shackleton's antartic expedition.

A fantastic story of determination and triumph."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"An incredible adventure is documented in this book. I'm surprised to find that the original book was published in 1956 and a movie has not come from it. The only criticism I have is that the book was too short. Through the writing in this book it seemed the crew never gave up. Endurance seems the perfect name. With today's movie special effects technology, people would come in droves to see this story on the big screen."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is the most exciting and incredible story I have ever read. It tells the story of the kind of leadership we may never see again. Against the most incredible obstacles, this crew fought for their survival.

The story of the Endurance and her crew is one of man's indomitable will to survive.The story of Ernest Shackleton and the crew of the Endurance is a remarkable tale of courage in the face of tremendous obstacles. With a bare minimum of supplies, 28 men managed to survive nearly 20 months of ice, freezing weather, storms and near starvation.This is a must read book for anyone interested in the history of exploration - or human courage!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Lansing draws from the diaries the E.H. Shackleton and the crew of the Endurance to re-tell the story of the ill-fated Trans-Antartic Expedition. The harrowing story of courage and determination under almost unimaginable conditions both inspired and humbled me. Lansing does an admirable job of describing the events of the journey from the abandonement of the Endurance and the long polar nights on the ice floes to Shackleton's mad dash across the 10,000 foot peaks of South Georgia.I am impressed that Lansing exhibited restraint in not speculating unduly upon the thought of the men without using their accounts.The book is outstanding. I was afraid for, and inspire by these great men and felt Shackleton's triumph as he finally returned to South Georgia."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This recollection of an &quot;incredible jurney&quot; is an unbelievable retelling of the perilous jurney to the south pole by the Endurance as told by Sir Alfred Lansing. He has managed to piece together the story of the greatest expiditions since Columbus left Portugal in 1492. This book is perfect for the person who explorers The Patagonias of South America to the person who explores the internet. Easily the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I have not quite finished reading this book but expect to do so shortly.In the past I have read \\"The Worst Journey in the World\\" by Apseley Cherry-Garrard which details Scotts Expedition to the South Pole plus a mid winter trek to obtain eggs from the Emperor Penguins.In my opinion this book does not rate as highly as the one referred to above but it certainly has some heart stopping moments.A good read and one I would recommend."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"\\"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage\\" makes you hold your breath from beginning to end.

Reading the book for the first time several years ago pompted us to do a trip to Antarctia. The story of how all members of the expedition lived on ice flows for several months and through the Antarctic winter is one of the best stories of courage and bravery ever told."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This riveting story of Shackleton's voyage and shipwreck in the Antarctic is a testament to humankind's ability to survive disaster when led by a man with an iron will and unbelievable courage. The obstacles that the crew faced and overcame were awe inspiring and opened my eyes to the vastness, beauty and desolation of the Antarctic continent. With no hope for rescue from outside, Shackleton decides to make a small lifeboat voyage across the Strait of Magellan to a whaling station to get help for his crew. The story of that voyage and the unbelievable obstacles that he and five of his men faced and overcame will make any small boat sailor shake his head in wonder.The book is extremely well written and is based upon the diaries and records from the crew and news articles of the day. It includes references and photos which lend to it's authenticity."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Great stuff one of the best adventure storys i have ever read,recomend it to all lovers of nonfiction &survival."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I was nothing short of blown away by this book. It gives new meaning to the word \\"incredible\\" - or rather, makes one remember the real meaning of the word, in that you simply cannot credit the truth of this amazing story. I challenge anyone to finish this tale of survival and yes, endurance, and not look at his own life with a new sense of wonder and gratitude. You're left with the conviction that anything IS possible, after all. Even if you think you \\"aren't interested in the subject matter\\", trust me, you will be once you start reading and are soon hooked. Subject matter be damned, this is at its core about the strength and perseverance of the human spirit. One of the best books i have ever read, it will stay with me forever."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I felt like my heart was frozen in place as I read this book. In fact, I think I've hung my head a little lower with shame this week as I have spent my evenings reading this story, reminding myself that I'm simply not made of the same stuff Shackelton and is crew were.Their story is truly unbelievable. The way Lansing told the story, it seems like they should have perished a dozen times over. Yet a story like this could have been easily ruined by a lesser author. Lansing was up to the task. I marveled at the author's canny ability to describe the most nondescript details of such a monotonous existence and never run out of language. These details gave believability such a remarkable story. Left out, the story would have been too fast and overstated. Over-described and the details would have seemed glamorous or unbelievable.If I had any complaint about the book, and I'm whispering now, it would be that perhaps the author could have done more to develop the individual characters and their personalities a little more. I was especially disappointed that the story didn't focus as much on the intriguing Shackleton character as the title and opening pages led me to believe. I do feel as though I picked up a few lessons on leadership, such as when it is wise to keep my own counsel, but this story was driven by the facts and events. I found myself wishing to know more of what these men were made of. I can quickly forgive Lansing for the absence of these observations as the author was the beneficiary of other authors's research. The dried out journals of the crew may have lacked the content for such musings.This is a superb book that I hope is widely read. I've already loaned out my copy!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read, A remarkable feat to survive this ordeal. Through strength and reselience these men lived to tell this uplifting and extordinary story. Could not put this book down."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"ENDURANCE: SHACKLETON'S INCREDIBLE VOYAGE is a classic man-vs.-nature tale of heroism, endurance, struggle, and survival in the face of an unending series of seemingly insurmountable adversities. It tells the remarkable story of the Ernest Shackleton-led Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, launched in late-1914 with the objective of achieving history's first overland crossing of the Antarctic continent. In January 1915, Shackleton's ship, named the \\"Endurance\\" after the Shackleton family motto (\\"fortitudine vincimus\\") and presaging the extreme trial that was to come, became trapped in a vast sea of pack ice off the coast of Antarctica. After drifting with the floes for ten months, the Endurance was crushed under the intense pressure of the ice and sunk, leaving Shackleton and his 27 team members stranded in the planet's most frigid, inhospitable environment, on its most perilous seas, thousands of miles from civilization's nearest outpost, with limited, ever-dwindling supplies, no shelter, no modern communications technology, and three small, rickety lifeboats. Their survival depended solely on themselves, and against desperate, almost impossible odds, they were able to triumph, without the loss of a single life, through sheer indomitable will.Drawing on both the personal diaries of crew members and extensive firsthand interviews, Lansing crafts a suspenseful, page-turning chronicle of the expedition's two-year ordeal. Lansing frequently quotes from the diaries, which allows him to convey the men's innermost thoughts at any given moment in their journey without venturing into the realm of the speculative, yet his use of the quotes is judicious enough that he avoids encumbering the narrative. His writing style is fluid and he exhibits one of the most refreshing qualities for a nonfiction writer - restraint. Rather than overloading his prose with hyperbole, his approach is to mainly let the facts speak for themselves, eschewing commentary and respecting readers enough to allow them to form the unavoidable conclusions on their own. The result is an account which speaks with impeccable credibility while sacrificing nothing in the way of readability or enjoyability.Only two very minor criticisms warrant noting. One is that the first 30 or 40 pages start a little slow before the story settles in and becomes utterly gripping. The other is that it ends rather abruptly and with no epilogue to tell of what became of the men after the expedition.In sum, ENDURANCE is an amazing and inspiring story, expertly told by a talented writer, about what men are truly capable of when pushed by nature to their physical and mental limits. Upon reading this book, one may well be shamed into never complaining again about trifling everyday inconveniences.Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"When you start this read it's difficult to stop.

They never were able to start their overland journey as they spent two years trapped in pack ice and battling the Antarctic seas.Despite losing their ship, The Endurance, to the pack ice, Shackleton successfully led his men to safety. Battling heave pack ice, unfavorable weather, and formidable seas, Shackleton finally reached help two years after they had started their journey. Even more incredible is the fact that not a single crew member was lost. Supplementing their food stores with penguins and seals, the crew stayed alive.

And I seriously doubt if I would enjoy it nearly as much if it was somehow re-issued in color. As I read this book, I saw the pictures in black and white, which is my personal testament to how well the account of the diaries were interpreted and written by the author. The incredibly harsh and hopeless conditions this group of men faced was beautifully colored in (in black and white), and was matched only by the astounding courage mustered up by one and all, that was requisite for the eventual outcome."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Gripping, emotional, almost unbelievable. I read the kindle version and the pictures came through great, but the map on the fronts piece was too small to be readable. I went to the internet,googled and printed out a better map so I could follow Shackleton's journey (as I am totally unfamiliar with Antarctic geography).What these explorers went through in the early 20th century boggles the mind. Today we have gortex fabrics, weatherproof clothing, better shelters, better food preservation.... They had canvas, oilskin, felt boots and seal blubber. Amazing, absolutely amazing.For a rousing adventure of exploration, survival, human emotions, leadership, and endurance - read this book !"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"A solid telling of Team Shackleton's survival in the South Polar regions.

What is amazing about Lansing's writing is that he includes terrific detail but it is absolutely NEVER boring. The time on the ship, the ice floes, the open boats, the islands are all beautifully described so that you have a detailed sense of the setting and can appreciate the gargantuan task that layed before these men. The film by Branagh doesn't even remotely come close to how amazing and exciting this story is.

One ofthe most memorable is the scene in which one of the menis cross country skiing on the huge ice float on which themen have been stranded for months, when a 12-foot-longsea leopard pops up out of a hole in the ice and beginspursuit. This huge beast moves so quickly thatthe skier -- one of the fastest in the whole group -- isbarely fast enough to out run it. Add to thisadventure, a lack of food, the constant threat of drowning,bitter cold, and men living for days in nearly freezing, knee-deepwater, kept alive only by sheer will, and you begin to get asense of what the story of this three-year journey is all about.The next time you have a cold, send out for tissues, Nyquil,and Endurance,and you'll be glad you got sick!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"After turning over the last leaf of Lansing's riveting account, I was compelled to drop everything I was doing and get on a ship headed to South Georgia, where I humbly paid my respects at Sir Ernest Shackleton's idyllic resting place right on the shores of Grytviken Harbor.This remote island figures prominently in a story that gives revitalized meaning to words like &quot;adventure&quot;, &quot;hardship&quot;, &quot;soul&quot;, and of course &quot;endurance&quot;. From the book's very first proclamation (&quot;The story you are about to read is true&quot;) to its final implication (&quot;These were men!&quot;), Lansing engages the reader with successively awe-inspiring and head-shaking tales, anecdotes and journal quotes.Lansing's narrative is also more engaging than personal accounts written by the protagonists themselves (Shackleton's &quot;South&quot; and Worsley's &quot;Shackleton's Boat Journey&quot;) because their very acts of heroism are modestly downplayed in the first person. Lansing holds nothing back in his respectful tribute.The only drawback is a lack of illustrations and maps."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"If you read one book in your life make it this book. This is one of the best balanced books that I have ever read. Simply put the story is about Shackleton's attempt to be the first person to cross the Antarctic continent by passing streight across the South Pole. The story talks about everything from the planning of this expadition to the official ending of the project. What these men faced inbetween could have never been planned for, so they needed to depend on their smarts and their shear will to survive. Never before have I heard of men doing so much with so little. The story is truely inspirational, and Lansing tells it well. The book is full of beautiful photos taken during the expedition, so it is easy to envision the environment that these men were subjected to. The photography makes the book well worth it by itself, but the story makes the book a treasure. I highly recomend this book to anyone that can read."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Alfred Lansing's Endurance: Shackelton's Incredible Voyage in on par with timeless classics such as Out of Africa and West with the Night in its storytelling, level of adventure, sense of place and time, emotional content...

As was the practice at the time students exchanged Christmas gifts prior to the holiday vacation. I received a gift from my classmate John Marceline. It was a blue covered, hard bound text titled Endurance by Alfred Lansing. At first I was disappointed to have received a book for a Christmas gift. Today I look at that gift as one of the most important gifts I have received in my life. I have read that very book countless times. Endurance has enriched my life with visions of beauty, joy, strength and utter desperation. Today as an eighth grade science teacher on Martha's Vineyard my students' lives are enriched by the spirit of Endurance. Endurance is required reading for my students. My students learn, as I did, the courage and power of Endurance"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I read this book when it was first published in 1959, the memory of it has stayed with me since and I was determined that one day I would find another copy of it. Finally through Amazon.com I found it.The second reading 38 years later was no disappointment!The desire of man to survive, coupled with the selfless devotion of Shackelton to his men,is so vividly portrayed by Lansing that you feel Shackelton's burdens and his compassion.Shortly after starting the book you will find your view of your daily trials and tribulations lightening dramatically."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is a great book. It really started to pickup after the first 100 pages. When I was reading this book from the beginning, it was dull and uninteresting. All they were doing was staying on the ship and talking about all their provisions and the things that they would need to survive. Once the Endurance sank, and they got on the ice, the story picked up pace. They floated on the ice for quite a while until it broke up. Shackelton was a great decsion maker, because he knew exactly when to launch the boats. The most exciting part was when the open boat journey from Elphant island to South Georgia was taken. I thought that all the men left behind on Elephant Island would die through the winter, but they didn't. Shackelton came back for them and it was all over. I felt that the story ending was incomplete. Alfred Lansing Could&quot;ve told us more about what happened. I always read fiction books because I like them better, but this was one of the best non-fiction books thatI had read."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I found it on Amazon by chance and bought it based on the great reviews. Now I wouldn't be without it.When it turned up I must say, I was expecting something a little thicker. Having read about Mawson's Expedition in &quot;Home of the Blizzard&quot; my first thoughts were - where's the rest of the book.Although it is comparatively lightweight, Lansing provides a well written account of Shackleton's leadership and the courage of his men.It's an uplifting story of survival against impossible odds.If it were fiction you'd say it was unbelievable. Knowing that it actually it happened is awe inspiring.It is an easy book to read, (lasted barely more than a night)but POW what a story. My copy is now dog-eared and long gone, doing the rounds of the office.One word of advice though, buy two copies because once you've read it, you'll want to share it around."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"First, let me suggest that if you want to buy this book, do a search for ISBN 0786708425. Other reviewers have commented that the edition I'm reviewing has some editing errors and a forward that might offend some. The 0786708425 edition doesn't have either problem.When you do a search for 0786708425 in Amazon, it brings up the cover of the book I read, which is a slightly different cover than the one for this review. Interestingly, that cover -- for the ISBN I'm recommending -- is not visible when we do a search for Endurance in Amazon. And is why I'm putting my review here instead of there, where no one could find it.That said, what more can I offer that the other 377 5-star reviews haven't said. You already know this is a terrific book.In my opinion, it's the best retelling of all. I haven't read all the other books, but I just can't imagine this tale being told any better than by Mr Lansing.After I read Lansing's book, I immediately started The Endurance by Caroline Alexander. She was a key element in the documentary that sparked my interest in the adventure, and for which I'm grateful, but her book is not the one you should read.Alexander's book is like reading the box score of a game. A dry recitation of the facts. The best part of her book is at the end, where she describes the subsequent lives of each of the men. One unfortunate soul died just months later on the battlefields of WW I. Another went on to great fame and professional success. Most lived long and fruitful lives. That was good to learn.But if Alexander's book does not grab you, Lansing's book will not let you go. He was a masterful writer. His book has fewer photos than Alexander's, but gives us a more detailed picture of daily life and the adventure's major events. We know how the story ends, but we can't wait to hear about it. Lansing brings us there with Shackleton and his men.I've since bought the first edition of the hard cover Lansing book, where it sits in the Deserted Island Books section of my home library. I've also sent my son, in the Navy Seabees, a copy.I wish I had read this book as a youth. No physical discomfort in my life has been anywhere close to what Shackleton and his men endured. I've always tried to not be a complainer, but from now on, I won't even think it, much less voice it, when I'm too hot, too cold, too tired, too hungry. Whatever my discomfort, it won't begin to compare to The Endurance.An inspiring story, wonderfully told."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is a wonderful tale of survival. Shackelton is an inspiring leader and the crew who traveled with him to the ends of the world are equally heroic. I would compare this favorably to The Bounty (also excellent) and other great adventure stories. It's a story of a time when men dared to be great, and is truly inspiring. The photographs taken by the ship's photographer are wonderful visuals to accompany this great story. (photos are a bit harder on Kindle, but still manageable.) Definitely recommend to those who love a good adventure/survival story."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This account of Shackelton's expedition to Antarctic is a read like no other. I could not put this book down,nor could I believe the constitution each person on the crew had to continue forth under such insurmountable odds. The author, Lansing has provided a compelling book. His research of events are smoothly seamed together captivating the reader. Even if ones interest usually doesn't lean toward the topic of explorer, I promise you this book will consume you. Its message is especially good for any of us who may be feeling \\"overwhelmed\\" by what our lives are tossing our way... you will be giving thanks at the comforts you have by comparison to this expeditions minimal articles to provide their continued existence. As another reviewer mentioned, buy the hard or soft-cover not paperback version as these include all of Hurley's photographs which are essential to this book-seeing is believing and you won't believe what this photographer captured. Enjoy, you will share the events of this book over and over with many."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Alfred Lansing wrote this in 1959, but its popularity has been revived recently when PBS broadcast a documentary on the book. It tells the story of how Ernest Shackleton led a crew of 27 on an exploratory expedition to the South Pole in 1914. It reminds me of Roosevelt exploring the River of Doubt, a book I reviewed at hungerisgood.blogspot.com.My recommendation is that you read this book in the summer, outside in a hammock, drinking lemonade, with the warm breeze blowing your hair. After all, Shackleton and his men are experiencing extreme, bitter cold, and this book has the capacity to make you feel cold even on a hot day. However, if you want to get the full experience, go to a walk-in cooler at someplace like Costco, and read it in short sleeves.You won't be able to put this book down, so don't start it until you are sure you won't compromise your work or family obligations. I suggest you wait until you get influenza, or perhaps take a trip to Mexico. Whatever you do, don't read it while you have influenza in Mexico. That would be a little over the top.My favorite part was their encounter with a rogue wave. The worst part was so bad that I can't discuss it. The best news is that Shackleton brought all his men home alive.This book is an excellent study of leadership. Shackleton had an uncanny ability to know the strengths and weaknesses of his men. He was able to control the troublemakers, and that is no small feat when you are crowded in total darkness for months at a time in the bottom of a wooden ship. Remember, they hadn't invented antiperspirants yet.Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Normally, a true account of an antarctic expedition in 1915 would not be at the top of my reading list, but I was intrigued after hearing a friend discussing Ernest Shackleton one night.I found this to be an extremely interesting and well written account of a group of British explorers lead by Shackleton. The hardships that they face and the way they keep going is unbelievable. You will keep asking yourself if this story could possibly by true! All I could think while reading this book was that I will never complain about anything again!If you want an exciting, well written book that reads almost like a novel, and will most likely stay with you for life, then check this one out. Even if you are not a huge fan of adventure, I think you will find a lot to like about this book."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Alfred Lansing's book, Endurance, dramatically details the 1914 expedition to the Antarctic led by Sir Ernest Shackleton. Although a non-fiction book, Lansing manages to make it read like a thriller, adventure. He wrote his story using first person accounts, interviews of survivors, journal entries, etc. While sometimes history can be a bit dry, this novel truly makes you feel a part of the adventure and reads very quickly. Ernest Shackleton's leadership abilities ensure not only the survival of the crew, but demonstrate his character as a man. Crew and officers were treated alike and shared in the duties of survival. Order was maintained and his personality and command of the situation enabled the group to survive what could have been a disaster."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"It is amazing how these men, in a spirit of cooperation, never gave up hope and continued on, enduring one horrible condition after another. Endurance, accurately describes the name of the boat, the book and all it took for those that survived."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"An amazing story of leadership, hardship and survival. I can't believe what that team went through and survived. Enthralling read."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is derived from the diary entries of the 27 British men who were stranded in Antartica for 2 years (!) just before World War I, and miraculously survived, with only a few frost-bitten toes. Incredibly, they had a photographer on board who kept a meticulous record on film of what happened, and his pictures are included in the book. You will not believe that human beings are capable of this level of endurance and courage."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"'Endurance The Greatest Adventure Story Ever Told' exceeded all my expectations for an exciting white-knuckle read. The author does an excellent job of drawing the reader into the scene,so that you feel the cold,wet and hunger,and the terror of being hunted by a huge leopard seal[you may remember the one in the film -Eight Below].Eight Below (Full Screen Edition)These men are outstanding how they were able to keep their morale so high,despite the circumstances.The photos were also wonderful, and I greatly appreciated the fact that although this was a book about seamen,it avoided the use of profanity,ecept for just a few isolated instances,which made it a nice inoffensive read.This is a book that once read will not be easily forgotten.Highly recommended for fans of adventure/survival stories.I read my library's copy."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Hands down, the best book I've read in a long time. A great lesson on survival and the human capacity to adapt and transform from within."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is one of those stories everyone should read. This is a story of survival, camaraderie, suffering and hope. Mr. Lansing has used primary materials as much as possible to give you the feeling that you are with the men in that frozen landscape."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I seem to gravitate toward survival-type stories (I'm a fan of Jon Krakauer's Into the Wild and Into Thin Air), so I decided to buy this when I saw it on Amazon's top 100 pick list. As it happened, I was home sick when the book arrived, and I wound up reading it in just two days.It was an engrossing read. Although I already knew the basic storyline and how things end, that didn't detract from my enjoyment as I went along. What struck me is that the author has a very low-key writing style, so where someone else might get melodramatic with all the trials and challenges Shackleton's crew confronts, you are left to form your own conclusions, unclouded by hysteria or over-excitement when they have to abandon ship when it runs aground on ice, for instance.I also appreciated that writing style when I unexpectedly came across references to seal clubbing and killing of the Huskies. They were both necessary to the group's survival, but being an animal lover, I don't usually subject myself to reading that kind of thing.There is a lot of discussion of ice in this book. How water freezes, contracts and expands. It's a central part of the book. You'll walk away having new-found respect for the unforgiving predominance of Nature in one of the world's last untamed places.The book will also give you a fresh appreciation for the lengths Man will go to in order to survive. The group's survival was in large part due to the tenacity and leadership abilities of Shackleton himself, when psychological factors were as important as physical challenges in such an unforgiving environment.I would have been very interested if the author had added details in an epilogue telling us, briefly, of what became of Shackleton and the others after they were rescued. Did Shackleton lead any more expeditions? did he settle down to a more conventional life? What about the others? After surviving an ordeal like this, it would be interesting to know to what purpose the men devoted the rest of their lives."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I read this many years ago before my first trip to antarctica...I couldn't believe this actually happened!! It made me see the frozen continent with different eyes. I'm reading it now for my book club and it hasn't lost its wonder. I suggest everyone take this trip from their sofa. Great Read"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This book keeps me coming back for more. I'm amazed at what these people were able to endure! The story helps me to find strength to continue when I feel like quitting."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is an account of survival in a wilderness beyond most of our imaginings. It's at turns heart-breaking, heartening, terrifying, and triumphant. This is a true adventure tale."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Before reading, get a good map marked with longitude and latitude. Then just enjoy and prepare to be amazed. Wickwire, Krakauer, Whittaker, and Messner look like creampuffs compared to the least strong (weak certainly can't be used to describe any of them) members of the expedition."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The first 40 pages seem drab, but then the story takes off, and I never wanted to put the book down! Yet the first 40 pages are essential to understanding the type of man that Shackleton was, why his men had such incredible devotion to him. They trusted each and every decision Shackleton made, ultimately saving their lives. It is succinctly written, and often quite witty. It's the best true-life adventure I've ever read!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The first time I read this book, I couldn't put it down. For months afterward I felt empowered to face any challenge (especially in MY ordinary life!). Lansing does a fantastic job of combining all his research into a smooth flowing account of the most fantastic survival epic of all time. 28 men left standing on a piece of floating ice in the antarctic sea and how they walked, floated, rowed, sailed, ate, thought, interacted, and survived on their own power and endurance...simply outstanding."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Probably the best book on polar exploration and the human hardship which goes along. Shackleton may have never reached the South Pole but I believe the story presented in Lansings' book is unparalleled in human hardship and achievement. Truly incredible!!!!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I first read Endurance in 1968, when I was a teen. It was most impressive then, and even more so to me now. Truly an inspirational story, one that is almost beyond belief. These fellows lend a new meaning to the phrase &quot; tough guys&quot;. Not just physically, but mentally."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This book left me still and slack-jawed in amazement. The story of the Shackleton Expedition's survival through ice, hunger, wind and waves is the paradigm of human triumph against all odds. This book should be required reading in the schools. My only complaint is the lack of a good map."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Incredible voyage does not begin to cut the surface of this amazing story. It is amazing that more people don't know about this. no wonder there is a surge in &quot;shackelton-theory&quot; of management. read this book at your peril...you will find yourself sucked in!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"And I thought it was hard to walk through ten miles of snow to school.Could not get over how tough and brave these men were.There are many things to learn from this book."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Excellent narration by Lansing, although pictures and drawings and some maps could have made the book even better. I savored every word!!!!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"A must for anyone who, like myself, is addicted to reading accounts of human endurance and survivial."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The most amazing thing about Lansing's account of Shackleton's ill-fated voyage to Antarctica is that it really happened. Had someone manufactured this story, it would not be believable. To have endured the unimaginable hardships that Shackleton and his crew faced seems impossible. The fact that Shackleton returned each crew member alive is utterly incomprehensible. Lansing's account of the adventure is gripping, accurate and heart-stopping."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I approached this book as another boring assignment, but I soon was pleasantly surprised. This story is truly amazing. These men, accomplishing impossible feat after impossible feat, leave me inspired."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I too cried when Shackleton shambles up to the manager's office. My God! What MEN!! I humbly stand in awe of them. This is a GREAT book!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"How can 28 men survive being trapped on an ice floe below the Arctic Circle? No one can begin to believe how they made it through this ordeal until reading Alfred Lansing's 1959 chronicle. Mr Lansing has written in a very fluid and descriptive manner. He allows readers to feel the sub-zero winds, the icy ocean spray and see the endless expanse of ice. But only for a little bit because you know you really aren't there. And these men endured this for...how many months? You wouldn't believe it; this book simply must be read to appreciate what man can endure when they must."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I hardly put this book down. I had read small parts of Shakleton's voyage before, but I wasn't ready for the overwhelming content of the expedition and its sense of drama. As a previous reader suggested, those who didn't give at least give 4 stars here, aren't cut out for this type of adventure, and obviously don't dream of expanding their personal limits. Stay in your armchair."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"What an adventure. The story is strong so Alfred Lansing had good subject matter. But, what he was able to accomplish was to write a great book that is hard to put down. The story, characters, and writing in &quot;Endurance&quot; is wonderful. You'll never forget these men or this story."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This was a great book to read. I sat up all night and ended up leaving work early to come home and finish the book. It is truly amazing what a person can do when they are tapped out and really extend themselves.I would have to rate this as one of the all time best adventure stories. Definately a good read."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"What a fantastic story - made all the more incredible by the fact that it is true.The only thing the book lacks is a map to support the magnitude of the achievements within it."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":". . .though I longed to see maps of the exploration, maps, definition of terms. Perhaps other books on the subject might supply that information. There is an incredible exhibition called &quot;The Endurance,&quot; at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City through October 11, 1999, which includes Frank Hurley's photographs and actual film footage of the ship, men, and dogs - as well as the original 22 ft. lifeboat, the &quot;James Caird.&quot; Reading this book (which was actually recommended by Amazon.com) AND seeing this exhibition made a thrilling experience for me. Finally at the end of our century, there is recognition with appropriate tributes to the accomplishments of those brave men - a timeless tale, indeed!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The most incredible survival story of all time. Not only a terrifying adventure, but also a stunning trubute to the endurance of the human spirit.

I started reading it Friday night when I got home from work, and finished it about 4am Saturday morning, starting out with a beer or two, and finishing with coffee and hot chocolate (couldn't do the powdered milk). If there was ever a book that would inspire schoolkids and executives alike, it would be this one. Leadership, teamwork, perserverence, positive attitude, etc. What is most incredible is the time in which this adventure occured and the fact that survival in their incredible conditions was achieved. Like many reviewers, I would love to see a movie made from this book, with the same budget and attention to detail as &quot;Titanic&quot;.

This is, quite simply, one of the greatest true adventure stories ever written.

Get it, read it, pass it on."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"As I read Endurance, I searched for a point a morale in the book, I was very disappointed because there wasn't one.Endurance was some what like Robinson Crusoe, full of useless details. Do I seem like one who would care how many seals you killed? The book could have been shortned by a lot if the details were removed. Don't get me wrong some parts of the book did provide for some good supspense, ie would they make it to South Georgia?,but I just didn't enjoy it.Another problem with the book was the point of view the book was written in, Who was the narrator? You could never tell who was talking, and the diary exerpts just simply needed to be removed."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"No doubt the voyage was INCREDIBLE, however the author lacked so much discription and ACTION in the writing, that I have not been able to finish the book.

Gratifying, I found as the last paragraph of chapter ten in Shackleton's book SOUTH, THE STORY OF SHACKLETON'S LAST EXPEDITION this wonderful closing:When I look back at those days I have no doubt that Providence guided us, not only across those snow-fields, but across the storm-white sea that separated Elephant Island from our landing-place on South Georgia. I know that during that long and racking march of thirty-six hours over the unnamed mountains and glaciers of South Georgia it seemed to me often that we were four, not three. I said nothing to my companions on the point, but afterwards Worsley said to me, \\"Boss, I had a curious feeling on the march that there was another person with us.\\" Crean confessed to the same idea. One feels \\"the dearth of human words, the roughness of mortal speech\\" in trying to describe things intangible, but a record of our journeys would be incomplete without a reference to a subject very near to our hearts."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"\\"ENDURANCE\\", what a tale.

He is not always right, many times he is just absolutely wrong. But his courage is simply breathtaking.You must know many British famous sentences as those: \\"I am going out and will be for some time\\" or \\"Dr Livingstone, I presume\\".Shackleton probably did not utter so famous remark.

It is not just a book a man would enjoy even though it seems more like a mans book. Once you start you can not put this one down!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is, bar none, one of the best adventure stories ever lived. You will be amazed when you start reading this story and will find it hard to put down. Being a military man I often finding myself in rather cold, wet and miserable conditions. After reading this story, whenever I feel sorry for myself, I think of Shackelton and his men and how they survived what must of been the most harrowing ordeals ever recorded. Highly recommended. Bought it for my father-in-law last Christmas and he was equally enthralled with the story."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Tremendous page-turner. I enjoyed this book immensely, yet was turned off by the off-base foreword and afterword by Dr. James Dobson. It seems he's adapted Lansing's amazing account to suit his own needs, and in the process, edited the content of the story for the &quot;Christian&quot; audience. I strongly urge that you read this book, but stick to the Lansing paperback rather than the doctored Dobson version. To Dobson's credit, however, the included map is helpful and adds to the reading experience."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"The word &quot;incredible&quot; in the title is no exaggeration. If this were a work of fiction, one criticism would be that it was unbelievable. The fact that this book is true--based on interviews and diaries of the actual crew members--makes it all the more powerful and engrossing. Well written. Highly recommended. If you like this book, also check out Caroline Alexander's book with photographs by the expedition photographer (Hurley)."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Makes fascinating reading. The author catches your attention from the very start. The adventure is breathtaking. Incredible endurance by men under extreme conditions for two years.

Shackleton's leadership skills helped the entire crew to overcome seemingly impossible circumstances to achieve the end goal. This book chronicles a life lesson for all of us to know and understand.

It's hands down the best retelling of a survivor tale that I've read. The author just tells the story in such a simple and yet compelling way. The details that are included are incredible. And the story is totally miraculous. I recommend this book to anyone who likes history or tales of courage/adventure. I was blown away by Shackletons (and his men's) accomplishment in the face of what was should have been sure death."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"There's not much to add to the almost 400 reviews preceding-other than another five stars.Working almost exclusively with a palette of black, white, gray and blue, Lansing manages to craft a vivid account of the Imperial Trans Antarctic Expedition of 1914. As others have mentioned, this story, as interpreted by Lansing, is so engrossing you won't want to put the book down. (Even after a second or third time!) It's also an interesting perspective on leadership under the most dismal conditions that can be imagined.A tidbit from one of the one star reviews that deserves mention: there was more than one publisher for the paperback versions of this book; Carroll & Graf, and Tyndale. As I understand, the Carroll & Graf edition contains the familiar secular foreword followed by Lansing's original text. The Tyndale edition has a Christian themed foreword from James C. Dobson, followed by Lansing's text edited for a Christian audience. IF this bothers you, make sure you're getting the Carroll & Graf version! (Thanks, Joel Abrams, for that information.)"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Utterly astonishing book, that builds and builds, leaving the reader in near disbelief at the display of sheer will-power, persistence---and yes, endurance--of all these heroic survivors. After reading this, I went and read the several negative reviews here, and while at first I was puzzled and of a polar-opposite (pun intended) opinion, I quickly came to see how worthless said reviews are, when considering the sources, with their concomitant, atrocious grammar and spelling. One can only conclude that such reviewers, being more familiar with the \\"airport fiction\\" genre, are persons unfamiliar with the reading of history, true-life narratives, or maybe even of reading itself. Seriously, even a fictionalized account could hardly have been more gripping, especially toward the mid-point of the book and onward. The fact that this was real makes the book all the more fascinating and riveting.Indeed, the book does not begin by suddenly plunging the reader into break-neck-pace action. Rather, there is a deliciously slow build-up---the descriptions of the preparations made for the journey ahead, and of the men and their individual temperament and personalities----which became more fleshed-out as their individual contributions toward survival was told. Yes, the first 1/3 of the book is low on pure action and adventure, since basically the men are merely camping (on an ice flow probably the size of a city), and the book narrates day-to-day life on the flow. But this is indispensable in fleshing-out the personalities of the characters, and in bonding the reader to these men; we truly care about them, as things get dangerously more dicey as the books proceeds.Once the ice flow breaks-up, and the men take to the boats, there is no end to the excitement and exhilaration in reading this book. The reader will be amazed at how, right to the very end, fate seems to erect constant, seemingly insurmountable, barriers and impediments to their ingenious and courageous efforts at self-preservation.One small criticism of the book: I wish there was a follow-up, prologue chapter, describing what happened to the men following their rescue---maybe a \\"where they are now\\" summary.Again, I can't, for the life of me, understand how someone could give this a poor rating, unless, as I stated, one concludes such reviewers are ignorant and inexperienced practitioners of the reading and historical arts (again, you be the judge, after noting their misspellings and grammar).Anyway, I will probably get this in hardcover, if available, as it is a worthy addition to my permanent library collection. And I will likely seek out more books and information on the subject."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I agree with other reviewers that this is the best of the Endurance books, but there is one feature I especially liked. Lansing routinely describe weather conditions- temperature and wind speed. This background makes their survival even more amazing when you consider routine temperatures well below 0 degrees with winds 50 mph and above."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Before reading this book I had no idea who Shackleton was and what he accomplished during this extraordinary journey. With this book, I was treated to a saga of extraordinary courage, optimism and leadership. It doesn't matter who you are and what you do for a living, this is book is a required reading for every human being. It shows you what can be accomplished with optimism and great teamwork and leadership. Now when I begin to run out of steam while running on treadmill, I think of this book and Shackleton and that helps me go much much more distance. Even after a five mile run on the treadmill (which is a big deal for me), I feel so humbled when I think of this book. Very intriguing, adventurous.

Nicely told and crisply written. Not a lot of imagination or creativity in the narrative. Bland but extremely interesting."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"An awesome read; the story is fantastic, and it's well written. I'll skip the details because I'm sure someone in the ~450 prior reviews covered that. The first half is a bit slow, relatively, in comparison to what happens once the Endurance sinks. My only complaint is they didn't include more photographs. I have the special Life magazine \\"greatest adventures of all time\\" and it includes many fantastic pics not included in the paperback. This one is a must read."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Wow. What a truly amazing story. As cliched as it is to say so, this really is one of those stories that if it were a piece of fiction written by a Hollywood studio you would simply laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. I was so astounded that I spent several hours researching to find something that would discredit the facts presented. But no, what was written is as it occurred and if you take the time to read it you will be motivated indeed by the ability of the human will to survive.I am sure there are individual tales of endurance to match this but i have yet to read anything so remarkable and also so expertly written about a group of people fighting for their very existence.The events in this book occurred a little under 100 years ago. In some ways it seems very close to us today but ultimately it could have happened a thousand years ago given the ingenuity and skill of the men involved. I doubt with modern technology today you'd be lucky enough to get a crew together with enough skill in seamanship, navigation, carpentry, boat-building, hunting etc. to survive such an event.I found myself unable to tear myself away from the book, screaming in my head at the men to win the day. Knowing the history and therefore the outcome in no way detracted from the story thanks to the brilliant writing.Enough has already been said about the story so I'll leave this with just my admiration for the Author and the men of the Endurance.A must read."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"If you are checking out this book then you are quite probably already somewhat familiar with the story of Shackleton. Setting sail from England in August 1914 and then proceeding to Antarctica the ship became marooned in a sea of ice in January 1915 and was held fast for ten months until finally being crushed by the pack ice. The crew then proceeded to eke out an existence on the ice and to head in the direction of a much needed supply cache, finally taken to small open ships boats as part of this ordeal. Finally, fetching up on a small Antarctic Island a fateful decision was made that a small team would try to sail one of the boats to South Georgia Island and the whaling station there to seek rescue.This book tells the story of this amazing feat of human endurance, ingenuity and perseverance in the face of some the harshest conditions mother nature can conjure. The prose is favourably disposed towards the tenets of brevity in many instances but also takes the time to delve into character descriptions and examine the motivations of a number of the crewmen and decisions they made. One of the advantages for the layman is that the only sailing jargon/navigational minutia included is actually necessary which means that basically anyone can read this and get a sense of the enormity of the problems without having to have sailing or Antarctic experience. This is a real boon for this book is the perfect gift for the person who has everything, the sheer against the odds scenarios discussed within will strike a chord with basically any reader regardless of what genres they normally indulge in.I cannot recommend this book highly enough not necessarily because it unearths every detail nor for it being the best written book ever but just for the story it contains."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I had the pleasure of seeing the movie based on this book years ago. I've recently become interested in historical novels and this one was high on the list. This is by far one of the greatest stories of all time. This book is so compelling its hard to believe its a true story."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"If you think this might be more attractive to the male gender, as a woman I can state emphatically it was a thrilling adventure, with the right blend of realism and characterization. It almost made me feel like adding a blanket to my bed! Once you read this adventure into the bleakness of a frozen world, the hardships, toughest endurances, losses yet optimism prevail when survival means hope. The writer opens up a world that most of us have never seen, nor known the subtle evidences of life and change amid a tundra of ice. So bundle up, ready yourself for howling winds, rough seas, creaking joints, splitting ice, mountainous glaciers, absolute silence, and survival of the fittest and immeasurable bravery & courage.Sheryl in Vancouver BC"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I read this on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed. I couldn't put the book down and easily read it in two days.There are 4 daring adventures: 1. Getting stuck in an ice flow, 2. Surviving on a desolate island in Antartica, 3. An incredible, lucky journey by a small boat returning to civilization, &amp; 4. crossing the final few miles to civilization on land. I don't think I've given away the book because reading how they got into this jam and then get out of it is totally unbelievable.I recommend this book to readers interested in adventures, war stories and nature. Truly this book shows the real power of natural forces."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Shackleton is &quot;hot&quot; right now. The Mugar IMAX theater at the Boston Museum of Science is showing a great documentary on Shackleton's Antarctic adventure.I strongly recommend this book to those interested in Shackleton, the Antarctic, or exploration/adventuring. The photographs (by Hurley, the expedition's photographer) are superb, and add greatly to the experience.The ordeal that Shackleton and his men suffered is almost beyond comprehension--and his success in bringing home safely EVERY MAN is awe-inspiring.There are many facets to this tale: nature, leadership, courage, perseverence, navigational skill, loyalty......it covers a broad range. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This harrowing memoir is written predominantly through the diaries kept by the men aboard the Endurance. The diaries were barely ledgible at times, according to the author, but were invaluable in terms of information. Other sources for the book were &quot;eyewitness&quot; accounts from the survivors of the journey, including Dr. Alexander H. Macklin. Thus, creating a very accurate and dramatic &quot;true-life&quot; story. Not only is the story told, but the atmosphere and emotions of the crew and their surroundings are shown, and one gets the feeling of what is was like for these men in the early 1900's adrift on ice packs and marooned on unliveable land for more than a years time. The story is well written, fast paced and tells several parts of the tale at different intervals during the book which makes it very easily followed. If you enjoy historical accounts or are fascinated with Antartica itself....this is a must-read book."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I had never heard of this story before and I must say it has to be one of the most astonishing and fascinating non-fiction stories of all time. In fact, this story of 27 men living and ultimately surviving one of the most terrifying conditions one can imagine, is almost too hard to comprehend. This is also a great story of leadership and teamwork which should be an example of how one can overcome the worst odds imaginable and should be required reading in history and management classes. One can really learn and be inspired by these men who did not achieve what they had outset for, but achieved much more, the ultimate reward - survival - in the end."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This is one of those books that truly puts life into perspective. What these men went through--had to go through--simply for survival is utterly amazing and inspirational. I could not imagine any more desolate and hopeless conditions. The books speaks a lot for the endurance of the human spirit, its willingness and strength to continue on at all odds as long as a shred of hope still remains.And this is what Shackleton gave his men: always a shred of hope. And that is precisely what this book is about--hope. I recommend its reading highly; it is a tale you will remember and talk about and a tale that will impact how you see the world."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"What more can I add for a review, it already has 5 starts and there are 237 reviews before me. Let me just say that this story is one that I was familiar with. I knew the story and the outcome and yet I still found this book a fascinating read. The detail in which this book delves is rarely seen and makes this a page turner. Don't hesitate to read it, you will be rewarded for your endeavor."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"What an amazing history Alfred Lansing shows us in this book. I knew the general story before reading the book, but as I was reading it never really believed that all of the men would survive for that long under those conditions. Telling you that doesn't ruin the story -- it just enhances it -- the suspense is in understanding how they survived. Lansing's descriptions are amazingly and agonizingly detailed."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This book qualifies as one of my all time favorites. Even a book of the most imaginative fiction could not begin to approximate the adventure that these incredibly brave men endured."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"What an account of courage, the wider perspective, endurance beyond description.

What a story of courage and leadership and hope! Even though you know that all will be rescued, the book is a page turner because the journey itself is so unbelievable. It is the best book I have read this year. I am waiting for my husband to finish the book before we watch the DVD with Liam Neesen."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Plan on traveling to Antartica in the future, and even though this was a failed expedition I always wanted to learn more about this. Took this book to read on vacation, and finished it by the 2nd day - couldn't put it down. In my opinion, this has got to be one of the greatest stories of survival and determination in modern history, and the author keeps you hooked the entire way through. Details of emotions and struggle become that much more profound when you realize the extensive research that was done in crafting this book. An amazing tale of the power and determination of the human spirit - we all can learn from Shakleton and his men, and Lansing plays a brilliant role as a medium of delivery."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"This book is one of my top two books I have ever read.

I wondered how the book Endurance could possibly compare with this fantastic DVD set. The book was just as good 5 stars.We see Sir Shackleton in 1914 and his 27 men heading for a cross continent trek across Antarctica. Unfortunately the Endurance gets caught in the ice. She is crushed and sinks. Shackleton orders abandon ship and his men are on the ice. Against all odds, low temperature and little food they get on an ice flow and move 3 small boats toward open water. They are starving and must kill and eat their sled dogs as well as seals and penguins. Some of the men are almost killed by 1100pound Leopard seals but the seals are shot and supply the men food and blubber for their cooking pots. They eventually get off the flow and face horrific seas and bad weather and make it to Elephant island. Some are frostbite and the youngest member has to have his toes on one of his feet amputated. Another developed a boil on his back the size of a football.Unbelievable hardships.Then Shackleton and 5 men must sail almost 800 miles to South Georgia island to get rescue for his men from a Norwegian whaling village.They make the horrendous voyage across the Drake passage that has some of the worst weather on earth. Eventually they arrive on the wrong side of the island and Shackleton and 2 men must trek about 30 miles across part of the island and a glacier before arriving at the village. They are ushered to the Norwegian leader and the 3 stinking, dirty, nasty, badly clothed humans knock on his door. He says \\"Who the hell are you\\". Shackleton says my name is Shackleton. The Norwegians knew of Shackleton's expedition as it had stopped at South Georgia before but after over a year they thought them all dead. The Norwegian leader cries for them. Shackleton's 3 men left behind on the other side of the island are rescued. After 3 attempts with different ships the others on Elephant island are rescued.Its amazing. Shackleton INMO was not a great planner and made serious mistakes but his leadership and survival skills were legendary.He had a huge ego but believed in himself and inspired others to give 110% of themselves in order to survive. The expedition across the Antarctic continent was a failure but Shackleton's indomitable spirit and superb leadership skills helped save every man. No one was lost. All return as heroes. The most incredible story of survival ever told with diaries, logs and pictures( many lost) to prove it. An incredible man and a fantastic story. Endurance 5 star.PS. For scientific Antarctic matters learned give me the explorer Scott. For speed, planning and efficiency reaching the South Pole, Amundsen. For leadership, survival skills and surviving in the worst conditions give me Shackleton. The 3 great Antarctic explorers of the heroic age of exploration."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"My husband and I read this book because we were thinking of going to Antartica. It alerted us to the wildness and coldness of the area and of the kinds of storms that occur on Drake's Passage and we decided that, since the weather has not changed anything, we would travel to Italy instead!"},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"It is almost hard to believe that Alfred Lansing's novel is based on actual events. In 1914 Ernest Shackleton embarked on an expedition to cross the Antartic by land. Unfortunately, the sinking of the ship, Endurance, left the men stranded on a frozen and treacherous ocean. The Endurance crew battled obstacle after obstacle to return to civilization.Lansing meticulously researched this novel by interviewing survivors and reading the memoirs of those who experienced the events firsthand. This novel deserves praise not only because it is an incredible read, but also for bringing to life the heroic men who survived such an ordeal. I'm impressed by how well this book was put together. Not only does it vividly describle the impossible conditions the men were forced to endure, but the author also took the time to humanize the crew.Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage is not some drab assessment of a historical expedition, it is a novel filled with emotions felt by those who lived through the most unbearable circumstances. There are many books written on this amazing survival story, but Alfred Lansing's version is worth the read."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"An excellent adventure story where no one dies or gets killed.A real \\"page turner\\"."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"I am working my way through the top 100 Adventure Books of all time. This one is, so far, the best. It is the concatenation of several adventure books, since almost every type of mishap and obstacle is encountered. Shackleton must go down as a true hero, as well as his crew. The version of the book with the glossies in the middle was captivating... I spent a good bit of time staring at the remarkable pictures. The story of how those film plates survived this oddysey is, in itself, remarkable.A good adventure would be ruined by poor writing. Lansing is superb and does credit to this story.This story could never be made into the movie because it would be considered too \\"far-fetched\\" to be believable.

Shackleton and the crew of the Endurance to re-tell the story of the ill-fated Trans-Antartic Expedition. The harrowing story of courage and determination under almost unimaginable conditions both inspired and humbled me. Lansing does an admirable job of describing the events of the journey from the abandonement of the Endurance and the long polar nights on the ice floes to Shackleton's mad dash across the 10,000 foot peaks of South Georgia.I am impressed that Lansing exhibited restrained in not speculating unduly upon the thought of the men without using their accounts.The book is outstanding.

What a will to live and a test of physical and mental perseverance! Whenever I am feeling overwhelmed, I'm going to remember the willpower of Sir Ernest Shackleton and his 27 intrepid men in their determination to survive almost two years lost in the Antarctic. These men and their good humor in times of absolute desolation reminds one that you can never give up. Alfred Lansing did a wonderful job of bringing the men and their voyage to life.The only thing I would have liked was a map so I could better see where Elephant Island and South Georgia were and trace the passage as it was."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Truly incredible.

One of the best books that I read in 1998."},{"Title":"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage","review":"Highly recommended! A virtually flawless account of an adventure that could not have been written as fiction - no one would have believed it. As it is, it's hard to believe that they once made MEN like this, and that these men had such magnificent, albeit harrowing, adventures. Today, we measure ourselves by what new toothpaste slogans we come up with. What a world. Some minor criticisms -- where are the maps, charts, drawings, and photos? And the epilogue? This book cried out for one. But this is all minor when compared to Lansing's superlative achievement.

My husband's curiosity was picqued by such outbursts; after passing it on to him, he read it in almost one sitting and agreed that it was perhaps the best book he had ever read as well (and we've read LOTS of books!). The small annoyances of daily living will seem laughably trivial after you've been exposed to the true hardship these men faced for almost 2 years. Although the recent best-sellers Into Thin Air and The Perfect Storm were both good reads, Endurance makes the events in those books look like a walk in the park by comparison.

Furthermore, I believe that this subspecies is now extinct.No exploration today -- the ludicrous mass herdings up Mt.

With few true heros on the world stage a read like this..with rugged, earnest, and utterly selfless individuals..is a welcome diversion."},{"Title":"The Nigger of the Narcissus","review":"I read this in one sitting on a very dark skied rainy afternoon in an attic which looked like the interior of a ship and I was riveted by it, truly amazed by this tale which was at least in part based in fact. Conrad had written a couple of minor novels and some stories before this but this was his first masterpiece and remains his best tale of the sea, though he wrote other good ones none of them approach the power of this one. There is not only a great telling of a perilous holding-on-by-the-skin-of- your-teeth tale of a ship in peril but also a figure on board whose presence has an unsettling effect upon the men. While the ship sails on calm waters the crew and captain all appear to us as individuals only united by the fact that they all walk on the same decks, they are seen as unique presences and they all have their own reaction to the strangers &quot;condition&quot; which is an apparent illness. As the storm approaches and the ship and crew begins its stunningly told fight for life the individuals all merge as it were into one entity sharing the common task of sailors versus the sea. As the men try to save the ship the strangers presence is forgotten and the captain himself is mysteriously quiet as the men simply do what they must to survive the storm. Once the ship is no longer in peril the uneasy balance of personalities resumes and once again the stranger is suspect. Fascinating and exciting story. Elements of both mystery and high adventure combining here to give one not only a wildly enjoyable read but one which leaves ones mind opened in some way. Heart of Darkness and Lord Jim were Conrads next efforts, but don't miss this one. The prologue to this has Conrad setting down his artistic credo but read it only after the tale is told. That way your mind can absorb in its own way this excitingly told tale."},{"Title":"The Nigger of the Narcissus","review":"Joseph Conrad provides a memory from life of the sea in the waning days of square-rigged ships. How far that age is gone is illustrated by the rebuilt Constitution. When she was gotten out in recent years after her reconstruction she really wasn't put under full sail--you couldn't assemble a crew to do so in the USA.Conrad suggests he was among the crew but at other times assumes the stance of an omniscient observer (as when he reports that conversation between Donkin and Jim Wait in the closed deck house). Yet he does this in other novels and I can live with it for the reward of his evocation of the sea--at least I think it's a realistic evocation of the sea, I who have voyaged only in air conditioned cruise ships and a small inland sail boat.More important than Conrad's nautical narration is his penetration into the psyche of nearly everyone on board. The first customer reviewer was wrong to say that \\"the loathsome Donkin\\" stands for the crew and to align the novel with political literature. A great humanistic work cannot be demeaned to the status of a political analysis, at least this one can't.The last pages of the novel are as melancholy a picture of the vanished men of a dead age as I can imagine. They have undergone three fates (except for Donkin, who of course succeeds): death at sea, death by land, and transfer to a steam vessel, the latter equated with a sort of death.Even the material remnants of that age are fragmentary and unsatisfactory, a few ships in dock as museum specimens and the great East India docks transformed to the trendy \\"Docklands\\" development."},{"Title":"The Nigger of the Narcissus","review":"This a powerful and dramatically written sea story of shipmates under trial both from the sea and from eachother. But the sea is only its point of departure. Behind the surface there abides the universe of human struggle, sacrifice, betrayal and death. In the final lines, Conrad says so: &quot;A gone shipmate, like any other man, is gone forever.&quot; Then the story ends with a farewell image of the crew tossing aloft in the night, battling with the sails in the teeth of a westerly gale -- a fitting description of struggle and victory at sea and a metaphor for the struggles of life. This is a remarkable work, which is prefaced by an author's note setting forth Conrad's artistic mission as he saw it."},{"Title":"The Nigger of the Narcissus","review":"A powerful tale of human interaction in the confines of a sailing ship. Conrad mixes technical details with poetic prose in a style that is very enjoyabe to read. A relatively short book, this makes a delightful introduction to Conrad. Perhaps the best tale of the seas written."},{"Title":"The Nigger of the Narcissus","review":"The Narcissus is about to set sail from Bombay to London and a crew is mustered. Amongst them is Donkin,a surly agitator who demands his rights, and James Wait, a huge black man who feigns illness to avoid work. Donkin champions Wait's right to be ill and Wait becomes a focus for all as mutiny threatens...This is the gist of the plot, but 'Narcissus' is very much a 'Tale of the Sea' as Conrad puts it; the sea challenging and changing the crew as elemental nature;the close proximity of death; the ship as an Island of souls plagued by moral, physical and superstitious problems like a nation (Britain?) in minature surrounded by the sea.A dense and profound book that challenges the emotions rather than entertaining with a 'begining middle and end' type story (such as Conrad's 'Chance'). I was surprised to read that Conrad disliked 'Moby Dick's' portrayal of the sea as I was immediately put in mind of Melvilles eerie and haunting passages when reading this.Like 'Moby Dick' this book challenges the reader, and like 'Moby Dick' it will never leave you."},{"Title":"The Nigger of the Narcissus","review":"I first read this book many years ago and never forgot Conrad's description of a tremendous gale at sea that lasted for a day and a night, and that put the sailors on board a sailing ship through unbelievable terror and hardship. The fact that it is an autobiographical tale (Conrad was a seaman for twenty years) adds great excitement to the telling. I always wanted to pick the book up again, so, last week, I did and was very glad I did. The reading of that event was as gripping as the first time around. Further, I was more able to appreciate the other qualities of Conrad's writing this time round. I will, however, state at the beginning of this review that, for many modern readers, his late nineteenth century style of prose will probably be far too wordy for them. One example of this will suffice to show what I mean. Here it is. \`The feverish and shrill babble of Eastern language struggled against the masterful tones of tipsy seamen, who argued against brazen claims and dishonest hopes by profane shouts'. And that's just on the first page! On the other hand, such wordiness, for a patient modern reader, gives, in my humble opinion, great rewards because he will find himself sucked into the world of isolation, desperation, courage, stoicism, and sheer terror that was life on a sailing ship.For me, the portrayal of the gale that had the two and a half dozen men strapped to the ship as it lolled in tremendous waves for twenty-four hours ON ITS SIDE (how scary is that?), is the highlight of the novel. For Conrad, though, I think he meant it to be the tale of a black seaman who came on board, feigned illness to get out of his duties, and then slowly but surely realized that he really was very sick and was facing his imminent death. This character and his dilemma had a profound effect on his shipmates and the novel examines that in detail. Conrad's characterization is masterful and, by book's end, the reader feels he knows the men very well; from cowardly, trouble-making Donkin to the oldest sailor, Singleton, who stood with his knees locked into the wheel for thirty hours as he fought to keep the ship from turning completely over and drowning everyone on board. And any review of this book that omits the fact that Conrad was Polish is remiss because it is astounding to realize that the writer of this wonderful tale is not a native English speaker. He obviously had a brilliant ear for linguistics. Read this example of Donkin's speech, Donkin being an Englishman of the lowest class.\`....Will yer? Are yer a bloomin' kid? ....Tell an' be damned! Tell, if yer can! I've been treated worser'n a dog by your bloomin' back-lickers. They \`as set on me, only to turn against me. Who axed me ter \`ave a drink of water?' and so the revolting man goes on.So, despite the unfashionable wordiness of this work (and the oh, so politically incorrect usage of the term in the title), I am filled with admiration for this writer. Will I return to this novel again? You bet I will."},{"Title":"The Nigger of the Narcissus","review":"This book was titled \\"Children of the Sea\\" in the American edition. It's a quite good book, some what the form of it falls in between a novel and a shortstory. It tells the tale about the rough life at sea on a ship with sails! It's moving to hear about these sailors out on open sea, their lives depend on eachother, then they reach the destination and split up never to see eachother again. Perhaps the most memorable part of the novel is when the ship enters the dirty dark industrial city of London, after life at the merciless but fresh sea, Conrads description of London is almost Dickens like in its somber visions."},{"Title":"The Nigger of the Narcissus","review":"I came across Narcissus as a reference to one of Faulkner's inspirations in writing As I Lay Dying. As the latter book was superb, I suspected the former would perhaps shine as brightly. I was definately wrong.It's not that the book is bad--certainly not. But the book, as a story, isn't all that riveting, and as a social commentary is not anything that most haven't seen time and again (that Conrad's work came before much of what we've seen is, of course, of some merit).From an academic standpoint the book is probably worth a read. Historically, it's clearly important as it effectively captures the mood of an era long past. As a study in literature I found Conrad's employment of seamless shifts between the first and thrid person as subtle and deceptively powerful--clearly this is where Faulkner borrowed style from the work."},{"Title":"The Nigger of the Narcissus","review":"The nautical setting is interesting: Recognizable to those familiar with sailing, a learning experience for those of us who are not. One star.The characters are interesting: Ranging from hardend sailors with strong work ethics to unpricipled slackers, with a mysterious black shipmate (who may or may not be faking illness) thrown in to shake them all up. One star.What I didn't find interesting was Conrad's writing style. His descriptions contained far too many confusing similes, his run-on sentences and three-page paragraphs were tiresome, and his sudden switch from third-person to first-person narration was a bit bewildering. No stars."},{"Title":"Snowy Torrents: Avalanche Accidents in the United States 1972-1979","review":"If you really study the subject of avalanches this and the later edition is a must purchase."},{"Title":"Dead Sexy","review":"For those of you who read romantic vampire fiction, you know that lately the books have been either very good or very bad. This is one of those in the very bad category. It tries to ride of the coattails of Laurell K. Hamilton's early Anita Blake series books by having the heroine (Regan) be an ex-vampire hunter who catches the fancy of the vampire Master of the City (Joaquin). The setting is the USA sometime in the future, a time when, we're told, colonies exist on other planets. Regan is now out of a job because vampires have been declared an endangered species and are restricted to specific urban enclaves. Humans are being brutally murdered in the park in the vampire enclave and the police are stumped.Where to start, where to start...This universe is supposed to be some future America, and given the rapid changes that have occurred in our own culture as a result of the space program to-date, it seems that this universe's sole nod to the future is that they use \\"credits\\" for money, TV is know as the \\"Satellite Screen\\", and Regan has a \\"robot coffee maker\\" (I kid you not) in her home. Otherwise, the setting could be - oh, I don't know - America 2007? The author couldn't even be bothered, it seems, create a coherent future universe (much less unique terminology) for her story setting. If you are going to set a story in a future universe, at least make it a believable one; other authors seem to have no difficulty doing that.Now, we have the character of Regan herself. She's out of a job because of the change in the status of the vampires, but we're told that in the past she was an active vampire hunter and has killed them, using the usual extreme prejudice ways. We are given a facile reason why she became a vampire hunter (the usual avenging a dead friend) but not much more than that. She is also now a consultant on vampire crimes for the police (Oh, Anita!). However, whenever Regan sees blood, especially when she sees vampires drinking the synthetic blood they now survive on, she feels her \\"bile rising\\". She is called in to consult on a number of murders (I was already losing track of the number of them) that were killed exactly the same way - throat slashed, certain organs removed. As far as I could tell, there was absolutely no reason for her to be called in, because she provided no information, clues, what-have-you, whatsoever to the police. She came, she looked, she left. What was the point of any of that? I still don't know. The author couldn't seem to decide if she wanted Regan to be a kick-@ss or fragile. As a result, her character ping-ponged all over the emotional spectrum.Then there is the push-pull of her relationship with Joaquin, the MOTC. Of course, she's strongly attracted to him, of course she's horrified by her attraction, of course he loves her immediately, of course there's a normal human guy who's also attracted to her but who's much further down on her Lust-O-Meter. But it's all superficial; there is no real wrestling with her conscience about the relationship - it's more of an \\"eek, what am I doing lusting over a vampire\\" kind of thing. When Regan worries, for example, if Joaquin (currently spending the day under the motel bed to avoid the sun) is going to use some \\"special vampire vision\\" to see her \\"through the bedspread\\" as she undresses for bed, you've got to wonder if the author has forgotten who her character is supposed to be and has confused her with a 12-year old girl. For a person who is supposed to be an expert on vampires, she shows very little intellectual curiosity about them, nor does her attitude evolve in any logical fashion.As if there wasn't enough mishmash in this book, we also have vengeful werewolves, a Native American shaman, and, oh yes, the Lakota nation which has been granted full nation status and given the Badlands as their sovereign territory, not to mention a werewolf enclave in Romania. I'm still wondering why a storekeeper warned Regan and Joaquin to stay away from the Lakota lands, apparently completely ignoring the fact that Joaquin (an ancient Apache vampire (insert an eye-roll here)) was described as copper-skinned, dark-eyed, and with long black hair. Now to me, if I were the storekeeper, I would have found out first if Joaquin was, just perhaps, Native American himself first.Now, you may say that I am too harsh in this review, that is is meant as just a light read, but I take exception to an author who seemingly just phones in a book, one that seems to have been assembled by tossing ideas into a hat and pulling out a handful of them. I take exception to a flaming romance between people who have no idea or understanding of who the other actually is. I take exception to paying good money for this book, and for the time I wasted reading it, hoping that something would redeem it.If you absolutely must read this book, buy it used. Hopefully the author's other books are better than this, but this is one reader who won't be wasting her time with them. There are just way too many better books out there, by authors who respect the readers' intelligence in the same fashion we're supposed to respect theirs."},{"Title":"Dead Sexy","review":"What is going on with the paranormal/vampire romance writers these days? Are they all dried up and time to move on? Another big big big disappointment yet again and right after the big one from Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dream Hunter too. I had to force myself to finish Dead Sexy with a pot of coffee. I felt as if I was reading a text book. Why did I force myself to finish this? Because I don't want to have to pick it up again and finish it later. Like the previous reviewer, the chemistry was just so flat. Romance in the paranormal world is suppose to be earth shaking with fireworks and explosives. You see none of that in this. I don't mean I want to read page after pages of sex but I at least want to see some romance and how love was develope between the hero and heroine. As for the storyline, I felt as if I missed something. As if there was suppose to be a story before this that explain things. I even thought I skipped a book. I love Amanda Ashley's book, everyone of them before this one. I never felt so bored before with the others. Come on Mrs. Ashley, what happen?"},{"Title":"Dead Sexy","review":"I completely agree with MayFayre, so I will try not to repeat. I will add that Regan is a virgin. There are virtually no sex scenes in this book and what little action there is is interrupted over and over again so you can predict the outcome of each attempt, until the end where the joining falls flat. The reason for the lack of heat is that Regan detests vampires for one and she is saving herself for her husband, so her virginity will be her gift to him. How touching. I am not condemning the \\"wait until you find the right one\\" attitude, but that is not why I read vampire romances. I would hope a worldly vampire would be attracted to a woman (not a girl) who will fire up his and the reader's blood (pardon the pun) and steam up the windows. Why else am I interested in these books. This one has certainly no excitement, no mystery or any other qualities that could make this worth reading, so why not redeem it with hot steamy sex. Guess the writer didn't want to bother to have to think too much about any of this story and it shows. I would not purchase this book, new, used or even borrowed from the library unless you want to waste your time. Life is short and each read should be a worthwhile and enjoyable experience. Save your time and money and read Lindsay Sands, Sherrilyn Kenyon, Angela Knight, Robin Popp, etc., but stay away from Laurel Hamilton!"},{"Title":"Dead Sexy","review":"Ugh. This book was bad. I knew it was going to be bad when the ex-vampire hunter, Regan, is walking toward her car after dark in the park (where vampires roam free) and is afraid. Afraid? I'm sorry, but if a heroine is going to be billed as an ex-vampire hunter, I don't want to read within the first few pages that she's scared to walk to her car alone in the dark. I must admit that I only made it half-way through this book. There was no believable reason for Joaquin to feel so strongly toward Regan. The whole story just seemed flat, underdeveloped, and shallow. And then when the werewolf bite happened and she was all, yeah, let's go to South Dakota on a whim, I was done.I had read another Amanda Ashley vampire romance (historical) and thought it wasn't bad.

Yet, she knows Santiago is not the one committing the murders that have suddenly cropped up. In fact, he also is after the killer; an old enemy of his, a werewolf with a long grudge and evil heart. Regan and Santiago's mutual attraction has now turned her into a target for the vile creature to use as a weapon to hurt his nemesis. However, Regan is not one to take things lying down. Even if she has to lose her humanity, she will be no one's tool or victim.Readers who have enjoyed Ms. Ashley's unique spin on vampires, one that is both warm and fuzzy, while retaining a high level of tension, will certainly enjoy this.

The creatures of the night are confined to areas like You Bet Your Life park that contains condos, shops, and a supernaturally charged force field that keep vampires within. Synthetic blood satiates the hunger, but Joaquin Santiago, former master of the city, can cross the barrier and drink the real thing not this blood lite without killing his prey.Regan is sent to the park to investigate what looks like a vampire kill, but she has some doubts because the victim's heart, liver and throat were ripped from his body. Joaquin tells her he believes a werewolf is the predator; an enemy who murdered his wife; furthermore they will attack one another until one is eradicated. Regan is caught in their crosshairs (teeth?) and gets bit by Vasile turning her into a werewolf. She can revert back by killing her \\"mentor\\", something that Joaquin has tried and failed at for centuries.Whether she is a mortal or a werewolf, Joaquin bares his heart to Regan, who rejects him initially, but soon notices how kind and gentle he is so she cannot help but return his feelings. Both are strong willed people who understand they must first deal with Vante.

A book like this is invaluable to the Bob Dylan fan: it can resolve arguments, end bets, and settle a worried mind kept up at night worrying over whether a certain lyric went this way or that. However, this collection has been rendered obselete by the publication of Lyrics; the two books are identical, down to the layout, font and text styles, except for the differing front and back covers. That, and this book covers Dylan's lyrics through New Morning, while Lyrics covers them through Empire Burlesque. So, if you're looking for a Dylan lyrics Bible, get that book instead of this one. Of course, if you're an obsessive Dylan collector *looks around innocently*, you'll want to get both, anyway.Note: Being as even Lyrics is now well out of print, and itself misses 15 years of Dylan artistry (including such major albums as Oh Mercy, Time Out of Mind, and Love and Theft), it is time for a new edition of this book. This would also give them the opportunity to include some of the songs that were left out, for whatever reason, from both this and Lyrics (along with such items as the Planet Waves linear notes.) There are various seeming typos and changes (sometimes inexplicable) from the lyrics here (apparently the original ones that were copyrighted), and the ones that were actually recorded. This would be a chance to rectify these as well. And now is the perfect time to release it: Love and Theft was a success, huge with the critics, Dylan's touring his butt off to great raves, thousands are turning to his music for healing in the wake of September 11th, he's nominated for three Grammy awards (including Album of The Year), and there is much talk about him still because of his 60th birthday, previous Album of The Year, Things Have Changed, Nobel Prize nomination, etc. If ever there was a perfect time to release the book, it is now.

A must for someone who feels like smiling after finishing the final lines."},{"Title":"Fools Errant","review":"Fools Errant is a novel set in the age of Earth just prior to that portrayed by Jack Vance in his classic The Dying Earth. It follows the peregrinations of Filidor Vesh, a rather shallow young man whose only accomplishment is the accident of his birth -- he is the nephew and heir of the Archon, head of the Archonate that rather loosely rules this future Earth (or at least the part of it we see). As the novel opens he is summoned by a dwarfish associate of his uncle, one Gaskarth, who tells him the Archon wishes to meet him. But it seems the Archon is in another city. So Filidor must accompany Gaskarth to this city, by whatever means of transportation Gaskarth chooses. However, once their, it seems the Archon has already gone on ahead to the next city. And Filidor and Gaskarth must follow -- though apparently the Archon would prefer that his nephew perform some service for the locals while he is there.You can see where this is going -- the Archon remains a step ahead of Filidor and Gaskarth, and so Filidor is exposed to society after society of the Archonate. He sees such places as Ektop, so ecologically committed that the residents refuse to interfere with nature at all -- wearing no clothes, eating nothing that has not fallen from a plant, building no houses; or Zeel, where perpetual competition and innovation is the rule; or Tarend, where the inhabitants are obsessed with physical beauty. There is also plenty of danger -- they are captured by ant-people and by giant beavers, they are marooned by a revolutionary blimp crew, and they are pursued by a dangerous magician. All comes to a somewhat expected but still pretty satisfying resolution.The book is exceedingly derivative of the works of Jack Vance. The tone is similar, the dialogue captures Vance well, the strange societies are very reminiscent of Vance's societies. At times it seems too derivative -- it's a relief to be able to note that Hughes's more recent stories and novels, while still showing their roots in Vance, display a more individual voice. But even though this early novel is very much a Vance imitation, it's a fairly successful one, and I would think anyone who enjoys Jack Vance would enjoy Fools Errant."},{"Title":"Fools Errant","review":"In Olkney, Filidor Vesh enjoys his hedonistic life, as one would expect from a young heir to the Archon, of Old Earth's human inhabitants. However, his fun time at the Logodaedalian Club ends when a dwarf Gaskarth informs Filidor that his Uncle Dezendah the Archon summons him. The lad tries to sneak away, but the persistent guide forces Filidor to accompany him on what is surely a FOOLS ERRANT.Gaskarth escorts Filidor out of the city to the lands of Binch, Ektop, Zeel, and Jamb. At each site, Filidor learns that he just missed his uncle and where he is expected to go next. Also at each locale, Filidor learns first hand about different behaviors by always landing in trouble. As he treks from one location to another, Filidor begins to enjoy his travels, but wonders when he will finally catch up to his elusive relative and just who is his guide anyway?FOOLS ERRANT is a wonderful science fiction novel that combines a coming of age relationship tale with a satirical look at the extremes of society. For example, the uncompromising members of the environmentalists and the industrial developers are swiftly ridiculed for failing to seek a modest proposal for the betterment of society as a whole. Other humorous bashing highlight that Matthew Hughes has written a wonderful tale that will find genre fans wanting more adventures of the interesting lead characters in the near future...."},{"Title":"Fools Errant","review":"I wanted very much to like this novel but could not get past its verbiage. I love Jack Vance, and am well aware of his distinct and unusual style, in which peasants speak like dignified lords, and archaic vocabulary abounds. These things help to make Vance what he is--but they do not fully define him.This book recalls a series of Vance parodies that appeared in a newsletter called the Vance-phile. These short stories lovingly tweaked Vance's sometimes-florid and unusual style. They did not have to stand on their own; these were comic lampoons, not full-length novels.This novel likewise emulates some of Vance's quirkiest grammatical traits, but it lacks Vance's literary command. Vance is a master, throwing all sorts of tricky words, concepts, and subtleties at you and then daring you to figure it out. In this book the archaisms and over-elaborate structures are present, but the word choice is not always spot-on, and you sometimes get the sense that the verbiage is there for its own sake.It's also important to note that while Vance does use strange, overly-formal, and often curious words and sentence structures, he is also a very terse writer. He did not allow himself to get bogged down in description, or trip over his own words. That seems to be happening here.I will take a look at some of the author's later works, and see if his command of the language improves. He has chosen a good master to emulate; he just needs to realize that the qualities he's emulated aren't necessarily the most important ones."},{"Title":"Fools Errant","review":"This is probably more fantasy than sf, mostly because of the style. Or maybe a fairy tale...Callow youth travels the world, gets dumped into situations that confound him, and eventually succeeds and grows.Now, I called one of the plot twists pretty early on, but that didn't spoil the book; the story is all about the process. The periodic insertion of tales of a trickster-guru were, I thought a fun addition to a fairly mannered story.In ohter words: don't read it for the plot; read it for the journey.This is particularly true given Hughes's use of language. I've read too many books where an author will not use a plain word if a \\"fancy\\" one might work; since they mostly don't grasp the connotations of the \\"fancy\\" word- like a man referring to his personal parts as his \\"vulva\\"- and no I'm not joking- this is often very unintentionally funny. But Hughes is a master at using the \\"fancy\\" words- ALL CORRECTLY. It's one of the things I love about his style. It's very mannered- and you'll either love it or hate it- but it's so well done!I first encountered Hughes in F&SF; since then I've picked up some of his novels and anthologies, and enjoyed them. This one fits well into the mix. Lots of fun!"},{"Title":"Fools Errant","review":"I first saw Matt Hughes's name when reading an article about Jack Vance online. At that time, he had published Fools Errant, Fool Me Twice, and Black Brillion, as well as some short fiction in F&SF. The first book of his that I read was Black Brillion. I really enjoyed it, so I went and bought the e-book version of this book, here on Amazon, back when it was available (for some reason, they no longer offer the e-book version, and neither does any other online book seller). I found that I liked it as much as I had liked Black Brillion. And while his writing is definitely influenced by Vance, Matt Hughes writes with a style all his own, part Vance, part Wodehouse, with a little Bradbury, P.K. Dick, and Wolfe as well. While this was his first published book in the field, the writing is charming and welcoming, grandiose and descriptive. The adventures of Filidor and companion are pure fun, each one self-contained as well as part of the larger narrative. And when you finish this book, you will see that he left it open for a sequel. Fool Me Twice is that sequel, and is every bit as fun and well put-together as its predecessor. In short, thus far, if Matthew Hughes wrote it, it is going to be well worth your time to read it. I have read all his SF/F work, and he has not disappointed me yet. So give him a try!"},{"Title":"Fools Errant","review":"A new author attempts to write in the style of Jack Vance.

Although the plot exhibited some really creative twists on the old &quot;traveling story&quot; and the characters were well-drawn and multi-dimensional, the prose was annoying and invasive.Hughes appears to be very much in love with his linguistic cleverness and overuses it as a stylistic device. calling residents of a monastery &quot;monasts&quot; and a bathing room an &quot;ablutory&quot; were cute and would have been much more effective if they were the only examples. But with at least one such ploy every few pages, it got old. I don't want my Latin dictionary by my side when I read modern fiction, I just want to escape into the story.

And this slim book appears, presenting the wild idea of an actor, perhaps not even a very good actor, who manages to reach the position of head of state. Obviously an idea like this could only appear within the realm of science fiction! What a difference in perspective an additional twenty five years will make, as once more science fiction becomes fact.The route Lorenzo Smythe takes to reach this post is, however, just a little different from that of the real-world actor. The Great Lorenzo, as he styles himself, is conceited, arrogant, out of work, and down to his last half-Imperial when he is offered the job of doubling for a well-known political figure. The job is so obviously beneath his dignity that he is ready to turn down the offer when the Martians take a hand, and Lorenzo finds himself involved in murder, kidnapping, and slicing both humans and Martians into small pieces to flush down the disposal.Forced by these circumstances to take the job, Lorenzo is even more disturbed when he finds out the identity of the person he is supposed to double for, none other that the leader of the opposition party, Joseph Bonforte, whose politics, what little he knows of them, he despises. But his own inflated idea of his abilities allows him to steady down and start studying for the role, a role he will play for much longer than he could ever anticipate.This book is a character study, carefully and artfully detailing how Lorenzo changes under the influence of having to pretend to be someone he is not, aided by the immediate staff of the man he impersonates. It is fascinating to watch him change from someone you probably wouldn't invite into your home, to confused and beginning to search for some moral basis to his life beyond 'the show must go on', and finally to a man doing his best not just for himself, but for all intelligent beings, truly becoming the man he is portraying.The other characters here are pretty sketchy, mainly props to help move the plot and aid Lorenzo. This is most noticeable with Penny, Bonforte's personal secretary, who suffers from the typical Heinlein failing (at that point in his writing career) of portraying women as one-dimensional beings. However, this limited portrayal of these secondary characters does not detract from, but rather enhances by contrast the masterful portrayal of Lorenzo.Heinlein makes good use of his own experience in running for the California State legislature, as he describes the mechanics of running a political campaign, just how decisions are reached, how dependent a politician is upon the quality of the staff he selects, so that these items ring with real-world ambience. This is also probably the first book that clearly showed his leaning towards what would now be called Libertarianism, but this exposition is fairly muted, unlike some of his later works. And it wouldn't be a Heinlein book without his side commentaries: here he covers monarchies, civil servants, patronage, media management, taxes, unions, truth and lies, prejudice and xenophobia.Published at a time when a novel of character was practically unheard of in the science fiction world, this work, like so many others by Heinlein, expanded the boundaries of the field, another step in lifting it out of its self-imposed pulp ghetto and back to the world of literature. This is probably part of the reason this book earned Heinlein his first of five Hugo awards for best novel of the year, a record matched by no other author. The rest of the reason? It's a fun, fast, great read; a story that hasn't lost its power to engross, entertain, and expand your view of the world.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"I read this book over 10 years ago. I still remember it and I'm still fascinated by the whole theme of pretending to be someone makes you into that person that you were pretending to be. Less heavy handed than Vonnegut's Mother Night with the same theme, this Heinlein book is a delight on many levels. First the main character's smart aleck tone is highly entertaining. &quot;If a guy walks into a bar dressed like a hick acting like he knows the place, you can tell that he's a space man&quot;. Heinlein's use of character voices is one of his strengths (like in Podkayne of Mars). Second, the role that this actor is playing becomes him and makes him into a responsible human being which is a nice idea in that a person can change and become a good person despite their best efforts to the contrary.There are problems of course. The Martians aren't that fleshed out. The shift from jerk to statesman seems way too abrupt. Some may find the main character grating. But Heinlein's strength rest in that his storytelling doesn't allow you to dwell too much on his weaknesses."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Heinlein was one of the best, and you would be missing out if you passed up the chance to read this, one of his many masterpieces. This story can still hold its own (despite being printed in 1957) against others in the genre- again, Heinlein was a master story-teller.Enough people have given the summary of the book, but Heinlein wrote beyond the surface. The story is of an actor who truly discovers a greatness within himself that he at first only pretended to own. It's a story of humanity- in the politics the actor must represent- that humanity must not be doomed to repeat the same mistakes of seeing itself superior to other races, but instead try to learn to live in harmony. Like any good story it takes believeable characters and puts them in seemingly real situations in fantasy worlds, and tells us how we could only hope to act were we in such a predicament.I'm lucky enough to own a first edition in great shape. I happened across it at a yard sale and had to pick it up. To me it was a \\"new\\" Heinlein novel as I hadn't heard of it. It's a light read, and although short, it's deep and fun. The plot loosely reminded me of a certain movie about an actor who impersonates the president... Of course this book was written LONG before that, and is much better. Read this book because it was written by Heinlein. Love it because it was well written."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This is a crisp story, with action and intrigue from start to finish. Lorenzo Smythe is one of Heinlein's most engaging characters, and a real departure from the typical Heinlein hero. He also goes through a lot of changes, as a good protagonist should.Heinlein generally doesn't have a lot of good things to say about politicians, but John Joseph Bonforte (another critical character) is his exception that proves the rule. He's honest, capable, caring - in short a saint among politicians.Another reviewer complained of too much politics, but that's rather silly in my opinion. The book is about the world of politics in the future, so it has to talk about it. But there is very little of Heinlein's trademark libertarian philosophizing. The book moves so fast, there isn't time for it.This is Heinlein's only short work to win a Hugo award, and I consider it quite worthy of the honor. It's not one of Heinlein's series of juvenile novels, but it can be read by teens as well as adults. Get it - it beats 99% of the science fiction ever written, and practically 100% of the stuff being put out these days."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Lorenzo Smythe has to be one of the best examples of a character you love to loathe in the beginning, and winding up loving by the middle. The way that Smythe, like so many of Heinlen's first person narrators, reveals things about himself, sometimes inadvertently, is just as interesting as the stories he tells. &quot;Double Star&quot;, as far as I'm concerned, is his Heinlen's virtuoso performance of narration, and a terrific plot to go with it."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"I first read Double Star when I was a teenager. I didn't get some of the subtleties until much later, but what a great read for a teenager. My 14 year-old daughter picked it up as a last resort (sci-fi, yuck), and stayed up all night to read it!Engaging charachters that speeds along. Not alot of gadgets or pure sci-fi, just an interesting story, interesting people set in an interesting time (the future). If you have any experience with politics, theatre, crime, soap operas or mysteries, you'll enjoy the read."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"The other two are _The Door into Summer_ and _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_. Heinlein also wrote a handful of near-great novels as well as some third-tier stuff that I don't care about rereading. (And his nonfiction, unlike Asimov's, isn't worth the paper it's printed on.) But these three novels are magisterial, and as close to perfect as anything he ever wrote.This time out, our \\"hero\\" is Lawrence Smith a.k.a. Lorenzo \\"Lorrie\\" Smythe a.k.a. \\"The Great Lorenzo\\", a self-important and out-of-work actor who, at least initially, isn't all that heroic. He's approached about a job, and it turns out to involve serving as a double for a famous statesman in a public appearance. The rest you'll have to read for yourself.It's a fast-moving, well-paced, meaty story, and it raises all sorts of fascinating questions about personal identity, character, and such. And Heinlein handles it all very deftly. Smith (why _are_ so many of his characters named \\"Smith\\"?) contends at one point that in order for an actor to portray a character properly, s/he has to _become_ the character, and it's impossible to do so without coming to like the character somewhat. Well, that's just what Heinlein does here with Smith himself. (Another of Heinlein's Smiths would later describe this process as \\"grokking\\".)Oh, there are a few soapboxy bits, but they don't interfere much with the story. For example, at one or two points we get a few pseudo-profound quotations from statesman John Joseph Bonforte that sound suspiciously like Heinlein himself at his tub-thumpingly silliest (or perhaps some lost excerpts from the notebooks of Lazarus Long, which may be another way of saying the same thing). But it's kept under control. (In other words, this is not _Starship Troopers_ or _Farnham's Freehold_.)This is one of Heinlein's finest and most tightly constructed tales, and almost fifty years after its publication it still holds up well. This is the master at his best -- and his best was very, very good."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"When compared to the body of Heinlein's later work (i.e. the mid-sixties to the late 1980s) _ Double Star_ hardly holds up. However, given the period in which this book was written it is truely a marvel worthy of its Hugo award winning status. I admire Heinlein for the way his hard sci-fi usually fools you to believe the events that are occuring. But in _Double Star_ Heinlein does less than he can to make the stroy believable. My understanding is that Heinlein kept the novel short to attract both adult and juvenille audiences. Maybe that's why he kept one aspect of the story very simple as well. The aspect I speak of is Lorenzo's transformation from pompous actor to a high ranking political official. What I mean by simple is that even in a science fiction story set far in the future, this transformation, which fools the public at large as well as many who are close to the senator, is accompshed with makeup! What I do like about the novel is the fact that Heinlein inserts a socially important message regarding prejudice. In the future realtionships between humans and martians parallel the race relations between whites and blacks during the time the novel was written. Heinlein is able to skillfully use the art of speculative fiction to draw this comparision, thereby creating an effective vision for social reform. In this regard the novel works well, and I would have liked to have seen more of it. It does, however, provide a blueprint for things to come from Heinlein, as he would elaborate more on issues of this nature at a later date. The novel could have been better even by 1956 standards. I believe it was lessened by Heinlein's conservative nature apon entering the world of adult sci-fi. Thankfully he loosened up as he entered the 60's. For fans of Heinlein _Double Star_ is a must read despite flaws."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Most definitely!!!

That's all I'll say on the plot, but do not think this book will be dull simply because you think politics is boring (just as I did)...it is NOT boring, once you get past the first few pages.The Master has created another collection of words that you will have a tough time putting down..."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Many of Heinlein's early novels are aimed at a younger audience, and those which aren't tend to be more light-hearted. \\"Double Star\\" falls into the latter category, with an unlikely premise and an unusual character as the narrator and hero of the story. Although, it is also difficult to call this an early novel considering he had 12 published prior to this one, and that is not counting his first novel which wasn't published until after his death. \\"Double Star\\" was published originally in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" from February to April of 1956, and then in book form later that year.For me, this is one of his best early novels. He stays within the boundaries of the story, and doesn't rely on a \\"big surprise\\" to try to lengthen the plot. The hero is Lorenzo Smythe, an actor who has a rather high opinion of himself. He is engaged by Dak Broadback for a performance, but not a typical performance. Instead he is hired to be John Joseph Bonforte, the former Supreme Minister and leader of the opposition. Lorenzo will need to fool people who have known Bonforte for years, as well as many others, and worse yet he will need to be surrounded by Martians, whom he can't stand the sight or smell of.The story is cleverly put together, obstacles arise as the result of politics and situations, but they are certainly believable within the context of the story being told. This had been a problem with his earlier novels, at least it was a problem for me. The story is a bit predictable, as Lorenzo is forced to continue the role longer and longer as new situations arise, but that didn't bother me as it was very enjoyable to read. This isn't going to rank as Heinlein's best, but it is a cut above most of his earlier novels. It is a enjoyable light read, and certainly a viable Hugo award winner from 1956. It has also been remembered on some fan polls ranking 44th on the 1987 Locus All-Time Poll for SF novels, and tied for 41st on the 1998 Locus All-Time Poll for SF novels from before 1990."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This book definitely deserves five stars.

He is sitting in a bar contemplating this sorry state of affairs when he strikes up an acquaintance with a stranger, a recently landed spaceman. Within a few hours Smythe finds himself a) employed b) nearly killed c) an accomplice to murder and d) leaving the planet. Smythe's new role will be a bit of a challenge for him, he has been hired to impersonate a famous politician who has gone missing. Smythe is sure that the role is well within his capabilities, it is just that the job well take place on Mars, and the needed performance is before an exclusively Martian audience, a race that Smythe finds particularly distasteful. Still the show must go on and Smythe is nothing if not a trouper.This is one of the novels that Heinlein wrote during the 1950's that was aimed primarily toward the young adult audience. As such the more outspoken sexual situations that appear in his later works (STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND, I WILL FEAR NO EVIL, TO SAIL BEYOND THE SUNSET etc) do not appear here. The story is on the surface that of an adventure, will Smythe get away with his impersonation or not, but, as with all of Heinlein's work there is a deeper layer. Smythe undergoes a great change in the course of the story as Heinlein once again addresses his familiar themes of the complexities of government and an individual's duty to his society.Fans of Heinlein will not want to miss this charming adventure which is a great read in itself as well as foreshadowing themes that will return in CITIZEN OF THE GALAXY and THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS. Those new to Heinlein's work could happily begin with this one even though it is not RAH at his peak.

It is somewhere in between the juvenile stories and Heinlein's serious works. As literature it's more entertainment.

It was written in the 1950s, but is set in the future (with rocket ships and space travel), thus it is \\"science-fiction\\".

The actor plugs on, winning an election for a high office for the polician. And, things get stickier and stickier and stickier.It was and still is a very good story.

I tend to think of the \\"everything else\\" books as his \\"small books\\"... not necessarily fewer pages, but -- as a rule -- less ambitious... drawn on a smaller canvas.This deft retelling of The Prisoner of Zenda is one of the best, perhaps the best, of the small books. The storytelling is tight, and Lorenzo Smith is one of Heinlein's most memorable characters... He also one his most human and self-aware characters.

The man character looses his individuality, becoming someone else. The (explicitly stated, too) message is that the trade-off was worth it - rather than being another unsuccesfull actor, the protagonist has become a significant political personality and can carry on realising his original's vision.This does not go well with any notion of the individual human being's intrinsic worth and I'm surprised that no one else seems to be troubled by this.Still, a very good and diverting read.The snapshots of a Martian culture are particularly memorable."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Reading it from Smythe's point of view was the best part because he's relating his thoughts to the readers as he enters into a bizarre impersonation job.

Since he's out of work, and a bit desperate to do something he takes the job, and soon finds himself wishing he hadn't. He is to take the place of a very public political figure. In what comes to be the most challenging acting job of his life, he pulls the job off with flying colors. Through his study of the charachter he must incorperate a personality which goes against his own in many ways, and in some ways he finds it almost more than he can handle.Through the course of his job, Lorenzo finds himself pushed further into playing his role, making dicisions, becoming this person. Like many novels by Heinlein, science fiction is merly the genre which allows situations to take place which otherwise could not....allows a normal guy to be faced with abnormal situations, and to grow because of this. Because of this, his stories are not only highly entertaining, but introspective as well. Double star examines what makes a person who he is by showing what is involved in assimilating another person and portraying them. It shows how a person can make a consious choice to be who they want to be, and take on the nessicary responsibilities to become a more honorable person.I would reccomend this, as well as a number of Heinlein's novels as tools for a person who is working to better themselves and examine thier role in life."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This is a highly curious book. As SF it is very much dated: the &quot;science&quot; is ludicrous by today's standards. Despite the comments of other reviewers there is not really all that much politics in it. I have reread this a few times (one of the few books that allow this) and find it gets better each time I read it. I feel this is a book that very much expresses Heinlein's philosophy, and can hold its own beside &quot;Space_Cadet&quot; and &quot;Starship_Troopers&quot;. The one-dimensional young female character so typical of Heinlein's later work is here, but in reasonable proportions (I will go with the mainstream view that Heinlein never wrote anything worth reading after 1961). I guess this indeed is a classic although it is full of laughably silly little details."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"In this short novel Heinlein tells the story (in first person) of Lorenzo Smythe, a man of the stage, as he stumbles upon the role of a lifetime in a bar over drinks with a pilot. Lorenzo quickly finds himself embroiled in caper too far to turn back from and eventually becomes involved in a political coverup that is way over his head.For the most part I enjoyed Double Star. It started out light and comical, but eventually lost those two elements the more we learn about the political situation...and the more Lorenzo sinks into his role playing a double. Now that I look back there is very little science fiction involved in this book other than trips to Mars and the Moon. Beyond that it is a novel that focuses on politics, acting, and the theatre. There are many references to Shakespeare; elements of which are the main plot of this book (deception and disguise). Not being a fan of politics in general, I thought the heavy political aspects eventually pulled the book down. But that's just my view. There are many people who enjoy this type of narrative. I wish Heinlein would have maintained the light and fun tone throughout. Regardless, it was an enjoyable read on my trek through the Hugo &amp; Nebula winners."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This is a Heinlein, so it is worth reading. It's an interesting story, with a unique plot (for science fiction) at least, and is a politically charged work, for those who like that side of Heinlein. In reality, this book could easily exist outside the genre of science fiction, so readers who don't normally like SF might dig this book. That said, this isn't one of Heinlein's best stories. There is almost no science whatsoever (not that unusual for RAH, but alas), the dialogue isn't up to his usual standards, and the story never really picks up steam like you expect it to.So, all in all, this is a book for the Heinlein devotee to pick up after they have already read most of his best work, an RAH newbie should look elsewhere. A good book, but I can't see why it won a Hugo."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Although there's a fairly strong plot to the novel, as in all the Heinlein I've read, its strengths lie not so much in the action, which in some ways seems rather dated now, but in its comments on the political process, which has stayed pretty much the same.There are also some amusing references to the British system, such as when Lorenzo hands the Emperor a scroll which is supposed to be a list of Ministers for approval, but which is actually blank, and the discussion on the relationship between the Emperor and the elected politician.This isn't the most profound of books, but it's none the worse for it, and well worth a read."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"As an avid reader of Heinlein, I was a little disappointed by this novel, but not overly so. A fairly interesting little mystery, but you can pretty much figure out the plot within the first few pages or so. In fact, this book lacks a great deal of the social commentary that is Heinlein's hallmark, though it is not devoid of it. Read it as a study in character development -- he does a fine job of letting the main character develop and change, and while our heartstrings aren't tugged quite as mercilessly as in other RAH novels, it's still an enjoyable read for an evening."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"As a professional actor (well, I do get paid -- to some extent) I loved RAH's generally accurate excursion into an arena in which I have personal knowledge. The story has held up well to the ravages of time."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Double Star is a brilliant tale of political intrigue set in a science fiction mileiu. Ignore the space ships, ignore interplanetary travel, and ignore the other trapping of SciFi, this is a story of an actor drawn into the most brutal, deceptive, treacherous environment known to humanity; politics.The actor, Lorenzo, has the right build and face to play the stand in for a high ranking politician, and it is not clear whether or not he'll ever get out of the role... or want to.In addition to being a great tale, there are a number of worthwhile lessons hidden in here. The best example is the habit of taking notes on people you meet, even folks junior to you that appear to be nobodies, in order to cultivate a relationship at a later date. Machiavellian? Mmmm... yes, but also good manners for anyone who meets and works with a lot of people.A great story, regardless of the setting. Easily one of Heinlein's best and most underrated.E. M. Van Court"},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This is one of Heinlein's four Hugo-winning novels. A rather lightweight actor is shanghaied away from Earth and more or less forced to impersonate a kidnapped politician. As he understands what the politician stands for, he falls more willingly into the role. The politician is recovered, but in such condition that the actor must remain in the role, and when the politician dies, adopt it for life.Lorenzo's transformation from lightweight actor to Churchillian libertarian politician is interesting to watch, and the science fiction is not essential to the plot--the Empire could, with some plot modifications, be in Roman times, or the British Empire, or in the twentieth century.Two problems: We see two sorts of characters we encounter too often in Heinlein's later books here--the two-dimensional female (Penny) and the yammerhead (Bill). It strains credibility that someone like Bonforte would tolerate someone like Bill near him for several years (sure, he does good work, but surely there would be thousands of nicer competant people available to a high-level politician), but the plot needs a bad guy close enough for the readers to focus on. But we see too many Pennys and Bills in the later Heinleins. Second problem: Heinlein's parliamentary system is ill-thought out. Wouldn't the Grand Assembly be heavily dominated by Asians? Yet, all of Bonforte's associates are American or English. (I don't think we even see an Asian, other than the Emperor's attache. Where's Quiroga from? South America?) How is it, in a Grand Assembly where the districts must have the population of New York City (say, 800 members, 8,000,000 per district), that there can be \\"pocket boroughs\\"--districts for space pilots, and university women, and a district for Lapland? And, would these districts be content to have their representatives be Mr. Bonforte's secretary and crew?Still, a great book."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"If there was a definition for a page turner, it should include the words Double Star. Start this book. Your fingers will start turning the pages faster and faster (regardless of slide rulers and native Martians) until without even realizing it you will reach Double Star's moving finale.But until then:You will have enjoyed one of the best first person narratives ever in science fiction.You will have read a fantastic case of somebody's personal singularity, witnessing his personal Gethsemane Gardens, but also his apotheosis.You will have extremely liked the excellent cast of supporting characters, the petty politicians, the sarcastic nobles, the unexpected villains and the hive extraterrestrials.Easily among Heinlein's best. Quintuple star for double star."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"...swipe from the best, and Heinlein certainly did here, lifting his plot from Anthony Hope (hodgeson)'s classic swashbuckler \\"The Prisoner of Zenda\\".The interesting things about this book (which is NOT one of RAH's juveniles) that at first appear to set it apart from the majority of Heinlein's output are all characteristics of the narrator, Lorenzo.Lorenzo is a xenophobe, an unheard-of trait for a Heinlein protagonist.Lorenzo is completely incompetent at mathematics -- while RAH (through the mouthpiece of Lazarus Long) has opined that no-one is truly human who cannot understand higher mathematics.Lorenzo is completely uninterested in politics or anything having to do with government, except as he personally may find himself interacting with law enforcement officials.Lorenzo presents himself as something of a coward.And Lorenzo is a raving egomaniac.But Lorenzo learns to deal with his fear of Martians.He never does learn math, but we gradually come to recognise that Heinlein has pulled a switch on us, and that Lorenzo is still our old friend, Heinlein's Competent Man -- but that his competency lies in another direction.Because Lorenzo is recruited for the greatest challenge of an actor's career -- to impersonate, literally in front of entire worlds, an immensely famous politician, who has been kidnapped by his political enemies in order to derail an important treaty with the inahbitants of Mars.And, gradually, as Lorenzo comes to know the man he must replace -- know him from the inside out, and \\"become\\" him, to the point that he can extemporise politically sound speeches in the Great Man's style -- that he begins to understand that politics is all-important in making it possible for the masses to live in peace and security, Lorenzo Grows Up.The Lorenzo we meet on Page One is a cheerful, flippant, shallow and actually fairly immature man. The Lorenzo we see by the end of the story proper has matured, seen some of the wrongs that need righting, and has realised that someone has to step up to the line and take a stand or the wrongs will simply continue; that all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.And that is what the story is about, really -- like RAH's juvenile, \\"Starman Jones\\", this is mostly a story about a man growing up and accepting a man's role and responsibilities.And, as the much-older Lorenzo adds as a short coda at the very end of the book, learning the important thing about the faceless masses, the thing that so many politicians lose sight of -- that they have lives of their own.That they can hurt.(At least one previous review has alluded to the excerpts from Bonforte's speeches -- i strongly suspect that, as the character of Bonforte himself seems to be by the man, they are heavily influenced or inspired by the oratory of Winston Churchill. Particularly, when i read the passage about choosing sides, i hear Winnie's voice in my head...)"},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This story of a provincial actor forced by circumstances to play the role of the Solar System's most broad-minded statesman is perhaps Heinlein's most under-rated novel, even though it has sold millions of copies and won the Hugo. A true actor, Lorenzo manages to become the role -- expanding his own horizons as well. In his epiphany, he starts with the only principle he ever subscribed to -- \\"the show must go on\\" -- and follows it to include all fair-dealing and professional ethics, and continues until he reaches eternal truths and a philosophical outlook. The scene is a marvel of thought and emotion (and not a bad start for a personal philosophy). His depictions of actors, politicians, and modern monarchy all ring true.(Gee, and I didn't even mention the kidnapping, murders, dirty politics, rockets, death rays, and Martians!)"},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"While Double Star did win the Hugo Award for the best science fiction novel of 1956, I would not call it one of Heinlein's most important works, nor would I rate it as highly as a good number of his other novels. It's a great story, but it strikes me as rather peculiar. There is not a great deal of science fiction in the book, for one thing. More importantly, although the plot revolves around politics, Double Star is much less political than many of Heinlein's other novels. No great questions are probed very deeply, and one finds oneself entertained more than intellectually stimulated or morally challenged. Here's the story in a nutshell. Lorenzo Smythe (aka The Great Lorenzo) is a fairly good actor currently down on his luck. A seemingly chance encounter with a space man lands him a role he never dreamed of playing. At first, he is only told that the job involves impersonating an important person. Two dead men and one dead Martian later, he finds himself rather unhappily bound for Mars, and he soon learns that his assignment, which he has reluctantly agreed to, is to play none other than John Joseph Bonforte, the head of the Expansionist movement, a man loved and hated passionately throughout the solar system. The real Bonforte has been kidnapped just days before an important event. If Bonforte misses that event, in which he will be formally adopted into Mars' most prominent native family, all of the goals of the Expansionist movement may well be doomed to failure. Smythe gives the performance of his life, but his hopes of returning home are squashed when the real Bonforte is recovered in very bad health. Smythe is asked to continue the charade just a little longer. One thing leads to another, and he finds himself essentially becoming Bonforte, holding the Expansionist party together by his presence and working to make Bonforte's goals a reality. His original self had no interest in politics and had a natural aversion to Martians, but Smythe changes fundamentally as his command performance extends from one encore after another.Some readers may say that there is too much politics in this book; this is true only insofar as the story is about politics. I really would not call the story political at all. Besides expressing an argument for the equality of all members of the empire, be they Martian, Venusian, Jovian, Terran, etc., the story is relatively free of the types of political and philosophical arguments that typify many of Heinlein's later novels. Those readers uninterested in politics should not pass this novel over out of a fear of politicization. Double Star is a very entertaining story and a fairly quick read. There is nothing earth-shattering or conscience paradigm-shifting about it, and that is the reason I am somewhat surprised that it received the Hugo award. This actually would be a good crossover introduction to Heinlein for readers not interested in science fiction in and of itself."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Robert Heinlein is one of the legends of science fiction for a simple reason: he was a masterful storyteller. There have been finer prose stylists, and a few sf writers have crafted novels of greater power than Heinlein's, but rare are the authors who have so consistently grabbed a reader and commanded rapt attention from the first scene to the last, in novel after novel. Double Star isn't one of Heinlein's best novels, but it was good enough to win a Hugo, Heinlein's first.Spaceman Dak Broadbent hires Lornzo Smythe to impersonate a man. Although Lorenzo is a talented actor (just ask him!), he is more of a con artist than an accomplished thespian. Before Dak can explain the role, Dak and Lorenzo are fleeing, having killed a Martian and a human during a shootout. The individual Lorenzo is to impersonate turns out to an important politician -- important to Earth's relationship with Mars and to the Expansionist Party's future. As you would expect in politics, betrayal motivated by unrealized ambition threatens exposure of Dak's scheme. Can Lorenzo get away with it? That's the question that drives the plot and captivates the reader.If we're confident today that there are no Martians on Mars, it's still fun to imagine the future as Heinlein saw it: a colonized moon and outer planets, space yachts, the strange customs of Martians and Venusians, and all the other trappings of 1950s science fiction that Heinlein helped create. It is a future that his characters, who are living in it, naturally take for granted -- unlike some current, ego-driven sf authors who can't resist bogging down their narratives with detailed descriptions of the technological advances they envision.Heinlein, of course, loved to pontificate, and Lorenzo's crash course in politics gave Heinlein a chance to opine on a variety of topics, from philosophy to moral instruction, from economics to political equality. Not surprisingly, the freedom-heavy political model that Lorenzo adopts mirrors Heinlein's own: free trade, free travel, a minimalist approach to lawmaking, the primacy of the individual (balanced by the individual's understanding that functioning communities require self-sacrifice). Yet Heinlein's gift was his ability to put story first. His characters pontificate because, in the context of the story, it's the natural thing for them to do. Their opinions never get in the way of the story; in fact, they often advance it. Heinlein always managed to convey heavy opinions with a light touch, a technique that few authors have managed with such skill.Politics, Lorenzo learns, is a game often suited to dirty players, but what if an election is based on a hoax? Yes, I know, conspiracy theorists and party hacks are always claiming elections are based on hoaxes, making Double Star a novel that will always be timely. But is it a great novel? Double Star is an entertaining send-up of politics, making the point in stark terms that great politicians are great actors, that the difference between performance and reality is often blurred to obscurity, but the novel lacks the depth of Heinlein's best work. The ending is a little too obvious, a little too easy. Even second-tier Heinlein, though, is a better read than most authors can manage. Double Star is an unpadded novel written in a breezy, fast-moving style. More than a half century after it was written, it is a novel that both sf fans and readers of political fiction can continue to enjoy."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"For a book that was written over 50 years ago, it's a fine read. It's cool to read sci fi from back then since it wasn't as accepted a genre as it is now. I rather like Lorenzo's character and his thoughts. There's a bit of acting advice here that real-life actors could actually use. Some people might decry the implausibility of the plot, but we need to remember the time and content that this story was written in. While I LOVE the Lazarus Long books, I have found Heinlein's older works to be a treat as well. If you're a Heinlein fan, read this. If not, you might still enjoy it. Just keep in mind that this was written in the 50's, so much of our technology (current) outpaces what is in the book. It's interesting to see Lorenzo do his best to be a double, and starting to enjoy it and care about the role rather than just seeing it as a job."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Heinlein's disdain for politicians doesn't stop him from knowing that the game of politics is the most important thing for all sentient life. The ablility for living things to live together in harmony, and for the greater good, hinges on interactions in the political arena, and that is the true nature of this story. The subtext of the well-woven plotline is secondary to the lessons learned by the protagonist, and that is what makes this great literature. Read the book, don't just watch it like a TV show, and you will know. Another great by the best."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"I was pleased to renew my acquaintance with this book recently via the audio cassette version. The story is read -- or more accurately, performed most excellently -- by Lloyd James. I leave it to the other reviewers to give a synopsis of the plot. It's fun to see what Heinlein &quot;got right&quot; in some of his future predictions and where he &quot;missed&quot; (no mobile phones? -- part of the plot would have collapsed). If you enjoy travelling with an audio book, this should be a fun companion."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This novel is classic sci-fi as Heinleins has always written it, at its best.I have always been a fan of Heinlein, even after I learned to decipher his incredibly libertarian views written into his books. If you've never read a Heinlein book, start with The Puppet Masters. It is one of the greatest sci-fi novels ever. I say 'one of the greatest...' simply because I haven't read all the books that have been written. Double Star, however, is still an exciting narrative, though sometimes the cultures and structures can be hard to get straight. If you're a libertarian or a conservative, dig in and enjoy, and if you're a liberal, don't worry, this book isn't too conservatively oppressive."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"The idea of a person having to impersonate another person has always been an idea that intrigued me. In this book Heinlein really explores this idea. Although we would think this is impossible in the grand scale that Heinlein talks about but at the end of your reading. You probably will ask yourself, &quot;Why not?&quot;"},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"DOUBLE STAR by Robert Heinlein. c 1956.When an major political figure in the Earth Empire determined towin civil rights for Martians is kidnapped, an actor is hired toimpersonate him during an important ceremony. However when thingsbecome complicated, the actor must decide whether to continue with his\\"performance\\" or walk away from it all.While an extremely well written novel where the political figureis obviously inspired by Dwight Eisenhower, this is still really just apolitical thriller only with space ships. Heinlein is no doctrinareliberal science fiction writer but rather an intelligent and rigorouslymature thinker. Therefore this is a sci fic novel more for the regularreader rather than the typical sci fic fan who tend toward Roddenberrystyle leftist thought control. A science fiction book for those who donot like science fiction novels."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Excellent. Old SF but still good.though some carracters aren't developed, the basic idea and the interaction are excellent. Loved the ideal of anti-racism which is still appropriate today."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"DOUBLE STAR, written in 1956, was the first Robert A. Heinlein novel to win a Hugo Award. Interestingly, in his memoirs, Isaac Asimov referred to this book as the best thing Heinlein ever wrote. I disagree with Asimov -- DOUBLE STAR is certainly a fun read, but nowhere near Heinlein's best.This book is essentially about an actor shanghaied into impersonating a powerful politician. The job is originally meant to be a short-term one, but eventually evolves into something much bigger and more important. Most of DOUBLE STAR consists of the actor faking his way through one high-profile situation after another. The results are consistently entertaining, and Heinlein's prose is first-rate.DOUBLE STAR is a short read, and contains almost no hard science. This is a novel about politics, but the political ideas are dealt with in a rather superficial fashion. All the major characters are colorful, but not as well developed as I would like. The ending is also extremely predictable. This was probably a cutting-edge novel for its time (i.e. the United States of the 1950s, when SF novels were first entering the marketplace), but it doesn't compare favorably with the more complex SF novels of today.Still, Heinlein's erudite prose is a joy to read, and he was certainly the best stylist of SF's golden age. DOUBLE STAR is good, old-fashioned fun, and anyone interested in reading classic SF should definitely give this one a whirl."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This is sort of a retelling of \\"The Prisoner of Zenda,\\" and the plot succeeds or fails based on whether or not you buy the possibility that, with just a little grease paint and some talent, one man could pass himself off as another, at close range, to people who knew him. The other part of the story is that this man whom you are impersonating is a key political figure in the story of mankind reaching out to the stars. He brings an end to human-centered government, and xenophobic relations between Earth and the other inhabited planets in our Solar System. Heinlein takes on this sort of theme much more powerfully later in \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.\\" This book is more of a romp, with some stuff to think about just coming along for the ride.How different was the world of late 1950's sf publishing. Novels could be 140 pages long. No need for warp drive in order to meet aliens (though some sort of relativity drive makes it possible to get from the Earth to Mars in a matter of weeks), because they're right here! They live on Venus, and Mars, of course. Did we really know so little about conditions on Mars as to think big people-sized creatures could live there, in 1956? Hard to imagine we were that ignorant still. Of course, we had still not one satellite in orbit in 1956, let alone sent any robot vehicles off to the Moon and planets. But canals with shrimp growing in them? And an atmosphere that would allow someone to breath, albeit only for a short period. Mars would kill you in a matter of seconds, it's barely better than the Moon. Several themes of Heinlein's later work are on display here, though he develops them a lot more later on. His whole interest in the impersonating schtick is to explore what it would be like to inhabit another person's...life. In a later work, he has an old man taking over a young woman's body (\\"Time Enough for Love\\"). All of this raises interesting questions about what is it I'm talking about when I say \\"I\\"? Also, the motif/theme/whatever it is of the Wise Old Man is here, in the person of the politician, Bonforte. He's not preaching and pontificating yet, as he will in later novels, but he is there. I enjoyed reading this, but be prepared for some major boners in future-prediction. There are mountains of microfilm filling up vaults on the Moon, which I'm guessing the \\"robot brains\\" (computers) can read somehow. Slide rules still...rule. As another reviewer here said, it's more Ruritania than sf, but what the hey. Give it a read."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This is a story for everyone. Kids and adults can enjoy this story of intrigue and action. Set in the future includings mans exploration of the solar system. There are even Martions on Mars! I have read it many times and it has become one of my all time favorites!"},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This one isn't really \\"science fiction,\\" since, with only changes, it could be set in the here-and-now, or in Ruritania -- but it's pure Heinlein, and better written than many of his earlier works. At only 128 pages, it's also pretty short for a novel -- but it works. Lorenzo Smyth (a/k/a Larry Smith) is an actor convinced of his own talent (which, as it turns out, is actually considerable) who is hired to impersonate the Good Guy leader of a major political alliance, who has been kidnaped on Mars by the Evil Opposition. Against his better apolitical judgment, Lorenzo takes the job because it's a challenge, and almost immediately regrets it as the limited engagement spins itself out indefinitely. There's a minimum of strident overwriting of the sort Heinlein was often guilty of in pursuit of his moral and ethical positions, with the quietly-made exception of a plea for racial tolerance."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This short novel is typical Heinlein fare, which is IMHO quite good. In short, Double Star is the story of Lorenzo Smythe, a young actor full of himself who gets drawn into events larger than even his own ego.

In fact, if Hollywood is looking for a good story, this book would make a great movie. But as literature I just found it a little uninspired. Maybe I was expecting something else.

Many address political struggles, which this does.But very few actually have a political campaign -- in a Parliamentary System, not an American Congress style system -- as its central conflict. And no others I can think of use Theater as a central theme as well.Heinlein's protaganist is a method actor with sideruns into vaudeville -- those who believe the two are incompatible haven't worked in the trade, which I have. Lazlo comes across as an &quot;authentic&quot; actor. Self-important, delusional about his own importance in the universe, opinionated and terribly terribly refined and effete. But it never falls into parody (I worked with many Lazlos during my time as an actor, and was one more than once). Its hook -- later stolen wholesale for the movie &quot;Dave&quot; -- involves Lazlo being pulled into a role he doesn't want -- the impersonation of a kidnapped Minister of Parliament, and one of the most influential politicians alive. Complicating Lazlo's immersion into the role are his dislike of the man's politics and having to work with his staff, who revere the object of Lazlo's study and resent Lazlo's intrusion into his role.This book won a Hugo award and deserved it. It's a fun ride and highly enjoyable. Pick it up and lose yourself for a while"},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Probably one of the best written of Heinlein's novels, this slender book is more a character study than traditional gee-whiz science fiction. The hero is an actor chosen to impersonate a prominent political figure. The story, though set in typical Heinleinian future history, is largely the story of the actor growing into the role of, and eventually becoming the statesmen. Heinlein handles this somewhat hokey plot in a surprisingly effective way, eliciting considerable sympathy for the protagonist. Heinlein uses a traditional science fiction device, the growth of an immature hero in a novel environment. Heinlein used this device in a number of other books and its effective because it encourages readers to identify with the hero. In this case, however, the novel environment is less the future history that is the backdrop of the story than the world of politics and electioneering.I suspect that Heinlein may have originally planned a more complex and longer book. The doppelganger aspect of Double Star is mirrored by the unusual biology of the Martians who appear as minor characters. My guess is that Heinlein intended to do more with this aspect of the story but settled for a shorter and simpler plot. This book also reveals one of Heinlein's best features, his intense dislike of racism. Published in the mid-1950s, Double Star is partly a barely veiled attack on racial bigotry."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Winner of the 1956 Hugo Award for Best Novel, Double Star is a passable, light-hearted, political adventure story albeit with a pretty interesting main character -- Lawrence Smith (\\"The Great Lorenzo\\").The Plot (some Spoilers!)The actor Lawrence Smith is drinking his last money away in bar when a spaceman enters and attempts to hire him for a suspicious job. Smith initially refuses but is cajoled into assisting -- eventually they viciously kill some Martians who try to stop them (an aspect of the story which is never fully explained since all the other Martians are really nice).Slowly the extent of the job is revealed to Smith -- impersonate the prominent expansionist politician John Joseph Bonforte whose been kidnapped by his political enemies! Smith doesn't agree with Bonforte's politics and hates Martians -- Bonforte on the other hand is palls with the strange fission creatures and their stinky smells and half-brained children. This doesn't jive with the job he must perform as Bonforte -- a speech to the Martians so he can join their hive and eventually make them full citizens of the Earth Empire! Some hypnosis so Martians smell suddenly like perfume and before long Smith's internalized all the mannerism and traits of Bonforte. The plot thickens and Smith slowly is forced to win Bonforte's elections since the real politician's been temporarily mind-wiped... A visit to the Earth Emperor (A Constitutional Monarch) and his toy trains on the Moon spells potential disaster! Will he be caught? Will the real Bonforte recover?My ThoughtsSince Heinlein has \\"The Great Lorenzo\\" tell his tale in first-person, the transformation from an irrationally racist egotistical actor into Bonforte himself is well done and we get some fascinating insights into his mind. However, since the novel abruptly stops when Smith has to actually become Bonforte at all times the 'who actually am I' is never explored in much detail. However, this is a fun adventure with unbelievably silly aliens, dumb emperors with no power playing with trains....I think Heinlein realized that describing Martians is a futile endeavor -- hence they are but a back story here and even more of a back story in Stranger in a Strange Land. Also, what starts out as an adventure story quickly turns into a turgid political 'let's win the election story.' If only Heinlein buckled down and decided to be serious -- the Smith/Bonforte character deserves a better backdrop (especially since all the the other characters in the novel are interchangeable and dull). I remain unimpressed. If you like Heinlein, pick it up -- it in no way belongs in the ranks of Heinlein's best despite its awards..."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"I'm a big Heinlein fan but the book is not always entertaining.

It clearly was a different time and mindset.I did enjoy this book, I can not deny that. While it did not enrapt me, I was very curious to turn the page. But, when all was said and done, this book did not move me in any meaningful way, nor leave me with any new thoughts. I wouldn't quite call the book forgettable. In fact, as I was reading it I had some deja vu, and wondered if I had not read this once sometime in my past. But, it's not a story that makes me want to come back and read it again in the future.

Characters are using slide rules and fingerprints to prove their points. Not to mention the Martians running around Earth and Mars. Very talky not much else going on.

Not even a good escape novel."},{"Title":"What is art?","review":"Tolstoy's WAR AND PEACE is not really about war and peace, but about the passing of one generation into another as epitomized by the dichotomy of St. Petersburg and Moscow. His WHAT IS ART is a sad excuse for insight and scholarship. Much better to read master aesthetes, it is.For most of my life I struggled with such things as Truth, Beauty, Art. Then my mentor said I should read Ananda K. Coomaraswamy's CHRISTIAN AND ORIENTAL PHILOSOPHY OF ART (nee WHY EXHIBIT WORKS OF ART) and TRANSFORMATION OF NATURE IN ART. Succinctly put, art is the perfect combination of craft and vision. Beauty is NOT in the eye of the beholder; that is taste, and many people do prefer deformity. Beauty, rather, is the attractive power of perfection. Read Aristotle and Aquinas for further insight. And, oh, yes: Truth is Story, or as Kant said, the agreement of subject with object.I could not understand why such works as WAR AND PEACE and MOBY DICK, especially unabridged, were so highly regarded. True, I enjoyed them for the most part but I always felt that an editor like Max Perkins would have held Tolstoy' and Melville's feet to the fire and transformed both books into flawless works of art. Then I read Percy Lubbock's watershed THE CRAFT OF FICTION and Sigrid Undset's KRISTIN LAVRANSDATTER, a far better book than W&P; or MD.Tolstoy is an enigma; he could write well and terribly."},{"Title":"What is art?","review":"If you have any real interest in art you must own this book.

Tolstoy was a far greater artist than a theoretician of Art. His resentment of Shakespeare is a misreading, and his favoring one particular kind of Art shows him somehow striving to be ' hedgehog ' when he is truly the fox. Tolstoy would be Tolstoy for the world without this essay. With it alone and his other polemical prose writings he would not be the great artist , one of the greatest writers mankind has known."},{"Title":"What is art?","review":"Tolstoy has the aesthetic/philosophical insight of a thin-lipped Puritan. His conclusions are dogmatic and authoritarian. What is art, according to Tolstoy? That which gives communal emotional expression in glory of God. All else is vanity, alas: mere self-indulgent Hedonism. Follow the precepts in this book and watch your horizons begin to narrow. The fact that Tolstoy was a distinguished novelist and that he spent so much time thinking about these matters is of no consequence. As many have said before, Tolstoy was a very good novelist but a very bad philosopher."},{"Title":"What is art?","review":"then perhaps you ought to read this book by one of the greatest writers ever. Tolstoy was a man of vast knowledge and he displays that here with his meticulous study of beauty and what it means, which leads him to his own definition of Art. Art, he says, is whenever you, the artist, has transmitted his/her feelings to a universal audience. Clearness, simplicity, brevity, and comprehension are qualities of a work of art. Surprisingly, most people disregard this book while at the same time they put all his other books on a higher pedastal than the author himself does by his own definition! You tell me...but I think Tolstoy was on to something..."},{"Title":"What is art?","review":"I'm surprised that nobody (so far) has commented on the physical aspects of this book, Because the original is so old - written in 1899 after sixteen years of thought-it is now a rare book This then, is printed using a patented Print on Demand technology. It is printed using a robot that turns and photographs each page. Since the book has been re-typeset, page numbers change and there is no index or table of contents. Also, there are a number of typos. However, none of this really matters as far as the actual content of the thought is concerned and the typos are not too distracting.\\"What Is Art\\"is an interesting read with many aspects applicable to today. For example, in discussing the definition of \\"beauty\\", Tolstoy observes, \\"As is always the case, the more cloudy and confused the conception conveyed by a word, with the more aplomb and self-assurance do people use that word, pretending what is understood by it is so simple and clear that it is not worth while even to discuss what it actually means.\\" Along with gems of insights, Tolstoy betrays his own prejudices as he is against nudity (\\"female nakedness\\"), even referring to a ballet as a \\"lewd performance\\". He dislikes Wagner, all of Beethoven's later works and the whole Impressionist movement - which, of course, was new back then. However, he is also against realism, \\"When we appraise a work according to its realism, we only show that we are talking, not of a work of art, but of its counterfeit\\". He also dislikes art schools- but not art education in public schools-, critics, art about art, and the idea of grants to artists. He believed that artists should earn their living in the real world, so as not to lose a connection to regular life. For this, he conveniently overlooks the fact that his inheritance of vast tracts of land worked by peasants enabled him to pursue his own career. He has great hopes for the role of art creating brotherhood among man. \\"Art should cause violence to be set aside\\".Tolstoy's main point is that art is real art if the artist was sincere in his feelings about the subject and that viewers were then \\"infected\\" with the feeling. \\"The chief peculiarity of this feeling is that the receiver of a true artistic impression is so united to the artist that he feels as if the work were his own and not some one elses- as if what it expresses were just what he had been longing to express\\". This brings us to deeper thinking about just what it is that we are trying to convey in works of art. For any artist who likes to think about conveying feeling, I would also recommend a more modern outlook on this subject- Creative Authenticity by Ian Roberts- 16 Principles to Clarify and Deepen your Artistic Vision"},{"Title":"What is art?","review":"Tolstoy unleashes an intellectual argument as only he can as he provides a classical insight into the definition of art. Filled with lashings against Church Christianity and praise for true Chrisitanity, and more lashings against universal art that is unoriginal and full of sexual erotica, Tolstoy argues that true art is reflective of the religious consciousness of the age and is measured by its degree of infectuousness to the consumer. It is valued by having particularity, clarity, and sincerity of feeling from the artist. Keep in mind this was written at the end of his life in the 19th century. Tolstoy also argues that governmental endowments given to art that only satisifes the sensual desires of the upper class is a great abuse of the millions of common people that work hard but will never even see the art, art that was produced at incredible expense using their money. In summary, Tolstoy offers a timeless definition of art."},{"Title":"What is art?","review":"Do you have thoughts like &quot;well, maybe it's just me... They say Monet is great, but perhaps I just don't understand it...&quot; I say, maybe it's your own gut that tells you what is the true art and what is not!This work by Tolstoy is a summary of his 15 year spiritual journey and research of art and what it's all about. And who is the author! A genius himself! In this piece he tells us in plain language that the whole art of his century (with a few exceptions) is a product of a rotten class of people, a select few, whose main concerns were far from being common with the feelings of any normal human being. &quot;Art, nowadays, is for pleasure, not for bringing moral values in the form of genuine feelings to a reader&quot;. This is basically the general idea of the work. At first, you feel dumbfounded reading this, but after a few pages, his statements start to make sense. Only a true moral feeling expressed in the right form, not necessarily beautiful, but understandible and to the point, is a true piece of art.Now, let's go back and think for minute: do I really like Sheakspeare or is it the literary criticism the makes me feel that I am not a fully cultured person unless I acknowledge Sheakspeare as the greatest of all, or at least one of the greatest writers (playwrights) ever? Even if I think that he was too verbose and vague to begin with? That sometimes you read him and whole paragraphs go by without you fully understanding what he's talking about? Mind you, he wrote for the theater, which means characters' sentences need to be pretty concise and clear, so that the audience could follow them. Anyway, Tolstoy will help you understand this problem.His main idea, again, is for art to convey the feelings of fraternity and love to the reader, not sexual desires, fake patriotism, shovinism or those exquisite feelings of the upper class. Art is about compassion, love, oneness of all people and good healthy humor. I totally agree with that.One more thing: in this work, Tolstoy confronts the idea of goodness with the idea of beauty, saying that for the sake of beauty, the contemporary artists disregard goodness. This a very controversial statement, in my opinion, but there is a point there...Also recommended: of course, War and Peace, Anna Karenina, Resurrection, Childhood, Boyhood &amp; Youth, as true standards of literature, by which you can judge the works of others. All other fiction by Tolstoy is just as great and easy to read, especially his short stories, such as &quot;Master and Man&quot;, &quot;The Forged Coupon&quot;, etc. His other less known works that are revolutionary by their essence, are &quot;My Confession&quot;, &quot;What is My Belief (Religion)&quot; and especially (really hard to find) &quot;Critique of Dogmatic Theology&quot;, where he expounded his views on religion and traditional Church Christianity with all its absurd, useless dogmas, which only divert your attention from what Christ really taught. This is a very controversial work, which was prohibited in Russia of his day, but which is certainly worth reading. By the way, why doesn't Everyman's Library publish it?"},{"Title":"What is art?","review":"It's important not to get sidetracked by Tolstoy's particular opinions on the various works of art he discusses, but instead to focus on the methods he uses to decide if a so-called work of art is worthwhile or not. Otherwise, you will get nothing from this besides an opportunity to compare your own particular taste to that of Tolstoy's. The most important thing I took away from this book was the desire to revisit my own favorite works and ask whether they were authentic or counterfeit. Whether Tolstoy and I came to the same conclusions regarding a particular work is irrelevant.That being said, Tolstoy betrays his own ignorance in certain areas. He dismisses the late Beethoven because, as the composer could not hear his own works, they must therefore be incoherent and unlistenable. However, since Beethoven had perfect pitch, as do many composers and performers, it was not necessary for him to be able to listen to his compositions. In fact, many composers of the day typically wrote without instruments in front of them, and considered it the mark of an amateur to compose \\"at the piano.\\" The works of Beethoven's late period were at least 75 years ahead of their time; as Beethoven himself remarked, they were written for future generations anyway.Tolstoy's synopsis of the Ring of the Nibelungs, and his description of a performance, may be some of his most humorous writing (perhaps intentionally so), and if the reader peruses only one section of this book, this should be the one. Of course, we have the benefit of hindsight; Wagner was not funny at the time, but a hundred years later, Wagnerian opera is a staple of low comedy. Tolstoy is to be commended for recognizing this at a time when Wagner's work was considered the highest art imaginable.At the essay's conclusion, Tolstoy for some reason briefly applies his standard of value to science - research that leads to knowledge of how men should treat each other is good, but pure research for its own sake, or to satisfy one's curiosity, is not. So sociology and psychology are useful, but astronomy and paleontology are not. Whether or not I have correctly interpreted Tolstoy's position is not important. This section is too brief to do the argument justice, and should have either been expanded or left out. Science and art are two entirely separate realms, and positing one as a subset of the other requires at the very least a lengthy essay of its own.Tolstoy's observation that great art reflects the dominant religious ideal of its time is unarguable. He observes that the religious ideal of his own time was the \\"brotherhood of man,\\" and a little thought will reveal that this is the ideal of our own time as well, common to all modern religions and independent of creed or doctrine."},{"Title":"What is art?","review":"Well written book. Very logical. Art seperate from aesthetics is an interesting concept. This book is a good conversation starter, and does a good job of getting the gears turning. A pretty good read for anyone interested in thinking about art, especially its implications on culture."},{"Title":"What is art?","review":"Tolstoy, in his magical, down-to-earth way discusses the wanton waste of money and time on sculptures, paintings, etc. that should never be called &quot;ART.&quot; If something is designed purely for erotic satisfaction, it should not be called &quot;ART.&quot; Even when a bizarre creation attracts thousands of viewers, the adoring crowds do not validate the creation, but the creator who supports his/her career via their pocketbooks!Tolstoy's scathing and unapologetic look at 'Art History' can still be argued in our own culture. The times have changed but mankind has not. I would venture to say that Generation X understands very little about true artistic works, we are so bombarded with commercialism and materialism. We are only interested in what gives us erotic and material pleasure. But in the long run, temporal and vainglorious things did not satisfy Tolstoy and his contemporaries, and will not satisfy us either."},{"Title":"What is art?","review":"This book is very readable with a lot of factual history. There was a lot of interesting information. I would recommend this book to my friends."},{"Title":"What is art?","review":"In this piece Tolstoy asks the hard questions about art by going back to basics: What is art? What is beauty? What is truth? His education and, more importantly, his experience and thought on the subject, force us to realize that we don't have any easy answers. And these are definitely questions that are not satisfied by easy answers. They are also questions that are more important than the answers themselves. These questions take us beyond the answers by forcing us to be sincere with ourselves. Sentas and solas aren't enough.For his part, Tolstoy makes it clear that this is a subject where he knows the thought of the important thinkers on art (all of them, apparently, of any significance), knows the history of the philosophy of art itself, and knows how to think (which he urges us to do). He also makes it clear that the question of what is art is, for him (and should be for us), more than an intellectual exercise. So if we want to be educated about art we have to let go of our non-ideas, open our minds to the thoughts of others, and admit to ourselves that we probably don't know much about art&#8212;and may not know much more about it even after reading Tolstoy's thoughts on art. But at least we'll know that much, and that's a pretty good place to start. We can all draw our own conclusions about what art is and what it means to us, as well as to Tolstoy. I don't want to be the one that tries to sum up the Count's thinking on the subject, but I don't think he would argue too much if I suggest that Keats has summed it up pretty well in his Ode on a Grecian Urn: &#34;Beauty is truth, truth beauty, &#8212; That is all that Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.&#34;"},{"Title":"What is art?","review":"This is a classic, a gem, a beautiful statement of the nature of art.

I have a library of the Ancient Christian Writers series of many more Patristic authors, and have studied unabridged versions of their works, but I found myself looking for something accessible for a friend recently. After researching the matter, I bought two copies of this work - one for my friend and one for me.Richardson and company take the earliest and best non-canonical Christian literature and present it, edited, in a handy volume that contains not only preforatory material for each letter, but also helpful footnotes and study aids.Many people don't know that before the close of the age of the Apostles that Clement of Rome was penning a letter to the Corinthians (AD 95 or so), the same group that had given Paul so many headaches 40 years earlier. This letter starts of this work. Next, we move on to the kind, gentle Bishop Ignatius of Antioch. About AD 110, as he was being transported to Rome for his execution as a Christian, he wrote letters to Churches along the way exhorting them to continue in faithfulness. About the middle of the second century, Bishop Polycarp of Smyrna - a disciple of John the Apostle - wrote a letter to the Phillipians. That letter is in here. Next, his martyrdom is recounted in another early Christian document.And on it goes. The Didache (or The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles) probably contains material from both the first and second centuries AD. It's a sort of manual on what Christian worship, procedure and organization should be. The so-called Second Letter of Clement follows that in which second century Christian living is described.The second century Apologists are represented in the letter of \\"Mathetes\\" to Diognetus. This horatory letter is a Christian justification of the faith to a friendly pagan. Next, Justin (surnamed \\"Martyr\\" for his later martyrdom) explains Christianity in Greek terms, as does Athenagoras who follows him in this book.Finally, there's a segment of Irenaeus's \\"Against Heresies\\" in which the Bishop of Lyons articulately defends \\"traditional\\" Christianity and scripture from abuses of those who possessed, in his words, \\"knowledge, falsely so-called.\\" In short, Irenaeus combats the Gnostic heresies of his day.The greatest value of this book is in showing the vitality of early Christianity as it - although persecuted - handled the business of not just surviving, but appealing to the hearts and minds of the citizens of the Roman Empire and Greek culture of its time.For additional, scholarly works, see Quasten's Patrology or the Ancient Christian Writers series from Newman Press."},{"Title":"EARLY CHRISTIAN FATHERS.","review":"Cyril C.

I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in biographical information pertaining to the Early Chirstian Fathers."},{"Title":"EARLY CHRISTIAN FATHERS.","review":"This book gives very readable translations of most of the 2nd-century's most important Christian documents (the earliest writings of the outside of the New Testament). In fact, a couple of the documents may even slip into the late 1st century. It's a fascinating look at theology, church politics, and the current events that were being dealt with by the early church. The introductions to the pieces are excellent, giving clear commentary on the historical background of each piece of literature without trying to push a single interpretation of dating or authorship.My only disappointment was the lack of inclusion of Shepherd of Hermas. As early, unique, and influential as that writing was, it really deserved a place here. Otherwise the selected material wonderfully covers the spectrum of Christian writing that we know of from that era."},{"Title":"EARLY CHRISTIAN FATHERS.","review":"\\"Of special interest to the scholar is the extensive book list included in the volume.\\" Concordia theologicalFathers of the Church:Who could rightly be called an 'Early Church Father'? Keep in mind that a 'Father of the Church' is not an ecclesiastically conferred distinction for which the Eastern Orthodox or the Roman Catholics have an undisputed list, as is the case of its teachers 'Doctor of the Church.' Early Church Fathers is a title that came to be applied to few early Christian role models who led by their truthful faith, holy living, and orthodox teaching, that the ancient churches of Alexandria, Antioch and Rome gradually accepted them as practical interpreters of Christianity. Their qualification would seem to fit the apostles, along with early Christians of the New Testament like Timothy, who is never referred to as Early Church Father. On the other hand, there are some of those regarded as \\"Fathers of the Church,\\" whose generally orthodox teaching was marred by some doctrinal controversy (e.g. Origen), or whose lives were far from being exemplary (e.g. Hippolytus).Early Fathers Writings:The Writings of those early Christian writers produced in the first and second centuries, were referred to as the Apostolic Fathers. Ante Nicene writings of the Fathers from Clement of Rome to Athanasius cover the period from the close of the New Testament writings down to the Council of Nicea (AD 325). The authors of these writings were considered to be the next generation of Apostles and as a result were named The Apostolic Fathers. Perceived by many scholars to be the most important collection of post-New Testament writings, a number of these texts were in fact considered for the Canon of the New Testament but dropped later. A good example was Dydimus the blind, eminent dean of Alexandrine Didascalia, reverence for 'The Shepherd of Hermas' considering as one of the most inspired of all writings, and it is included in the Sinaiticus Codex.Cyril Richardson work:This is one of the best books on the \\"Early Church Fathers\\" of the second century, essential for understanding the thought and exegetical writings of the Church Fathers, who lived and wrote during the founding time of the early church. This first volume of The Library of Christian Classics, long acclaimed for its quality translations, contains most of the basic Christian writings of the first two centuries of the Christian Church, with the exception of the Epistle of Barnabas, and the Shepherd of Hermas. These patristic guides are very helpful, providing introductions, explanatory notes, and indices. The series ensures that modern English translations of some of the most significant Christian works are available for scholars and students, allowing searching readers to better understand the early Christian church. Describing this representative work as introductory overlooks the fact that, for the reader to appreciate the writings, he should have a knowledge of Early Church History, as narrated by H. Chadwick, or even some exposure to the Fathers thought in Historical Theology, as exposed by J. Danielou, translated into English by eminent Patristic RPC Hanson.Cyril Richardson work is partly complemented with Lightfoot's classic 'The Apostolic Fathers', recently revised by M. Holmes.Those novice readers who want to read selections from the fathers writings, in order to determine the turning points in Church doctrine are thus advised to explore H. Bettenson's The early Christian fathers (Clement of Rome to Athanasius) since the latter was the first of the fathers who dramatically influenced Christian thought beyond Nicea."},{"Title":"EARLY CHRISTIAN FATHERS.","review":"Catholics and Protestants both tend to see their distinctive doctrines reflected not only in Scripture, but also in the early Church fathers. Richardson tends to steer in the middle: He presents various doctrines as being in germ-form, or developmental in nature.Consider, for example, the papacy. Richardson avoids the extremes of seeing the papacy directly traceable to Christ and the papacy as a centuries-later invention. With reference to Clement, he comments: \\"This implies more than a casual relation with other churches; and while this should not be pressed to vindicate much later papal claims, it does indicate that the Roman community took most seriously its responsibility as a sister church for the welfare of other congregations. Here, in germ, is that exercise of authority which was to become the papal primacy.\\" (p. 36).In like manner, Richardson takes a middle view of the validity of apostolic succession. He believes that the Greek of Clement's first letter is compatible with either an \\"episcopal\\" or a \\"presbyterian\\" interpretation of early church government (pp. 63-64).Richardson treats other doctrines in much the same manner. All in all, the reader can appreciate Richardson's fairness and objectivity."},{"Title":"EARLY CHRISTIAN FATHERS.","review":"A good book for prominent church fathers, but I was looking for a book including those less well known.

Being the nosey person that I am, I began to do my homework on this new fellow. The career path I discovered was both admirable and impressive. What was even more amazing was Matthew's willingness to share his experience with others (through his books). I cannot say enough about how appreciative I am of the time Matthew took in writing down both experiences and learning curves, and putting them into his book.The book itself is excellent. The flow is perfect, which is the most important aspect. It begins where it should and takes you along the appropriate route. Exactly what was needed! Through his book, I was able to review many terms and concepts, and what was most useful was that I learned many new concepts, terms, and ideas that I did not previously know nor think about. That is the greatest asset in education, opening one's mind towards concepts that we have not considered or known about.

Matthew Martinez is someone that virtually anyone can relate to. He shows us how he turned a small nest egg into financial independence. Matthew started one property at a time while also holding a full-time job. I found the information very valuable that he grew his real estate portfolio while also working full-time to support himself.

I have often wished that I had my own \\"mentor\\" to coach me and do the deal with me, as I was still not quite confident enough to go forth and invest. Reading Mr. Martinez' book, I feel like I have that mentor with me, not only telling me exactly what to look for, but how to evaluate it, how to do it, and through his experience, what to look out for. Reading his book, I have now had the confidence to make my first purchase!I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Martinez right before his book was published and found his wealth of experience far belies his age (late 30's). His business acumen far surpasses many people twice his age, and his down-to-earth manner makes him readily accessible and willing to share his experiences and guidance. Early in our discussion I asked him, quite seriously, if I could just give him my investment money and have him put it to work for him/me, and just as a true mentor would, he told me that I could make so much more for myself if I just did it myself! He offered to answer any questions I had, and told me that while the first property may seem like the largest hurdle, once done, I would be on my way to real estate confidence (and income!). His mentoring (via the one-time meeting and much more importantly, this book) has paid off in my first real estate purchase!Every STRONG real estate investor (those not did not just ride the real estate wave and/or are now going under in the challenging real estate market) will say that they had a mentor, someone who took them under their wings and helped them.

An excellent book I have no problem recommending.Mike Summey, co-author The Weekend Millionaire Book Series"},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"I should have known better than to buy a real estate book that was published in 2006. This book was obviously written right at the absolute peak of the real estate market and the author's experience and examples are from 2002-2005, which were arguably the best times in history to be in real estate. If you're picking up this book today, you'll immediately see a lot of advice that just doesn't make sense in today's economy and real estate market.That isn't to say there isn't any good information in the book, because there is. Some of the advice surrounding being a property investor and landlord still apply today, and many of the basic tactics involved in analyzing markets and buying properties remain true. But aside from this information you're more or less reading about the experience of someone who made it big during the best boom years in real estate by using a lot of leverage and taking advantage of incredible short-term appreciation to amass his wealth. If you tried to mimic everything in the book today, you'd be nowhere near as successful. These days you don't go out and buy a property with little money down, realize 10-20% equity gains in a single year and then tap into that equity to finance your next deal, and so on.This book is mainly trying to sell the dream. Just based on the title alone you can tell it was marketed toward people at the peak of the real estate boom and wanted to quit their job and get rich just buying up property. That's still the dream of many today, but this book won't give you all the answers to accomplish that in today's economy. I'd suggest a more recent book if you want to get a better idea of what it takes to make it in the business these days.

Matt Martinez has created a book that takes a down-to-earth approach to investing in real estate. Unlike many books that give you broad overviews of investing Matt has taken one single approach (multifamily properties) and broken it down to the essential points.I really enjoyed the story telling style of the first part of the book where Matt teaches by example, walking us through his first deals. Not only do we see the numbers but just as importantly how Matt came to owning these properties.If you are wondering what a \\"good deal\\" is for a multifamily property then you will find Chapter 8 \\"Evaluating Deals\\" worth the price of admission. In this chapter the author actually takes us through a deal and tells us what we should pay for a property. Not some double talk about it depending on your situation, but what we should actually pay! Even if you don't know NOI from a Cap Rate you can work through the numbers from your own deals with this chapter.Each chapter is summarized with a \\"Lessons Learned\\" section. This is extremely helpful for folks like me who have a five minute attention span. In these segments Matt reminds us of the essential information we need to take away to become successful investors.

The author provides similar arguments about our schools preparing us to have jobs and not to become entrepreneurs. Let's face it, many people simply hate their jobs, hate doing nonsense work that only benefits their companies, and would leave in a heartbeat if only they could do it financially. The title of this book may suggest a quick way to get rich, but it is not. This book is not intended to make you the next Donald Trump, but to teach you how to replace your salary with income generated from rental properties.I always believed that employees are underpaid. At least that's what I always thought when I had regular jobs. I absolutely loved Karl Marx's explanation that the author used. Marx said that employers cannot pay you what you are worth because the company relies on exploiting you for their profit. Their profit is the difference between what you are worth and what they are paying you. If the company paid you what you are worth, then it would go out of business.The author proposes that investors should acquire income-producing properties while they are young and let the tenants pay them off so that they can live off the rental revenue stream during retirement.

Enjoyed the book. Very well structured content, great explanations laid out about every aspect of rental properties. I won't apply too much of it in the immediate future, but when I have the means, you can rest assured That I'll apply what I've learned.I think the best advice was to get into it for the long haul. You rightly discourage \\"flipping\\" and the quick buck nonsense that got so many people into trouble recently. I don't think a better or more realistic strategy exists for investing in RP's than what you Laid out. Keeping the NOI low, and the cash flow high, is what its all about.My basic analogy is dividend-paying blue chip stocks. You hold onto enough of them, and you can live off the dividends, and sell off what you please, when you need to. The prob with the quick-flippers, who by the way are alive and well and crawling all over Texas as we speak, is they are focused on exit strategies, almost to the exclusion of building value over time. Building value is almost antithetical to their whole mind-ser, which unfortunately leaves a wake of bad loans and overpriced real estate in their wake.Case in point was Las Vegas and South Florida, neither of which have the income levels from locals that can prop up an area over time.Funny as it sounds, its not terribly unlike propping up Muncie, Indiana or Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The game was predicated to collapse over time, and collapse they did.Conversely, your method builds up properties and areas, and adds values to properties, for the investors' AND the communities' benefit.It's a solid, long-term strategy that will put more money in your wallet over the long term, after all is said and done.Classic turtle and hare situation. In this case hares are quick-flippers. They leave town almost as quickly as they arrive.Sometimes they walk away with a lot of cash, just as often they are left holding the bag, as the majority of them are all over the sunbelt as we speak. I strongly hope your methodology gets out there in a big way, for the benefit of investors AND communities both."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"The book gave his account of how he continually acquired real estate properties and became a very successful real estate investor.

It's now nearly impossible to acquire a investment property with only 10% down and most people no longer have the equity in their homes to do what he did in 2002.He does make some very good points about skipping the properties that don't produce monthly income and I like his strategies to avoid equity-only investing.

The author does a very good job of presenting his journey as clear and simple as possible while ensuring to also provide a realistic view of the risks and pitfalls of real estate that he encountered along the way to his current success. I recommend this book for anyone who is just startingout or as a refresher to the novice such as myself who has just recently entered the exciting world of real estate."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"I've been searching for the right real estate book for a while now. I am a CPA/financial advisor who has been a real estate investor but needed more knowledge.This book is definetely a unique book that opened my eyes and made me see things that I wasn't seeing before.I definitely recommend to anyone who wants to be a millionare in the few years."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"I have read many real estate books. I have learned more from Matt's book than most of the other books. I'm reading these books hopefully so I can learn how to be profitable in the real estate business. This book is not based on hype."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"I have started other books on real estate investing but quickly lost interest and never finished any of them. I read this entire book in under two days. Mr. Martinez has broken down the steps and given a clear strategy that even an inexperienced person such as myself can understand and implement."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"Overall it's a good book but he does give some rather shady advice such as how to obtain financing for down payments. He says things like \\"family and friends\\" \\"private investors\\" \\"hard money lenders\\" The only real way to obtain money is really to just work 2 jobs while living at your parents house for a year or two making huge sacrifices, but he doesn't say this...Also, this book was written in 2006 before the big real estate crash. Would his leveraging plan still have worked? I don't know.. Maybe I'll have to read his new book.All in all, it's only 10 dollars. There are a lot of good things he does say. Good explanation on CAP rates. And he does make a strong argument on why owning multi-family houses/apartments is better than owning multiple condos or single family homes."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"I found this book easy to read. The terminology was simple, the concepts mundane and the investment strategy easy to follow. Anyone wishing to invest in Real Estate could do so following the author's concepts."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"I am very glad that I read this book first. It provides just the right amount of inspiration and information. But after reading more detailed books about value-play strategies and finacial analysis, you quickly learn that this book is designed for novices. That is not a bad thing in itself. But be sure that you know why you are buying it.I gave this book four stars because it touches upon everything you need to know about real estate investing. 'Touches upon' is the key phrase here, because Martinez fails to go into any specific detail about anything. To his defense, this book was not designed to do that. It was designed to show you that there's really not much to it. Success does not take a ton of money, and it does not take a genius. But it does take hard work and dedication.If you want in depth detail on financing, financial anaysis, and 1031 exchanges (etc), finish this book and then go pick up a book that focuses on those aspects of investing (and is likely 2x thicker). Do not buy this book expecting it to be a one-stop shop for everything you need to know. Use it as a primer (to find out how much you don't know) and then continue your education. I think Martinez did a fine job, and accomplished what he set out to do with this book."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"The title is a little deceptive... \\"2 years to a million in real estate\\" made me assume he is talking about INCOME within 2 years, instead he is talking about HOLDINGS... several buildings which total about a mil, which he probably owes close to a mil on.He used a strategy to pull out equity from previous properties and his primary residence to finance his new purchases, sometimes on interest-only mortgages... high LTVs, risky stuff. I'd like to see how it's playing out right now, but if it's working and he's still able to cash flow the units, GREAT! Otherwise, I'd be a little concerned as the markets plummet 20% per year in some areas.AT THE SAME TIME, he said that after he did a few of these, he was able to quit his job, living just on the cash flow from his properties, WHICH IS AWESOME I THINK... It's hard to make properties cash flow, especially in areas like Boston where this guy is from. If he bought in good neighborhoods, I think he did a decent job."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"i was reluctant to get this book because the title sounded like a marketing pitch and i hate those type of people/books.but when i started reading, i knew this guy knew what he was talking about. i still dont like the title and the 2M part is just a small part of the book. he showed how his portofolio grew to 2M in just 2 yrs. the rest of the book is filled with great ideas, examples, a few equations.Just a great overall book. it's my fifth or sixth book on this subject and this one is the best, IMO. it talkes about CAP rate, how to deal with section 8 contracts (and the details behind it), how to build a great team that will help you works smart, not hard.Of course the author benefited greatly from the rising house prices in boston in the mid 2000's, but that's not what i focused on. I focused on the examples and the suggestions sprinkled in this book.highly recommend it."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"What immediately sucked me into this book was the personal story of how Matt Martinez became a real estate investor. He had concern for his job security, and his drive to liberate himself from his job made him obsessed about finding the right properties. Unlike any other real estate investment book, Matt's story is personal, real, and achievable for people who have the discipline to achieve their own financial independence - sooner rather than later. Other books tend to say \\"I borrowed $5000 from a friend and now look at me, I'm rich!\\" Martinez is different. His first property required a lot of research and he financed it with an equity loan from his own house. He then leveraged the equity in his other properties over 2 years to build enough passive income to quit his job. Then when the headaches of managing the properties became too great, he sold them and acquired a larger apartment building and hired a property management firm to take care of it for him. His strategy changed from triplexes and four-unit buildings to multi-unit, multi-story apartment buildings all over the nation.There is good technical info in here as well about methods to keep units rented, how improvements can attract higher rents, finding a property with a good cap rate, and so on. Cap rate was a term I had heard but didn't fully understand until I read it in this book (also described very completely in \\"What Every Real Estate Investor Needs to Know about Cashflow... by Frank Gallinelli).I am greatly looking forward to his next book on investing in the new economy. This one was written prior to 2008. Before, it might have been easy to secure a home equity line of credit (HELOC), and then draw upon it to produce a down payment for an investment property. With just the right property even the payments on the principle + HELOC could be covered and there may still be enough for positive cash flow. How is it possible to obtain this financing today with banks now gunshy about the housing market? Martinez will evidently address this in his next book, which should be coming out shortly."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"Ive purchased a few of the highly recommended real estate books on Amazon and this one takes the cake. Some RE books simply put me to sleep but this is a Very easy ready with powerful information. Once i picked it up, i couldn't put it down and finished the book in a few hours. Seems to get right to the heart of the matter where other books spend a ton of time on fluff. Note: this book was written during the real estate boom which skews things a little. But the key pts still apply. Highly recommend"},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"This book attracted me because it was related to a subject I adore:Real Estate! Specifically how to get into Multi-family ('Commercial Residential') propertyinvesting and purchasing.Much like David Lindahls Commercial Property 101 (Trump University), it is writtenin simple, easy to understand language. There are a couple of basic worksheets to follow and use whenanalysing your next 'deal' and provides examples of the right property to buy - something that will becash flow positive from Day One. I've been a real estate investor since the age of 21, and perhaps was privy to theworld of real estate since the age of 5 when my mother was a real estate corporate leasing specialist,sometime property developer and also investor, however like so many in the wolrd today have alsobeen caught up by the global financial crisis initiated by the sub-prime collapse.Looking back I shoudlve have borrowed more because as Trump once said: \\"Banks go after the oneswho owe 'a million or less', but want to work with you when you owe them millions if not billions!\\".I'm not saying this was the best statement by the Donald, however it does let you in on how a billionairereally thinks.I mention 'Year' in the title because this was written in 2006, perhaps when housing/property priceswere at record prices. While published in this year the advice held within this book could actually (and perhaps finally)truly be utilised in the buyers markets that we are seeing now, withall the foreclosures, bank collapses etc that we read about.In summary, if you're holding cash, read this book, take action by making offers becauseas sure I am of anything you CAN find the type of cash flow dealswritten about in the book now more than ever."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"This book is definitely not a get rich quick scheme despite the title; it is a biographincal account providing lessons learned and suggestions for avoiding pitfalls and capitalizing on opportunities. Martinez does a good job of gettig that bit of extra info across to the aspiring investor who is serious about real estate. He has good ideas for helping think outside the box on financing and brings up great points about the actual process of being a landlord. I found his suggestions on leveraging capital especially helpful. A great read for the new investor/landlord or investor who has come to a wall in terms of financing additional properties."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"Best resource on Real Estate tranactions for beginners and old pros. Having been an accountant for 30+ years, \\"2 YEARS TO A MILLION IN REAL ESTATE\\" has opened a window of opportunity revealing a doorway to a new career. READ IT, you'll gain insite and equip yourself with TOOLS for the FUTURE!"},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"This book is a very good resource for those who are starting out in residential real estate investments. Matt's experience is quite extraordinary, but what I benefitted from most were the practical parts - examples of standard leases, addendums for leases, having a locksmith create a key system with a master for all properties, how to make your property more secure, what to watch out for when you accept a security deposit...the list is almost endless. Definitely worth the purchase price."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"Wow.. Matthew Martinez has really done an extraordinary job on writing this book. It teaches you all the insides and outs of the real estate market. He has done an impressive job on making this book easy to understand and follow for something that is VERY informative. For a realtor like myself, I have found this book more than necessary to grasp an understanding of how to find good investments and how to calculate your profit. I highly recommend it!!!"},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"I like the format of the book, also i like the fact how he gave a little of his experience of real estate. Some writiers just touch the surface of the water, they just don't go enough depth. Overall i enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"This book is one of the best books I've read on real estate investing. It is full of very valuable information that will help anyone thinking of investing in real estate, and also give some useful tips to already current investors. I'd suggest this book to everyone."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"In spite of the inspirational title this is NOT a get rich quick infomercial style real estate scheme. You feel the author's pain as he describes the tenant who doubled his water bill filling up the neighbor's pool. Then he explains the micro-economics of how that increase in expense effects his property value. As a real estate broker with a good grasp of the market, I found that he does both an excellent job describing property investing fundamentals, but then applying them to specific properties. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"Like most people considering buying this book, Matt did not start his real estate career with a large sum of money for down payments. He did not receive gift loans from relatives; he was simply the average American with a day job and no huge savings.His principle is based on leverage and using OPM (other peoples money). To the skeptic and beginners the last sentence might read something like \\"His principles are based on taking HUGE RISKS\\" but this is not true. All successful real estate investors use significant leverage. But the key, which he explains is having the knowledge. Risk, is therefore, simply having a lack of knowledge on the subject and Matt is the bridge maker who will close the gap for you.The great thing about this book is that it is \\"Fluff Free\\". Matt does not just give you a basic principle and then follow with zero detail (which is a major criticism of the great Robert Kiyosaki books). Instead, all 182 pages are packed full of \\"need to know\\" information. There are even several appendixes after the 182 pages that give you quotes, further suggested readings, and samples of letters/forms you will need in your own real estate business. I took notes the entire time I read this book and ended up with 20 pages in Microsoft Word, this book is the real deal.One last word. Undoubtedly, like anything in the world there will always be a few skeptics. Scattered throughout all of the positive feedback on Amazon you will see a comment or two of criticism, do not let this scare you. Everyone has heard the old clich&eacute;, \\"misery loves company\\" so don't fall for into these people's traps. If you take the time to read this book and take action on what you have learned success will be inevitable."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"I think Matthew's book is a good read for the beginning/ intermediate real estate investor. I am 33-years-old and pretty well versed in real estate, having my RE license in CA and having done probably 3-4 personal deals, but the book opened my eyes to some new ideas. For example, Matthew elaborates on a plethora of unique ways to fill a vacancy, how to evaluate in detail potential investment properties, different ways to get financing for down payments, etc. He also lists a ton of other real estate investment books to reference.I think the main thing I have come to realize from reading his book is that cashflow is king. Building a million dollars in equity really is not the point. Receiving a nice monthly cashflow stream from buying the right properties is what it is about. After I read his book I started evaluating certain investment markets which showed me that you can realistically have probably $50k- $200k to put down and be able to cashflow $1k- $4k a month, which I personally would consider a pretty nice start. And if you're worth a million and own the right cashflowing properties? Well, I'll be writing a book like Matthew at that point!"},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"The book follows the author on his path to success through real estate management/investment. When I reached the point in the book where the author made his first real estate investment purchase in the summer of 2002 I paused to consider the housing market he succeeded in. With a copyright of 2006, the author must have generated the bulk of his successes between 2002 and late 2005/early 2006 - heady times for the real estate market. His claim that the book will \\"... teach you how to duplicate my achievements...\\" is questionable given the present housing market. If he were starting out today would he have achieved so much so fast?The book is easy to read and I like the way points are summarized at the end of each chapter. I'm just concerned that someone whose advice is based upon an experience gained during very favorable housing market conditions might not hold up under tougher times."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"I stumbled upon this book by reading the author's complementary review of Larry Loftis' book on duplexes, triplexes and quads. I thought it spoke well of the author to write a nice review of a \\"competitor\\" so I gave the book a shot.I was pleasantly surprised. The book is EXTREMELY complete. (In fact, I preferred it to Loftis' excellent book) The first several chapters deal with the author's beginning as a dot com worker who started to dabble in multi-unit investment and chronicles how he quickly increased his net worth and eventually quit his job to devote himself fully to his real estate \\"empire\\".The remainder of the book was very meaty as well. It basically gives all of the ins and outs of buying and managing properties, including a secion on dealing with Section 8 tenants which I'd not come across elsewhere in my reading. There is also a lot of information about landlording and the laws which deal with it. Martinez seems to be quite the careful sort, and I guess experience in real estate must teach you to always be on the lookout for potential troubles. Perhaps his guidance and advice will allow me to skip any \\"shortcuts\\" I might otherwise have tried.In my view, a successful \\"how to\\" book must inform and motivate. Martinez does a good job of that, motivating the reader with the success stories included in the first few chapters while also being extremely informative in the remainder of the book. Don't be fooled by the sensationalist title, which kind of makes it seem like a get rich quick book (though I'm sure the title helped to sell a lot of books). What the book IS is a thorough manual of how to proceed in investing and managing your rental properties and growing your wealth along the way.Five stars."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"Unfortunately for the reader, Mr. Martinez gained all of his real estate knowledge during the housing bubble of the early 2000's. His story and tactics all revolve around using equity in current properties or the sale of current properties to finance the purchase of additional real estate. During the housing bubble when real estate prices were increasing at 20%,30%,40%+ per year and lenders were giving out loans with little or no down payment, this approach could work wonders. However, now that home prices have flattened out or even plummeted and lenders are requiring 20% down with verifiable income and perfect credit, Martinez's methods of property procurement are completely out of date and virtually worthless.Martinez also briefly describes how to effectively manage income producing properties. While not entirely out of date, I found the material to be extremely general and with no real substance for someone who is actually trying to be a landlord.Don't be fooled by the title. If you are interested in spending your hard earned money and valuable time getting into rental properties, look for books with more substance and more current information.On the plus side, it is a quick read, has some inspirational quotes and hidden amongst the fluff are a very few interesting tips. Pick it up at the library if you are still interested."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"This book is great. Matthew is not your typical get rich guru (although he got rich quick), he's more like one of us: going to work and paying the bills. He decided that there was more to life than this and took matters and real estate investing into his own hands. His book also differs in that rather than investing in single family homes he focuses on multi-unit buildings. There are few books out there that cover this topic for beginning investors.

I consider it a MUST read for anyone thinking of buying a rental property, or even if you already own a couple of rental properties.

I have read nearly 30 real estate books over the last 2 years, this is by far one of my favorites. The spreadsheet analysis example given on page 56 of the book is invaluable to any real estate investor in my opinion. As I write, I am currently looking at a quadraplex. With Matt's spreadsheet analysis I am able to accurately predict if the property makes money!! And as an added bonus, the author is a class act and true professional. He even answered an important real estate question for me. What more could you want!!!!!Todd Veeck..."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"There is very little original content in this book. Though well written versus many of the \\"Make A Million\\" books in circulation, the basic premise of making a million dollars in two years is a sham.Four of the first six chapters in the book track the author's first, second, third and fourth income producing property investments. At the end of those chapters, the author lists the \\"Value\\" of his rental property portfolio. The problem is, the author lists the cumulative market value of his portfolio versus the equity value of the property portfolio. By doing so, the author does not subtract his portfolio's debt total from the portfolio's market value to calculate the portfolio's true equity value.There is a substantial difference between equity value and market value, particularly if one follows the authors advice and takes out high loan-to-value mortgages. Given the current state of the residential real estate market, with falling home values throughout the county, be very weary of taking on high debt levels with minimally positive property cash flows."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"This is a good book to get an overview of a successful real estate investor.

Today he holds a portfolio consisting of several millions of income-producing properties - and his tips on how he did it - and how you can, too - are offered in a guide covering everything from real estate 'bubble' mistakes to picking and financing hot properties.Diane C.

This author SHOWS us how with this exceptional, first ever 'How to' manual. Let's face it, most of us are extremely risk averse and thus steer away from anything that we don't understand. Understanding this, Matthew Martinez exceeds the two (2) most important ingredients that any real estate author owes to a reader 1) He breaks that inertia which keeps us talking rather than doing and 2) He offers an incredible amount of relevant and detailed information in a very digestible, step-by-step roadmap to success.

This isn't realistic any more since homes values are typically not appreciating and that home equity loans are limited to only 20% of the available equity in your home now (2010).That aside, it's still a good story about creating possibilities. I like how the author emphasizes staying at your job and doing this at a reasonable pace instead of leaping in head first without the proper education that goes along with years of real estate investing experience.The book contains some good basic information about how to reach out into the community to have good deals come to you through some out-of-the box marketing."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"This book is idealistic at best and savings emptying at worst.

This author's description of his rise to real estate wealth is shaky at best. The timeline, as written, does not work. I find the financials he describes highly questionable. Purchasing several appartment buildings using one secured line of credit off a condo? I don't think so.As mentioned in other reviews, this is not a credible system for puchasing investment/revenue real estate, but rather a story about an individual who either got very, very lucky (of which there are many in real estate) or is padding his jacket.There are many, many better books out there. This author is trying cash in with a catchy title and some cheerleading. Nothing of substance. See Keller's new book: same price, much better value."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"I agree with many of the reviewers that the strategy from this book does not apply in today's housing market. Extracting equity out of your condo is impossible these days unless you have owned your place since early 2000. Also, the financing world is much more strict after the housing crash, so no more easy leverage. It's possible that the author might have gotten a little lucky with his condo as he bought it right before the boom, and was able to amass more investment capital by the time the housing market peaked. But, I believe that he knew what he was doing and had a high level of the real estate market even before he bought the first condo.Having said that, I found the information on how to manage a property, calculate income & expenses, and determine appropriate property values are quite good for beginners."},{"Title":"2 Years to a Million in Real Estate","review":"I have various rental properties and found the book to be an excellent source of information.

Old Testament ; 25) (Vol 25)","review":"Should I try to review these three narratives as literature or as 'inspired' religious texts? They are certainly both, the only debatable issue being the nature and source of the 'inspiration.' \\"Jonah\\" is included in the canon of the Old Testament by Protestants, while \\"Tobit\\" and \\"Judith\\" are usually included in the Apocrypha. This 93-page study pamphlet comes from a catholic publisher and has both the 'imprimatur' and 'nihil obstat' certifications. Roughly the upper half half of each page is the narrative in the translation of the New American Bible; the lower half of each page consists of notes and explications by Irene Nowell, O.S.B. Much of Nowell's commentary focuses on the historical provenance of the three narratives, which she explicitly identifies as \\"fictions\\" intended as exhortations to the contemporaries of the anonymous authors. All three were composed centuries after the events they narrate.\\"Jonah\\" was written around the Fifth century BCE, \\"when the Jews were still recovering from the Babylonian Captivity...\\" Nowell interprets it as a polemic against the \\"attitude of exclusivity and rigid observance of the law\\" which prevailed among Jews of that era. The man Jonah is sent to preach to non-Jews in the city of Nineveh. It's a short text, just a page and a half in my own Swedish cathechism Bible, and it's replete with thorny ambiguities, much stranger and subtler than the simple tale of Jonah and the Whale.\\"Tobit\\" is the story of an exceptionally pious Jew held in exile in Assyria in the era of Sennacherib. Many of its historical details are inaccurate and it was probably written generations later as a parable of appropriate piety. Tobit shows his courage by piously burying the corpses of executed Jewish criminals, an act for which he is punished. He is also 'tested', like Job, by blindness. Eventually, he sends his son Tobias on a dangerous journey to Media to recover money which he had sequestered with a kinsman. Tobias is aided by a kinsman/servant who turns out to be the archangel Raphael in disguise, one of the seven 'helpers' of G*d. With such help, it's no surprise that Tobias returns with the money and with a proper wife, plus a salve that restores his father's vision. Rapahel then reveal his identity and departs skyward.\\"Judith\\" portrays the invasion of the lands along the eastern Mediterranean coast by the armies of the great Babylonian king Nebuchanezzar, around 593 BCE, under the command of the general Holofernes. The tale was written as much as four hundred years after the historical events; many of the details are faulty, and the geography is thoroughly scrambled. Holofernes has trapped a Jewish frontier settlement in a ruthless siege, and the Jews are losing hope. Judith, a beautiful Jewish widow, rails against them for their lack of faith. She crosses the siege lines, pretends that she is betraying her countrymen, lies guilefully, and 'seduces' Holofernes with her beauty. Holofernes wines and dines her in expectation of bedding her, but falls into a drunken stupor. Judith whacks off his head, sneaks out of the Babylonian camp and carries the gruesome trophy to the Jews. When the Babylonians discover their headless general, they are thrown into confusion and the Jews slaughter them as they flee.Nowell's explications of the three stories are far from theologically controversial. She hews a rather standardized line, interpreting everything from the very localized perceptual grid of the Jewish authors and their contemporary readers. I would have preferred to see her attempt to place these literary pieces in the broader context of influences upon Jewish culture during those eras of exile and captivity, and especially in the era of \\"Hellenistic\\" cosmopolitanism when they were most probably composed. In other words, I question their 'purity' as artifacts of isolated Jewish communities; to me, they seem heavily influenced by exposure to Greek literary traditions. I'm also intrigued by the undertones of polytheism in all three tales. The G*d worshipped by Jonah, Tobit, Judith, and their fellow Jews is repeatedly labeled \\"their\\" G*d, theirs exclusively in Tobit and Judith, and references are made to the gods of other 'nations' as if those gods existed independently. Angels and devils are also depicted in the action, as actual entities with their own existence. I'm driven to wonder, by these tales and even more by the related tale of Job, just how pure the 'monotheism' of the Old Testament jews really was.But my interest in these three narratives isn't actually theological at all. Rather, it's musical and artistic. All three stories were immensely popular in the 17th and 18th Centuries as subjects for painting, sculpture, and theatrical music - cantatas, oratorios, and operas. The popularity of the names Jonah, Tobias, and Judith are a remnant in our times of the fascination people felt for these characters in the Baroque era. The most splendid musical settings of the 'sacred' narratives, in my opinion, are:Jonah: the oratorio \\"Jonas\\" by Giacomo Carissimi, brilliantly recorded by Les Voix BaroquesJudith: the opera \\"Juditha Triumphans\\" by Antonio Vivaldi, sung on recording by Magdalena KozenaTobit: the oratorio \\"Tobit\\" by George Frederic Handel, and the oratorio \\"Il Ritorno di Tobia\\" by Joseph Haydn"},{"Title":"White Stallion of Lipizza","review":"Ah, what can I say about such an important book in my life?Hans is a poor boy who dreams of riding dressage with the Spanish Riding School of his native Vienna. He attains his goal through hard work and perseverance, by his own merit and against the odds. The book is beautifully written with a flowing narrative style, engaging for both adults and children. The illustrations are the best I have seen from Dennis, at times humorous, at times scholarly, and always precise.I did my senior thesis on the birth of dressage in the Renaissance, but without this book I would never have even heard of Xenophon, or the passage, or known that the Ancient Greeks rode without stirrups. I illustrated it with my own copies of Wesley Dennis's drawings from this book.Also highly recommended as horsey history, &quot;Gaudenzia, Pride of the Palio&quot; by the same writer/illustrator team.If you would like to find out more about Classical dressage please check out Laura Camins's &quot;Glorious Horsemen&quot; and Walter Leitdke's &quot;Royal Horse and Rider,&quot; both of which deal with the birth of dressage in the Renaissance according to modern scholarship, and by extension the noble equestrian ballets of which the Spanish Riding school is the last still extant. Did you know that the Louvre's great central courtyard was designed to accommodate horse ballets exactly like those in this book?When I first read this book, when I was about seven years old, I owned a Lipizzan mare of my own. She was for me what Borina was to Hans, my schoolmaster. She was small and gray, with a wide girth, branded, and very long lived. She would do caprioles as we galloped through the field, I kid you not. Were it not for this book I would not have the words to describe her, to remember her like this, and so I am indebted Marguerite Henry.To bring one spark of beauty into the world is worth a life's dedication, is it not?

Austin State College)","review":"For Darshan Singh Tatla, Operation Bluestar--the Indian Army's 1984 storming of the Golden Temple in order to flush out the militant leader Bhindranwale and his followers--was the 'crucial' (p 210) event that transformed Sikhs' understanding of their identity: 'From a self-confident religious community, the Sikhs rapidly acquired many characteristics of a persecuted minority' (p 1). In particular, argues Tatla, the threat of an overly centralised and overtly Hindu India practising 'ethnocracy' (p 36) rather than democracy led the one million-strong Sikh diaspora to take up the role of popularisers-and chief fund-raisers-for Khalistan. Their reaction to Operation Bluestar also 'enabled them to redraw a strict definition of Sikh identity, highlighting the religious tradition and collective symbols of the community instead of the geography, language and cultural traits' (p 210). Tatla adds that support for Khalistan fed on the alienation which many Sikhs living abroad had long felt but rarely articulated.Tatla's excellent work underscores the 'situational' (p 210) nature of ethnic consciousness. Why then does he only grudgingly admit that, for the Sikh diaspora, 'a broader loyalty towards India probably still exists' (p210)? With the return of peace to Punjab and the entrance of the Akali Dal (the main Sikh political party) into the recent national coalition government of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, support for Khalistan has become a slogan rather than a belief."},{"Title":"The Everglades and the Everglades National Park (Research paper / Stephen F.

From the gripping prologue, Ms.Reynolds carries the reader through Jessica Moran's profound search for truth that combines deep family angst with cultural bitterness and small town prejudices. I was hooked from the very beginning and read her book straight through. Jessica's journey for truth set against the backdrop of a vanishing part of Pacific Northwest life fascinated me."},{"Title":"The Civil Wars of Jonah Moran","review":"Marjorie Reynolds once again delivers with strong themes and interesting characters. She is not afraid to address a cross-cultural romance and mental disablement. Her settings come off the page--I forgot I was on my own porch several times as I read her descriptions of the Olympic peninsula. An absorbing read by a writer who delivers what she promises."},{"Title":"The Civil Wars of Jonah Moran","review":"This excellent novel was intriguing from the beginning to the end. Complex family relationships between mother and daughter, daughter and father, sister and brother unfold as the primary theme, the possiblility of gross injustice, is explored. Reynolds has created a cast of believable characters who grow in self-knowledge as the events in the novel affect their lives. Jonah, a young man diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, a mild form of autism, is especially well-developed without traces of sentimentality. The author also very capably writes an inter-cultural romantic relationship with honesty and respect for the similarities and the differences of the couple. Readers who enjoy vivid descriptions, a bit of mystery, well-written dialogue, and writing that is sensitive in it's development of characters will appreciate and enjoy this fine second novel."},{"Title":"The Civil Wars of Jonah Moran","review":"I thought The Civil Wars of Jonah Moran was a great book. It took place in the pacific northwest. It is about this woman in her mid 30s. She comes back to this town in the northwest. It is filled with romance, heartbreak, love, dedication to family, and a on going feud with her mother. It also has some mystery to it. If you are interested in this sort of thing you will like it. This was my first time reading a Reynolds book. It was excellent. I wouldn't mind reading something else of hers again!"},{"Title":"The Civil Wars of Jonah Moran","review":"After reading \\"The Starlite Drivein\\" I thought this author couldn't possibly do it again, but she did. Civil Wars delivers realistic, sympathetic characters in a unique setting, with plenty of conflict and drama. After the stunning prologue, I was with these people every moment, feeling their pain and rooting for them. This is a must-read, now on Kindle at a reasonable price."},{"Title":"The Civil Wars of Jonah Moran","review":"I was drawn into this story quickly. The author has perfectly captured the geography and characters of the Olympic Penninsula, and Lila, in particular, is a baffling character whom the reader wants to understand. But in the end, I felt that the resolution was sewn up through contrivance, reconciliations were almost arbitrary, and the great \\"why\\" at the heart of the book didn't explain the heartlessness of Lila's actions. As she did in The Starlite Drive-In, this writer has once again organized her plot around a mental/neurological condition, but her portrait of Aspberger syndrome is not complex or compelling like her portrait of agoraphobia. Both books deal with another familiar theme...the dual nature of men, and which parts count, when remembering a very flawed man who has committed acts of betrayal while living a respectable life. This an entertaining book, but I was hoping for more than entertainment after that fantastic first chapter--and the final passage is as trite, clumsy-footed and improbable as a Sasquatch sighting."},{"Title":"The Civil Wars of Jonah Moran","review":"Marjorie Reynolds' book THE CIVIL WARS OF JONAH MORAN sat on my bookshelf for a couple of years before I pulled it out from the near bottom of one of my many stacks of unread books (as a fellow reader I'm sure you can relate to that). Although I should've read this book when it first came out, I'm glad I waited until now. Jonah Moran has Asperger's Syndrome and two years ago I wouldn't have had a clue as to what this was all about. In the past month I have done a lot of research on this syndrome since the child of a friend was diagnosed with it. I had no idea this book referred to A.S. until I started to read it. When they say there are no accidents, they're right.Back to the story though - this is a wonderful book. I loved Ms. Reynolds' first novel and was not disappointed with this one. Although there are some complex twists and turns to the plot, she manages them with ease and clarity. The relationships between Jessica and her family are realistic & well-developed and the changes that take place are logical. I've spent very little time in the Pacific Northwest, but I enjoyed reading about the area and the Native American side of the story makes it even more interesting.I place Marjorie Reynolds right up there with Elizabeth Berg, Jane Smiley, and Anita Shreve in her ability to tell a good story about people you'd like to know."},{"Title":"The Civil Wars of Jonah Moran","review":"The story opens on May 3, 1979.

While Jonah still has to be saved, this tragic event sets the wheels in motion for some tragedies to come.The beautiful rain forests in Washington State in a small, mill town act as foil/counterpoint to the seething, Civil War within the community.

An iron-hearted bigot, she forces Jessica to move to California once she discovers Jessica has become pregnant from a Native boy at age 16. She ships the girl to California to stay with elderly relatives and makes snide, racist comments about the daughter Jessica never got to know.Meanwhile, other Civil Wars are brewing. When Jessica returns to Washington after a disastrous divorce, Jonah has become more socially quirky and is ostracized and ridiculed by many locals. On March 28, 1998 a halfway house for ex-cons is burned. Naturally, suspicion falls to Jonah. A bright, naive man of 28, Jonah spends all of his spare time with his army of miniature soldiers re-enacting the Civil War. He has an encyclopediac knowledge of the war and those who fought in it. His miniatures are painted with exacting detail and he appears oblivious to the social mores and constraints of the community at large.Jonah appears to be more at the autistic end of the autism/Asperger's scale. While he is proficient at self care and is verbal and clearly bright, his social ineptitude and verbalizations and adherence to routine and sensory sensitivies point him further down the continuum towards autism. His special interest is the one hallmark of Asperger's.Meanwhile, the mystery of the Burned Halfway House is underway. Since one of Jonah's miniature figures was found on the grounds and shoeprints that match his, all eyes are on him. Jonah is very naive and not adept at defending himself. Even so, the suspect list grows. A former resident; an elderly neighbor who witnessed the event but does not initially come forward; a local bigot who dates Jessica; his bigot cronies are all on the suspect list.However, there are silver linings in these smoky clouds. Callum Luke, the father of Jessica's daughter re-enters her life. They join forces to find the arsonist.This is an excellent book with a realistic character who has autism. I like the way Native customs and history are included as well as the rich descriptions of the beautiful Evergreen State. The Civil Wars of the logging Moran family within each other and the small town bigots against Jessica and Callum keep the theme consistent. What a gifted writer and an extraordinary book!"},{"Title":"The Civil Wars of Jonah Moran","review":"Reynolds easily transports the reader into the magical emerald mists of the Olympic Peninsula's temperate rain forest. Her main character, Jessica Moran, is wrapped in a weave of protective love for her brother who suffers from a newly discovered neurological disorder called Asperger's Syndrome.Jessica's life is further complicated by her difficult but triumphant struggles in romance as well as her mother/daughter relationship. Reynold's characters have depth and courage. It's a wonderful, rewarding, cozy read. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"The Civil Wars of Jonah Moran","review":"Set in the majestic rain forests of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State, Marjorie Reynold's admirable \\"Civil Wars\\" compels the reader's attention in a tautly told arson/murder mystery. The crackling pace of the novel, however, does not diminish the superior characterizations which provide complexity and depth to an otherwise exciting, but non-groundbreaking, novel. Indeed, the psychological tensions of the Moran family -- their origins, impact and resolution -- are the genuine backbone of the novel. Relationships twisted by guilt, abandonment, resentment and resignation become the true focus of the reader's attention; the ever-present dampness and density of growth of the area become symbolic counterpoints to the aridity of human contact the Moran mother and daughter have with one another.Ironically, this fecund environment (lavishly described by Ms. Reynolds) has generated a remarkably fractured family. The angry matriarch, Lila Moran, capably presides over a logging empire while bemoaning the condition of her personal life. Her son, Jonah, never has emerged as a man, and instead of acknowledging his retardation due to a relatively rare neurological disorder, Lila prefers to rue his adult childhood obsession with Civil War figures. As disappointed as she is with her son, she saves a special animosity for her daughter, Jessica, who has returned home after a failed marriage and an unsatisfying adulthood. Jessica's anguish centers around the tragic drowning death of her father, who perished while attempting to rescuse Jonah, who was precipitously thrown in the water by Lila, in a brutally cruel manner of teaching him to swim. This scar runs like a red thread through \\"Civil Wars\\" and only through Jessica's renewal of a relationship with the sympathetically-portrayed Callum Lake is there any chance of healing. Callum, unfortunately, never receives the in-depth portrait he otherwise richly deserves. His adolescent feelings for Jessica serve both as personal and dramatic motivation in the resolution of the arson/murder investigation which professionally absorbs his time.There is much to admire in Marjorie Reynolds' writing. She can, without questions, probe to the inner recesses of our emotions and provide unflinching portraits of both human good and evil. She is a nuanced writer as well, always writing to make her characters believable. My sole reservations with her second novel are small, but critical. The reader knows, from the first fifty pages, that the plot will be resolved tidily; Lila and Jessica's coming-to-grips with their own unresolved hurt and betrayal appears almost like a soap opera. The author's brilliant first novel, \\"The Starlite Drive-in\\" did not have these flaws. Nevertheless, \\"Civil Wars\\" is an honorable, penetrating look into a family at war with itself."},{"Title":"Olive Oil","review":"This is an excellent reference that describes the history of olive oil production, and provides a blow-by-blow description of literally hundreds of top quality oils categorized by country and region. It also demonstrates what makes a good oil and how to find one. I've looked for years for a reference like this and finally found it in the library."},{"Title":"Olive Oil","review":"Both my wife and I have been cooking for years. For us, it is a bit more than a necessity or hobby, but rather a passion. We lived several years in various parts of Turkey during the early 1960s and became quite interested in the cooking of that country and that part of the world. This is when olive oil entered our lives. This wonderful stuff has become, over the years, a mainstay in our kitchen. We both thought we knew quite a bit about the use, types and properties of olive oil. We were wrong.I absolutely love this book. I have learned more from it than the dozens of other books I have read over the years on the subject, all put together. The author has done a tremendous amount of research to put this little volume together. Each one of the major countries that produce this oil is covered, region by region and in some cases, farm by farm. Literally hundreds of various olive oils are addressed. We are given insightful knowledge of their qualities, taste, textures, origins, bottling, usage, storage, and on and on. The author has concentrated on only top quality oils and wasted little or no time on the others. He has though, given very good advice and many pointers on how to identify and avoid those oils that are poor quality. This is very helpful! The author has also gone to great lengths in teaching the reader how to interpret the various makings on container, what to look for and what to avoid. Again, this is extremely helpful information.The book is set in a format quite similar to a birding field guide. It is color coded by country and region, and wonderful maps are provided. The first part of the book provides the fascinating history of the olive, going back some 8,000 years, addresses the cultivation and care of the olive tree and their groves, the harvesting and processing of the olive. He addresses the olive oil industry as a whole and also gives plenty of space to the small, independent growers and producers. This alone is worth picking up the book and giving it a read. One of the most outstanding features of this work is that the author actually gives the phone number, email address or web site for almost ever one of the hundreds of brands reviewed. This for us was extremely helpful. Living in a rather isolated area, there is no way we have access to most of the wonderful brands the author offers us in or local area. This has been a real handicap over the years. This book solves that problem.Now keep in mind, this is not a cook book. It is a work though which address a specific ingredient. To find how to use it, you will need other books and a propensity for experimentation. I can promise you though, with this book in hand, you will certainly know your olive oil. I do wish I could give this one more that just five stars. This is one of those works you will want to own, as there is so much information in it that you will find it impossible to remember ever thing within its pages. I find my self taking it with the when we go to the \\"big city\\" to shop, much like I would take a field guide to birds when I am in the field birding. Highly recommend this one!Don Blankenship"},{"Title":"Olive Oil","review":"I read a review of this work by one of my Amazon friends and had to get my own copy. And it was a good call! This book is a little gem.For one thing, I now realize that I haven't had a clue about how to shop for olive oil. For another, this book provides almost a travelogue, as it discusses the various olive oil regions throughout the globe.The book's purpose is laid out clearly on page 10: \\"This book is for everyone who wants to know how to recognize high-quality oils and where they come from. . . . It tells you which are the most important oil producing countries, it shows you how to identify oils, read bottle labels, and understand what is meant by such terms as 'extra virgin' and 'cold pressed.'\\"Some of the most interesting aspects of this book include coverage of a variety of subject. For one, a brief introduction to olives (history, the tree, history, cultivation, making olive oil). A second feature of special interest (now) to me--how to recognize quality. Boy, was this an eye opener. I thought that by looking at the oil and making sure that it was clear, I was aces. The discussion of buying and storing olive oil is useful, too.But the real heart of the book is the country by country (and even region by region) description of olive oil produced, its qualities, and actual brands produced by country (or region), with brief analyses of these. For example, the discussion of Italian olive oil is lengthy and provides great detail on the industry and its product. We get a little history and then the region by region discussions. For instance, Luguria. We see a little about this area, the types of olives grown and used in making olive oil, and then a brief description of leading producers. For example, Abbo-Frantoio del Podere Bevera. This is made by the Abbo family. Their best oil has, as the book describes it, a \\"mellow taste of pears and almonds and a long, warm aftertaste.\\" Sounds yummy, no?Olive oils from Portugal, France, Greece, the United States, Australia & New Zealand, and other places are discussed, too.If you are interested in olive oil, this is a fun little book to read. I use olive oil religiously in my kitchen (it's healthy and it works well with cooking food and as a part of salad dressings, etc.), so this little volume is especially enjoyable to me."},{"Title":"Olive Oil","review":"A wonderful book which reads like a travelogue for anybody who is interested in this super-food. As with wine, there can be a lot of 'airiness' about the subject of olive oil and that is why this book is so refreshing. Mr Quest-Ritson seems to blow the cobwebs away from the Extra Virgin Olive Oil world and gives it the dignity and truth it deserves. This book is worth its weight in gold."},{"Title":"Olive Oil","review":"This has been a very useful book for me as I gear up to start a new job with a branded importer of olive oil. Check out [...] to get some great products and one of the growers is listed in this book."},{"Title":"Olive Oil","review":"Good reference if you are buying olive oil from lots of different countries, or going on a trip and want to include olive oil farms in your itinerary.

It is a treasure trove of information on olives, oil varieties, growing locations, and the history of oil making. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Killing of Bonnie Garland: A Question of Justice","review":"Willard Gaylin is a gifted writer who is also a psychiatrist with long years of practice. The book is about an awful murder, but more than that it's about the inability of institutions of society -- Yale, and the criminal justice system -- to deal effectively with immorality and cruelty. The murder is the lens through which Gaylin brings social, moral and psychiatric issues into focus. Twenty years after I first read this book it remains vivid in my mind."},{"Title":"The Killing of Bonnie Garland: A Question of Justice","review":"William Gaylin's book, which combined good journalism, professional psychiatric insight, and superb wisdom and philosophical context, is in my opinion the best criminology ever written. Although his discussion of the crime and the motives therefor is first rate, what gives the book its immense value is the observations he made of the reaction of the Yale community to the offense. (Both murderer and victim were Yale undergraduates.) He combined this acute analysis with an acuity of insight that makes the book both profound and immediate. Anyone interested in criminal law should read and digest this book."},{"Title":"The Killing of Bonnie Garland: A Question of Justice","review":"The best true crime books reveal not simply the crime and the criminals but the times in which both existed. While not really a True Crime book per se, it does reveal the crime, the criminal and the times.I reread this book after reading American Taboo by Philip Weiss. Both books are about young, sexually liberated young women in their early twenties who are murdered in the mid 1970s by men whose claims of \\"insanity\\" successfully save them from murder convictions. In both cases people rally around the murderer because \\"no one can help\\" the dead victim anymore. In American Taboo, it's \\"us\\" (read \\"Americans\\") against \\"them\\" (read the Tongans). In Bonnie Garland's case the us are people who passionately believe that \\"prison does no good\\" versus \\"the establishment.\\"Gaylin delves deeply into the minds of all involved to understand their motivations and goals. He nails Herrin's defenders on their strange inability to differentiate punishment and rehabilitation. He also exposes their contempt for imprisonment in general - most can barely summon up an example of a crime that would warrant a long stint in jail. Gaylin isn't one sided, he depicts both sides with compassion and respect, he is especially good at drawing out the passionate desire for social justice that lead some of Herrin's supporters to see this case in political terms. Would committed Catholic clergy like Sister Ramona Pena and the Christian Brothers have championed the cause of a man who bludgeoned his girlfriend with a claw-hammer in any other time but the early 1970s?Most unsettling is the reaction of the Yale establishment many of who voice a feeling that Bonnie Garland's father needed to just get over it, that his grief and rage were somehow out of proportion. The lack of simple human compassion is staggering - for them the University is more important than the students.This is a powerful book. The first chapter alone should be required reading in every high school civics class for the questions it asks. Does society have a right to demand punishment in the name of justice or is the goal of the justice system to salvage what can be salvaged that will benefit society in the long term? These are questions each of us should ask ourselves as citizens."},{"Title":"The Killing of Bonnie Garland: A Question of Justice","review":"This is one of those rare books that, for better or worse, keeps me under its daunting yoke. It's gory depiction of the murder of Bonnie Garland, a 1970s Yale undergraduate, and of the mindset of her murderer, a fellow student, is breathtaking in an eerie, dreadful sort of way. When I read this book about four years ago, the hairs on my arms stood straight up. When I think about this book today, my Pavlovian hairs march in step. Giving me a glimpse of the mind of a killer is what I liked about this book.What I didn't like, and what the second half of this book concerns itself with, is the psychological analysis of why the killer did what he did. This was the bane of an otherwise great book. The first half of the book was written in a reporter-like, just-the-facts-ma'am style. I liked that. Part of the joy of the book for me was to figure out how the killer thought, and to extrapolate his motive(s) for the crime. The author's Mickey-mouse psychological analysis of the killer's motives in the second half of the book was amateurish at best, and to my reckoning, just plain wrong.In any event, I couldn't stop reading the book and the pitfalls of its second half weren't so bad as to destroy the enjoyment I gained from the first half. Personally, however, I would just read the first half and leave it at that.One important note: my enjoyment of this book was purely on an intellectual level -- in trying to answer the question \\"why do killers kill.\\" However, on an emotional level, this book was nauseating and, quite frankly, sick. I often had to put the book down and wonder (1) how could someone commit such a heinous act and (2) how could somebody write a book about it in such a cool-headed, detached fashion? I'm not sure if I'm better for having read it or if I would have been better off having left my copy without a reader. I'm sure the answer rests somewhere in the middle, but if you're especially squeamish, you'd be better off not buying this book. If you've ever lost a loved one to violent crime, it's probably not the book for you. And if you're the vigilante type, this is definitely not the book for you: you'll probably find yourself wanting to take care these sick-headed people yourself."},{"Title":"The Killing of Bonnie Garland: A Question of Justice","review":"I agree with the people who write that the book is quite haunting.However when Dr Gaylin leaves the facts and enters the realm of jurisprudence, I thought he was long winded and sometimes his arguments were poor.For example he suggests that the then manslaughter defence of extreme emotional disturbance might apply when a man has just seen his wife murdered, but should not apply to a jilted lover. However while most people would not be as emotionally disturbed by a rejection in love as they would by seeing their spouse murdered, there might be some people, particularly those with mental disorders, who are.I also think Dr Gaylin understated Herrin's mental disorders, which IMHO were dependent personality disorder and an autistic spectrum disorder. It should be said in Dr Gaylin's defence, that psychiatric diagnoses have come quite a long way in the last thirty years.The good doctor makes many valid points about the philosophical and practical difficulties of using psychiatry in courts of law.I also wonder whether there was a subtext of class warfare: the Garlands and Dr Gaylin being Republicans and the Catholic Church, Yale and Herrin being Democrats.Still, it is a very worthwhile book which really sticks in your mind. I want to read more and have ordered Meyer's book on the same killing."},{"Title":"The Killing of Bonnie Garland: A Question of Justice","review":"Absolutely invigorating book. The methodical thinking of Willard Gaylin is simply brilliant. Everything is clear. An amazing read!"},{"Title":"Decline and Fall of the Hapsburg Empire 1815-1918","review":"If the book has a theme, it is that the Dynasty and the Empire were not in irreversible decline and the fall, brought about by defeat in WWI, was not inevitable. Why the title then? Well, towards the end of the book, in a couple of chapters added to the second edition, Sked admits that the title was chosen by his publishers and not by him.My main reason for contributing this review is that I don't think it is clear from other reviews here that Sked's book is not a narrative or comprehensive history of the Habsburg Empire from the Congress of Vienna until its fall. It is rather a series of essays which reflect on other historians' treatment of some of the major themes in Habsburg historiography. These are interesting, challenging, occasionally repetitive, but are not, and do not pretend to be, a substitute for a general history of the period (such as C.A. Macartney's great work)."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall of the Hapsburg Empire 1815-1918","review":"This text is truly invaluable for students of the Habsburg Monarchy. It's major strength has to be that it is analytical in style, providing explanations for the decline in fortunes of the Habsburg Monarchy. It is also innovative in that it provides a new perspective on the last century of Habsburg rule. Sked's book is an extremely readable text, which is accessible for all. An added bonus is that it provides a background to the historiography surrounding the Austrian Empire. Even if you do not agree with Sked's conclusions, it will certainly give you something new to think about, and is a useful antidote to the more traditional interpretaions of the Habsburg decline. I cannot recommend this book strongly enough!"},{"Title":"Decline and Fall of the Hapsburg Empire 1815-1918","review":"First let me say that academically the book is both readable and factual in its content. But I found the book troubling for two reasons. First, Professor Sked writes like an English Lecture. He poses questions which he answers with his own opinions, many times taking other authors opinions to task. Those that he doesn't agree with he speaks of as liberal or extreme or having &quot;missed the point&quot;. Secondly as this is a Second Edition,it should have been brought up to date with information that has been developed over the last twelve years.As an example of his inability to rewrite his own words (which he takes as sacrosanct) there is an aside that refers to the USSR and the eastern european satellites. He makes a referral to what would happen in eastern europe if the USSR were to go multi-party, hinting at chaos on the terms of Yugoslavia. Where has he been for the last ten years? No chaos, some nations in NATO and others being accepted into the EU.Lastly, he shows a pronounced weakness in his understanding of military matters. In his discussion of the failure of the 1848 Hungarian Revolution, he dismisses the treatment of other nationalities in the Hungarian Crown Lands as being self-defeating but not disasterous. He especially discounts the Croats. Napoleon, not a bad general, described the Croat Cavalryas the best in Europe, both for their bravery and ability to endure hardship. He used them as his scouts for his intelligence services and gave them credit for helping to secure many of his victories. They would not have won the was for the Hungarians, but they could have been a thorn in the side of both the Austrians and Russians. Instead the helped to defeat the Hungarians at every major battle.Reading this book is informational, but you must be prepared to spend a lot of time searching around Professor Sked's opinions and biases to get to the facts."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall of the Hapsburg Empire 1815-1918","review":"What I am about to type concerning this book will be rather political, so I should make it clear at the outset that the author himself has no political axe to grind. He is simply examining and refuting some common misconceptions about the last century of the Habsburg Empire and the causes of it's fall. If that is what you are looking for, you could not do better than to read this book. This is *the best* book on the subject in English, bar none. If that is your interest, **buy it**, without reservation. Alan Sked's political opinions appear no where in it's pages, which are full of hard facts and strong historical thinking. It is in every way a model piece of historical scholarship.The reason I see this as a very political text is that the history of the fall of the Habsburgs has been put to ideological use for a long time now. The Habsburg Empire was dismembered by that crusading moralist professor, Woodrow Wilson, in the name of &quot;Democracy&quot;, &quot;Progress&quot;, and other &quot;enlightened&quot; ideals for which he was willing to kill and send others to die.It has been argued that the fall of the Habsburgs was a kind of bellwether, proving the inevitable progress of modernity and modern politics over the face of the whole Earth as a reactionary dionsaur of an empire finally died under the weight of it's own anachronism and decrepitude. The author of this book disproves that thesis totally. He demonstrates definitively that the Habsburg Empire was not weak or inept, and that in fact it faced it's worse crisis in 1848, and, having survived that, was viable as a political unit right up until the end of it's life. There was no mass longing for democracy, no mass discontent with the ancient Monarchy of the House of Habsburg, no demand for &quot;national sovereignty&quot; or &quot;self-determination&quot; on the part of the many nationalities of the Empire. They were fiercely loyal to the Monarchy right up until the end of it's existence. The Habsburgs fell, not because of the &quot;turning of the tides of history&quot; against them, but because they picked the wrong side in WWI. Period.The fact that this is so undermines most of the cherished myths of the modern West. It proves that history has no inevitable current ending up with us, since it shows that the way history turned out was in fact the result of the individual choices of men, rather than the effect of some kind of powerful underlying trend that men could not have shaped. It proves that democratic gov't's are not the only ones capable of being seen as legitimate in the eyes of their people and that a nation of highly cultured and relatively wealthy people (the Austrians) could happily and freely choose to live under a radically different form of gov't, namely a hereditary monarchy. It proves that a powerful multi-ethinc state can be built, if ethnicity is carefully divorced from political power and protected (the Empire of the Habsburgs was virutally a microcosm of Europe in it's vast ethnic diversity). It proves that religion can be effectively joined to gov't - the Habsburg Empire was a confessional Catholic state until the end.In short, it proves that the supposedly axiomatic modern truths about how politics just has to be are really just so many lies. There was, once upon a time, a strong, viable, multi-ethnic, confessional, hereditarily monarchical empire, that was a living force in world politics right up until the First World War, and that only ceased to be so after it was deliberately destoryed by the victors of that war, who sought to impose their ideology at all costs on the conquered, even if it meant destroying an ancient state and everything that was based on it. We know the results of this well: the wellspring of nationalisms this created has turned the Balkans into a killing field, and it left no strong power in the Germanic world that might have checked the Nazis after Germany itself was raped by the vitorious Allies; thus, the dismemberment of the Habsburg Empire cleared the way for Hitler and every horror to follow him in Central Europe. This was the price foreigners were made to pay so that professor Wilson could &quot;Make the world safe for democracy&quot;. No amount of foreign blood is too much, apparently, for the ideals of a progressive intellectual."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall of the Hapsburg Empire 1815-1918","review":"I bought the second edition under the misleading impression that the contents will be updated, even though the conclusions may still stand. Instead, I have a book that's 95% same as before, plus some random afterthoughts on the main thesis that the Habsburg Monarchy self imploded because of losing the war, and not from the rampant nationalities conflict in an age of nationalism. If you want to read Sked's work on the Monarchy, just buy some second hand first edition.And if you want a refreshing look at European history, look no further than Paul Schroeder's majestic The Transformation of European Politics."},{"Title":"Falcon: The New-Size Ford (The Ford Road Series, Vol. 7) (The Ford Rd series)","review":"Since it's the only book available that covers Ford Falcons in any detail, it's better than nothing but could have been better.

It is refreshing in that Stephens has no agenda, is not concerned with political correctness, and is not catering to anyone. The book was written in 1872, just seven years after the end of the Civil War, so the thoughts of that era were very much on the author's mind.Readers should understand that the book is geared towards students and serves as a general history. Stephens himself states (although at the end of the book) what the book is NOT: a study of economic trends, inventions, explorations, etc., although some of these aspects are touched upon. The best parts of the book are the early chapters concerning the settlement of the colonies and the last few chapters which summarize the Civil War. A bit too much detail (for me anyway) is given to the Presidential elections. I would rather have read in more detail about the policies and actions of each President. Again, understand that this is a general history book, a starting point if you will, and not a detailed study."},{"Title":"A compendium of the history of the United States from the earliest settlements to 1872","review":"A.H.

In addition to the book under review, he also wrote \\"A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States,\\" a scholarly defense of the southern right of secession.In this volume, Stephens does a solid job of tracing the key principles of American history from the colonial age through 1872.

It also displayed that a woman can do what men do just as well as they can. This book captured perfectly a young woman dealing with everyday teenage problems and then some not so everyday problems while all the time shriving for and finally reaching her goals in her field of study. This book has taught me that no matter what life throws your way as long as you believe in yourself you can do anything you set out to do."},{"Title":"THE FIRST OF HER KIND","review":"It's not easy being the first in her family of three sisters to want to work in her father's greasy garage. And it isn't easy being one of the first girls to go to a vocational high school to learn the basics of auto mechanics. Mara faces these challenges as well as the challenge of discovering that she can be both feminine and smart in overalls and under a car as well as in a gorgeous evening gown. Finding her place in a largely male world while being a girl with every girl's insecurities and needs, Mara is sensitively portrayed by an author who knows the world of which she writes with truth and grace."},{"Title":"THE FIRST OF HER KIND","review":"As a high school English teacher, I encourage my students to think differently and critically.

I bought this book on Amazon because it was cheap even though I've never seen the book before. I guess that's my fault."},{"Title":"Boogiepop And Others","review":"Five years ago, a serial killer mysteriously committed suicide just as he was getting into his prime. About that time, an urban legend started about \\"Boogiepop\\", a sinister/romantic boogeyman who would whisk beautiful girls away to the land of the dead at the very instant they'd reached the pinnacle of their beauty. Now, a shape-changing monster called the Manticore is eating girls from the local high school, and Boogiepop is beginning to appear in the flesh.Each chapter of the novel focusses on a single student at the high school, presenting events from his/her point of view. It jumps backwards and forwards in time a little bit, and some scenes are retold from different points of view. Thankfully, the first few pages of the book are taken up by full-color manga-style illustrations of each of the main characters, with a one-sentence quote for each, so that the reader has a visual reference to keep everyone seperate (which can be tricky when all the names are in Japanese, and thus all equally foreign).Now that I've read this, I have to re-watch the anime mini-series, because it'll make a LOT more sense having read the book. (the book is a direct prequel to the anime \\"Boogiepop Phantom\\", which I often describe to people as \\"Like Lain, but without the suck\\".) This book's original title translates to \\"Boogiepop Doesn't Smile\\", but the translators renamed it to differentiate it from the manga adaptation of \\"Boogiepop Doesn't Smile\\" that's coming out soon.I highly recommend it; it's a nice quick read, and contrary to its Japanese origin it actually makes SENSE, and there are none of the gaping plot holes, loose ends, ambiguous endings, or unexplained crucial elements that normally plague Japanese stories."},{"Title":"Boogiepop And Others","review":"I was initially skeptical about this book when a friend pushed me to read it. I do not get into this anime stuff. From my relatively limited experience with Japanese animation and its fans, many (though not all) tend to be silly or pretty mystical. Thankfully, this book is nothing like that! While it seems to be marketed as a sort of horror light novel for anime fans, I found the story and main characters to fit into a more heroic or rational narrative that would more likely strike home with people like me than with an average 'otaku.'It is a tight story full of allegory, consciously motivated characters, and great heroism in spite of how horrible the world is around the protagonists. Certainly, the writing is simple and the book is short, but that just makes it a quick, satisfying read. It is very mysterious and cerebral for such a short novel, so it demands multiple readings to fully grasp all the mysteries and themes woven throughout.I understand that only four of the novels in this series were ever translated. That is a real shame, as the book left me wanting much more Nagi Kirima, Kazuko Suema, and Boogiepop. Perhaps if GoManga would market this more outside of anime fandom, where I would think more people would be interested in what it has to say, it could have as much of a success here in the States as it does in Japan."},{"Title":"Boogiepop And Others","review":"This was what got me hooked on the Boogiepop series. It's plot is really interesting and full of suspense."},{"Title":"Boogiepop And Others","review":"Boogiepop and Others is the first novel of the Boogiepop series. The story utilizes a variety of different narrators and perspectives to explain events and motives. As a result, you have a large cast of characters, some well developed while others seem to be cut a bit shallow.Perhaps the key achievement with Boogiepop and Others is the inclusion of these characters into one huge non-linear plot. Because of the large number of perspectives used in the book, the plot jumps from one timeframe to another, showing different aspects of events in a different light. As a result, the plot itself becomes somewhat confusing, but when it all comes together, it does seem fairly impressive. The character interactions are well-done, although sometimes its hard to pin a name to a face, owing to the inconsistency of each character's uniqueness.As for the storyline itself, it mixes together mystery with sci-fi elements, throwing some plot twists that are a little hard to stomach, but are necessary to develop the plot. Being the first novel in the series, the reader can spare the benefit of the doubt and just enjoy what the author tries to do here (which is basically setting up the entire Boogiepop persona).Overall, Boogiepop and Others provides a nice intro for people new (or seasoned) to the Boogiepop world. A plot that keeps you guessing (to a point) and a moderately diverse array of characters gives the book a good bit of substance."},{"Title":"Becoming a Woman Who Listens to God","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Becoming a Woman Who Listens to God. It is obvious that Sharon Jaynes loves God and sees His hand in her daily activities. The author isn't trying to give a doctrinal statement on what the Bible says, she is helping the readers discover God as they go through the day.The reason this book made an impact on me was that the author shares her personal experiences, both those that put her in a favorable light and those that don't. One of my favorites was when she watched the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark. She wrote about a key segment of the film in which there is a fire where the bad guys are trying to obtain the jewel that will lead them to the ark. From this situation, Jaynes drew the analogy of 3 types of people and how they are seeking God. Since this is one of my favorite films I was instantly engrossed in the description. From her clear description of the 3 types of people I realized that God had indeed revealed truth to her through the movie. I have watched that movie several times and yet I never saw that analogy.A second example that meant a lot to me was when she went to her son's school to meet with one of the teachers. After the meeting, God spoke to her as she watched a busload of handicapped students get off the bus. Later that day, her husband asked how the meeting with the teacher went. She said, \\"Oh, it was fine, but let me tell you about the one I had with God in the parking lot.\\" It was good that she recognized God's voice through the situation, but it was awesome that she shared that experience with her husband. Immediately, I found myself asking \\"When was the last time I shared what God was teaching me with my hubby?\\"If you want to know God better and be able to recognize His voice in the midst of a busy schedule, read this book. You will be glad that you did. I know that I am."},{"Title":"Becoming a Woman Who Listens to God","review":"I read the reviews on Amazon before purchasing this book, and although there were \\"mixed\\" reviews, I went ahead and purchased it for a study I was about to do with my sister and a close friend of ours. If you are wondering if this book is for you (which it was DEFINITELY for me!), then I suggest going to [...] and reading the excerpt.This book has changed my life! I've been a christian for over 11 years, serve in multiple ministries at my church, and yet I always battled with recognizing God's voice. Sharon Jaynes does a great job of teaching us that God is always speaking to us, we just need to learn how to listen! My small group and I all were able to hear God clearer within a few weeks into the study. I believe that all of our lives have been changed, and we all feel closer to God now then we have ever felt. Her book helped me grow closer to God (so much that I bought two more of her books!)She is a wonderful author, and I'm sad that there are negative reviews on her book. I believe the other reviewers are \\"nit picking\\" and truly should have been reading the book with the attitude of \\"God what do you want to teach to me today\\" instead of trying to debate multiple theological topics."},{"Title":"Becoming a Woman Who Listens to God","review":"This is incredible.

It may say, Becoming a Woman...who listens to God - but we men could use some of these points to get close to HIM as well! Thanks"},{"Title":"Becoming a Woman Who Listens to God","review":"I would not recommend reading this book. Here is an excerpt of my notes on the first chapter.p. 14 1 John 1:1 Ms. Jaynes says the \`Word of life' is Scripture. The Word of Life is Jesus, not Scripture. In the beginning was Jesus, not Scripture. If she can make such a fundamental mistake, we need to be very careful taking any of her teaching/conclusions for granted.I'm a bit dubious about her statement on that same page that the Bible is easy enough for a child to understand. Her statement suggests that anyone can pick it up, read it and understand it. God tells us over and over that only through the Holy Spirit can we understand His Word. It is \\"foolishness\\" to the unbeliever.p. 18 Again...Logos she says is Scripture. Logos is Jesus.A very shocking statement on p. 25 \\"that soft breeze upon your check is the Holy Spirit passing by.\\" God is not a soft breeze on your cheek.p. 25 When she says sometimes you read the Bible and don't get anything out of it and that's okay...it'll just store up for later. I'm not sure that's good teaching. If you're reading the Bible and not getting anything out of it, then ask God to reveal His truth to you. You should always be getting something out of it right then and there it seems to me.And from reading Chapter 2 on the Holy Spirit, I'm not comfortable that this author has a firm understanding of who God is. I don't think she should be trying to teach others. This is dangerous ground."},{"Title":"Becoming a Woman Who Listens to God","review":"I must strongly agree with this last person's review. I also found that she talks about things from the Bible out of context. For example, she talks about Aquila & Priscilla teaching Apollos about Jesus. This author gives credit only to Priscilla (pg. 86) & not Aquila. If you look at Acts 18:26 it clearly states that Aquila & Priscilla (BOTH OF THEM) took Apollos into their home to teach them about Jesus. I have to agree that this author does not have a firm understanding of the Bible & its teachings."},{"Title":"Rome of the Caesars","review":"A attempt to reconstruct the Rome of the Caesars based on archeological ruins and from ancient writers, very helpful , well done"},{"Title":"Waterfalls, Fountains, Pools & Streams: Designing & Building Water Features for Your Garden","review":"WE CHECKED THIS BOOK OUT OF OUR LOCAL LIBRARY AFTER REVIEWING SEVERAL BOOKS.

She has developed a vast following and has gained well-deserved notariety. I own quite a few of her books including this one. As in all her other books, she is very thorough in helping beginners grasp the essense of what it takes to make their water garden succeed. If anyone simply reads and heeds what Nash says, they can't fail. My only disappointment is the lack of color photography. There are some very good photos in it, but I still think there should be more. This is the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five. A lot of people purchase this type of book not only for instruction and understanding, they also buy it for inspiration and fresh ideas. The only way to do this is to SEE many examples. I hope someday Helen will compile a beautiful book of photography that will be a true inspiration and foundation for present and future water gardeners. In the meantime, for those of you who want to build a beautiful water garden and need ideas, get in touch with your local garden club to see if there is a water gardening club nearby. In metropolitan areas there is usually a large group of people who are members of a water gardening community.

Kieth is a master at pacing and composition, and with an appealing style that avoids the unpleasant unnatural realism that has wandered into much mainstream work (his anatomy, while cartoony, is at least much more realistic, as women are allowed to have normal bodies with hips and flab and all).This is not an easy read: Dealing with the violence and rape in the story is difficult. You have to pay careful attention to both what is being said and what is being shown, because they don't always even up, and for good reason. Kieth manages not to be exploitative in some very difficult situations, and builds the complete horror of the story.It could be a bit better. Just a bit more characterization up front, and the ending seems a bit rushed. This may be down to the fact that it was published originally as comics, which creates a problem when each \\"chapter\\" has to be of equal lenght.Highly recommended, though. Much better than Zero Girl, which sort of fizzled at the end. If you want to see how comics can approach serious and realistic themes without any of the trappings people usually associate with comics (superheroes, magic, science fiction), get this one immediately."},{"Title":"Four women","review":"In fact, you'll have to read it more than once. Somehow, every time you turn a page, it seems as if that new part of the story changes the meaning of everything that went before.The story starts simply enough, as a kind of road trip with four women of different ages and stages of life. The car breaks down on a lonely back road, at night. Two men in a monster pickup stop when they see the broken-down car, and ---- and for one thing, any more would be a spoiler. For another, I'm not sure I know what happened. I'm not sure the protagonists even know. There's a rubbery, shifting quality to the narrative that owes nothing to the fictional elements of the story. Sam Keith's artwork carries the narrative well, putting a little fear into even the comical moments, and black comedy into the genuinely fearful ones. As much as I like this story, I come away unsure what to make of it. In his introduction, Keith says, \\"If [Four Women] fails, it's because I'm not a woman ...\\" I don't know whether this actually succeeds, since ambiguity and uncertainty are so deeply a part of the story. I assure you, though, that it doesn't fail.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Four women","review":"\\"Four Women\\" by Sam Kieth, is one of the best psychological graphic novels in the market. It is also supremely enjoyable & moreso, an indelible book to one's memory for the everlasting time. And to mention further, it is extremely cunning & creative in regards to the book plotting & execution. Four Women,the book per se, is radically brimming with suspense, slight violence, extreme tension, poignancy & a hardcore matured-theme story all fluidly interwoven nicely.\\"Four Women\\",on its naked genre, was about heavy, psychological-laden story unveiled. The theme of the story was pertinent to rape. This critical story presented how a person would had acted and reacted to a chance coincidence in juxtaposition to the relevant subject of rape and violence. The realism & the execution of the subject portrayed here more than anything was accurate. It was as well very profound, with breadth & depth in relative to how the book successfully plumbed substantially the subject as it was evidently manifested by the author sweeping, masterful & informative penstroke.The aftermath of this unfortunate incident,being raped, also utterly dwelled on its repercussions. Since this graphic novel originally was a comic compilations of 5(or 6) issues, the last issue of this book was completely dedicated to the ramification & the reactions of the rape victims concerned. Proficient Sam Kieth,the author,educated on the subject, precisely showed us how each of the rape victims survived this horrendous & repulsive experience. His characterizations to each four were never been more truer.The author is one of the forefronts in telling a psychological tale, whom he is widely reknown for. The other one in parallel to him, whom Im very fond of, is J.M De Matteis. Sam Kieth efforts for this project was at his very peak. Four Women is the culmination & the benchmark of his career.The short summary of this yarn commences when the four lead/protagonist women-- they are the elderly, 40's-like Marion, manly Bev, middle-aged & married Donna & the youngest, a college student Cindy were travelling by car. And suddenly, on the middle of the road, there car broke down. It was this moment when the two would-be-rapists approach their car pretending to have good faith by helping.On the characterization front, the author's four leads were varied & each had their own disparate personalities. However, from my observation, two leads stood out. They were Bev & Donna. It is quite evident to a wary eyes to discern that Bev & Donna are having some sort of unspoken grudges toward each other. The object of their difference seemingly is \\"inner-strenght or character strenght\\".Characterization is this book secondary objective towards consummating a superlative story & profundity overall. The primary objectives are-- rape, which is the book theme, & psychological, which is the book genre. Throughout the story, one of the lens focus, was the implied actions between Bev & Donna. The manly looking Bev, assumed for herself, thru her actions, as more than capable & the navigator of the ship. She is the supposed in-charge person, decision-maker & arbitrator. But Donna, also by her explicit actions, saw otherwise. She deemed she was the sheperd of the herd & had the strongest will & character including Bev, especially moreso, in moments of crisis arisen.Up to the last page, their bickerings & dislikes to one another stemmed from that singular, relevant yet worst experience.Indeed, who among the two of them should actually presided the situation. Lying in the couch before the psychiatrist in a counselling session by Donna, she did her best to distorts the facts, to be in defensive posture, & made-up stories, just to assert her presumed superiority for the group, which she earnestly believed herself. Not much positive can be said to Bev as well. She is also one of the fires that started the whole incendiary.\\"Four Women\\" by Sam Kieth, is a satisfying hardcore reading & one of the best graphic novels today. If you are looking to read other \\"literary\\" GN, I have a few I like. \\"The Maxx\\" by Sam Kieth; \\"Age of Bronze\\" by Eric Shanower; \\"Maus\\" vol. 1 & 2 by. Art Spiegelman; \\"the Picture Bible\\" by Iva Hoth; \\"A Jew in Communist Prague\\" vol. 1-3 TP by. Vittorio Giardino.\\"Four Women\\", the graphic novel, is a \\"must own\\" & great to add to your collections.Most highly recommended !"},{"Title":"So What's the Good News?","review":"This is one of the most straight-forward, understandable, and eye-opening Christian books I have read. If you're looking for a book to make you look or sound like a smarter, more 'hip' Christian, this is not for you. Blue Like Jazz is a great book that will make you sound hip; you should get that one. However, I think this book may actually be better than Blue Like Jazz. Polk is not as good a writer as Miller, but He manages to present the Kingdom life in a way that not only encourages me, but challenges me. He doesn't speak 'Christianese,' the in-house language of most evangelicals, but tells of the work of God and subsequent life of God's people in a way that I can actually understand. It really feels like you're having a conversation with the guy, and he isn't out to prove he's right, explain all of your problems, or prove how smart he is.You do need to make sure you read the subtitle, though. Polk obviously intended to write an introduction to the Christian life. At the beginning, I was frustrated that he didn't explain in more detail the ideas he was presenting, but as soon as I remembered it was only an introduction, I fell in love with it. It has started so many conversations with friends, both Christian and non-Christian, which I think is his intention.

I had read of references to interrogation techniques but could not find any info on the net or in my library on _how_ interrogations are done. I read the reviews, compared the prices and picked this one. It's never going to win any award for literature, and you will recognize the techniques, though not specified as such, from any Law & Order episode. Everything about the interrogation starts with a witness/suspect waiving his right of silence. So, if you didn't do it, do not talk to the cops. They may not use special Jedi-ninja mind tricks to get confessions but plenty of people fall for fake sympathy, lies about evidence, and relentless repetition. One thing Law & Order gets wrong - the cops cannot tell you that if you confess, you will get less of a sentence; only the DA can make deals. Save your money, watch crime TV, don't do illegal stuff and above all, shut your mouth and keep it shut around cops.

After reading this book I feel that my confidence has been restored into the practice of these techniques. As mentioned in the back of the book- most false confessions are drawn through illegal techniques, pushing juveniles too hard, or the the more mentally fragile nature of those with low I.Q or questionable mental health history. False confessions will always rare, and most confessors are indeed guilty. In fact, confessions are not always used in court- the act of confessing brings more evidence to light for the police who can use that to prosecute and not overly rely on a confession.I can see however- for minor infractions especially- that those with previous criminal histories are more likely to confess to a crime they did not commit because they would feel their record or lack of a solid alibi would be enough for a jury to believe.This book has gotten me very interested in interrogations. I feel that should I ever end up in the hot seat- I would know what would be happening. Hopefully, I'll never commit a crime and actually be guilty! I would recommend this book to anyone interested in police interrogation- especially lay people."},{"Title":"Essentials of the Reid Technique: Criminal Interrogations and Confessions (Criminal Justice Illuminated)","review":"This book provides all the necessary information on one of the most common forms of interview and interrogation used by law enforcement agencies.

I have not and do not plan on taking the course.

I'll be referring to it for a long time in my line of work!"},{"Title":"Essentials of the Reid Technique: Criminal Interrogations and Confessions (Criminal Justice Illuminated)","review":"Essentials of the Reid Technique: Criminal Interrogations and Confessions\\"Essentials of the Reid technique teaches readers how to spot and interpret verbal and nonverbal behaviors of both deceptive and truthful people, and how to move toward obtaining solid confessions from guilty persons. The Reid technique is built around basic psychological principles and presents interrogation as an easily understood nine-step process. Separated into two parts: what you need to know about interrogation and employing the Reid nine steps of interrogation, this book will help readers understand the effective and proper way that a suspect should be interrogated and the safeguards that should be in place to ensure the integrity of the confession.\\"The \\"Reid Technique\\" is banned in some European countries because of its misuse in generating false confessions. In America many of the convicted who \\"confessed\\" were later proven innocent via DNA evidence. [Read the book \\"Actual Innocence\\".] In some Asian countries it is considered impolite to look anyone in their eye; sometimes called \\"staring\\" (or flirting) in this country. It goes against everything learned since the fictional \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" and the very real Edmund Locard. That is the use of physical evidence to test a suspect. [Read the book \\"Tainting Evidence\\" for warnings about planted physical evidence.]This is worth reading for anybody who is interested in True Crime, or even mystery novels. Amanda Knox was questioned for twenty hours non-stop until she agreed to sign a statement. The novel \\"Darkness at Noon\\" also tells about non-stop questioning. The movie \\"Boomerang\\" shows another example of non-stop questioning. If you ever become a suspect, it is best to say nothing except ask for a lawyer, then keep your mouth shut. Earl Rogers so advised."},{"Title":"Essentials of the Reid Technique: Criminal Interrogations and Confessions (Criminal Justice Illuminated)","review":"After reading this book I can see why a lot of people in prison are uneducated with mental issues. At first I used to think it was police racism but now I can see these tactics easily work on the mentally challenged. There is a brief section in the book on page 235 about false confessions. The author says in the experience of most professional interrogators the frequency of false confessions is rare and the four factors that appear with some regularity in false confession cases are: 1 suspect is a juvenile and/or 2 suspect suffers some mental or psychological impairment 3 interrogation took place over and inordinate amount of time and 4 interrogators engaged in illegal tactics and techniques. So I'm thinking of how many people in prison suffer from some mental or psychological impairment? I'm also thinking what is considered a inordinate amount of time for an interrogation? Time is a personal experience, a second can seem forever if you're holding your hand over a hot flame or time can speed by on fun days off. The book makes allot of statements that are one sided which is ironic since an investigator should know all factors that could cause a suspect to say or act a certain way...I feel a better book for investigators with tips to use with a flip side view point would be the book....Beat the Heat:How to handle encounters with law enforcement."},{"Title":"Operations Management and Student CD-ROM, Seventh Edition","review":"I'll make two separate sets of comments - one for professors and one for students.Students first... There is a well-done website that accompanies the book, which includes outlines, sample tests &amp; quizzes, and related study materials. The text is about average in terms of readability in comparison to other texts on the subject, and there are plenty of real-world examples to illustrate OM concepts (OM texts, as a general rule, don't read well). You may be able to get by with a previous edition if the textbook contents are your priority, but be advised, however, that the seventh edition contains some new and revised material, a few chapters have been re-arranged, and there are some different end-of-chapter exercises and cases.For professors... You are probably already aware that OM can be challenging for the professor as well as the student, esp. with respect to where to aim the course - to the managers and generalists, or to the technicians &amp; quantitatively-oriented. Heizer and Render have enough material to support either approach. The text is accompanied with ample instructor resources, including a CD and a website with slideshows, notes, outlines, and various other pedagogical tools. The testbank is easy to use, but should be supplemented with some quantitative short problems (if a quantitative approach is important to you).Heizer and Render have also done a fair job of keeping the material up-to-date, which has resulted, after seven editions, in a pretty decent product. For me, the instructor resources and the comprehensiveness of the content (adequate support for either a managerial or quantitative approach) make Heizer and Render a good choice by comparison to other OM texts."},{"Title":"Operations Management and Student CD-ROM, Seventh Edition","review":"still took forever to get here, but is free shipping and came before I need it anyway."},{"Title":"System 390 Job Control Language, 4th Edition","review":"I was hired as a mainframe programmer (trainee) having never laid eyes on a mainframe terminal and having no experience or knowledge of mainframes.

This is only partly true. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a cross-platform technology, but you can get different results on different platforms and different browsers.The book has a copyright of 2003, but no mention of Apple's Safari browser has even been mentioned, or the fact that since the release of Apple's new browser, Microsoft will no longer be coming out with new versions of Internet Explorer for the Mac platform. There is one pitiful, watermarked screenshot of a Mac-based browser that is obviously using OS 9.2.2 or older. All the other screenshots and examples use Windows XP.The book is busting with great information irregardless of platform, and some Web addresses of other sites using the technology to give you food for thought and a bit of inspiration.A few pages cover Font embedding, but the author would make you think that the only way to do font embedding is by using Windows, because no mention of Mac-based applications are even hinted at. How about HexMac? Why not even mention that it exists? It's like the \\"Mac/Windows\\" claim was an afterthought slapped on the book to increase sales - truly deceptive.Another star was lost due to the shoddy index.

Some of the selections seem a bit incongruous, such as the inclusion of the Benjamin piece in Part 1, but Kasinitz is a pretty good editor, and the introductions he provides to each thematic part help keep the work as a whole from seeming arbitrary and disconnected.If you're looking for an overarching theme, you'll probably be disappointed. Rather, each part (there are five) provides a snapshot of thought and theory of the evolution of urban sociology since its inception. So if you're looking for a profound modern argument or hypothesis on the state of the city in the 21st or even late 20th century, you'll be disappointed. If you're looking to get a broad grasp of the evolution of thought with regards to or an introduction to urban sociology, though, this is a very capable book, especially the firs two parts, which includes texts from important notables Lewis Mumford, Georg Simmel, Louis Wirth, Le Corbusier, and Jane Jacobs."},{"Title":"Metropolis: Center and Symbol of Our Times (Main Trends of the Modern World)","review":"The book was a compilation of essays from numerous individuals.

And she has included wonderful, common-sense advice. The first two chapters alone were worth the price. What a great concept, too. Most of us would never miss the $5.00 a day! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Wall Street on a Shoestring : Financial Success for Just $5 a Day","review":"This book presents a sensible, do-able, common sense plan for financial well-being. La Plante reminds the reader that it is really not how much money you have; rather, it is how well you use what you have that makes the difference.The book consists of eight chapters (not including a very well written introduction), with the first four laying the foundation for financial well-being and the last four giving detailed explanations of the various financial vehicles available to individuals for investment. All of the important aspects of financial planning are very well covered, and La Plante introduces most of the investment vehicles available to the individual investor. The book also contains a glossary of key investment terms and a listing of sources for further information on various financial and investment topics.La Plante tries very hard to be all-inclusive from the standpoint of reading audience, and she does this by introducing four fictional types of people, two individuals and two couples, each with different lifestyles and financial circumstances (single male, single working mom, thirty-something couple with a toddler and an older couple just embarking on retirement). Each chapter begins with a listing of topics the reader will encounter, and ends with a detailed summary of the major points of the chapter (these features will immensely aid the time pressed). Each chapter also includes a healthy dose of informative advice and tidbits on how to get the most out of Wall Street, which La Plante calls Wall Street Wisdom.While most of the information presented was not new to me, I do agree with the author's approach to financial well-being, which I feel is appropriate for most everyone at any age. I especially liked her treatment of mutual funds, dividend reinvestment plans, and most of all, investment clubs. All of these vehicles allow the small investor to participate for modest sums of money. I found La Plante's take on investment clubs to be very enlightening, for although she does advocate them as $5 a day investment vehicles, she strongly encourages the reader to look upon investment clubs more as a source of information and a clearinghouse for investing and financial ideas and less as an investment vehicle.Although the book is far from new, and most likely is out of print, it is hands down better than most of the books available on the market that deal with personal finance. Moreover, though the entire book is full of good, useful advice, the first chapter alone would more than pay for the book.

This book has a different feel than the previous two. It deals with Eilonwy leaving Prydain to &quot;act like a lady&quot;. Knowing her from the other books, she'd rather be doing what the guys are doing. Also Taran becomes aware of his feelings for her. Although they're usually arguing, I could see this sort of thing coming from a long way off. The main surprise is how someone(I'm not saying who)wants revenge and wants to exploit the unknown magical powers of Eilonwy to rule Prydain. The book, while simple like the others, gives great detail of how Mona is supposed to look like, and the actions of the heroes are easy to imagine.

Aside form introducing Llyan, the huge cat, and Rhun, who's even worse than Taran used to be,it has a wonderful dramatic scene at the end. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"The third volume of Lloyd Alexander's Prydain Chronicles, \\"The Castle of Llyr,\\" is something of a diversion. The action leaves Prydain, and the adventures have less to do with the larger struggle against evil in the wider lands.That doesn't mean this isn't a fun and humorous book. It is. Consider it something of a side adventure.One of the great joys of this series is the steady progression from lighthearted children's fantasy to more adult themes and a grimmer tone, allowing the reader to grow along with the characters. What begins as a light fantasy becomes very serious, and it works well. By the end, you feel as if the characters have taken a life's worth of journeys, learning from them as they went.The five wonderful books in this series feature an interesting cast of characters. Most of the action centers on Taran, a pig keeper destined for great things. Others, including a stereotypical spoiled princess, a crazed Gollum-like creature, and a hapless bard, take part in a series of increasingly epic adventures.In this volume, the cast find themselves in another kingdom, where Eilonwy is busy learning to be a lady. A conspiracy of sorts appears, and our hapless heroes find themselves caught up in it. They encounter another batch of odd and interesting creatures, including a giant stuck in a cave too small for him and a giant cat, and grapple with corrupt (or simply irritating) nobles. By the end, we have some new and welcome cast members.While on the surface this volume is not wholly essential for the broader Prydain story, \\"The Castle of Llyr\\" advances Taran and Eilonwy's relationship and introduces some characters who will appear again later. The writing is direct and lively throughout, frequently using humor to disarm serious situations, though the pacing is not as perfect as other volumes.The Prydain Chronicles, including \\"The Castle of Llyr,\\" are recommended reading for anyone who enjoys fantasy, especially classic children's fantasy. This series is among the best of children's fantasy literature, walking the fine line between being accessible to young readers and being appealing and engaging enough for adults to enjoy."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"The Princess Eilonwy has to go to the Isle of Mona to learn how to behaeve as a young lady.

You will be missing so many adventures."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"After the tinge of grimness in THE BLACK CAULDRON, Lloyd Alexander gives us a more light-hearted jaunt to Prydain in the third book of the series, THE CASTLE OF LLYR.I love this rollicking romp, but this is my least favorite book in the series despite our introduction to the smallest giant in all literature, Glew who has a wildcat the size of a carthorse, Llyan.The basic premise is that Princess Eilonwy is being sent to the Isle of Mona to be educated as a proper young lady. There's talk that she will be betrothed to Prince Rhun, the heir-apparent of that kingdom. Taran, Assistant Pig-Keeper and our hero, discovers he doesn't like separation from Eilonwy and he likes the planned betrothal even less. Prince Rhun is a nice guy, but a total klutz! To make matters worse, when events transpire that put Eilonwy in danger, poor Taran is taken aside by the King of Mona. The King, knowing that his son is less than competent, asks Taran to look after Rhun as well.Talk about a heart-burning situation! Rhun strives to live up to his position and Taran strives not to mind the fact that he has to repeatedly save Rhun when he really wishes the prince at the devil! This is very funny for the reader.Events move at a rapid pace in this volume, however the ending is still abrupt and still makes me indignant. My lips are sealed on that--this is a no spoiler review!Perhaps another reason that I like this book least of all five books in the series is Eilonwy herself. I love her daft comments and she's assuredly brighter than Taran, but as a character she never changes. From book one to five, Taran undertakes a journey that step by step takes him into manhood. Although Eilonwy is roughly the same age, she seems born with the knowledge that twists Taran around her little finger; she'll never change from girl to granny. It's the one flaw in Alexander's vision that he can't show us anything of Eilonwy's journey into womanhood. I can't call it a small one, but I love this series so much I can't mark it down too much. Call this four and half stars, then, in comparison to the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"Dont mind if I rated this 4 stars. THis is a great book, I couldnt stop reading it, but its just that THe book of Three was more interesting. I read this book since 5th grade(now im in 6th grade)its a lot interesting.I hope this review will be useful to you !!!thanks!!!"},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"I have only recently discovered Lloyd Alexander novels. I read THE BLACK CAULDRON, and immediately became so enthralled with Alexander's writing style and story-telling that I had to read the rest of the Prydain Chronicles. THE CASTLE OF LLYR, the third book in the series, met my need to involve the characters of THE BLACK CAULDRON and THE BOOK OF THREE, but this book is not THE BLACK CAULDRON, and seems to fall a slight bit short only because the overall theme of the novel is not approached quite as strongly.This installment of the adventures of Taran Assistant Pig-Keeper finds him escorting the Princess Eilonwy to the Isle of Mona where she is to be trained as a \\"real\\" princess, and then married to Prince Rhun, the bumbling prince of the isle. But sinsister forces are at work, and soon Eilonwy is spirited away, and it is up to Taran, Fflewddur the bard, Gurgi, and Prince Rhun to rescue her. They encounter many dangers along the way and quite a few interesting surprises that concern themselves and the Isle of Mona.- As far as CONTENT goes: There is definitely the use of a lot of magic in this story, between potions, magic items, and spoken enchantments. There are also a couple of disturbing sequences involving the possible brewing of certain characters. Parents may want to take a peek at these sections first to make sure their youngsters can handle it.THE CASTLE OF LLYR was a great adventure story that will immediately draw any reader in and not let go. Alexander has a wonderful way of catching hold of the reader with his story-telling. The theme addressed here is wonderful as each character learns something about themselves and how exactly Eilonwy's bauble really works.Fun read for a rainy day."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"I thought that &quot;The Castle of Llyr&quot; was the best book in the series. I enjoyed the interesting and exciting adventure with Taran, Fflewddur, Gurgi, and Prince Rhun to rescue the Princess Eilonwy from Achren. The book was very catchy, and it went the fastest. I also liked the ending of the book, but I won't give it away."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"The Castle of Llyr is such a wonderful addition to the Prydain Cronicles. After finding out that someone I knew was named after the series I decided to re-read them since I read them when I was very young. I remembered them as great books, and they still are. The Clastle of Llyr character's are wonderful, some new some old. I already have started the next book. I love Lloyd Alexander's books, I think that he is one of the best fantasy writers I have read.

This was the first (and not the last) of the Prydain series that I read as a kid. Even now I still read it and still enjoy the humor and philosophies in the books.

Not at all boring! I finished this book in one day it was so good!Eilonwy leaves for the Isle of Mona to train on how to be a proper princess. Taran, is notified of her great danger from Prince Gwydion. Prince Rhun, Taran, Kaw, and Gurgi set out to save the Princess from Achren."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"In this 3rd book of Lloyd Alexander's fantasy series, set in a fictitious, Welsh-like land, the Companions (encountered in the previous two books) undertake to escort the headstrong Princess Eilonwy over the sea to the Castle of Llyr, where she will receive training in Royal Behavior. Unbeknownst to the protagonists, however, the evil sorceress, Achren, is working out her private agenda to one day claim all of Prydain--for which she needs Eilonwy's inherited skills. To complete her vile scheme she enlists the spidery aid of the castle's Prime Minister, Magg.Although the two most prominent female characters appear at the end of the book, the Companions, fiercely loyal to Taran,offer a variety of talents in their quest to find and rescue thetomboy princess. In addition to our old friends (the Prince of Don,shaggy Gurgi, the truth-stretching bard, and Kaw, the crow (Hey, it always helps to have a winged ally), the author introduces readersto new characters: Glew, the dwarf who dabbles in potions andLlyan--a huge mountain cat with a fondness for harp music.Nevertheless, it is the character of young Prince Ruhn of Mona who proves the most human catalyst thrown into this mix; although nominally in command of the ship and then the expedition to find Eilonwy, this cheerful fellow proves an awkward bungler. Hopeless in times of trial and serious danger he seems an arrogant fool, proving more of a nuisance and even a burden to the would-be heroes. Beneath his oafish attempts which contribute to Taran's challenges the feckless prince aspires to marry Eilowny one day--a fact which galls Taran privately. Even worse he has promised the King of Mona to guard the youth at all costs and return him to Mona safely. Despite repeated instances of his awkwardness the prince amazes them all as he comes of age during this quest and offers to sacrifice himself for the princess.As the author points out in his introduction: this book offers more comic relief and also more hints of romance than the previous two books. Boys will easily relate to Taran's physical and mental struggles as he desperately seeks to prove that he is of greater value than his humble title of assistant pig keeper. Girls will enjoy the literary shenanigans as well. Here is Adventure Lite for Middle Schoolers."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"I read this book in about 3 hours it was so good! I hardly ever read that fast! It is one of the best books I've ever read!"},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"\\"The Castle of Llyr\\" is the third in the \\"Chronicles of Prydain\\". It is the first in the series to focus on Taran and Eilonwy's relationship from a romantic angle. In this book Dallben has sent Eilonwy away to the Isle of Mona to be trained in the ways of being a princess by her relatives there. Taran accompanies Eilonwy to Mona to find that he has a rival in the form of the Isle's clutzy Prince Rhun. Although this book is more romantically inclined than the others in the series, there is still plenty of adventure, especially after Eilonwy is kidnapped by a shifty steward, and Taran, Rhun, Fflewddur and the gang must go in search of her."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"The Chronicles of Prydain series has been a wonderful catalyst to get my 8 and 9-year-old reluctant male readers to sit for 20 minutes straight to finish a whole chapter.

It doesn't have the same kind of majesty that Alexander's other books have. Still, it is a very good book and adds humor where action is absent and allows Taran to discover his feelings for Eilonwy. Although it is my least favorite of The Prydain Chronicles, I would still recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"I really loved this book. It is a nice break from the others in &quot;The Prydain Chronicles&quot;, as it is more romantic and serious, yet does not lack action and edge-of-your-seat cliffhangers.

The feckless Price Rhun is hilarious, the cat Llyan is frightening, and the giant Glew is frustrating. Even though it stars and progresses rather humorously, the end gets dark and dangerous. This is a good book despite it being the shortest and funniest of the series.

Eilonwy is sent to a castle, where she is to learn proper &quot;lady&quot; etiquette. On Taran's visit with his companion, he notices something strange. The next day, Eilonwy is gone. This was a great book of adventure and fantasy. I would say it is the best in the five book series, and reccomend it to anyone who likes a good read."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"This is going to be a \\"typical internet review\\" in which the star rating is seemingly positive (or at least so-so), yet the review itself will dwell on the negative...***After over 20 years of sharing my life with Lloyd Alexander's Prydain chronicles, it has taken me up till now to realize why The Castle of Llyr feels the most underwhelming of the bunch, the least satisfying, the most unfinished. After all, it's not the quality of the writing, for it's as charming as ever. And the characterization of our beloved companions feels just as spot on as ever.It's the plot. Don't get me wrong. I have no problem with a book that (presumably) focuses on the Princess Eilonwy. The problem with Llyr is that it wastes this opportunity. The premise seems tailor made for exploring the character of the irrepressible Daughter of Angharad Daughter of Regat--what makes her tick, her family history, maybe giving longtime Prydain readers a true demonstration of her mettle... And yet she's absent for almost the entirety of the book! She puts in a couple of cameo appearances (ala Gwydian) at the beginning and end, but otherwise, her character is merely referenced by the others.In Llyr, there is some talk as to Eilonwy's potential to be one of the greatest enchantresses in Prydain (show us this!), there are mentions by the other characters of her irascible personality and how her abductor is surely going to regret kidnapping her (show us!), and mentions of her rich family history (show us!).Eilonwy is a character who has a mysterious past, comes from a long line of enchantresses, is set to be wed into a royal family, is kidnapped and put in mortal danger, and becomes the focal point of an island-wide search... And throughout it all, she is A.W.O.L. The themes I mentioned above are merely teases for the reader, musings voiced by the other characters. This not only makes the adventures of Taran and company feel a bit like \\"same old, same old,\\" but robs Llyr of having a strong identity of its own compared to the other 5 books. Llyr could have been the book in which Eilonwy (one usually reserved as a foil for Taran) came into her own. As such, it's more known as the book where we meet the giant cat. It's a book that doesn't seem to be about anything in particular except superficial adventures. (Indeed, the only part of the story that feels \\"important\\" is the end in which, not coincidentally, Eilonwy is finally on the page again.)[Compounding the problem: Not only is the kidnap victim largely absent, but the villain is as well. This off-screen stuff works fine when the villain is Arawn who can symbolize elusive, universal evil for the reader. But when the story is smaller like Llyr's, when the villain is more of an individual with a specific characterization, and when the plot is not painting in the broad strokes of \\"ultimate good vs. ultimate evil\\"--having such central characters absent for the entirety of the story presents a real problem. By the time we get to the ending which is meant to be a bit heartrending---(through bewitchment, Eilonwy does not remember who her friends are)---it's a bit like, \\"Who is this again? Oh, it's the girl we saw at the beginning. And who is the bad guy? Oh, it's this complete stranger who this book has not given us any time with until now.\\"]Imagine if the movie Cast Away had just focused on the Helen Hunt character and her 4-year decision to marry her dentist, with brief cameos by Tom Hanks at the beginning and end, and you kind of have The Castle of Llyr. It's sad that the 10-page short story \\"The True Enchanter\\" (found in the Prydain companion piece \\"The Foundling\\") feels more illuminating to the Eilonwy character than the whole of The Castle of Llyr.In the past I have read people (mildly) criticize Llyr for having a plot that feels insubstantial compared to the rest of the Prydain stories. Indeed, this is true. For unlike the other Prydain stories, one never gets the sense that a lot hangs in the balance. The companions aren't trying to save all of Prydain here, just one person. However, despite this, I feel this sense of \\"smallness\\" could have been offset had Llyr actually focused on exploring Eilonwy's character, the presumed subject of the book.We're not even sure if she's in much danger at all until the end. It's like reading a Scooby Doo mystery where the only investment you have is waiting for them to pull the rubber mask off at the end and find out whodunnit. Both the kidnap victim and the bad guy are absent for the entire story, and we're essentially left to hang out, once again, with Shaggy, Velma and the gang, whose escapades and shtick we've already seen multiple times by now, as they explore the haunted amusement park.I would guess that if any new readers chose Llyr as their first foray into Prydain, they'd be affected even more than a longtime fan. After all, why should someone care about the kidnapping of a character they never met before now, are never really given a reason to care about, and is mostly just alluded to by others.Make no mistake, the adventures we *are* presented with concerning Taran, Gurgi, Fflewddur, etc. are entertaining enough as always (if not exactly profound). And that pleasantness is why I feel the book deserves the three stars. But after realizing all that is missing, it's hard to unsee that big hole in the middle. Llyr would have benefitted from having at least a hundred more pages to give it a center. We could have gotten both the frosting and the cake. Llyr as is, is just the frosting."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"In this book Taran's thoughts and feelings about Eilonwy are the primary context of the story. It does a good job of setting up the next book in the series, Taran Wander, to offer a thorough exploration of Taran's self-understanding. As always, Lloyd's Prydain stories are accessible to young readers."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"i read this book when i was a youngster and just wanted to relive the story again. good for any child or adult that yearns for a simpler time."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"The Chronicles of Prydain continues in Book 3, The Castle of Llyr. Assistant Pig-Keeper Taran and his friends are going on another journey. This time, young orphan Princess Eilonwy is sent to the Isle of Mona where she will be taught the most difficult skill set she's ever had to learn: how to be a lady. The king and queen of Mona will teach her the courtly things every young princess must know. On the way, they meet the king and queen's son, Prince Rhun, who is a lot less competent than one would desire in the heir to the throne. He likes to be in charge but has no clue what he is doing. Very soon it is revealed that the king and queen intend to have Rhun and Eilonwy betrothed. All the while Taran discovers his true feelings of love for Eilonwy. But other plots are also going on. When Eilonwy is kidnapped, everyone must work together to save the princess from the evil enchantress Queen Achren.The story is exciting and moves quite quickly along. The romantic intrigue is an interesting addition to the adventure. It is definitely handled in a very kid-friendly way. To make things more complicated, the king asks Taran to watch over Rhun as they hunt Eilonwy's captors. Rhun eventually admits his own incompetence and his desire to prove himself worthy. There's lots of good drama and character development. The story seems a little episodic at times. They fall into many misfortunes and distractions that do not seem connected until the end of the story.Like the other books, it is very kid-friendly and I can't wait to read them to Jacob and Lucy."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"This is yet another wonderful book within the Chronicles of Prydain series by Lloyd Alexander. I highly recommend this series for both the young and young at heart."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"Lloyd Alexander, The Castle of Llyr (Yearling, 1966)The third book in Alexander's classic series takes Taran and friends to Ireland (excuse me, Llyr) when Eilonwy is given over to their regents for a more rounded education than she can get with a couple of old men and an assistant pig-keeper. Things get complicated when Taran, who has started to fall in love with Eilonwy, meets the Prince of Llyr, who becomes an immediate rival for Eilonwy's affections. Worse yet, when they actually get to the Castle, they find an old adversary they thought long dead is still around, and wants Eilonwy as much as either of the boys, though for very different ends. This sends the company on another adventure.It's as fun as the other books in the series, but it is kind of depressing to see such a well-worn, clich&eacute;d way of keeping a series alive woven into a series that's become such a backbone of juvenile fantasy literature. Still, the adventure is well-paced, as always with Alexander, and the writing is still solid. A minor dip in the series, hopefully rectified soon enough. ***"},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"I read the Prydain Chronicles as a child and still find them enjoyable today. I look forward to one day sharing these tales with my children."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"The Castle of Llyr is the third book in the Chronicles of Prydain, a series with such interesting characters and wonderful storytelling that each book is better than the last. This entry is something of a love story between Taran and Eilonwy, whose feelings had been hinted at in the first couple of novels. Eilonwy is forced to learn how to be a lady, all the while seeking to sneak away from her new castle home and go back to adventuring. She gets her wish, only to be kidnapped. As such, it is up to Taran and his companions to rescue the princess.As is usual for the Chronicles of Prydain, the plot is familiar but the story is not. Lloyd Alexander takes standard fantasy tropes, in this case the \\"rescue the princess\\" plot, and turns them into something unique and charming. In addition to returning supporting characters like Gurgi and Fflewdur Fflam, Alexander adds several new characters that are as unique and entertaining. The world of Prydain is alive not only with locations and history but with characters that you will grow to love.As the focus of these novels is on Taran's journey from adolescence into adulthood, you will see more development along those lines from him. This growth of character is not forced or sudden, and the end of the novel will leave you feeling like he has more growing to do. He does, in fact. Fortunately, the Chronicles of Prydain continue with another book following this one. By the time you finish The Castle of Llyr, you'll be thinking of little more than reading the next book in this wonderful series."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"A friend loaned me her copies of this series. I enjoyed them so much I wanted my children to be able to read them, but I was apprehensive about having them read her autographed copies, and they weren't available at our local library. I was so delighted to find them at amazon.com and at such a great price I just couldn't pass them up. This is one of those true classics, great for both kids and adults. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"The third book in Alexander's Prydain Chronicles is certainly the most romantic of the five books--Taran practically admits to being attracted to Eilonwy and shows jealousy when he learns that she's being sent to the Isle of Mona not just for \\"princess training\\" but, rather, because a prince (Rhun, providing the book's comic relief) is her intended husband.This book takes the form of a standard rescue-the-damsel-in-distress story but Alexander keeps the pace brisk and introduces new characters that will return in future books: Llyan, a giant mountain cat, and Glew, a giant. Dallben and Coll only appear in the opening chapters, but returning characters include wandering bard Fflewddur Fflam, Prince Gwydion, and evil Queen Achren.I woouldn't say that this is the best book in the series (that would be The High King, in my opinion) but it's a close second."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"This is a great series.

This book highlights self-sacrafice, as Taran has to choose whether or not to help the man competing for the same things that he wants. It also highlights the immorality of selfishness, as Glew is pretty much selfishness incarnate and ends up stuck in a cave with no way to get out, until Taran and co. decide to be merciful to him even though he tried to kill them.This books is lots of fun, definitely a recommended read, along with the rest of the series.Overall grade: A-"},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"Castle of Llyr is one of the coolest books I've ever read. It may not make sense if you haven't read the first two books in this incredible series, but even still its awsome. You may look at it and say, 'Its to long' or 'I don't like books with magic'but trust me, no matter what it looks like it is one of the coolest books I've ever read. If you like magic and sword fights, this is the place to be. If you like realistic fiction, you may want to look somewhere else. This book is 80 percent action, 15 percent just looking and searching,and the remaining five percent... is romance. But not enough to gag you, don't worry. The main character is Taran, the boy without an identity.The villian is Arawn death-lord, and his name says it all. There's kings and queens and sword fights and witches and people who love revenge. There's a wide variety of characters, too. If you like to read or just hear about fighting(some, not very violent), this is the book for you. One thing- if you're under 10 yrs. old you probably won't understand it. otherwise, its perfect."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"This has all of the best things of a long line of the best fairy tales of all time.

IT IS WONDERFUL WITHOUT A DOUBT."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"I recomend this book only to kids above the age of 9 because the book is a little scary.the book &quot;the castle of llyr&quot; is an exciting adventure.I got caught by the book in my school book fair.When i saw the book, i decided to read the summary on the back.it seemed so good i bought the book imeadetly.it was better than i expected."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"This book was my favorite of all the Prydain chronicles. Partly because a lot of the focus was on Eilonwy, though she was absent most of the book,(she has always been my favorite character) but also because it had great moral questions, and we finally begin to see Taran turn into an adult as he realizes as much as he cares about Eilonwy, he must let things be. In this book, Dallben decides that Eilonwy must leave Caer Dallben because it is time for her to learn how to be a young lady. He sends her to the Isle of Mona, and allows Taran to go with her, at least for the journey. On the way Taran struggles with his feelings for Eilonwy and his annoyance at Rhun, Prince of Mona, who is a bumbling fool, at least on the outside. Through an interesting chain of events, Eilonwy is kidnapped, and Taran learns that she is betrothed to Rhun without even her knowledge. They all go on yet another epic adventure to save her, as Taran must come to terms with his conflicting emotions. Another amazing thing about this book was that I didn't hate the love story part. Usually I hate mush because it seems as if they put it there just to be mush, and it rarely has any overall effect on the story. This however, was completly different, and I was actually hoping they would end up together. So, this is an excellent book that any fantasy lover would adore, though it would make more sense if you had read the other two books first."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"I have heard complaints that this book is boring, lacking in action. Obviously, some people fail to appreciate the DEEP EMOTIONAL TURMOIL Taran endures on his quest to rescue his beloved princess (the greatest heroine in ALL of fiction, thank you very much) so that she can marry a bumbling idiot in prince's clothing. Oh, wailings of misery! as Gurgi would say. This is the best book of the series, and my personal all-time favorite. A word to adults: don't cheat yourself out of Prydain because the series is &quot;for kids&quot;. I'm 20, and can fully enjoy the dark drama of Tolkein as well as the next fantasy-lover. But don't pass up the mini-wheats just because they're frosted! These books are ageless; these characters are as real as your own best friends. In fact, the fifth and final novel is dedicated to &quot;all the boys who might have been Taran, and the girls who will always be Eilonwy.&quot; Thank you, Mr. Alexander; I am one of the latter (this explains my lack of brevity!). READ THEM."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"The continuing epic story of Taran the Assistant Pig-Keeper and his rag-tag motley crew of kings, princes, and furry ape-like creatures. This book in the Prydain Chronicles is, truth be told, far more usual than its predecessors. While the first two books in the series were fairly new and different adventure tales, this one falls back onto the standard rescue-the-princess-from-the-evil-enchantress mode. Eilonwy is in trouble, and we learn much more about her background and history than ever before. Added to the usual mix of characters for spice (the dwarf Doli fails to make an appearance in this tale and, I assume, leaves a gap) is another unwanted Prince. This time it's Prince Rhun, a good-hearted if completely incompetent young man. His betrothal to Taran's beloved Eilonwy does nothing to make our hero love him more, but the prince's sweet nature and good spirits eventually win everyone over. Also introduced by the cat loving Alexander (remember, this is the author of the interesting \\"Time Cat\\") is Llyan, an over-sized mountain cat that has taken quite a liking to bard Fflewddur Flan's harp playing. All in all, it's a pleasant mix of lovable characters. As you might be able to tell, this is not a good book to begin the series with. At this point, we know these people (and animals) fairly well and nothing they do will come as much surprise to anyone. It still amazes me to no end how prolific kings and princes are in this land. Though I understand that much of the point of these books is to show how little birthright counts when it comes to being good and strong. And it is quite a relief to see Taran doing something other than hot-headedly rushing into danger as he's done in the previous two books. Alexander's characters are growing, slowly but surely. It is with glee that I look forward towards reading yet another installment in this enjoyable series."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"A slight break from the thunderous intensity of Prydain's battles, Book 3 features our favorite characters from the previous two books. Again, maintaining continuity will greatly enhance your experience of each story. Eilonwy, the girl adventurer must return to her proper position of Princess, or at least learn to be more like one - no easy task for this independent spirit. She is sent to the Isle of Mona unknowingly to be prepared as the future Mrs. Prince Somebody. Taran, her best friend and best enemy, is sent to escort her to Mona. Unfortunately, there are plots afoot and Eilonwy is gone before they know it. Taran, working through his odd, new emotions for the Princess, is off and running with the faithful Gurgi and king-cum-bard Fflewddur. We also meet the silly, sweet Prince Rhun, a tuneful kitty, a subterranean giant, and a real witch.While this is about Eilonwy, her heritage, and her future, it's also about the future of the friendship as people must change and follow their own destinies. Taran poignantly learns that sometimes the very most you can do is nothing. The change of pace is a refreshing, as we see the characters develop with each other instead of having to constantly flee/fight evil. This adventure feels more like a quest, with challenges to overcome and a goal to reach. In the process, all the heroes become closer and richer together."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"Taran has matured a little since the first two books; he's now less eager for a fight and also more aware of his feelings for the Princess Eilonwy. However, she's sent to the Island of Mona, the homeland of her ancestors off the coast of Prydain, to learn about becoming a proper young lady.Taran escorts her there with the loyal creature Gurgi and the foolish Prince Rhun as company. Once on the island Taran learns that Eilonwy's alleged aunt, Achren, has intentions for Eilonwy's magical powers that would be disastrous for all, and when one of Achren's sinister agents kidnaps the princess Taran leads a rescue mission to save her.Along the way they meet a harp-fancying cat in the forest and a midget named Glew in a cave, though both cat and midget have become giant-sized from Glew's magical meddlings, and the delays they cause make Eilonwy's plight all the more urgent.The themes of the book become ever more mature, as Taran sees in Rhun some of himself at a younger age--much to his irritation. And though I missed it as a child, the romantic tension between Achren and Gwydion is very much there (as it is in the first and last book, as well), adding greater nuance to a story in which Taran can't quite express his feelings for Eilonwy the way he'd like her to understand them. Not unlike most people in love, actually.The locations and plot may suggest that this story is a sideshow from the rest of the books, though the observant won't fail to notice certain characters and plot elements that lead directly up to the conclusion of the series."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"This is one of the funniest of the Prydain Chronicles. Humor is definitely one of Alexander's strengths, though also one of the series' few weaknesses, in that Alexander's characters each have their characteristic gags that they repeat over and over (the Fflam's propensity for exaggeration and bravado, Gurgi's alliterative interjections, Eilonwy's wilfulness, and so on), which quickly comes to seem too heavy-handed and belabored. But the fun is so genuine and so charming that one can forgive its obviousness. This is especially true in _The Castle of Llyr_, in which Taran speaks for all teenagers (and many of us who are older and who pretend to be wiser) who have suffered the torments of seeing the one they love in danger of bestowing his/her affections on a patently unworthy object (of course we would never object if the other guy--I speak as a male--were worthy of her--but somehow he never is). Once again, Taran has to make the choice between the appearance of heroism (in this case, being the one to rescue Eilonwy) and the reality.A welcome new twist, however, is the focus on Eilonwy, whose character undergoes further development. In this novel, Eilonwy has to make tough choices of her own, having to do with her magical heritage and its potentiality for both good and evil (especially the latter, as Eilonwy's former mistress, the sorceress Achren, reappears quite literally with a vengeance). Throw in a giant cat and a tiny (well, tiny in spirit) giant called Glew, and you have a thoroughly enjoyable entry in this excellent series."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"This fantastic book is an amazing sequel to The Book of Three and The black cauldron. Finding these books in my school library, I read the first one over winter break. I couldn't wait for the break to be over so I could get the sequels. This book turned out to be my favortite out of all five, though The High King was a close rival. The enchanting story about how Princess Eilonwy goes to Mona with Taran and Gurgi is facinating. All of the characters are unique in there own way, no matter how odd the character is. I love the character Prince Rhun. He is really funny. The ending of this book surprised me. I thought that Eilonwy would come willingly, happy to be rescued, but the ending is far from that. It is truly a worthy sequel to the first two books."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"The third book of the Prydain Chronicles is excellent, but somehow a little awkward. It is reminiscent of the teenager that Taran has become by this time, as he learns to help an inept prince to become more of a man. It teaches excellent values that adults as well as children should have. Enjoy this book, but read it as the third, following &quot;The Book of Three&quot; and the &quot;Black Cauldron&quot; or else it may loose some of its majesty."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"As a kid I read the Prydain books again and again. I can't resist some Harry Potter comparisons, and since they make a good common point of reference, I'll use the device here. The Prydain books aren't quite as exciting and magical as HP, but they have many of the same coming of age problems expressed through allegory, and frankly I find the characters better developed, more humorous, and more likeable. This is the third in the five book series, and to my mind the weakest but still very, very enjoyable. The protagonist of this book, as of the others is Taran of Caer Dallben, an orphan of unknown parentage and now an Assistant Pig-Keeper. He is being raised by a monastic collection of former war heroes and semi-wizards, and is always insecure about his lineage. In this book he also struggles with the crisis of his best friend, the princess Eilonwy, being forced to leave to learn to be a lady. Other main and recurring characters, save perhaps for the princess, are more or less also neurotic in delightful ways. Alexander avoids formula, even though the plot when described could sound like a million sword and sorcerer books. The depth and likeability of the characters lifts it above most fantasy books,though, especially fantasy books for kids. We grow up with Taran, and the character he develops is character that would almost universally be recognized as admirable. I highly, highly recommend all of them- at least as much as the HP books. Again, I think this may be the weakest one, but it's still terrific."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"Lloyd Alexander's five-part \\"Chronicles of Prydain\\" is essential reading for anyone, regardless of age, gender or reading preferences. Although they are classed as both fantasy and children's literature, these books can be enjoyed by everyone, not just for its fantastical elements and the broad good vs. evil conflict, but for their gentle humour, loveable characters and vindication of humanity over, not just fantasy-evil, but the more base qualities of greed, ignorance, spite and pride. At their core, the books are a coming-of-age story for our protagonist Taran, as he journeys from boy to man in troubled times, acquiring wisdom, humility, kindness and responsibility as he goes. The best part is that this process is gradual, but not stagnant. In each book, Taran has grown, and yet there's always more to learn on the path to becoming a man.As such, this third volume of the series \\"The Castle of Llyr,\\" concerns Taran's developing feelings for his friend and companion Princess Elionwy, who is being sent to the Isle of Mona in order to become a proper lady. The enchanter Dallben, with whom the young people live with, has himself ordered it. Neither are particularly pleased with the decision, and Taran is even less pleased to discover that Elionwy's new guardians have plans to betroth her to their son. Prince Rhun of Mona is hapless and clumsy, and jealousy rears its ugly head when Taran becomes acutely aware of his position in life as an Assistant Pig-Keeper.And yet all that must take a backseat when Elionwy is kidnapped, and Taran must work with Rhun, along with harpist Fflewddur Fflam and the faithful Gurgi, in order to bring her safely home. Their journey takes them into subterranean caves and across mysterious islands, only to find that the object of their adventure has been bewitched by the evil enchantress Achren who plans to use the Princess's latent powers to reclaim control over Prydain.As well as this, there are other familiar faces, such as the warrior Gwydion and the talkative crow Kaw, (though sadly, Doli doesn't make an appearance) and several other characters that play a part in the action both here and in stories to come: Glew, the \\"smallest\\" giant in fiction, the beautiful cat Llyan (who Alexander called \\"the prototype of cat-greatness\\") and Prince Rhun, whose clumsiness is offset by his endearing cheerfulness and awareness that he isn't quite the prince he should be. We learn more about Elionwy's heritage, particularly the purpose and nature of her glass bauble, though the full story of her people won't be fully explained untilTaran Wanderer (The Chronicles of Prydain). And of course, we get the first romantic overtures between Taran and Elionwy that are both poignant and typically awkward, as you'd expect from adolescents.The entire series takes place in the land of Prydain, which is heavily influenced by the mythology of Wales, as found inThe Mabinogion (Penguin Classics). Though it sounds like your typical fantasy-setting, there is a particular charm to this series, born out of Alexander's love and respect for life, his wit and wordplay, and the wisdom that he manages to infuse into his story without ever sounding preachy or pretentious. These five books, and the companion anthology of short stories set in Prydain's past, are essential reading for any child, to be put on the shelf right next toThe Chronicles of NarniaandHarry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-6)."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"This was very intriguing as Alexander added a new location to the magical and wondrous land of Prydain, the small island where princess Eilonwy goes to practice being a lady (which is what she hates doing the most) while Taran and the others join along to protect her from a plot to steal her lineage's magic power from generations back. This book, as usual, was filled with great adventure, surprising back stabs, traitors, friends and foes to defeat an old time rival for the protection of the magical power held at the mysterious and old castle of Llyr, the soul location of Eilonwy's magical lineage. This is not my favorite book in the series, though, but it was still very good and definitely worth taking a peek at."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"Alexander prefaces The Castle of Llyr by stating that, \\"For each of us comes a time when we must be more than what we are. And this holds true for princesses as well as assistant pig-keepers.\\" You'd think that with The Castle of Llyr being focused on Eilonwy, and my being female, this book would be my favorite. Yet except for The High King, the tales are all seen from Taran's viewpoint making The Castle of Llyr still a boy's read. Second, for much of the time, the story centers around the attempts of her friends to protect her. You see, Achren has returned and is seeking revenge. Well, actually, it turns out that Eilonwy is the last princess of Llyr. She alone has the power to invoke the magic devices and potent spells of the House of Llyr. And so Achren actually is seeking Eilonwy so she can control that power and rule the Prydain kingdom. Third, although I love Eilonwy as much as the other major characters, in many ways Eilonwy fits the stereotype of girls in traditional fantasies. Her societal role is to dress up, chatter, cook, and serve men, but she rebels against it by wearing men's garb, wielding swords, and demanding rights as an equal. In the sense that she refuses to become a respectable princess, Eilonwy serves as a role model. In other ways she doesn't, for she regularly thrusts herself into the forefront as one of the guys. For all these reasons, The Castle of Llyr is not my favorite book.Yet I still like it. For within its pages, we meet the Prince of Rhun. He reminds me of a younger version of the inept and impatient but honorable and likeable Taran. I enjoyed how easily vexed Prince Rhun could make Taran. When Rhun introduces himself, he realizes to his shame that he forgot to ask anyone's name. Now he has to repeat his whole greeting. In telling about himself, Rhun proudly talks about how easy it is to command a voyage: \\"All I have to do is tell the sailors....\\" Thankfully, the sailors know how to do their job and quietly go about their tasks without paying heed to Rhun, who has no idea how a ship is really run. Unfortunately, his lack of knowledge doesn't stop him from trying to take his hand at steering, any more than it once kept Taran from trying to make or brandish a sword. Under Rhun's control, the ship lurches so violently that Taran is thrown against the bulwark where he receives a nasty bump on his head. Still, when Eilonwy disappears and is suspected of being in danger, Rhun is among the first to join the search party. Despite all impending doom, he refuses to turn back but vows to find her. Through Prince Rhun and other new characters, Alexander instills humor into a sometimes dark story."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"Thirty years after I first read it as a child, I took a look at \\"The Castle of Llyr\\" again. The book was my least favorite of the Prydain series when I was a child--and my opinion of it has changed considerably. I suspect the reason I disliked it as a child was how different it is than the first two books in the series--instead of stopping evil forces threatening to rule the land, our heroes must rescue a captured princess.While the plot breaks no new ground, \\"The Castle of Llyr\\" is propelled by the solid cast of characters that Alexander continues to develop. As a child, I was struck by how the two lead characters- Taran and Elionway--grew in each book and, thirty years later, the way Alexander matured them continues to impress. While there is less action in this novel than in the first two books of the series, Alexander is able to subtlety weave a number of messages in \\"The Caste of Llyr\\" that younger readers might gloss over on the way to the next adventure scene.Elementary and junior high students with a taste for fantasy stories will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"This particular installment is a little darker than previous Alexander books I thought. I liked the story line development and characters, as i have read this now at the age of 12 and 40. The sense of imagery is really well presented by Lloyd Alexander and after seeing as many movies as I have, I still was able to imagine and enjoy this story and it's characters."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"Finally, books I remember enjoying as a kid that still stand up to re-reading as an adult!They are sometimes described as coming-of-age stories, and that is true in the best sense of the term. Alexander is deeply concerned with growing up, and he examines many of its central, deepest, and most profound aspects, such as discovering one's personal identity, and responsibility. Each book in the series looks at these themes in different ways and builds on them a little more. My favorite in the series, Taran Wanderer (which I had expected to enjoy the least), deals with these issues so simply and directly that it acquires an almost allegorical quality. He teaches many important life lessons that are every bit as relevant to us grown-ups as to young adolescents just beginning to struggle with these issues. And he does so through engaging stories and a memorable cast of characters. From now on, whenever I find myself in a situation that tests my courage or integrity, all I have to do is think to myself, \\"A Fflam never falters!\\"Some people like to complain about the supposed similarities between these books and those of Tolkein, but apart from some basic structural features stemming from their common mythological roots, there really isn't a lot of similarity in the details. Even in the most obviously similar part---the ending---what is really interesting is how it differs. I can't say much without giving it away, but let's just say that Alexander, to his credit, ultimately says almost the exact opposite of Tolkein. No, Alexander's fantasy world isn't as complex and well-developed as Tolkein's, but these books were written for a younger audience, and let's face it, nobody can stand up to a comparison with Tolkein as far as that goes. I think if people, of whatever age, take these books on their own terms, they will find them to be a rewarding experience."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"This is a terrific series for adults and for teens. I enjoyed reading all the books very much and would recommend them for anyone who enjoys fantasy and fantastic tales of magic and adventure.(Don't tell the kids, but it's really good at featuring excellent character in the protagonist as well.)"},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"I ordered Lloyd Alexander's book \\"The Castle of Llyr\\" for my 29-year old son who is an aspiring author and illustrator.

Princess Eilonwy is sent off to the care of the King and Queen of Mona to become a lady. When Taran accompanies her, he finds a romantic rival as well as a sinister plot. This book was just as cute as the earlier books--maybe a little cuter because of Taran's frustrating realization that he is romantically interested in Eilonwy."},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"Princess Eilonwy goes to her beloved home isle where there has been no battle or fights. It's where forests go for miles and miles, flowers bloom everywhere and when Taran is in his chamber Lord Gwydion shows up and tells him Eilonwy is in danger and Queen Achren is after her. Eilonwy is stolen and Taran, Prince Rhun, Fflewddur, & Gurgi, look for her. On the way, Taran and his champions get in some trouble. Eilonwy is under queen Achren's spell. Taran fights against it and... it's your choice to find out more.I liked this book because Lloyd Alexander did a good job with Fflewddur; he made him with a good sense of humor, funny. For example, on page 77 a mountain lion was running after Fflewddur and he said \\"Great Belin, she wants me back!\\" Previously in the story Fflewddur is trapped by her and he escaped so that's how she wants him back if your wondering .Another good thing I liked about the book is when Taran and his companions were trapped between the big mountain lion and how it adored Fflewddur. Another thing I liked about the story was that Taran has grown up, understands more and comprehends more. For instance, when Taran and the companions were trapped by Glew the giant he made a promise to the king he would keep his son Prince Rhun safe and would let nothing hurt him and he keeped his oath. On thing I didn't like about the book was when Taran and his companions were trapped under ground. Alexander didn't put a lot of detail in this scene so I couldn't picture what the under ground looked like but everything else in the story was pretty good with a lot of detail. kb, red creek"},{"Title":"The castle of Llyr","review":"So, a certain character must learn to become their station in life.

I am not a Waldorf purist---meaning I do not send my children to a Waldorf school (I homeschool)or necessarily follow or believe in Rudolf Steiner's philosophy. Yet I have read several Waldorf books on caring for and educating children, because they are very wise as to what children really need. They DON'T need the media, malls, plastic toys, the latest styles in clothes, or a life of being pushed from this lesson to that club. What they DO need is plenty of peace and quiet (AT HOME!!), simplicity in all forms (in their toys, their life schedule, their food, etc.), and they need routine in their day, and they need to be loved and understood and treated like children, not mini adults. The author of this book is such a wonderfully calm woman...I wish she had been my own mother!! She really understands children and what they need. Her calm wisdom just flows from every page of this book. This is an easy book to read, a plus for any busy parent. She speaks of the importance of rhythm in the life of chidren, the importance of play , the importance of calmness, and she has a chapter on creative discipline. Our society is so crazy, it is so hard for adults to cope in this modern lifestyle; think of how much more difficult it can be for children.A few things she talked about really stood out to me. One was how her one son could come down with a fever after a shopping trip to the mall, because it was too much for him to handle. We need to consider that children need to have QUIET lives! Another thing was that they had an 11 yr. old foster child live with them, and this child said that noone had ever read her a bedtime story. The author loved this child, but because she was ignored and unloved in her earlier years, it was never possible for her to really love or be loved. This brought out the importance of the early years in the life of a child, for they are truly the formative years of a person's character and personality. We cannot afford to ignore the years from birth to age 7. And the one thing that was so neat was that one mother asked the author to suggest what she could get for her preschool son, for the only thing she could think of was a video game. The author suggested a playstand, some cotton cloths, some baskets filled with clothespins, crystals, etc. The mother thought this was weird, but she did it. Well, was she ever surprised that her son LOVED these gifts, and spent all Christmas day playing happily with his sister!! We CAN be simple with our children, and because if it, they CAN be creative and happy. Do yourself and your children a favor and read this book. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Beyond the Rainbow Bridge: Nurturing Our Children from Birth to Seven","review":"Warmth and wisdom, insight and know-how - Beyond the Rainbow Bridge - Nurturing Our Children from Birth to Seven has it all! Small wonder, then, that this book has already become a treasured resource in classrooms and homes worldwide: parents and teachers have finally found what they were looking for.Anyone dedicated to raising healthy children to responsible adulthood will discover a wealth of information that both inspires and affirms. For instance, Barbara Patterson's characterizations of the different stages of early childhood development are nothing less than remarkable. Not only do they offer vivid, \\"close-in\\" looks at the world from the viewpoint of children at different ages, but more importantly, Patterson's grandmotherly warmth and decades of teaching experience bring the world of the young child to life with an enthusiasm that makes understanding immediate and clear. With her lively developmental account as a foundation, her suggestions for creative discipline flow straight off the page and right into the reader's heart, with a resonance of, \\"Yes, of course. That's so true, so obvious!\\"Patterson also focuses on the life-giving, uprightness-inspiring qualities of two aspects of children's lives that are seldom addressed as a tandem pair: creative play and daily routine. She so beautifully demonstrates that, while creative play would be invaluable simply for the joy it offers children, in fact it offers them much, much more. Through example after example, Patterson shows that play is the young child's most important avenue of exploration of the adult world. Given an environment that supports openly creative play, without a lot of pre-defined games and limiting roles (in other words, without the television character/action figure sort of toys that lend themselves to only one sort of play), children naturally invent imaginative settings where they can try out new experiences, process emotions, imitate adults at work, and learn to care about others and the world. They will do this over and over again, until they \\"get it\\" and move on to the next setting of interest.Barbara Patterson then goes one step further and offers a counterpoint to the limitless horizons of creative play, namely, daily routine. Where creative play enables a child to comprehend, practice, and master the full breadth of human experience, daily routine offers children security and assurance that the world is a purposeful, meaningful place to live in while at the same time guiding our children toward becoming both responsive and responsible to the needs of society and the Earth. As Patterson's examples reveal, children who can rely upon meals served at the same time each day, a good nap in the afternoon, and a set bedtime complete with a ritual of stories, verses, or prayers grow secure and firm in their bodies and emotions. They also experience that there are times when we humans are called upon to leave the limitless possibilities of self-expression and serve the needs of both others and ourselves. Beyond the Rainbow Bridge is unique in its presentation of creative play and daily routine as the in-breath and out-breath of human life.Rainbow Bridge is filled with many other perspectives that offer an invigorating and successful approach to the quandaries of childrearing. Readers are introduced to the lifelong significance of keeping a child warm. Here Patterson has invited Andrea Rentea, M.D., an alternative medicine practitioner, to give parents and teachers a fuller explanation of why young children need to be kept warm. Hint: it's not just because they might catch cold, though that is certainly a possibility. The longer-term reasons have, on the one hand, to do with offering the best possibility of developing efficient and healthy metabolic, respiratory, and nervous systems by not placing undue stress on children's bodies too early. On the other hand, keeping a child warm has another equally profound outcome - it can help prevent the adult phenomenon of being so \\"shut down\\" that the child-become-adult can no longer sense her body's signals that an adjustment in diet, clothing, etc. is needed.Patterson also borrows from Rudolf Steiner and describes twelve human senses, not five. At the turn of the century, it was far from a foregone conclusion that humans possessed only five senses - each scientist and philosopher felt free to look at human sensory experience and develop a description of the senses that corresponded to that reality. The most common descriptions offered five, seven, nine, eleven and twelve senses. Patterson supports Steiner's view that attributing twelve senses to the human being is the most useful model for educational work. Now readers throughout the world can discover this multi-layered approach to raising healthy children. Patterson fully describes each sense, then offers practical suggestions for fostering the development of each. The result? A well-rounded human being whose body, soul, and spirit have all been blessed by those who love them.Reading Beyond the Rainbow Bridge is an exhilarating experience - filled with revelation and delight, told with grandmotherly warmth by a seasoned teacher, and accompanied by practical suggestions that really work! Charming drawings and photos add an extra dimension to this professionally acclaimed book - no one engaged in parenting or teaching young children will want to miss it!"},{"Title":"Beyond the Rainbow Bridge: Nurturing Our Children from Birth to Seven","review":"Finally, a parenting book that makes sense! In a gentle, easy, and non-threatening way this book teaches the importance of creative play, the necessity of daily routine, and the merits of creative discipline. The suggestions work and are easy to incorporate into any lifestyle. As the mother of a preschool child I found this book to be reassuring and comforting. Learning to use statements with the directive &quot;You may&quot; as in &quot;You may put on your shoes now&quot; produced immediate results -- as did limiting choices, which ultimately made everyone feel more secure.This is a phenomenal book -- it belongs on every parents nightstand, on bookshelves in our schools, and as required reading for elementary educators. I recommend this book to expectant parents, parents with young children, and anyone who values and understands the importance of a nurturing environment for children."},{"Title":"Beyond the Rainbow Bridge: Nurturing Our Children from Birth to Seven","review":"I purchased this book because I want to get my hands on anything about Waldorf (Rudolf Steiner) education. But had I never heard of Waldorf schooling, I still would have devoured this book! It is an easy read- not bogged down with philosophy or too preachy. Some books I have read about the Waldorf method left me feeling terribly guilty that my son has ever laid eyes on a television set or that he has a room full of plastic, battery operated toys. Instead, the authors give solid reasons why television watching and cold hard plastic toys with only one use can be harmful to the developing young child, and offer alternatives to TV and unimaginative toys.By breaking down the age groups into 0-2, 2-5, and 5-7, Barbara Patterson, a Waldorf educator, is able to suggest developmentally appropriate activties and toys, and describe in detail how the young child develops physically, emotionally, and spiritually at each age.I especially enjoyed the chapter on &quot;Creative Discipline&quot; (Who couldn't use a few new ideas with preschoolers!) where she explains how reforming the space around the child, (i.e. changing specific things about the child's surroundings)serves as both prevention and correction for misbehavior.I was impressed with Barbara's apparent love and respect for children, something that sadly seems to be missing in many parenting books. Her focus is on understanding how and when children develop and the importance of raising happy and capable children, not just ones that do as they are told.A bonus I didn't expect when I ordered this book is the appendix with illustrated directions for creating toys that foster imagination and creative play, like the knot doll, puppets, and even directions for finger knitting (something I forgot 16 years ago!)I highly recommend this book for teachers and caregivers of young children, parents, grandparents, expectant parents, and anyone who has young children in their lives that they care about."},{"Title":"Beyond the Rainbow Bridge: Nurturing Our Children from Birth to Seven","review":"This book seems to get great reviews, but I just wasn't terribly impressed. There aren't a lot of nitty gritty details in the book. It really just seems like one big general overview....which I wanted much more than that. Particularly annoying are the dialogue sections at the end of each chapter between her and \\"parents\\". These parents ask her some good pointed questions and in her replies, she never answers the question. I don't know how many times I thought...yeah, I wonder that too...only to have her evade the tough question and come off sounding like an authoritative know-it-all. There are some good parts to it, like her description of the senses and about rhythms, but overall I would recommend other books on the subject before this one. You Are Your Childs First Teacher by Dancy is much much better!"},{"Title":"Beyond the Rainbow Bridge: Nurturing Our Children from Birth to Seven","review":"I agree with the reviewer that said one should take this book with a grain of salt.The idea of giving a young child lots of time to play and a simple, natural environment to do that in is a good idea. However, we cannot shield our children entirely from the outside world of noisy electronic devices and any kind of machine whatsoever. If you read the book, you get the sense that even playing a CD or using a vacuum cleaner is unhealthy exposure for children seven and under. I think our kids will survive!The part about leaving your kids at home when going to the mall, if possible, is wise advice. I know my kids' senses get overloaded in those places!This isn't the most practical of books, but it does gently point the reader toward creating an environment of peace, order, and simplicity for our children to grow up in.

I was a tad disappointed because based on all the reviews, I was expecting the book to really be a worthwhile addition to my waldorf collection. For the relatively high price, it is very short with big print and lots of pages spent in a very basic question and answer format. I essentially did not learn ANYTHING new. Instead, I highly recommend the book Heaven on Earth by S. Oppenheimer. It is a waaaaay better value: much more densely packed with information on many, many (waldorf related) topics, is intelligently written and explained, has pictures, tons of family and craft and literacy ideas, and tons of references, and I feel it is beautifully written. I feel Beyond the Rainbow Bridge was hastily published and could be of more value if the author had included more of her expertise, which she no doubt has. However, if you are looking for a VERY basic and SHORT intro to the waldorf approach to nurturing kids to age 7, then this might be your book, otherwise skip it."},{"Title":"Beyond the Rainbow Bridge: Nurturing Our Children from Birth to Seven","review":"I think this book is very insightful in alternative ways of parenting. It makes you stand back a minute and think of how your child might percieve our parental actions. Often it is hard for an adult to see through the eyes of a child. This helps a bit. It is not something that you need to strictly adhere to, they are ideas that you may try to incorporate into your style of parenting. Whether you are going the Waldorf route or not, I think many parents can gather insight about parenting from this...(A side note to the tub cleaning reviewer - try biodegradable cleaning products or give your son a bucket full of soapy water and a sponge, or a spray bottle filled with plain water, he doesn't need to know that he doesn't have the same cleaning solution that you do...it's the fact that he wants to clean with you...someday he won't want to do all these things with you...and you'll fondly look back on the times that he did - that we all need to remember.)"},{"Title":"Beyond the Rainbow Bridge: Nurturing Our Children from Birth to Seven","review":"This is a wonderful book, with lots of good information about nurturing young children.

First, it is a very concise book compared to a lot of parenting books. The authors cut right to the chase and get to what really matters without a lot of fluff and fancy philosophical BS. Although their approach to parenting is heavily influenced by the work of Rudolph Steiner, the way that they share information on development, discipline, play, and health is palatable for any parent whether interested in Waldorf or not. (Sheesh, I am sound like I am doing a book review over here. Not my intention).Ok - on with why this book is such inspiring to me and how it has influenced my mothering!The authors have a 13 page section on play and honestly, it is some of the best information I have ever read on the topic. In a few short paragraphs, I clearly understood why a doll is so vital to the development of both boys and girls and how \\"doll play\\" evolves as the child grows older. I also learned what a poor choice toy boxes and contained types of toy storage systems are. It is important that children learn the value of caring for their toys and play things. A toy box encourages fast, careless clean up whereas a shelf or cube with small baskets or nothing at all encourages children to place individual items in their place with more care. Although children under two and a half are too young to express it, the majority of children enjoy knowing that their personal items are in the same location each day. It is soothing to their mind to understand that their doll is in the cradle and their blocks are on the shelf. A toy box is confusing for them as they do not know where in the box a certain play item may be.The authors' section on creative discipline is so thought provoking. They do not come at you with a hard and firm \\"this is what you must do or your child will be a delinquent\\" approach. In fact, Barbara Patterson states that \\"what may seem normal or acceptable in society today is not necessarily what is healthy for families and children.\\" I absolutely love that idea because it seems like most books on discipline are geared towards such unhealthy approaches.For the rest of my discussion on how this book inspired my parenting, see: [...]"},{"Title":"Beyond the Rainbow Bridge: Nurturing Our Children from Birth to Seven","review":"This book is right now at number one.

It basically seems to focus on creating a harmonious relationship between children and nature. The authors encourage introducing your children to the four elements (supervising obviously) of earth, wind, fire and water through activities like doing dishes and lighting candles. She puts a large emphasis on what she calls rhythms, or periods of \\"breathing in and breathing out\\", alternating periods of energetic play with more managed quiet times. She also encourages a weekly routing to help the child feel more stable and learn the days of the week (wash on Monday, iron on Tuesday, etc).The only thing I really didn't like in this book is that she is a big fan of redirecting as a means of discipline, and seems to encourage almost a religious (mother nature) view of the earth.The authors certainly offer a lot of good points and suggestions that I plan to incorporate with my son, so I certainly think that it was well worth the time to read it."},{"Title":"Beyond the Rainbow Bridge: Nurturing Our Children from Birth to Seven","review":"Such a kind and true approach to parenting.

His multiple perspectives are embodied in seperate characters -- taken together, these characters form the whole of the Karamazov family, and these perspectives constitute the whole of Dostoyevsky's view.Each of the brothers represents a distinct school of thought or values -- the impulsive Dmitri portrays the instinctive and carnal desires of man; the nihilist, Ivan, displays the cold and unforgiving intellectual, governed by the rules of logic alone; the religious Alyosha, student to the Great Elder Zossima, depicts the humble and devout spiritualist. While the murder of their father, Fyodor Karamazov, is the catalyst to the real action of the book, it is certainly not the central focus -- a fact that might be surmised in light of the fact that the murder is not carried out until more than halfway through the text.Instead, the work is a discussion and analysis of man's values and beliefs, and an affirmation of Dostoyevsky's fundamental conviction: that the presence of the human spirit cannot be denied without disastrous results, and that despite the assertions of the nihilists, God is a necessary element in the world of man."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"&quot;I would die happy if I could finish this final novel, for I would have then expressed myself completely.&quot;This statement from Fyodor Dostoyevsky helps elucidate both the theme and purpose of the The Brothers Karamazov, one of the greatest masterpieces of world literature. Superficially, the novel deals with a patricide and how each of the book's characters contributed directly or indirectly to that murder.Yet, The Brothers Karamazov, at its heart, is so much more. Its underlying theme deals with the drive for self-redemption in the eyes of both God and man and the role suffering plays in facilitating that redemption.Fyodor Karamazov has fathered four sons, Dmitri, Ivan and Alyosha, by two wives, and one, Smerdyakov, with a peasant woman known as stinking Lizaveta.Fyodor Karamazov, a vulgar and ill-tempered man represents, for Dostoyevsky, the Russian government of his times. Like the government, Fyodor shuns his children, preferring instead the materialistic, but joyless, life of wealth and possessions. His union with Lizaveta, who comes to represent all the peasants of Dostoyevsky's Russia, produces Smerdyakov, a bastard child who, in his own turn, will be raped and pillaged by the government and will go on to give birth, metaphorically, to bastard children of his own.Karamazov's eldest son, Dmitri, an impulsive sensualist, finds respect as an overbearing soldier but one whose inability to pay his debts eventually turns him into a poor and irrational man.Ivan, Fyodor's second son, is a cold intellectual who finds his fulfillment in his literary and creative abilities. He becomes famous through his writings, especially those concerning the Russian Church.The youngest son, Aloysha, finds temporary fulfillment in the cloistered, monastic life. Outwardly innocent and naive, Aloysha struggles with his desire for spiritual fulfillment in the monastery and the joys and excitement of the secular life.The character who provides the catalyst for change is that of Father Zosima, a character who seems to embody the strong spiritual sense that was Dostoyevsky, himself.Father Zosima, who has lived a pure and spiritually-nourishing life, has the gift to sense both a man's motivations and his needs. Zosima tells the brothers Karamazov that a sheltered, monastic life is not a prerequisite to the achievement of spiritual riches, a fact that seems to be proven true when Zosima's corpse rots after his death in direct contradiction to Russian belief at the times regarding spiritual purity.It is Father Zosima who, throughout the book, expounds Dostoyevsky's theory that it is suffering that will purify and cleanse our soul, thus bringing us peace. Each brother, in his own fashion, undergoes his own trial by fire, and, in the end, is better for it.One brother, tormented by a guilt he does not deserve, must live his life in unwanted exile, or not at all, though he possesses the heart and soul of a true Russian. Another suffers the torments of a complete nervous breakdown that leaves him grappling on the very edge of sanity. Only a third son seems to find the answer he is seeking and the novel's uplifting final scene epitomizes Dostoyevsky's eternal belief in the importance of Russia's children in her future, as children hold their hands high and shout, &quot;Three cheers for Karamazov,&quot; ending this essentially depressing masterpiece on a joyous note.An extraordinarily complex and rich novel, The Brothers Karamozov also deals with man's response to death. All of the characters, each in his own way, attempts to flee from death and only those who can finally accept the finality of death and the suffering of living find justification and fulfillment in life.Dostoyevsky uses many stylistic devices to expound upon his theme of redemption through suffering: imagery, irony and dreams are three of the most prominent, however, it is Dostoyevsky's wonderful ability to manipulate the third person subjective that serves to illuminate each character and bring him to life.The Brothers Karamazov is a book that delves deeply into the heart of man and the soul of Russia. Dostoyevsky, as any true artist, presented facets of himself in all of his characters who each manages to see the world in a different way and finds redemption through his own unique vision.Ironically, one of the brothers Karamazov is portrayed as a young man who begins to instill the seeds of change in Russia through its children, something Dostoyevsky, himself, thought was needed if Russia was ever to make the transition from a backward country to a global power. That it did, although the children Dostoyevsky envisioned as spiritual visionaries became instead, violent revolutionaries. They sought to free the peasants, not through enlightenment but through the establishment of a totalitarian state Peter the Great would have envied. Today, however, Russia tragically lies amidst the same poverty in which it was dwelling one hundred years earlier.Clearly, Dostoyevsky's path to enlightenment, illuminated brilliantly in The Brothers Karamazov, has not yet been fully assimilated by either the people of Russia or the people of the world in general.A sad and ironic twist to the vision of a master writer and a truly prophetic man."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},L={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],C={key:0},q={key:1};function R(n,e,s,c,r,i){const f=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",L,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),p(f,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",q,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",C,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const j=u(M,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-f8301964"]]),B=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/10.md","filePath":"library/10.md"}'),V={name:"library/10.md"},z=Object.assign(V,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{B as __pageData,z as default};
