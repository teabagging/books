Indeed, at the height of his fame, it's revealed that the King of the Game has worked as a circus clown. As a youth, Roy is all set for the majors until a strange attack from a Kundryesque temptress leaves him wounded; and for fifteen years he wanders aimlessly, to all appearances lost. {The novel opens on a speeding Pullman, and Roy is described as \\"traveling (on the train that never stopped.\\")} When finally he re-enters the profession, he joins the Knights led by Pop Fisher. This \\"jinxed\\" team is going through a wasteland of a season, \\"glum and red-eyed ... they moved around listlessly and cursed each step.\\" The knight errant proves to be their salvation, depicted in one scene as being \\"in full armor, mounted on a black charger\\".

And I hate to break this to Kevin Costner fans, but this book is not dripping with Karo syrup, nor is there a \\"magical\\" conclusion in which a hero plays catch with his long-dead Dad."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"In this masterful book, Bernard Malamud takes our most myth-laden game and overlays a fantasy story about the man who could have been the best ballplayer who ever lived. The story propels you onward through the season of Roy Hobbs' return to baseball and to society, as you marvel at his on-field feats and laugh at the reactions of his manager, teammates, and team owner. Throw in a pair of love interests -- one being the unattainable beauty Memo and the other (Iris) being the warm, mothering type who Roy really needs -- and you have as amazing array of subtexts and subplots for such a small book.\\"The Natural\\" isn't just a baseball story, though the baseball elements are portrayed with great accuracy. Each baseball vignette starts out as if it's \\"regular\\" baseball -- a great hitter, a fastball pitcher, players spitting in the dirt, and so on. But Malamud spins them all out of proportion, as Hobbs brings his homemade bat, Wonderboy, to the plate and does the impossible. In one game, Hobbs literally destroys the baseball with a swing. In another, he hits a ball that starts out so low that it goes through the pitcher's legs, then rises just above the 2nd baseman's glove, and soars upward out beyond the centerfield fence. And in the fateful last at-bat of Wonderboy, the cracking of the bat sounds like thunder and actually brings some raindrops onto the field.These mythic circumstances are balanced by the mysterious, inspiring and infuriating story of Hobbs himself. He's introduced as a backwoods phenom on his way by train to Chicago for his major league tryout. He's such a hick that he doesn't know how to order from a menu. And when his fastball accidentally kills the scout who is promoting him, he's left alone in the big city, with tragic consequences. Then, fast-forward 15 years, and Hobbs again wanders in from the wilderness, this time to take the National League and the straggling New York Knights by storm. Through the heart of the book, he wills the team from last place towards first place through his awesome play and the determination he shows on the field.But at every step, tragedy follows. Hobbs' passions are so intense, his flame burns so bright, that he leaves death and destruction in his wake over and over again. He also shows himself to be so crass and single-minded that he pushes for what he wants --- even when he realizes that he is harming other people. He's bigger than everyone else (in a mythical sense), and he can't help leaving them in his wake.It's a great book. Is it as easy to read as today's current fiction? No. Is it as crowd-pleasing as the movie, \\"The Natural\\"? No. But it does two things that make the movie also memorable: capturing the spunk of Depression-era baseball, and making the achievements of Roy Hobbs larger than life."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Great book. Nice dust jacket. This is a classic story of a man finding out what he's really made of. Love this story."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"My father was an English teacher who also happened to be a baseball fanatic, and I still have his marked-up copy of \\"The Natural\\" somewhere in the basement. He actually built an entire English class around baseball fiction, with this book as its centerpiece.You can't help but appreciate the humanness of Hobbs as the book moves along, picking up steam much like the locomotives that are often used as a metaphor.My favorite character is probably Pop - what a great, colorful caricature of a crusty old manager who lives and dies with every batted ball and terrific throw.\\"The Natural\\" is the standard by which all other baseball novels - including mine, The King's Game - are judged. And that's how it should be.And other reviewers are right - you'll never see the book's ending coming if you saw the movie first, but that's a good thing. This ending feels more real, more true, more human.A classic!-- John Nemo, author of the baseball novel The King's Game"},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"I thought the movie \\"The Natural\\" was great. The story the book tells is even better. I think that each of the different tellings works for the different medium in which it is presented. I won't ruin it for readers by giving it away, but it's worth a read.The only criticism I have with the book is I'm not a huge fan of Malamud's writing style. I have read several of the reviews stating that's the best thing about the book, but I don't see it. I sometimes felt like the writing got in the way of the story, rather than moved it along."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Cynical and surrealistic, Bernard Malamud's commanding 1952 baseball novel &quot;The Natural&quot; presents the dark side of America's sunniest pastime.

Sweeping political changes were occurring as France, Italy and Britain released their Muslim charges to their own national independence in Libya, Egypt, the entire Middle East, Iran, India and Indonesia. The author wanted to awaken the public into realizing that Muslims represented one-seventh of the world's population, and although seemingly quiet, the author believed that they were going to have an important growing impact upon the Western world: both politically, in their awakening after a long political slumber, and economically, by their control of economically important oil fields. Alongside the many political changes from kingdoms to military-coup generals, there were also economic conflicts as governments switched from British mercantilist economies to socialist. The author wrote primarily about political and economic changes, and noted the change from the staid fundamentalist Muslim clerics being replaced by charismatic secular heads-of-state. Although the author noted the split between the Shiite and Sunni Muslims, he didn't undertake any detailed analysis in highlighting the religious differences between these two sects; nothing to be learned here. No quoting of the Koran; no analysis of the Quran was undertaken.

Turgenev provides enough material to keep the pages turning with interesting character studies, juxtapositioning of personalities, and old-school style Russian psychological analysis.

They've appeared in many places, including his own comic book and an edition of the Whole Earth Catalog. This nicely produced hardcover collects all two-dozen-odd FRANK adventures, with a few new pieces, an afterward by Woodring, and an introduction by (!) Francis Ford Coppola (!).FRANK is an odd little fellow: A generic funny animal, a bit like a cat, a bit like a bear, a bit like a chipmunk. He's usually mild mannered and curious, but is capable of great compassion and fits of violent temper.Frank's world is rich and strange: A wilderness dotted with exotic buildings and very odd creatures, such as the id-driven Manhog, the Jivas (spirit-creatures that look as though they were cut on a lathe), and the menacing, demon-like Whim. It's all very dream-like; sometimes nightmarish, sometimes charming, always intriguing.Frank's adventures are entirely pantomime, with written words confined to an occasional sign or letter (or ransom note...). They range from one page vignettes (\\"In the Mood\\") to epics like \\"Frank's High Horse\\" and \\"Frank's Real Pa.\\" Some (\\"Frank in the River\\") are interesting little adventures; some are humorous; a few are terribly disturbing (\\"The Palace of Horrors\\").Most of the strips are in wonderfully elaborate and evocative black-and-white. The color strips appear shockingly lurid in contrast.I adore FRANK and had no trouble paying for this volume despite owning two previous (and now redundant) collections. But I suspect his adventures may not appeal to everyone. The easily freaked-out may find them positively creepy. A few sample FRANK strips are available on Woodring's website (dub-dub-dub dot jimwoodring dot com); I suggest checking them out before leaping in."},{"Title":"The Frank Book","review":"After turning just a few pages of this book I was lost in the world of Frank. Frank's world has its own form of logic that seems startling at first. The character's define themselves through their actions since there are is no dialogue. Recurring, repetitive images and patterns abound. Jim Woodring's artwork here is truly amazing. The forward by Francis Ford Coppola is somewhat enlightening but gives the reader no idea what to really expect. This collection of comics is definitely not one for the kids; it is rather cruel and gruesome at times. There is also a very twisted sense of humor at work here. This book made me laugh, gasp, and wonder. All in all a brilliant collection of work with extras in the back such as cover artwork. Definitely a treat for the eyes as well as the soul. Bonus: This is also a much better deal than buying both the Frank #1 and Frank #2 books."},{"Title":"The Frank Book","review":"I was just recently pulled from the dregs of mainstream superhero comics in the last 2 years. It was a slow and painful operation, but eventaully my eyes were opened to how stupid they really are. So, of course, i got into indy comics, where the art is not only categorically better but the stories are...god, don't even get me started. We're not talking about me or indy comics in general here. We're talking about the remarkable Jim Woodring's FRANK. Woodring is a master artist who pulls tricks out of his hat that no one's ever even thought of before; his inventive use of pressure on his pen to create the effects of light and dark, not mention every texture imaginable, is absolutely astonishing. Every panel of every page looks so finished you'd think there was an assembly line working on this. Nope; it's just Woodring. If his original black and white pages weren't enough, his full-painted comics and covers convey a measure of patience and diligence unheard of even in most fine art. His expressive characters are all wonderful to look at, because nothing like any of them has ever been seen before. Now, Woodring's art could be praised so many times in so many different ways that Amazon would collapse, but his stories deserve just as much recognition. Every issue is breathtakingly creative, and the plots are completely oringinal. Somehow, despite the fact that they're all silent, a connection is made with the characters on a deep, intense level. Frank, curious and innocent (but not noble), Pupshaw, dependent and loyal, Whim, vindictive and conniving, and every other character within are perfectly fleshed out. Woodring is subtly and bombastically brilliant; you barely even notice that the book is silent or that you're reading about a cat-ferret-beaver. Thing. Frank is a generic anthropomorph, resembling a lot of things but being none of them. FRANK is as surreal as any Dali piece, and in some ways, on par with them in sheer originality and quality. the stories are bizzare, fluid, funny, disturbing, unsettling, lively and like nothing i've ever seen before. Collected in this handsome hardcover volume (which means no more scrabbling for individual issues), Frank is a dream-come-true in so many ways. The book the favorite of all the comics i own, because it cannot be called similar to anything else. Thank god for Jim Woodring; the comics world will be barren and lonely without him."},{"Title":"The Frank Book","review":"Harrowing, eerie, densely suggestive, handsomely rendered, bizarrely world-wise and funny as hell! These are symbolic fables, mostly mute, starring a vaguely cat-like cartoon critter, Frank, and his friends, neighbors, antagonists, nightmares, perhaps chief among them the loathsome yet pitiable, more-or-less anthropomorphic swine, Manhog. Placed in a lushly drawn worldscape that must have come out of the author's dream diary. Scalp-prickling stuff from Jim Woodring, a writer/artist who has clearly learned from underground comix masters R. Crumb and Justin Green, yet brings his own searching, sometimes scary, yet fundamentally affirmative and humane perspective to the mix. Plus dig those hynoptically wavy lines! (As a plus, these tales, though evasive in a way, are highly accessible to young and old - my own sons have read some of them with pleasure.)"},{"Title":"The Frank Book","review":"In a beautiful, comprehensive hardback edition, Jim Woodring collects 344 mind-bending pages of crystal clear color and black and white comic strips. The book itself is a beautiful object- lovingly designed by Woodring himself, it features a glossy color wraparound dustjacket, fanatastic new art on the endpages, a sewn in purple ribbon bookmark, and a short preface by Godfather director Francis Coppola.Woodring's &quot;Frank&quot; and &quot;Jim&quot; comics are surreal fables, with the theme of each fable springing directly from Woodring's unconscious. He admits he often doesn't know what he is writing about until after a story is completed, and he gives us few clues in his author's introduction.Frank, the main character, also leaves us with many questions. Is he a cat? Dog? Beaver? The peripheral characters are strange, often colorful beasts which seem to have tumbled from outer space, another dimension, an insane toy store, or perhaps simply an acid trip. These unheard-of creatures are also largely unheard; the comics are often wordless, adding to the bizarre sense of timelessness and obscure location. One advantage to this is international accessibilty, regardless of the reader's language.The wonderful thing about this book is it's completeness. Comics from The Seattle Stranger, Jim, Frank, Heavy Metal, Tantalizing Stories, World Art and more are included. Woodring also includes his seldom-seen trading card art toward the end, which gives some background and the names of the characters. This is useful to fans, who know and love the characters on sight but may not know the names, as they are never spoken. There are also panels which were removed from some original stories and have been restored, giving fans a chance to read these stories in their entirety for the first time.The artwork is incredible, the stories puzzling and thought-provoking, and the message is clear as pea soup. But you'll laugh, scratch your head and like these stories. There is some limited violence, so this might not make the best bedtime reading for very young ones.Highly recommended for fans of comix, bizarre art, and pulsing jivas. Woodring is a luminary on par with Robert Crumb, Dan Clowes and Robert Williams, and his work will be celebrated for years to come."},{"Title":"The Frank Book","review":"I read The Frank Book, and my eyeballs fell out."},{"Title":"The Frank Book","review":"First, let me point out that at 11.4 x 8.7 x 1.2 inches, and 344 pages, Jim Woodring's fabulously illustrated masterpiece, \\"Frank,\\" contains more than three-and-a-half pounds of peculiar, and at a relative pittance, ta' boot. Frank, the character for whom this book is named, is a apparently colorless, somewhat staid, Disney-esque critter of indefinable origin, whose sanity and composure seems enormously unhinged when set against the exquisitely bizarre landscape (itself a second key character of this book) and the wonderfully inexplicable behavior of the supporting cast. Not quite a cat, or mouse, or puppy dog, Frank is a charmingly generic anthropomorph, although not necessarily always charming in that super-sucrose, \\"your pal\\" manner that a Mickey or a Spongebob is or has to be. Mainly, Frank is intensely curious, even punishingly so.The \\"Frank\\" book contains 37 almost completely wordless stories, most of which are just 'acouple-few' pages in length, with the exception of the very long \\"FRANK'S REAL PA\\" (pages 59-107) which clocks in at 48 pages, and three other long-ish pieces; \\"FRANK IN THE RIVER\\" (pages 9-33,) \\"PUSHPAW\\" (pages 175-193,) and \\"GENTLEMANHOG\\" (pages 215-234) which consume twenty-four, eighteen, and nineteen pages, respectively. However, just because it is nearly wordless, do not expect this book to be a quick read. Because the panels are so beautifully illustrated and the storylines are so precise, expect to become deeply involved and engrossed within the pages. This book is a bona fide time-shifting machine, so don't be frightened if you decide to drink your morning cup of coffee while you \\"read just a few more pages\\" and lift your nose from the book to see that somehow, its become dark outside and everyone else has gone to bed. \\"Frank\\" is hauntingly beautiful. With landscapes that are vaguely reminiscent of a bad Peter Maxx acid trip in downtown Moscow, and characters that interact with Frank in ways that suggest they are aware of some magic principles or rules of the game that he is completely oblivious to, it is entirely too easy to spend way too much time immersed and engrossed. (Its okay, we forgive you. Now go turn on the oven, your dinner will need re-heating...)\\"Frank\\" has storylines, images, and characters that seem strangely familiar in an almost Jungian sense, and will remind many readers of....something...Repeated readings suggest very simple riddles or jokes, or maybe nursery rhymes, and it is amazing and odd how often certain scenes will pop into mind at the most opportune times. With characters such as the Manhog and Whim, these stories are certainly aimed at an adult audience, but most children should be able to safely read this book, provided they aren't already possessed of some sort of psychiatric trauma (although they may have questions when they are done.)I would absolutely recommend \\"Frank\\" to anyone who wants a book that is capable of stirring some sublime instinct within themselves, to anyone who hungers for remarkable illustration and potent, luminous storylines, and most of all, to anyone who needs a bit of strangely familiar mystery in their everyday life. Heck, I'd recommend this book to anyone who has an afternoon to spare and a few book-bound dollars in their pocket. Such a petty price to pay to pry a petite peek into the psyche of a genius. (For a larger peek, perhaps a PEEK.[...]"},{"Title":"The Frank Book","review":"Sitting in front of a computer screen, trying to think of a title that would truly encompass the spirit of Jim Woodring's insane little fables, only the word \\"Wow\\" came to mind. Wow. Regardless of whom you are, what walk of life you come from, even what language you speak, \\"Frank\\" will floor you, simple as that.On first glance these stories look like the drug-fueled dreams of a madman, simultaneously evoking a sense of awe and horror from the reader. The world of Frank, an anamorphic creature that looks like a combination of several different animals, is one that's utterly alien to our own yet oddly familiar. Frank himself is an enigma, at times innocently curious, while other times cruel and vengeful. The creatures, if you could call them that, which share this world with Frank are just as odd: from Frank's faithful companion Pupshaw to the vile and conniving Manhog.The stories that occur within this world are equally bizarre and seemingly nonsensical, yet underneath the surreal nature of these stories lurks meaning. I won't even attempt to analyze the themes of these tales, as I seriously doubt there is a single concrete message to any of the stories contained in this volume. Every person probably has different interpretations for Frank's world: biblical metaphor, morality tale, apocalyptic fable or just insane fun. You can look as deep as you want into these stories, or just read them for hallucinogenic kicks.I've never read, seen or imagined anything quite like the world of Frank, and I doubt I ever will. It manages to tap into a universal subconscious, screw around with it, and spit out a couple dozen of insane little stories for your reading pleasure. It's a staggering work of a demented genius and needs to be experienced by anyone who calls themselves a comic fan."},{"Title":"The Frank Book","review":"...or something like that. How else to describe beautiful art like this? It is an art that goes well beyond simply capturing our dreams and nightmares. Rather, it brings them back to us along with the whole pieces and scattered fragments that we'd forgotten we'd experienced. Absurd and thought-provoking, it brings joy to our hearts with one moment and shocking fear to our brains with the next. It is as grotesque and sublime as life, but at first glance it looks nothing like it. But once you immerse yourself into it, you will see it and you will enjoy it. I promise you will."},{"Title":"The Frank Book","review":"Simply a must have for any Frank fan, Jim Woodring produces a psychedelic journey, classic."},{"Title":"The Frank Book","review":"The world that Jim Woodring has created is unique and very different. His drawing is precise and clear so you have no difficulty understanding what shapes and forms you are looking at, but it isn't a place you've ever been to before. Fortunately, it's just barely familiar enough to be understandable and, also fortunately, it's also so different that it's totally fascinating.The book consists of a number of short stories or episodes collected from the Frank comic book series. There is no dialogue but Woodring is brilliant at telling a story with pictures. Some stories have an understandable plot and some don't. At least on the conscious level they don't. They often still feel like a story even though you would be hard-pressed to explain why.It's very satisfying to read/view the Frank stories, but you should probably be someone who enjoys David Lynch, surreal art, sci-fi, fantasy, and jazz."},{"Title":"The Frank Book","review":"Jim Woodring's 'Frank' comics put him in the cartoon visionary company of such luminaries as Crumb,Bode,Bosch,Alex Grey,and Rick Griffin. His colorful psychedelic landscapes give way to cautionary tales of human nature,and often as act as dialogue-less parables ranging from the very pithy to the very oblique. Frank, the blandly inquisitive catlike/rodent-like critter is often accompanied by the bizarre but fiercely loyal and protective 'Pupshaw&quot;, a creature looking like a cross between a raccoon and a birdhouse.Some adventures involve 'Manhog', the loathsome creature that embodies the worst traits of both species. And,mysteriously, floating through space and out of dying creatures mouths(!) are the Jivas, ornate spinning-top like entities representing the Tibetan Buddhist concept of souls inbetween incarnations.

The book's anti-semitism could easily be replaced by any other kind of racism and feel right at home in 2005. The story concerns a liberal Christian writer who takes on a magazine assignment to write about anti-semitism and his angle is to pose as a Jew so he can find out firsthand. It is a rude awakening for him, whether it is a hotel that does not cater to \\"those people\\" or a fiancee making off-hand anti-semitic remarks and thinking nothing of it. Some people might get thrown by writing that was done fifty years ago, but it is a book well worth reading."},{"Title":"Gentleman's Agreement","review":"GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT concerns the experiences of one Philip S. Green, an investigative reporter who decides to pretend he's Jewish to get to the heart of modern American anti-Semitism.Although written in 1946 and concerning the immediate post-World War Two era (the late months of 1945, the peak of New Deal liberalism, and the growing Conservative reactionaryism of the time), GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT still reads well, despite its occasional heavy-handed moralizing.Though some of the more grotesque evidences of open anti-Semitism have virtually disappeared from the American scene in the last sixty years (avowedly \\"restricted\\" clubs and the like), author Laura Z. Hobson's theme that there's an \\"us\\" and a \\"them\\" in America is unhappily still timely. Replace the word \\"Jewish\\" with any other, and GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT is just as illuminating now as it was in 1946.Hobson spends almost no time on her Jewish characters qua Jews. The Holocaust gets a fleeting one-sentence mention, though the mere fact that Hobson wrote GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT at all in 1946 places it squarely in the realm of \\"Holocaust Literature.\\" Hobson gives us no discourse with Judaism or Jewish culture as such, but for her purposes as an author none of that matters. The representative Jewish characters in these pages, Dave Goldman and Dr. Lieberman, are thoroughgoing Americans, totally assimilated and non-religious; yet, like Phil Green, the non-Jewish Jewish protagonist, they are battered and subjected to a bewildering array of overt and covert attacks, exclusions, and snide comments. They also demonstrate a sense of identity as Jewish individuals which Green first questions, then admires, and finally adopts.The shock of his friends and co-workers upon discovering that he is indeed a Christian is palpable. Many of them (including Phil's supposedly \\"liberal\\" fiancee, Kathy) are forced to confront their own preconceptions and prejudices.A fine book which needs to find its place in the American consciousness, GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"Gentleman's Agreement","review":"A superb social commentary of its time and a thoughtful examination of different shades of bigotry. Journalist Phil Green decides to take an undercover assignment on antisemitism by simply and quietly declaring that he is Jewish and then observing how it affects his relationships with others.The title is a reference to an unspoken gentleman's agreement not to sell homes, rent apartments or admit Jews to resorts or social clubs. However the elements of nonacceptance can be more subtle. Hobson makes the point that antisemitism can be selective as well - it's not just a violent Nazi/Cossack dislike. The word \\"gentile\\" derives from \\"gentility\\", and it is the polite mask here that exposed, the selective judgment of some Jews can be given a pass, but others not, or that social pressures cause some to hide their Jewishness or even the expectation that Jews qua Jews are required to be more moral than the rest of us.The form of the book is similar to that of a morality play in that each of the major characters act as a spokesperson for different aspects of the author's views. It is interesting to note that Ms. Hobson herself was, like the main character, a journalist - write what you know - though not a man. Her female characters come across very strongly, though there's a false note near the end when Ann, the \\"best bud\\" type reveals that she is having an affair with a married man, and this is used as a deus ex machina plot device. This too may have been extracted from real life as she had a child at the time who was born out of wedlock, as well as an being a single mother with another adopted child.Interesting too that the author voices the notion that acceptance of Jews would act as a test case for the further emancipation and integration of blacks in American society.Overall an enjoyable and thoughtful read, and though the language and social customs date it, the underlying message endures. The fictional experiment was laterupdated and enacted in real life.

In 1987 I tried to rent at a large building with a for-rent sign. Two men were standing outside. One of them told me, \\"The apartment has already been rented. We forgot to take the sign down.\\" Yeah, sure. I am old enough to remember when Arthur Godfrey (a popular TV personality) owned a hotel in Miami Beach that openly refused to cater to Jews. But upon reflection, Hobson's novel (and the movie) presented the problem from only one point of view. Just think about it. There are any number of Jews-only condos and closed communities. If a Jewish landlord in New York were to refuse to rent to Arab-Americans, then what? Don't Jews have \\"gentleman's agreements\\" of their own? Is discrimination OK if a Jew does it?

I would highly recommend this book to every woman - we could all use a little encouragement from time to time. I did especially enjoy the illustration of Mary and Martha. Too often we are overwhelmed by what must be done that we do not take care of the most important task at hand - just spending time with Jesus. Our to-do lists often take precedence over our quiet time with the Lord to the point that we begin to neglect it by treating this relationship as just another item on the to-do list.This books size and price make it an excellent gift or basket filler for ladies in your church.

As the father and daughter walk amongst their vines, you learn about pruning, watering, grafting, all important to the production of a bountiful harvest. Each chapter tells a part of the story and provides additional scriptural references to the concepts addressed.

The book is called Secrets of the Vine by Darlene Marie Wilkinson. Darlene uses the verses from John 15:1-2, 5, and 8 to illustrate God and Jesus relationship to us. In that verse Jesus talks to his disciples about being the Vine and they are the branches. The illustration used in the book was that those verses talk about three different people.The first person is Jesus, as the Vine. He is the main stem that grows out of the ground and supports the branches. What I found interesting is that the vine doesn't produce the fruit. The branches do, which is us. Then there is the Vinedresser, who lovingly takes care of each branch without fail or without leaving any behind. That Vinedresser is God.We, ladies, as Christians, are the branches. It is up to us to produce more and more fruit. That is the point of this book. God wants us to create fruit in abundance, and that in return blesses us in abundance. How do we create fruit? We are creating fruit every time we do something nice for someone else and God gets the glory for it.Darlene shares 3 secrets in this book, but I am not going to reveal them. You'll have to buy the book and read it to find out. But what I can reveal is that by reading this book, you will learn how to become closer to God, how to harvest more and more fruit and how much our Father in Heaven loves each and every one of us.By reading this book you will walk away knowing how to abide with God and know that He tenderly and lovingly wants the best for us.

She presents some very simple, yet profound, principles and examples of what it means for us to bear much fruit by abiding in the Vine. She shares how God has a plan for each of us and how He guides us to reach the abundance He wants for us through one or more of three stages: (1) intervening in our lives to discipline us so we will bear fruit; (2) intervening by pruning us so we will bear more fruit; and (3) inviting us to abide more deeply in Him so we will bear much fruit.This book is one that spoke to me from beginning to end and which I will likely come back to for reminders of Christ's invitation to abide and experience abundance.(I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah's Blogging for Books program for my honest review.)"},{"Title":"Secrets of the Vine for Women Study Guide: Breaking Through to Abundance (Breakthrough Series)","review":"I have not read this book yet, but I'm looking forward to reading it soon.

I usually take the salt and leave the preservatives, but I always wonder if it is better to keep the preservatives and let the salt go...Reading \\" Secrets of the Vine for Women\\"* (by Darlene Marie Wilkinson) was kind of like being in the market again and trying to decide whether to take the salt or the preservatives. I could tell that Ms. Wilkinson's heart was to glorify God and to encourage his people, and I fully admire that. I admire her courage with making herself so vulnerable. I admire her commitment to God's word and God's women in deciding to write this book especially for women, and there was so much that was good about the book, and so much that was not so good....So will I recommend this book - probably not.

All that God does in our lives is to lovingly help us to produce much fruit. God uses many methods to cause us to produce fruit from discipline and rebuke to removing obstacles to make room for more abundance. As we cooperate with God's plan and produce fruit, we abide even deeper with Him.One of the most helpful parts of the book for me was a list of tools to abiding.

The story illustrates how God is the vinedresser, Jesus is the vine, and we are the branches. By pruning our branches, God is disciplining us and helping us to grow as Christians.Darlene lists three secrets of the vine. The first secret is that if we as Christians do not bear any fruit then God will discipline us so that we will bear fruit. The second secret is that is we bear only a little fruit then God will prune us so that we will bear more fruit. And the third secret is that if our lives bear much fruit, God will bring us deeper into His presence and in that we will produce even more fruit.The author states that in spiritual pruning we must let go of what we think is pretty good so that God can give us His very best. The whole idea of pruning is that we lose something now to gain something later.At the end of the book is a study guide for each chapter that gives the reader a chance to further the study of spiritual pruning.\\"I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.\\""},{"Title":"Secrets of the Vine for Women Study Guide: Breaking Through to Abundance (Breakthrough Series)","review":"I'm not even sure where to begin on this book!

It would be a great resource for a women's study group.\\"I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review\\""},{"Title":"Secrets of the Vine for Women Study Guide: Breaking Through to Abundance (Breakthrough Series)","review":"Darlene Marie Wilkinson's book Secrets of the Vine for Women is based on Jesus' words in John 15. \\"I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser. Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit. By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit.\\" (John 15:1-2, 5, 8 NKJV)Each chapter begins with the continuing story of a young lady learning from her father as they walked together through his vineyards. The chapters then take the lesson learned in the vineyard and apply it to our spiritual lives. For instance, in one chapter, the father teaches the daughter how to tell which branch will yield the most grapes. It is the branch with the strongest connection to the vine. Similarly, our spiritual harvest is dependent on the strength of our connection with Jesus -- specifically, it's dependent on how much we abide in him.This book is a quick read, but still both uplifting and challenging. I highly recommend it -- either to read yourself or to give as a gift."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Vine for Women Study Guide: Breaking Through to Abundance (Breakthrough Series)","review":"note: I got this book for free from Blogging for books.What does it mean to bear fruit abundantly? Most people when they hear \\"bear fruit\\", it's to have more and more children to fill the earth. That's what some select groups say. But other people have no idea what it means to \\"bear fruit\\". In this book by: Darlene Marie Wilkinson, she explains the secrets of the vine for women. Her husband is Bruce Wilkinson and he was the one that wrote the prayer of jabez.

But what exactly was Jesus trying to explain by this example? If it is hard to understand, it will become more clear as you read the author's story of the vinedresser and his daughter, and how the vinedresser was able to make his vineyard prosper. Through her story, we learn about how God is our Vinedresser, Jesus the Vine itself and how God is disciplining, pruning and abiding in us as the branches.Another plus is the study guide in the back of the book for each chapter.

Using the illustration of a daughter visiting her father's vineyard, Wilkinson takes us on a six-chapter journey through the scripture. The author gives women a recipe for finding greater fruitfulness and service and impact for God in their lives. The book concludes with a study guide that invites the reader to go deeper in reflection on the impact the readings have on their lives.I personally found myself reading through this book twice. Though small, its message is very powerful and has the potential to be life-changing.

It is life-changing for any woman who desires a closer walk with Jesus Christ. With a study guide, charts and self evaluation, the three secrets of the vine from John 15 are revealed. Specifically written for women, this instructive book touches the core of a woman's spiritual life. You will learn how to live a life of abundance, how God intervenes when sin holds us back from abundant living, how God responds when our good intentions get in the way, how God longs for an intimate fellowship with us on a daily basis and how to live with confidence knowing God's will for your life.In John 15, the disciples in the upper room anticipated Christ's departure from them on earth with dismay. By using a familiar illustration of a vineyard, Jesus taught an important spiritual truth that becomes a life lesson for us today. We learn the spiritual disciplines that lead to abiding with God in peace and rest as we find ourselves \\" doing less for God and being more with God\\" which in turn produces much fruit in our lives.I enjoyed this little book immensely, read it through in one sitting. I would recommend that you use it as a daily study, work through the six chapters and study guide prayerfully and expectantly. God will be honored and you will experience abundant living when you see His perfect will at work in your life."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Vine for Women Study Guide: Breaking Through to Abundance (Breakthrough Series)","review":"'This book was a little dose of encouragement.

She explains that no other relationship could be as important, and none will ultimately be as fulfilling.I am ready to begin my friendship with God.

The book is visually pleasing in that each chapter has beautiful vineyard artwork with a Scripture. It touches emotionally by including a fictional vignette of a daughter and her father's grape harvest. In addition to the main purpose of the book, it encourages spiritual growth by including excerpts from Secrets of the Vine Bible Study, a \\"Three Seasons in God's Vineyard\\" chart that is built upon throughout the book, and a study guide with seven questions for each chapter. The book can be read straight through in a short span, be used as personal study or devotions, or be used for a group study. Scripture is abundant throughout.Just as Jesus used a vineyard analogy in John 15, Wilkinson continues that theme and explains some grape growing principles. Most meaningful to me was where she explained that a stronger rendering of a Greek word that means \\"cut off\\" would be \\"lifts up\\". According to a vineyard keeper, a branch that is trailing in the dirt is too valuable to cut off; instead it would be lifted, washed, and tied up in the sun so it would produce again. Although I know that sometimes God removes things in our lives, I thought this was a beautiful picture of Him tenderly retraining areas of our lives to grow again.Now that I have read this book through I am going to go back and examine it more closely and use the study guide in some times of reflection.

The writing is clear and comprehensive about the different stages of where our lives may be at in relation to what God is doing. However, if you have already done an inductive study of this chapter and found application points, it will be more of a review of those points.The author, Darlene Marie Wilkinson, starts off each chapter by writing a fictional story to try help us walk in a true daughter to a vinedresser. I believe this is helpful for women who read more fiction and have trouble getting into a non-fiction application book. I have not read the original \\"Secrets of the Vine,\\" but I would say there are anecdotes about other women's lives for female readers to relate to.

This is a short book-127 pp.-but to call it a \\"little\\" book would be totally inaccurate. This is a book full of power, a book that should be studied, savored, and read again. It would be a good book for a women's Bible study group to read.Repeatedly using the analogy of the vineyard and the vinedresser, who is teaching his daughter the secrets of an abundant harvest, the author's goal is to teach women the principles of what produces spiritual fruit. Using John 15 as its text, and reminding us of Jesus' intense love for his children, it teaches the difference between discipline and pruning by the Father. Often when we think we are being disciplined by painful experiences in life, we are being pruned to produce greater fruit. Our Lord wants us to produce fruit, and this book shares the secrets of making ourselves ready by understanding the process. A useful appendix in the back outlines the three seasons in the vineyard, the season of discipline, the season of pruning, and the season of abiding. Our goal is to get to that state of abiding in Him. There are study questions in the back of the book that help the reader to process the principles in each chapter.This is a book I am going to read again, this time highlighting and studying it in great depth.In accordance with FTC regulations, I am disclosing I was provided with this book by the Waterbrook Multnomah blogging for books program.

Isn't that so true of women !John 15 tells us the Jesus is the vine, God the vinedresser, and we as Christ followers are the branches.We are to bear fruit or do \`good work' as God has designed us to do. There are degrees of fruit bearing, or levels of good work.Level 1... no fruitLevel 2... fruitLevel 3... more fruitLevel 4... much fruitWe need to be pruned by God just as the grape vines are pruned to bear more fruit. Darlene Marie shares examples of life stories from women who were being pruned and how that developed more fruit.God invites us to abide in Him, as that is the only way to produce the much fruit. We abide in Him by spending time with Him, reading the Bible, prayer, and keeping a spiritual journal.The book follows beautifully with the example of the grape vines and harvest season, weaving the visual of the grape growing and the abundance of fruit.

It made the book even more pleasant. I have not read The Secrets of the Vine book and will not run out to read it now that I have read this one. I was happy that this book was short and sweet. It didn't delve into any topics as much as I would have liked for it to, but it was a short book.The book revolves around John 15. It explains better about our relationship with Jesus and God in regard to \\"the vine\\". I, honestly, had never really thought about the fruit I produce. Darlene Wilkinson touches on how we can simply, in our every day life, produce more fruit, which is glorifying and pleasing to God.She does offer a few examples as to how you can produce more fruit, while doing what you normally do. She says God wants us to start where we are with what we have. He placed us here in this year, in this house and in this season of life for a purpose.This book would probably be a great addition to The Secrets of the Vine, but it is also a great, short read for any woman who has not read the previous book.

But if we don't understand how God works in our lives to bring that wonderful harvest about, we can actually work against His good hand in our lives without ever knowing it. (from back cover)\\"I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser... I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit...\\" (John 15: 1, 5)Secrets of the Vine is the bestseller written by Bruce Wilkinson. This version, written by his wife, is aimed at a female audience. I had not read the former and presumed this would be a short little gift-type book that I would flip through in an hour. How wrong I was. I thought this would be a book I'd read, review and then pass onto my church's library. Again, I was wrong. There were so many points that stood out and demanded my attention that the pages are now covered in yellow highlighter.Mrs. Wilkinson has taken a chapter I've read and heard several times, and brings it alive. I live near Lake Erie wine country, and have seen plenty of vineyards. I've seen the vines but never thought of them representing Jesus, and I've never thought of myself as one of the many branches. But reading this book makes so much sense. God is the vinedresser who wants so much from us, but we have to be willing. If there is sin in our lives, we need to turn from it in order to begin producing fruit. If the fruit is good but not great, God may 'prune' parts of our lives. It might be hard, but it will be worth it.I'm also working through a Bible study based on Priscilla Shirer's take on Jonah. Why do I mention that? Because this week's study has gone over a very similar subject. First, we need to repent and turn from where we are, and then we need to follow what God wants from us in order to produce much fruit. This people, is no coincidence. This is God speaking, and I know I've been convicted.

With Jesus being the Greatest Vine if our attachment becomes \\"thick\\" with a full grasp on Him, just imagine the magnitude and quality of fruit we can bear.She thoroughly explores the 3 secrets of the vine by showing what no fruit, little fruit, much fruit and what fear and resistance to the Father will cost.

Of course, a relationship takes both entities and time, so this hinders God's desire for us to have spiritual abundance.This is the only book I have read by Darlene Marie Wilkinson, so I cannot compare it to her other books.

Very short. Not that short is bad, but this book only expounds John 15, the \\"I am the vine, you are the branches\\" analogy by Jesus. I would expect this content to be able to be delivered in a 45 minute sermon. I think this minimal content in a stand-alone book was disappointing. To give the author credit, she mentioned a few times how small this book was. I got the book free as a review copy, so it wasn't a huge deal for me. But if I would have paid the full cover price for this, I would have been upset.My other problem with this book is the title says \\"for Women\\", yet I'm not sure what about this book needed to be specifically for women. Instead of saying \\"parent\\", she said \\"mother\\". Her examples were almost exclusively from women, but through the whole book, I thought, \\"Doesn't this apply to everyone?\\" I felt like the \\"woman\\" part of the book was unnecessary.Though her discussion of producing fruit teeters on the line of \\"salvation by works\\", the rest of the book is theologically sound. It is just disappointingly shallow. A deeper exploration would have yielded a more substantial and more satisfying book. In fact, my initial impression was that the author jumped around topics too much, but the more I think about it, I feel like she keeps revisiting the same information over and over trying to get more and more out of it.

Using everyday examples of women attempting to fill a full and meaningful life for themselves while meeting the demands of life, Wilkinson emphasizes how being connected to Jesus the Vine is not something you squeeze into your schedule as time permits; but is instead what your entire day is anchored upon. Everything you do is layered atop your constant connection to Jesus.

I did love how Darlene Wilkinson uses John 15. She broke it down in such a way that it became clear the small things in my life mattered for Christ. In doing those things I thought wasn't important I actually bear fruit for Christ! He doesn't expect any more from me then what I am capable of in my everyday life. There were a few parts of the book that were confusing for me. I didn't completely understand her explanation of pain existing in punishment but not in pruning. So that was kind of clear for me.

By the 4th page of chapter one, she outlines what the reader can expect from her time with this book: \\"You'll discover how He intervenes when sin is holding you back. You'll understand how He responds when your own good intentions are leading you astray. You'll learn, perhaps for the first time, just how much He longs to enjoy intimate fellowship with you, and you'll have a clear idea of what you need to do to make that relationship happen. And finally, you'll know for certain that you can expect more lasting results from your life than you ever thought possible.\\"She makes good on this prediction by filling her book with illustrative women's stories as she defines productivity levels of spiritual fruit. These levels provide the organization for the remaining chapters of the book.One of my favorite points in the book is where she highlights the verse, \\"Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes away.\\" Her reflections on traditional vineyard care along with a modified translation of the Greek for the text add a full measure of grace to this verse, bringing peace to anyone who wonders if she might be a candidate for the cast-off status this verse seems to imply. \\"A stronger rendering for airo [Greek word for takes away in the verse] is 'lift up' or 'take up.' (Other NT passages support this reading of airo. The same word is used for example when the disciples took up 12 baskets of food...and for when Simon was forced to carry Christ's cross.) And according to a California vineyard keeper, 'lift up' is exactly what growers do to grape branches that are trailing in the dirt. The branch is too valuable to be cut off and throw away. Instead, the vinedresser carefully lifts the dirty branches, washes them off, and ties them up in the sun so they can begin production again.\\"Although rich and reassuring analogies run consistently throughout the book, not allof it is analogy-based. She also offers practical suggestions for abiding along with tools like charts for self-evaluation. Topical references for Bible study and thought-provoking discussion/study questions (What might happen if we mistake God's pruning for discipline?) might extend the time this book spends on your \\"current reading\\" pile but the encouragement factor here is well worth the extra time. How pleasant it is to go with her into delightful visualizations: \\"Imagine yourself standing in a cool, clear forest pool. Your arms are opened wide. Your face is up. Your eyes are closed. A pure, cool waterfall is splashing over you and around you...and you are drenched in peace. That's how it feels when you way yes to you Father the Vinedresser...\\"Blessings on your reading!(I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.)"},{"Title":"Secrets of the Vine for Women Study Guide: Breaking Through to Abundance (Breakthrough Series)","review":"How does one obtain an abundant life?

All while doing a beautiful job weaving in John 15 {the story of the vineyard.}Every chapter was full of beautiful scriptural references to every single concept addressed.

I was able to read it in two days, about 1 hour at a time. It is basically a shorter version of the author's husbands' book titled Secrets of the Vine. This book is specifically geared towards women and addresses such issues as the relationship women have with God, and also their past relationships. It has testimonials of women who have had rough lives and because they chose to \\"abide in the Lord\\" things have dramatically changed for them. This book personally spoke to me because at the time I read it I was seeking guidance from God on an issue. It is definitely a book that I would read more than once. The book concentrates on a scripture in the book of John and goes on to talk about what God wants us to do in order to receive His abundance in our lives. I wish it elaborated more on certain things such as the sins that prevent us from reaching the abundance that the Almighty wishes us to have. All in all, I would recommend this book to friends. It is a Christian read, and it is geared toward women but I think it will be inspiring to men also.

I have a deeper understanding of John 15 and other Bible scriptures mentioned than before. Also, this book will be excellent to use with daily scripture study as the author advises on page 87 in chapter 5.

Secrets of the Vine for Women introduced a woman's perspective on John 15. The author (and wife of Bruce Wilkinson) Darlene Marie explained why she wrote this book.Secrets of the Vine was more widely read by women than men. Bruce Wilkinson received many letters and comments from women about how the book changed the their lives that Darlene Marie decided to write this book to address many of the comments.The purpose of this book as in the original is to experience greater fruitfulness in your life. God disciplines those He loves - those who are His (Romans 10:9-11). Using John 15 and relating that Scripture to our lives is such a powerful key to open the door to abundance in our lives.A story of a daughter and her father was weaved throughout the book. The story was so helpful in not only understanding the complexity of running a vineyard but it was symbolic of the care and love our heavenly Father give to us.There were so many nuggets in this petite book. I quote (page 26), \\"Too many women I know think of singing in the choir or teaching a Sunday school class as the real good works, and the ordinary tasks of serving others throughout the day as somehow less significant. Even the disciples had that problem.\\" We then read the account in Mark 14:3-9 when Mary anointed Jesus with oil that the disciples thought should be used to sell and give to charity.Page 43, \\"Sadly, Christians you and I know are suffering every day unnecessarily because they have not heard or acted on the truth of God's discipline. They misinterpret unwanted circumstances and emotions as random events when they are actually God's efforts to set them free from sin and bring them back to fruitfulness.\\"Before reviewing this book, I doubted I would enjoy this book more than the first. I enjoyed this book just as much but in a different way. This book was quite personal. The author's warm and encouraging story telling was a true blessing. I did not want to put the book down as I felt as if I were sharing a cup of coffee with a friend or wise mentor. I felt as if I were in a retreat.

This week, the Gospel readings for Mass include sections from John 15 about how the Lord is the vinedresser, Christ is the vine, and we are the branches. I consider it a God-incident that I picked up Secrets of the Vine for Women which is about Divine Pruning and finished it during this week, not knowing until yesterday morning that the Scripture readings and the topic of this book overlapped.I readThe Prayer of Jabezby Bruce Wilkinson, Darlene Marie Wilkinson's husband, when back in college and have fond memories of it, since it's such an amazing book, was inspiring to me, and the first spiritual book my then boyfriend, now husband read upon my recommendation. Upon my spouse's suggestion, we began praying The Prayer of Jabez daily, over the phone when we were dating and miles apart, and now together as we say goodnight just after turning out our bedroom light.It's been a number of years since I read Bruce Wilkinson'sSecrets Of The Vine - Breaking Through To Abundance - The Breakthrough Series, Little Books, Big Change, which also resonated with me.

I can see this book being extremely helpful to Christian women who are just discovering the realm of their religion and who are looking to delve deeper into how to make their life more spiritually fulfilling. I cannot say there was anything remarkable in the writing for me but because spirituality is of such a personal nature, I would recommend this book for its quick read, basic easy to follow Christian concepts, and the potential to touch any woman's life regardless of her situation.

What is so great about the story of the vine dresser woven throughout the book, is the beautiful picture it gives you of the love and care God has for you. He wants you to abide in him, to be intimate, to bear fruit and live an abundant life in Him. Wilkinson helps us discover just how we can apply and prioritize our lives for Christ.

He writes morbidly but beautifully of love and death, fantastick images, and guilt among other things. In \\"The Black Cat\\" for instance he writes beautifully about a man's love for all creatures, and a page later this man is morbidly brutalizing a beloved cat, and in a bizarre turn of events,including a grotesque murder, the cat comes back and gets revenge in the end.The book is an unabridged compilation of Poe's most memorable short stories and poems. It includes such masterpieces as \\"Ligeia\\", a very beautiful story of a man's love for a woman, which also turns tradgic and gruesome,\\"The Tell Tale Heart\\", a man's guilt over a murder gets the best of him,'The Mask of Red Death\\", and \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\".Some of the wonderful poetry you will be treated to includes \\"The Raven\\",\\"Tamerlane\\", and \\"Annabel Lee\\", about the death of his young wife.

As a matter of fact, taken all together, despite the fact that each piece is written so that it will stand on its' own as a piece of art, the book does tell its' own story, each part leading to another until it comes to a very final conclusion...In an extraordinary book of poetry inspired by research, correspondence and first hand experience, the author will take you around the world to partake of a bitter feast of Human Rights violations.The primary theme that runs throughout the book is that of slavery in the modern world and it is divided into four sections.In The Beginning, he describes the genesis of the book and presents the first two pieces that he wrote for it. \\"Pedophiles\\" and \\"The Talent Agent\\".As The Idealist, he tells how he \\"Woke Up With Robert Frost\\" on the morning of \\"9/11\\" and relates to the terrible acts of terrorism that were soon to happen and would reshape all of our lives. He also tells the story of a special friend he made in faroff Kyrgyzstan and why he fears that she may have fallen victim to the slave trade.In Realities, he muses briefly on the differences between modern slavery and that of a hundred and fifty years ago, then goes on to \\"The Skeleton,\\" a truly remarkable poem in which he relates some of his personal experiences from his youth as hehitch hiked around the United States and relates them to his discovery of skeletal remains by a roadside on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington.Not only is this poem inspired by personal experience, but even the minute details are exactly as they actually were discovered by him, as are his experiences from travelling around the country.It's a comment to his ability as a poet and the quality of the poem itself, that when he read ten stanzas (there are actually sixteen) in direct competition with approximately a thousand other poets at the International Society of Poets convention in Orlando this past year, he was one of only ten to be awarded recording contracts.Realities goes on to address \\"Russian Brides (1&2)\\" (He has one!), slavery and human rights violations from around the world. The inspiration for his poem, \\"Young Girls\\", about the use of migrant women as sex slaves in the U.S. is from both a National Public Radio broadcast and from actual criminal activities that not only took place in South Florida where he lives, but there was actually one such ring broken up in the community bordering his own.Another NPR broadcast provided his inspiration for \\"Bosnia\\" and \\"United Nations\\"CNN's broadcast of \\"Behind the Veil\\" was direct inspiration for his poem, \\"Secret Police (To Serve and Protect)\\", about Afghan secret police taking over a private home along with the three young daughters of the man who they arrested. When their mother protested, they killed her outrightThe inspiration for \\"Iran\\" came directly from his own research on the internet where he found this story told about the fate of Mujahidin women who dared to struggle for their freedom from the tender mercies of the theocracy of Iran.The final (oh, so final!) section of the book is Betrayal, wherein the graphic stories of trusting women and the betrayal of their trust are told in \\"Betrayal\\", \\"The First Time\\". \\"Next!\\" and \\"Hungry Women\\".The life of a young sex slave/ prostitute is portrayed in \\"Rape for Hire\\" and \\"Cigarettes\\"\\"Going Home\\" is also from research and tells of the retrieval of a young prostitute from her life as a sexual slave, given hope and sent home. There's a twist to the story and the fates are not kind.Post Script... Since this book's recent release, I have not found it listed as a book of poetry anywhere. Rather, it has been listed under Social Science, Social Issues, Women's Studies and Criminology. Certainly a sign that it is being treated as a serious literary work!"},{"Title":"Beyond the Boys of Summer","review":"I have never read a book by Roger Kahn that was less than five stars. This volume is a collection of Kahn's work from books and magazine articles from his illustrious career. Roger covered the Brooklyn Dodgers during the seasons of 1952 and 1953 which led to The Boys of Summer. The book is divided into sections with chapters devoted to athletes, mainly baseball players, that have been subjects of Kahn's work over the past several decades. The last chapter is a tribute to former Dodgers' outfielder Carl Furillo, The Reading Rifle. It is absolutely first rate. Some of the other sections of the book are devoted to New York's centerfielders of the 1950's, hitters and pitchers, fighters such as Dempsey and Ali, in addition to Billy vs. Reggie, and George M. Steinbrenner. A very touching section is entitled \\"Heroes Off the Field\\" in which chapters are devoted to Jackie Robinson, Roberto Clemente, Ring Lardner, and Pee Wee Reese. Another memorable section is devoted to \\"On Getting Old\\" with chapters on Robert Frost, Stan Musial (old as a ballplayer), sportswriters, and the previously mentioned Carl Furillo. I did find one minor error in the Introduction written by Rob Miraldi when he said \\"he (Kahn) was sent to cover the crosstown Giants in the Bronx\\" after covering the Dodgers in 1952 and 1953. The Giants as Miraldi knows played in the Polo Grounds which was located on the island of Manhattan. If you have enjoyed Roger Kahn's previous books you won't want to miss this one, especially if you are a baseball fan. This isn't a book to be read by a speed reader. This is a book to be savored."},{"Title":"Beyond the Boys of Summer","review":"This is a moving collection of sportswriter Roger Kahn's writing over the last half century.

We also enjoy several looks at baseball stars from other teams (Mays, Maris, Aaron, Rose), and, of course, a moving tribute to the author's baseball-fan father. The book is mostly about baseball, but there are essays on other sports, Jewish culture, and 1960's campus rebellion. Aficionados may have read many of these essays before - but all are worth reading again. I just wish there was more here - Kahn is such a readable and moving wordsmith."},{"Title":"Beyond the Boys of Summer","review":"To the reviewer below who commented that this book is a retread and not the book he thought he was buying, I refer that reviewer to the subtitle of the book: The Very Best of Roger Kahn. This subtitle makes is very clear that this book is an anthology and not a new work. If, somehow, that doesn't make it entirely clear, a cursory scan of the book jacket's flaps and back cover would do so. It's an anthology, buddy. No need to disparage a great book because you didn't pay enough attention to look at what you were buying.Furthermore, it's an excellent anthology. Many of the selections included haven't seen print in 40+ years. There are pieces here from magazines and newspapers that no longer exist, so even though every piece in the anthology (other than the prologue and introduction) have been previously published, many of them have never been seen by readers under 60.

This book is a collection of his essays, mostly on baseball and its players, but fifty years of writing is a lot of writing. Here are his writing on many, many other people, other activities. Still, this is Roger Kahn, even the baseball stories make you remember that baseball players are still people.The short (5 page) Chapter 17 is on Joe DiMaggio's marriage to Marilyn Monroe. It brings a great sadness. This kind of reaching for the emotions is a thing that Roger Kahn does better than just about anyone else. He is able to look beyond the superstar personna to the peson underneath and then to bring this person to life using just the printed word.The really good thing about books like this is that they mean that the words printed in a newspaper that will be thrown away the next day remain available.

Not only has the handsome gambler just found out that he has a daughter he's never met, but in order to get custody he has six months to become a proper father and marry. And while Nick is head-over-heels in love with his best friend Alewine Jones, the stubborn lady freighter didn't take kindly to the notion of a wedding. The solution: a poker game where the prize will be a full house.Nick was Aly's closest companion, her best fishing partner, and he can make her insides go mushy with one lingering glance. That still doesn't mean she will up and marry him. But that mushy feeling comes back every time she looks into Nicks eyes. Suddenly Aly realizes that Nick has won more than her hand, he'd won her heart.* I certainly don't see how this book has received 5 star ratings. I was quite bored for most of the book. There wasn't much passion, adventure or mystery. Everything was pretty much laid right out there for you with nothing left for you to look forward to. I thought the writing was a little odd in this book. Sure I understated that Aly wasn't that educated & that she spoke improperly but when even when people weren't speaking the author would use words making me think she wasn't that bright herself. One example was she used the word \\"eatened\\" that's not even a real word. The word \\"ate\\" would've fit but \\"eatened\\"??? That was just one example of many. I didn't care for the characters & I really didn't care what happened. Unfortunately I can't recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Gentle Season","review":"Nicodemus Turner needs a favor. Finding out he's a father and only has six months to marry and prove himself fit to undertake guardianship of the six-year-old daughter puts him in a quandary. The only one he would ever consider is the woman he is in love with - - Alewine Jones, his best friend. The problem is Aly is stubborn, her pride almost bigger than her mouth, and she has no interest in marrying him. The only way she would accept his proposal would be if she were obligated by honor. So Nick arranges a poker game with the intention of gaining a wife as the prize.Aly always kept a promise. So when Nick named his price after the suspicious poker game, Aly reluctantly agreed. Very reluctantly. The outspoken lady freighter had quite a few words to say about it. Used to doing things the way she wanted and when she wanted, she had no interest in being hog-tied, even to her best fishing partner. Besides, when she was around him she turned mushy inside, and when he turned his attentions on her full-force she knew her heart was in danger. How could he really want her, when she had no notion of how to be a proper female?Can Nick convince Aly he needs her forever? Will Aly learn to trust her woman's heart?Move over Calamity Jane! Ms. Hunter captures a reader's attention with a tight plot and original characters. Nick's utterly charming manner and Aly's underlying vulnerability cause the reader to really root for the relationship. The subplot of the relationship between Nick's daughter and her mother is wonderfully complex."},{"Title":"The Gentle Season","review":"The Gentle Season by Dia Hunter is a fun-filled romp of a romance. The heroine, Alewine Jones, is a cross between Calamity Jane and Ma Kettle. The six-year-old child, Jezlynn, proves to be an even bigger stinker than the surprise one at the critter wash. While the child keeps gambler Nick Turner on his toes, Aly does her best to keep the to-die-for hero on his back! This historical romance is a keeper for readers who enjoy love and laughter."},{"Title":"Celestial Lancets: A History and Rationale of Acupuncture and Moxa (Needham Research Institute Series)","review":"After finding out that what is taught in the West as \`Traditional Chinese Medicine' was basically created by a Chinese Communist government committee from some but not all of the various ancient texts and practices that are available, I wanted to reconstruct Traditional Chinese Medicine (particularly acupuncture) as it actually existed prior to the Communist revolution. I came across Celestial Lancets in the process. Make no mistake, it is a tome, complete with more footnotes and references than most of us can read in several lifetimes.\\"Celestial Lancets\\" is written by one of the top academic researchers on China, Joseph Needham, in collaboration with his Chinese wife. It is part of his encyclopedic \\"Science and Civilization in China\\" series. It is written by a serious academic, for other serious academics or practitioners of acupuncture and moxa who want to explore as deeply as possible the history and understanding of these two ancient practices of Traditional Chinese Medicine. There are no less than three bibliographies broken down by language and dates.Needham is neither a starry-eyed believer in TCM, nor is he a scientific disbeliever. He simply explores the history to a very great, detailed depth, and then does the same for some of the western science that has been done (this chapter alone being almost 75 pages), letting the evidence show for itself. It should be said that the goal of the book seems to be history and explanation of acupuncture and moxa, not an attempt to PROVE the system to the most skeptic of Westerners.I like reading academic works, though I don't have even an associates degree, and I still found this book tough going, except for the last chapter on \`The Lore of Vital Spots'. This chapter will be of particular interest to serious martial artists (which is how I began my own exploration of things Asian, particularly philosophy). Unless you are serious enough about Traditional Chinese Medicine that you have begun learning the Chinese language, you might want to skip buying this book, and try checking it out from a library first.It is a very good book for it's purpose, probably ground-breaking in many of it's insights. It is not for beginners like me who are just trying to get an accurate, broad overview with less historical detail. Or just use it as a reference book, rather than reading it cover to cover. Western skeptics of TCM should begin by reading the conclusion on the last two pages, a good idea also for the mildly curious.The writing style is not challenging, just the pace of the writing for the nonacademic. A better introduction for the layman (again, not the purpose of \\"Celestial Lancets\\") would probably be \\"Web That Has No Weaver: Understanding Chinese Medicine\\" by Ted Kaptchuk, the second edition."},{"Title":"Celestial Lancets: A History and Rationale of Acupuncture and Moxa (Needham Research Institute Series)","review":"The book was originally published in 1980, thirty years ago, nowadays this reprint is enriched by two writings : a short preface by Prof. Christopher Cullen and an introduction by Dr. Vivienne Lo.At the time of the first printing Needham was 80 years old, and as happens in the case of books which have been compiled by great masters, this work is still today very valuable and has not been superseded by some other work.It is not a book to be read in a week or in a month, it is a sound reference work that anyone who is interested in the study of Traditional Chinese Medicine and/or its history should have on its desk or on its nearest bookshelf.This work is really precious, it fills an important gap in the Western literature, I believe that those who wish to approach these matters in a scientific way should read or refer to it frequently.Sometimes, the reader will understand its usefulness within few minutes, in other cases he / she will be aware of it only after many years...."},{"Title":"To Jerusalem and Back: A Personal Account","review":"Item received after a pretty long wait, toward the end of the estimated waiting period, but the book was in mint condition."},{"Title":"To Jerusalem and Back: A Personal Account","review":"...the more they remain the same.

This is a novel about fear of rejection. It is the theme. Dawn's presenting problem is her love for her first psychiatrist, a man. Now she is seeing a female analyst. August is, of course, the month for analysts to have vacations. Patients suffer, we know, (Woody Allen).One wonders, has Judith Rossner settled on 'hot' topics-- date rapes, Siamese twins, psychoanalysis-- in her writing? What is it about these somewhat outsider themes that is of interest to the author? Do actual cases do the work of devising a plot and a setting?The new analyst agrees not to terminate therapy with Dawn. The patient is to make that decision. Time passes and in college now, the patient, Dawn Henley, informs her analyst, Dr. Shinefeld, that she is a nervous wreck. The author conveys perfectly the patient's neediness.The therapist, Lulu Shinefeld, had a middle class childhood, growing up on West End Avenue. Dawn becomes for Lulu a sort of analytic daughter. Lulu feels that Dawn could embody the happiness fantasy.Concepts of dependency and connections are illustrated by Dawn and her natural and adoptive parents and Lulu with her husbands, children, parents, and friends. Psychoanalysis is a promising arena for the playing out of complications and misunderstandings. In analysis motives are under scrutiny. The parallel paths of the patient and her analyst scaffold this well-paced and interesting novel."},{"Title":"August","review":"I just finished reading August as I finished my training as a clinical social worker.

If you're psychologically-minded, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"August","review":"One of the only pieces of fiction about psychotherapy that conveys something of how it actually works in reality. Sure, it's a bit idealized, but it doesn't fall into the trap of cliche. Literature and films about psychologists or psychiatrists usually fall into one of two overworked tropes: the therapist turns out to be crazy, or the therapist ends up seducing the patient &#8212; and even when these are avoided, the whole notion of patient-therapist boundary is ignored. Rossner's interweaving of the back story of the therapist with the story of the therapy is nicely done, with both characters shown to be human and fallible, and the therapist for once is actually competent and insightful. As a psychiatrist myself, I find it refreshing to read something about my field that is not just soap opera clearly written by someone who has no idea of the subject. It's very rare. Rossner nailed it better than anyone else I can think of."},{"Title":"August","review":"A snapshot of analysis in high resolution.

There are great little bullet points with advice on almost every page, and every subject. I'm a dedicated mother and I found nothing to argue with.

Some of the advice he gives is not even advised nowadays.First off, he starts his book by saying that mothers have depended too much on baby care books and not enough on their intution, and that whatever the parent feels is right for them and their baby, they should go ahead and do,but then the author goes on to tell parents and mothers how to raise their kids!He gives so much outdated information that it's ridiculous.He advises breast-feeding mothers to only nurse 20 minutes at a time, 5 minutes per side and then says that if you nurse more than this, your baby is only using you as a pacifier and you shouldn't allow it! He goes on to say that formula feeding is fine if you just don't feel like it and that ANY formula will do and even gives a recipe for making your own! Pediatricians nowadays advise against this and say that it is dangerous to do.Then he advises using a pacifier &quot;So the parents can have hours of peace and quiet&quot;! That is not a good enough reason.If all you use it for is to get peace and quiet, why have a baby? Then he advises giving rice cereal to 3 week old baby's to help them sleep through the night, which many doctors tell you does NOT work and is also not safe because infants can't swallow solids very well, but he advises waiting to start solids at 6 months, BIG contridiction! Lastly, he says that you should put your baby to sleep on his side and not his back because he might choke to death on vomit! Again, they advise now to put them on their backs and not their sides and say there is no evidence that they will choke.Well I agree that he is up to date on SOME information, like the chicken pox vaccine, he is way off on most of the other information.I advise new mothers to skip this book.There are many other books that are more up to date then this and even better suggest that you trust your instincts!.

The overall theme, that voluntary migration - including for purposes of prostitution - is inextricably linked to, and sometimes indistinguishable from, traffic in persons, is powerfully presented with case studies gleaned from field research conducted in Thailand. Rural Thai women are engaged in sex work in Bangkok, Singapore, Japan, and Germany. The difficulty in addressing this phenomenon is that some are trafficked against their will and suffer from the most appalling conditions of fear, abuse, and inhumanity, while others voluntarily enlist as prostitutes, driven by a combination of poverty and lack of opportunity at home and greed fueled by misinformation for what lies before them. The book is wholly successful with this thesis.But the problems are two-fold. First, there simply is not enough depth to warrant even 116 pages. While the material is divided thematically, many stories are repetitive and do not add to the reader's understanding. The second, and more serious, problem is the authors' political agenda. While not oppressive, the anti-western theology is certainly intrusive. There is the use of 1970s-era jargon, referring to developed nations as \\"North\\" and the rest as \\"South\\", and predicating these labels with the assumption that South is good and North bad. There is the subtext that traffic in persons is essentially an economic problem - a migration issue - caused by unfair \\"Northern\\" economic exploitation and by discriminatory immigration laws that prevent citizens of the \\"South\\" from travelling at will to developed countries to seek their fortune. There is the imperfect understanding of economics compounded by a sort of pseudo-socialist template that yields incorrect statements like: \\"The need to import foreign labour into industrialized economies has now vanished\\" (p21); or callow outrage: \\"In an era of allegedly free markets, to permit goods, capital and rich people to move freely around the world, while preventing labour from doing so, appears both hypocritical and unjust\\" (p22). Japan is criticized because its standard of living serves as a \\"magnet\\" to those who live in poor countries. As though Japan is at fault, and the girls, even the willing prostitutes, are sad victims of Japanese success. This book is not the best forum to discuss uneven economic development, and the authors should have left it alone. Instead, there are odd statements like, \\"migrants represent the commitment of the nation to participate in the international economy\\" (p23), which suggests illegal migration and prostitution are positive economic policies of source countries, rather than the recognition that illegal migration represents a failure by these countries to provide for the needs of all their citizens.Some phrases are ill-chosen, \\"Trafficking in women not only breaches the criminal and many other laws,...\\" (p66). Others are simply bizarre, such as the discussion of wives living abroad as prostitutes. The authors aver that when husbands of the prostitutes date other women and waste the proceeds of their wives' labors, that \\"such behavior contributes to the high divorce rate\\" (p75). It is just odd to blame the husband of a prostitute for the marriage's failure.Overall, the book is a success. Its thesis is powerful, but the language is sometimes disingenuous. It is a useful starting point to understanding the trafficking phenomenon"},{"Title":"The Traffic in Women: Human Realities of the International Sex Trade","review":"The book was fine, I cannot seem to resell it though, the content was great for class, I learned something."},{"Title":"Mojo's Concert at Inverness","review":"This piano music is positively psychedlic.

He was lampooning the social radicals of America in the early 1960s. Maybe his warning came too late for Germany which had it's own folk song army to deal with.Recently deceased Peter Viereck is something of an interesting character. His father, George Sylvester Viereck, possibly the Kaiser's illegitimate grandson, argued the pro-German case in America during Woodrow Wilson's run up to war. By all accounts his Great War oppositionism was both principled and loyal to America. After Versailles however GSV became more radical in his pro-Germanism and was eventually imprisoned as a German agent during World War Two. He also broke with his two sons around this time, both of whom served in the US Army with one dying in the Anzio landings, and the other, Peter, working for the Army Psychological Warfare Division.Peter Viereck sees Germany as uniquely torn between two souls, in short, a western looking, european and Christian civilisation soul and a northern looking Volkish Kultur soul. Goethe versus Wagner. Considering his family history perhaps the conflict struck home.Peter Viereck wrote \\"Metapolitics\\" whilst a Harvard undergraduate. Not bad work for a twenty four year old! He went on to an academic career and earned the 1949 Pullitzer Prize for poetry. A life long political conservative he was an ardent critic of McCarthyism in the 1950s.The term 'metapolitics' is derived from Wagner, similar to 'geopolitics', it refers to the German nationalists' metaphysical vision as it approached cultural and spiritual issues, where 'geopolitics' looked at the intersection of geography and politics. The book was one of the first in English to explore the Wagnerian roots of Nazism. Wagner was not only a great composer but something of a radical political pamphleteer. Despite having jewish promoters and agents Wagner blamed a jewish conspiracy for is works not being as popular as he imagined. Viereck explores not only the cultural roots of nazism but the appeal of nazism to what he calls Germany's \\"Greenwich Village Warriors\\", alienated bohemians in exile in their own hometown. And then there is the unusual number of 'failed' artists drawn to the nazi movement.Viereck's analysis starts with Ludwig Jahn, who Viereck recognises as a pioneer German \\"Volkish\\" nationalist, a forerunner of nazism but perhaps one who would be appalled by the later developments of his thought. It proceeds via Wagner, the Wagnerians and moves on to Hitler's \\"official philosopher\\" Rosenberg.He speculates Wagner may also be appalled at how his ideas were used but in Wagner's case, he was truly a proto-nazi, there is a stronger chain of responsibility than in Jahn's case, despite some minor retreat from full bore Volkism towards the end of his career. In any case , the first generation of 'Wagnerites', including family members (for example, the in-law Houston Stewart Chamberlain) were not just proto-nazis but the real thing, indeed taking Hitler into their circle as \\"Uncle Wolf\\" to the children.Viereck explores the development of Volkish German romanticism, and he doesn't condemn all threads of romanticism, in laying a popular and intellectual foundation for the later growth of nazism. He also explores the role if Rosenberg and the \\"Realpolitlik\\" pioneers, Fichte, Hegel and Treitschke in the development of nazi ideas. Viereck notes the attempts by the Nazis to appropriate Nietzche, something some of the philosopher's family promoted, but highlights Nietzche's prescient warnings against the rise of antisemitic German nationalism.Viereck's analysis helps get us beyond the simplistic and misleading Verailles / inflation / depression analyses of the origins of nazism. Much of Rosenberg's \\"Myth of the Twentieth Cenury\\" was written before Versailles and the worst of the Great Depression did not hit Germany until after the Nazis had already emerged as Germany's biggest political party. Viereck provides some unfortunately brief debunking of economic determinist explanations of Nazism, focusing mainly on the how Hitler double crossed and ultimately expropriated his former sponsor, the industrialist Thysen. To his credit he does recognise that the allies were not guiltless in feeding the bear, besides the well known condemnations of Chamberlainian appeasement, there was the British Hunger blockade in World War 1 and the French occupation of the Rhineland, all of which undermined the liberal west's claim to moral leadership, at least in the eyes of the German public, when dealing with Hitler.Viereck devotes about a chapter or so to another idea that needs more exposure. He says we tend to overestimate the otherwise rootless Weimar Republic. It's very foundation may have been something of a strategem by Germany's military leaders to avoid popular responsibility for defeat, obtain a softer peace and pave the way for a militarist renewal down the track. Certainly the artifice of circumventing Versailles armament restrictions was well practiced before Hitler assumed power. And his assumption of power was aided by old school militarists who retained pivotal positions in the army and bureaucracy throughout the Weimar period where they behaved like a government-in-exile at home.Still the core of Viereck's book is in analysing the 'spiritual' dimension of nazism. This can be easily forgotten, for example, nazi racism, although it did attract a corps of racial scientists, their role, however repulsive, was more opportunist and parasitic to the whole enterprise. Nazi racialism, as expounded by Rosenberg was not even a corrupted version of darwinism, it was essentially a romantic attachment to 'blood'.Readers should check the various editions of Metapolitics available. I have the 1941 edition which comes with excellent appendices that include correspondence with Wagner scholar Thomas Mann as well as some reviews from the period. I understand the later editions include more supplementary material. Also readers should hunt online for Peter Viereck's 2004 essay entitled \\"Metapolitcs Revisited\\" which provides some additional insights and further developments that I am sure readers of the original volume would appreciate."},{"Title":"Metapolitics: From Wagner and the German Romantics to Hitler","review":"This book has a sweeping scope that can initially seem impressive. Until you fact-check Viereck's claims, especially his citations. This was no genuine exploration of the origins of Nazi ideas, \\"the roots of the Nazi mind\\". This was a polemicist with an extremely conservative cultural, religious and political agenda, smearing with a proto-Nazi tag those aesthetic and cultural movements that he happens to dislike.Viereck's main target was the romantic movement of the 19th century, especially but not only Richard Wagner. Although Viereck wrote in the manner of a moralist condemning the romantics from on high, his agenda led him into certain failings of his own. His portrayal of \\"Father Jahn\\" and other figures bear false witness, and he commits academic sins like altering texts, inventing fictitious works, misleading quotation, and the like.Basically Viereck's story was that the National Socialist flame was lit by Friedrich Jahn, who supposedly influenced the early German romantics, Fichte, Herder and so on, who then passed the torch to Wagner, who synthesised their evil ideas into a fully-fledged Nazi philosophy with all pieces complete, from F&uuml;hrer-principle to Holocaust, which Hitler then picked up and applied.This is nonsense. First, the historical Friedrich Jahn was neither a proto-Nazi nor an especially important figure. Viereck truthfully called Jahn a German nationalist, which sounds sinister because of 20th century history, but glossed over the fact that Jahn's nationalism came at a time when the German states were occupied, ruled and plundered by foreign armies under Napoleon. To be a nationalist under those circumstances was to resist tyranny, not promote it.Viereck elides the fact that Jahn was an outspoken democrat who insisted that French rule should be replaced by a democratic, independent and unified Germany. I feel no defensiveness towards Jahn; though no proto-Nazi he was an antisemite with insufficient other merits to balance that fact. But misrepresentation is irritating.Viereck greatly exaggerates Jahn's importance. Jahn founded his Turnverein (gymnastics organisation) movement in 1811 and lost control of it with his imprisonment in 1819, and though he remained generally respected until his death in 1852, he exercised precious little influence. I've looked for references to Jahn in the work of the German romantics, and found only a satirical _attack_ on Jahn in an 1823 play by the romantic playwright Joseph von Eichendorff.Viereck's portrait of the early German romantics defames admirable people, brotherhood-of-man democrats and liberals like Herder. Fichte is less admirable, but is also utterly misrepresented. Even those German Romantics who did lose their liberalism in old age didn't turn to any form of radical rightwingery that could be called proto-Nazi. They reverted to conservative Catholicism and monarchism.Viereck's attack on Wagner illustrates his method. For example Viereck's first, 1941, edition of this book was the first text to frame Wagner by quoting the concluding words of \\"Judaism in Music\\" while - without alerting the reader - omitting Wagner's key words, \\"for then we shall be one and indivisible\\", in order to hide the fact that Wagner was calling for assimilation. This deception has been much imitated since.(Viereck also brings in additional words from another Wagner essay. Several of Viereck's supposed Wagner quotes are actually mosaics assembled by Viereck from fragments of Wagner text. Wagner was undoubtedly a disgusting antisemite; Viereck's damning quotes from Cosima's _Diaries_ are real enough. Though selective; he does not cite passages where Wagner defends Jews from antisemitic attacks, or says he would no longer write against the Jews. And Wagner called for assimilation, unlike some of his contemporaries who really were proto-Nazis.)Viereck claimed that Wagner's call for the founding of a people's army, in his \\"The Revolution\\" essay, was \\"a dream akin to what R&ouml;hm in 1934 envisaged for his Storm Troopers.\\" But Wagner's text called for the army to be under the control of a democratically elected government. Did Viereck really not know the difference between Storm Troopers in a Nazi state, and an army accountable to an elected government?Viereck also claimed that Wagner invented the F&uuml;hrer-principle. You'll find no such idea in Wagner, since Wagner was a young anarchist who eventually drifted as far right as supporting constitutional monarchy. So Viereck claimed that when Wagner used \\"a number of other terms, especially 'hero', 'folk-king' and 'Barbarossa'\\", he really meant \\"F&uuml;hrer\\". Viereck pioneered the technique of claiming that if Wagner's words don't support your conspiracy theory, then the words must be in a secret code. Thus anything can be said to mean any old thing, making \\"proving\\" a case much easier.Viereck also invented a Wagner essay called \\"Heroism\\", which apparently called for racial purity under a dictatorship. There is no such Wagner essay, nor any Wagner essay that ever called for either racial purity or dictatorship. Wagner's clearest late statement on political systems, \\"State and Religion\\", advocated constitutional monarchy, the monarch exercising a symbolic function above politics, while political parties of \\"men of equal rights\\" contended for office.Wagner did write, in an essay called \\"Heroism and Christianity\\", that there was no such thing as a German race and that Europeans should get used to racial intermingling, explicitly advocating racial equality \\"under a universal moral concord, such as only Christianity can bring about.\\"Is \\"Heroism and Christianity\\" related to Viereck's fictitious \\"Heroism\\" essay? Hard to say. Still, Viereck, who writes from a rightwing Christian worldview, needed to insist that the late Wagner was anti-Christian, though the essays and _Diaries_ show this is quite untrue. This can have comic results, as when Viereck used an anti-Christian remark by the young Wagner to prove that _Parsifal_, written decades later, must be anti-Christian. It may be that Viereck, with his own agenda, was embarrassed by the words \\"and Christianity\\" from Wagner's \\"Heroism and Christianity\\" title, so he \\"disappeared\\" them, along with the actual content of that essay.Summary: This book has been tremendously influential, especially in its earlier editions. But it is a sustained piece of academic misrepresentation, and its influence has been pernicious and regrettable.Laon"},{"Title":"Metapolitics: From Wagner and the German Romantics to Hitler","review":"_Metapolitics: From Wagner and the German Romantics to Hitler by Peter Viereck was one of the earliest books written during the World War to show the influence of Wagner on the thinking of Hitler. Previously it had been believed that Nietzsche's amoralistic thinking had played a larger role in the development of Hitler's Third Reich. However, as Viereck shows in this book, it was indeed Wagner who was the antisemite (and one of the most virulent antisemites even prior to the coming of Hitler).This edition put out by Transaction publishers of _Metapolitics_ is expanded not only to cover the influence of German Romanticism on Hitler (which preceded Wagner himself), but also to include a new introduction and several appendices on Albert Speer (Hitler's architect of the Third Reich), Count Claus von Stauffenberg (the aristocrat who tried to assassinate Hitler), the poet George Heym, and the poet Stefan George and his circle.In the letters of Richard Wagner is included a letter from an admirer and ardent nationalist which states: \\"To be genuinely German, politics must soar to metapolitics. The latter is to commonplace pedestrian politics as metaphysics is to physics.\\" Metapolitics as defined by Viereck is the type of political thought serving as inspiration for Hitler and his Third Reich regime.The book begins with a discussion of German Romanticism and its influence on Hitler. For Viereck, the Third Reich may be perceived in some sense as German Romanticism writ large. The book also discusses the influence of \\"Father\\" Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, a German nationalist in the 1800's, on the storm troopers and on Volkish nationalism in general. The book next moves on to discussing the case of Wagner. Many of Wagner's operatic pieces can be seen as allegories for different components of his metapolitical thinking. For example, it has been suggested that certain characters (the dwarves and the dragon) represent capitalists or Jews within his operas. The book subsequently discusses Houston Stewart Chamberlain whose racialist tracts served as inspiration for Hitler. Also, the book includes several chapters on Alfred Rosenberg, the official Nazi philosopher. Rosenberg was also influenced by German Romanticism and his understanding of history proved particularly virulent. Viereck opposed Christian morality to Rosenberg's neo-paganism.In sum, this book presents an interesting discussion of some of the precursors of the Third Reich. Both German Romanticism and Richard Wagner played a large part in the development of the thinking of Hitler, and also in many of his primary proponents and Nazi fellow travelers."},{"Title":"Metapolitics: From Wagner and the German Romantics to Hitler","review":"This transaction reprint from 1941 is a classic chestnut and still reads well as one of the first analyses of the sources of fascist ideology. The case against the Romantics, and such as Fichte, is always important, although it is open to challenge. We can find the earlier sources, but no simple causal sequence--and yet...As Nietzsche well knew Wagner's spiritual odyssey was a strange one and we see the attempt at high tragedy itself turning into a tragedy, irony indeed.One of those books... Significant and lively reading with a 'genealogy' on the mark."},{"Title":"Metapolitics: From Wagner and the German Romantics to Hitler","review":"This new edition of Peter Viereck's classic is very gratifying in that it has stood the test of time.

If his only motivation is to let the publisher use his name for the money, I hope he's getting very little. This book is, in a word, terrible.Speculative, science, and techno-thriller fiction are some of my favorite books; this book isn't convincing on any front. Sure, language has changed with the advent of the Web, but the egregious overuse of made-up jargon, describing concepts that are probably not close-in enough to spawn the casual, nickname-ish use prevalent in this book's narrative.Gratuitous jargon, gratuitous sex, and labored narrative just don't cut it.

I am an attorney and a pretty good writer. Cybernation was one of the worst books I have ever read. I read the entire book so that I would truly give it a chance to get better; it didn't! I am part of the force designed to protect the nation's infrastructure and this book was childish at best. I am sorry to be so harsh, but if you let someone put your good name on a book, you should read it first. Not to worry, every page has its own cliche. The end of the book, not to ruin it for you, &quot;Yep. And they lived happily ever after.&quot; Great ending!"},{"Title":"Cybernation (Tom Clancy's Net Force, No. 6)","review":"First, let me tell you a little about the book. This series follows Net Force, a division of the FBI set up to deal with net crimes in 2010. CyberNation deals with a group trying to form a nation based completely on the net. Their main goal throughout the book is to get more people to sign up with them, so that they have the numbers to get the attention of current nations. To get people to join, they disrupt the internet, in a not very legeal way, and so Net Force is called in. The rest of the book is Net Force trying to catch the hackers doing the disruptions.In general this series has a very well thought out discription of what needs to be done to protect and police the net. Having said that, I have noticed that the Net Force books have been going down hill, and this one continues that trend. A lot of time is spent on character development, but no development actually comes out of it. For example, we see Jay Gridley question his upcoming marrage. But in the end, the final decision has nothing to do with the pages of inner questioning that he goes through. Then there is the introduction of new 'toys' for the military, that never show up again. Add to that the fact that every other scene leads to sex, and that there is almost no technology discription, this book is only a shadow of Clancy's work.IMHO this series has become a soap opera, with most of the time spent on generic character development and sex, and very little time spent on the action and discriptions that brought me to Clancy in the first place."},{"Title":"Cybernation (Tom Clancy's Net Force, No. 6)","review":"I had thought, in the beginning, that CyberNation would be pretty good because Tom Clancy wrote a ton of really good books and many great video games are created based on his stories. However, as I read along, there was hardly anything to enjoy. Obviously, I had not read any of the other reviews, so I had no idea what trap I was falling into. The storyline of this book is devoid meaning and completely boring, the complete opposite of what Tom Clancy would normally write.The \\"storyline\\" about Gridley, Howard, Michaels, Santos, Chance, and Keller is completely disjointed. One of the few reasons why this story is connected is that they are fighting against each other in the internet world, and using the VR, or \\"Virtual Reality\\", to track things down or to mess things up. In fact, the whole story is covered up with sex, crime, and violence that there is hardly any connection shown. Of course, if I had not been able to follow the storyline, I would not be able to write this, but it was still quite confusing.So I ask, again, why did Steve Perry write this? He has no sense of what Mr Clancy writes, nor of his style, elegance, and flair. One cannot imitate a type of writing without being the type of person, obviously, so why did Mr Perry try to do so? Mr Clancy truly should write more of his own books, even if he thinks he is too important and too proud to do the writing. Mr Clancy and Mr Perry must have decided to play a prank on loyal fans of Mr Clancy (not that I am one) because this has disappointed many enthusiastic readers. Of course, these questions I am not really able to answer, but I would not be surprised if Mr Clancy's name was written in huge, bold letters on the book for the profit."},{"Title":"Cybernation (Tom Clancy's Net Force, No. 6)","review":"The language used in the book is full of slangs.But I do not think that the book is so bad as the reviewers say.May be a good read for teenagers but not recommended for adults."},{"Title":"Cybernation (Tom Clancy's Net Force, No. 6)","review":"I can't believe that something like this would be published under the name of such a respected author (Tom Clancy)... who, by the way, is not even listed the writer for the novel.I had admittedly high expectations when reading the book jacket, since the premise seemed quite interesting.

While I kept expecting some inventive plot twist or thoughtful character development, what I got instead was embarrassingly adolescent writing and complete predictability.I can't even label this book as a guilty pleasure, since there was no pleasure in reading it, and the only guilt I feel is that I didn't recycle it after the 2nd or 3rd chapter."},{"Title":"Cybernation (Tom Clancy's Net Force, No. 6)","review":"Clancy's name is used to sell this book, but it's not written as well as other books he's been involved with.

If you buy the book you won't be disappointed"},{"Title":"Broken Dreams, Fulfilled Promises","review":"I heard this story from Carolyn herself while having tea with her and her husband at their house in Amsterdam. Reading the book has been a great reminder of God's love and his passion for us. As she writes in Broken Dreams, God has plans that are for sure pretty hard to understand but for those who persevere, there is a promise of fulfillment at the end of the path. Great Book. Five stars for this awesome story that shows who God is. Congrats Carolyn."},{"Title":"Broken Dreams, Fulfilled Promises","review":"I was very encouraged and inspired by reading this book. I had ordered it online and on the day it arrived I was especially busy and tired, and it was late in the evening when I opened the package (that the book was in). I went into my kitchen to do a few things, and began reading the book there. It was so hard to put down that I stood for several minutes, reading. I went into my living room and sat down, continuing to read. It was so hard to put down that I read almost the entire book before I went to bed that night. I finished the book the next day & I also read through it a second time that following week. Carolyn Ros was so honest, real & genuine in what she wrote, in describing how difficult this experience was - but also in expressing what a tremendous difference her - and her family's - faith made in giving them all they needed to cope as they lived through this experience. Also, from having read it, I think she is very talented as a writer. I strongly recommend this excellent book!"},{"Title":"Broken Dreams, Fulfilled Promises","review":"Broken Dreams, Fulfilled Promises takes you through the journey that Carolyn & Johan Ros lived. It is the story of a family whose lives are ripped apart by circumstances beyond their control and then brought back together through their faith in the Lord. I know both Carolyn and Johan personally and thought I knew their story. But after reading Broken Dreams, Fulfilled Promises I learned so much more about their experience and I was truly moved by their faith in the Lord and their perserverence through extreme adversity. They never gave up knowing that the Lord had a plan for them. They went through a very dark time as a family and came through it with a very bright future. I recommend this book to anyone that wants to be inspired and who wants to experience a miracle."},{"Title":"Broken Dreams, Fulfilled Promises","review":"Through reading this powerful story, we'll witness the reality of the living Christ magnified in a life that can boast of nothing but God's abundant grace displayed in broken dreams and fulfilled promises.When the sight of a strong, valiant husband reduced to insignificance because of violent epilepsy attacks becomes unbearable, Carolyn's first aid includes prayer and a request to God, his Creator, to spare him. In her shaken spirit, she cries out to the Lord for consolation and comfort. As the tears flow over the years, the words of God--especially the Psalms--become the confession of her heart. Here is found the proclamation of hope for just one more day, the declaration of faithfulness that our heavenly Father does see her sorrow, and grief over the loss of the husband she had once known. How easy it would be for her to be caught up in a spiral of self-pity and bemoan all the lost opportunities. Yet, she chooses not to focus on the difficulty of her circumstances but on God, Jesus Christ and the promises in His Word.The ending of the book enlightens us with Johan's awakening: the return of authentic memories, the regaining of his identity and vocabulary, the investment of his energy into sharing his faith with others and the showing of his love and care for Carolyn and their four grown-up children. Carolyn finally encourages us by pointing back to the strong supporting pillars of life without which no one can withstand the pain and pressure we all go through in this life. Applying it to her own journey, she says, \\"These pillars have stood firm, upholding us and helping us to transform our lives.\\""},{"Title":"Broken Dreams, Fulfilled Promises","review":"Carolyn Ros' lovely, deep meditation on what we do when the healing process in our lives takes time revolves around her husband, Johan's brain surgery to correct a life-threatening aneurysm. Though the operation was successful in saving his life, Johan suffered a loss of language and cognitive abilities that turned a strapping take-charge Green Beret into a man struggling to form a sentence. Carolyn was left with 3 small children and a husband who seemed fine to look at but whose cognative and emotional life were a mere wisp of his former self for many years. But even at his least responsive, Johan never forgot the name of Jesus nor His sovereignty. Using Scriptures from her daily journal throughout the years of Johan's recovery and ultimate restoration, Carolyn reminds us of God's promise, not to take away all our pain but to walk with us through it. It is a triumphant and a richly poetic book about how God's Word is the rock upon which we rebuild our lives, and the stones for the building."},{"Title":"The USSR olympiad problem book;: Selected problems and theorems of elementary mathematics (A Series of undergraduate books in mathematics)","review":"This book consists of &quot;320 unconventional problems in algebra, arithmetic, elementary number theory and trigonometry.&quot; The problems are mathematically accessible to students at the high school level or higher, as they call more upon analytical thinking than upon advanced mathematical techniques. There is a range of difficulties, with harder problems marked with stars in the book. (The hardest problems are marked with double stars.) The problems are divided into twelve sections: &quot;Introductory Problems,&quot; &quot;Alterations of Digits in Integers,&quot; &quot;The Divisibility of Integers,&quot; &quot;Some Problems from Arithmetic,&quot; &quot;Equations Having Integer Solutions,&quot; &quot;Evaluating Sums and Products,&quot; &quot;Miscellaneous Problems from Algebra,&quot; &quot;The Algebra of Polynomials,&quot; &quot;Complex Numbers,&quot; &quot;Some Problems of Number Theory,&quot; &quot;Some Distinctive Inequalities,&quot; and &quot;Difference Sequences and Sums.&quot; Much of the book is devoted to providing hints and solutions, which are both thorough and clear.

Marilyn says the Texas state curriculum requires elementary students to learn about their community but there wasn't a book about Fort Worth, Texas that appealed to elementary level children. So she and these three third-grade and three fifth-grade students wrote a book. They traveled to different attractions all around the Fort Worth area and wrote up their findings. For example, one attraction was the Fort Worth Zoo. The address, phone number, URL, hours and ticket prices are given. This information is followed by an overall description of the zoo and a bulleted list of zoo features. Then each child tells what he or she liked best about the zoo. The book is also filled with pictures. It's a delightful book, and I think every community should have a book like this.

She examines Faith Ringgold's bold &quot;American People&quot; series and the subtile, yet captivating &quot;Feminist&quot; paintings in exacting detail and of how they reflect the political mood of the Black Power movement and Negro tokenism and the bourgeoisie of the 60's and 70's. Dr. Farrington also notes many of the principals who sponsored and guided Faith Ringgold toward notoriety. If only the paintings in the book were in color(!); however, the illustrations are nonetheless compelling and the book is a rare and thorough examination of a very difficult life, Ms. Ringgold circumventing educational and artistic sexism and racism from the 40's and throughout. Faith Ringgold is a spirit beyond her obstacles. At a time when feminist and sexual politics have been trivialized and racist policies often thought obsolete, Dr. Farrington's profile is a bittersweet reflection of a Black woman's true determination against social divisions that exist to this day."},{"Title":"Worst-Case Scenario Five-Book Set: Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook, Worst-Case Scenario: Travel, Worst-Case Scenario: Dating & Sex, Worst-Case Scenario: Golf, Worst-Case Scenario: Holidays","review":"The Worst-Case Scenario books by Joshua Piven and David Borgenicht have gone way beyond cult status, and the set of all five is the perfect thing to get if you want an entertaining read. The ultimate coffee table books, not one person can pick one up without finding something out they didn't desparately need to know until just now.After reading these books, one can manuever on top of a train, jump from a building into a dumpster, survive a riot, escape a runaway parade balloon, hotwire a car, get someone unstuck from a chimney, determine whether your date is an axe-murderer, and hundreds of other things.Great for an armchair quarterback or basically anyone else who has the slightest interest in nifty things, this collection is probably the best thing I can recommend on Amazon.com. Just put them on a coffee table and watch how quickly people pick one up, and how slowly they set it back down.If all five books is too much of a commitment for you; however, try the original (yellow) or the \\"Dating and Sex\\" (black) book.

The original edition is essential reading for any student of Alaskan development during the first third of the twentieth century; but it is not an enjoyable task, being a dry and biased account of most of the important event taking place during the development of the territory, along with many not so important happenings.Professor Cole cured those problems with this edition. Inaccurate information is noted, incorrect initials and grammar have been corrected. This handy volume has also been judiciously edited and illustrative pictures and footnotes have been added where necessary. The result transforms this volume into an exciting and, at times, suspenseful rendition of the last American frontier. This edition belongs in the library of every person interested in Alaska."},{"Title":"To the Ends of the Earth: The Great Travel and Trade Routes of History (A Hudson Group Book)","review":"This book is the cousin of \\"The Silk Road: A History\\" by the same author. And much of my review of that book would apply to this. Few think of commerce as romantic. Yet the history of commerce is about more then accounting. It is about the Clipper Ships that raced on the China trade, the caravans that crossed the desert. It is about vikings, cossacks, mountain men, bedouin and other peoples who traveled and traded along the ancient roads. It is about the semimystical aura of storied items like gems and spices, and the intrigues between kings. Finally it is about connection, the ways each people showed what it could contribute to life with his hands and his mind. And it is about the endurance of myriads of people who wandered along the ancient pathways.For those who wish to travel through time and space in their minds, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"To the Ends of the Earth: The Great Travel and Trade Routes of History (A Hudson Group Book)","review":"This book shouldn't be out-of-print just for the sole reason that there are no others like it and it's on such a central, enlightening subject. It devotes a chapter to each of the most central and famous trade and travel routes on the Earth. These trade and travel routes are not only at the center of the history of each of their regions (and world history) but they are actually etched into the contours of the Earth (or connected with the ocean currents). Whether they are overland routes, rivers, ocean routes, or combinations of each, they give a sense of real history that is more foundational than what can be described by the political borders of nations and regions. It can also be said that most all history plays out on these trade and travels routes and in the cities they inevitably lead to. Some examples of the trade and travel routes recorded in this book: the Amber Routes; The Cape Horn Route; The Appian Way and the Egnatian Way; the Eurasian Steppe Route and the Russian River Routes; the Great Desert Route and the Persian Royal Road; the Great North Road; the Great Trek Route and the Missionary Road; the Heraclean Way; the Inca Royal Road; the Indian Grand Road; the Mediterranean-Black Sea Routes; the Mississippi Route; the Mohawk Trail; the Nile Route and the Sudan Route; the North Atlantic Route; the Oregon Trail and the California Trail; the Orient Route; the Panama Route; the Sahara Routes; the Silk Road; the Spice Route; the Western Seaways and the Tin Routes; the Incense Road and the Pilgrimage Road; the Cape of Good Hope Route; the Californa Mission Trail; the Ambassador's Road and the Burma Road...

There are seven stories in all, 5 stories, plus 2 more that are the original first drafts of &#65533;Sleep Disorder&#65533; and &#65533;I&#65533;d Give Anything for You.&#65533; Whenever you put Edward Lee and Jack Ketchum together, it spells horror in a highly entertaining and gruesome way. Fantastic collection, don&#65533;t miss out on it. Here is a brief description of the stories.I&#65533;d Give Anything For You &#65533; Clare is a beautiful woman, who becomes exasperating dating, or rather gold digging, a young and very rich man named Roderic, who is fat, slack muscled, and &#65533;pale as a fish belly&#65533;. Seeing a stud on the side named Wardell, Clare finally decides that the fine restaurants and the jewelry and the high living just aren&#65533;t worth the price of dating a man like Roderic when Wardell satisfied her so much better. Besides, along with Roderic came his mother and her man servant Fudd, both of whom disliked Clare. &#65533;Don&#65533;t leave us,&#65533; Roderic begs Clare. &#65533;I&#65533;d give anything for you!&#65533; But Clare leaves, not knowing just how much Roderic is willing to give.Love Letters From The Rain Forest &#65533; Clara Holmes, a beautiful woman, dates droll and dreary professor Howard Moley in an attempt to get at his family fortune, but finds him too boring to be worth the shot at money, so she dumps him. Howard, a mycologist, expert on fungi of every category, flies off to Brazil on a grant to study the rainforest. He still sends Clara love letters, telling her of his wonderful discoveries. Clara replied by sending Howard pictures of her in bed with other men, right about the time she receives a letter from Howard telling her how he has fallen ill. Howard has one more letter to send Clara&#65533;.Masks &#65533; not my favorite, a tale of a worldly and traveled man, his penchant for using his collection of masks for pleasure, and a surprise ending as to which mask we really wear.Eyes Left &#65533; The dead are walking and talking and &#65533;living&#65533; among us. Protected now by the Government so that they have rights, they are still cause for amusment by three friends who hang out during happy hour at the World Caf&eacute; to watch the ladies stroll by. Admiring the scenery and guessing which ones are dead, spouting off about the minority rights of the dead, and wondering what it would be like to bed one. And then she came in, had a drink with them, and made them an offer.Sleep Disorder &#65533; Bill Dumont is a rich, successful, powerful man, and a bastard to boot. Ask his ex wife Laura or his girlfriend Annie, or Millie, the hooker he frequents. But Bill has a problem, he talks in his sleep. When he starts somnambulating, Annie moves out. Bill sets up a tape recorder, because he doesn&#65533;t believe his sleep disorder is all that bad. Bill is in for a surprise.Good Seeing You &#65533; First draft of the short story Sleep Disorder by Jack Ketchum. Don&#65533;t skip over it, it&#65533;s different and stands apart from the collaborated version.I Would Do Anything For You &#65533; First draft of the short story I&#65533;d Give Anything For You. Don&#65533;t skip over it, its different and stands apart from the collaborated version.All these wonderful tales followed up by an Afterward written by Jack Ketchum with some interesting tidbits on how this collaboration came into being.This is one of those books that is worth the price of finding.

Ketchum's visceral visions combined with Lee's love of the truly twisted make for a wicked trip down some very unnerving paths.\\"I'd Give Anything For You\\"... if ANYONE ever says that to you - run! don't look back... just run! Nothing like making sex a horrible thing and a visual that stays with you long after you've finished it!\\"Love Letters From the Rain Forest\\"... good guys finish last, but hey sometimes they only appear to. A bitter tale that waits to grab you until the very end and even though you smell it coming, you wince and cheer at the same time!\\"Masks\\"... good horror should always make you nervous along the way and then reinforce your fears at the end, Masks takes its job seriously!\\"Eyes Left\\"... not your normal zombie story, and in case you wondered, there ARE things worse than death!\\"Sleep Disorder\\"...gotta love a good revenge tale =) Evil, bitter, nasty - oh yeah, women are bad, bad things...And when you're done you get to read 'Good Seeing You' aka first draft of 'sleep disorder' - an amazing tale that was lovingly altered and twisted in just the right way for a wonderful collaboration piece!And then 'I would do anything for you' first draft [note the 'do' and 'give' in the title change] a raunchy ride that gets tweaked into an unsettling argument for abstinence! Almost funny in parts but the end takes all the grins away and replaces them with grimaces...Sharp concise writing, no frills in your face pacing, and characters that you love or love to hate...

Well, you get something like the collaboration between Leopold and Loeb, but far more subversive and a hell of a lot more fun. And that's why they got together for this collection, says Jack Ketchum, \\"We did this just for fun.\\" And he's not kidding, TombRats! Sleep Disorder is more fun than a barrel of vampire bats, and perfect Halloween reading for horror fans. This volume collects a number of edgy stories of supreme terror and, in pioneering Gauntlet Press fashion, shows the two authors working on their own and the final collaborations that meld these two titanic talents. You'll love the title story (written in individual form and collaborative form), \\"Sleep Disorder\\", which treads the very brink of madness with a sense of humor that underscores a full-on screamer of a plot, and that's just for starters. These stories range in tone and atmosphere, but the horror is full-throttle throughout.

I purchased the kindle version for $4.99 and would probably not purchase the hardcover book. I enjoyed all of the stories, except for Masks.

Here's an example from sleep disorder: \\" The benzothiamide (???Bensthiazide?) you were adding to his nighttime dose....\\" This example was frequently found in the book with many different words. To me it seemed like someone was planning to look up the word, made notes about it, and then forgot. I thought this was very unprofessional and I have never seen this in a book before. Otherwise, the stories were great!"},{"Title":"Romance: A Novel (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Joseph Conrad's Romance is one of his last books, published in 1923 (he died the following year). Conrad's final novels supposedly showed a dramatic falling off of his powers (and I've certainly read some I thought were poor). Why does no-one want to examine the second-rate? Much is to be learned about Conrad from his later books. And Romance is quite readable, enjoyable even, one of the most exciting books I've read for ages. It's a bit like an elder Stevenson, a boy's adventure story, a bit slow in places but still fascinating. It does not move me as some of Conrad's stories have done, even to tears, but it's not bad at all. The co-author is Ford Maddox Hueffer. Was he a collaborator or did he complete Conrad's unfinished manuscript?The book really is about romance, in all its aspects, and does a credible job of it. Romance is a melodrama, a genre highly coloured and over reliant on the complexities of its plot. The style is beautiful, if mannered and measured in places. Parts of Cuba are beautifully described, as is the sea and ships. Types are evocatively drawn, quick sketches that add verisimilitude without slowing down the plot. There are perhaps a few too many disasters, things going wrong at the right time so as to add to the suspense. Characters are too often obtuse when it is needed to build a climax. It's a real cliff -hanger (literally) and yet the narrative retains enough plausibility (just!) to make the book read like a thriller. One endures the crises, the disasters, the misunderstandings that advance the plot with an almost painful desire to reach the end. You can see the devices used to elaborate the plot and delay the denouement, just as you can see the playful skill of an old gentleman who, teasing you, refuses to tell you the end of a story before all the elaboration of detail that lead up to it.But the narrative skill is impressive. And the book is self declared about romance, about the illusions and pursuits of youth. It is an old man's book, looking back on an adventurous life, sighing as all old men sigh - and then using a lifetimes' skill in the telling. If this is Conrad in decline, all technique and style but no great truths to impart, it is a decline that many other writers would envy.No message, no picture of the workings of the human heart, of the intricacies of human nature.But charm, beautiful language and a few days entertainment. Why say no?"},{"Title":"Romance: A Novel (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"About this collaborative novel published in 1903, Conrad said, \\"There's easy style, plenty of action, a romantic atmosphere, and a happy ending after no end of real hair's breadth escapes.\\" It was both his and Ford's idea of what Romance was, and they made a serious attempt to capture it in this story.There's a hero, of course (John Kemp), and a heroine (Seraphina), and after suffering all kinds of adventures (mainly in Jamaica and Cuba) involving smuggling, piracy, sea chases, shootings, men sworn to loyalty, and lots of near mishaps, they are united and at peace. Much of the intrigue that takes place on Jamaica was based on fact, and Conrad did a lot of research on politics on the island (and Cuba) during the 1820s, when the book is set. But the book suffered the same fate as some of Fenimore Cooper's novels in that it was relegated to the \\"boys' adventure literature\\" category rather than taken as a serious work of art. (The critics are probably right.) The dialogue is especially weak. The cultural differences, though, encountered in the book are handled deftly by the authors, especially the Spanish ways of Seraphina as contrasted with Kemp's English background. Not considered to be one of Conrad's major achievements."},{"Title":"A guide to the best historical novels and tales (Burt Franklin Bibliography and reference series #228)","review":"I liked the variety of titles from which to choose.History has always been of great interest to me.I intend to try all the titles listed."},{"Title":"A guide to the best historical novels and tales (Burt Franklin Bibliography and reference series #228)","review":"Good listing but doesn't inspire one to buy the books.

Little does she know that within the year, her life will be turned upside down, just as the lives of the famous couple andtheir children are---set against the backdrop of a seemingly routine life of a family, a furor erupts when Mia discovers that Woody is having an affair with her daughter Soon-Yi. And then, in the midst of this angst comes the allegations of molest by Woody of the couple's adopted daughter Dylan.Before the storm, the author marvels at the simple routines of this family, from the Connecticut house to the Central Park West home that Mia shares with several children---some biological and some adopted. Woody, of course, lives in his own duplex apartment across the Park, but visits frequently. In this fashion, the two have developed a semblance of normal family life for a dozen years, collaborating in movies and co-parenting the children.Court battles ensue, and the author describes the stressful climate of the home while this is happening---it takes more than a year for everything to be resolved. But while it is playing out, the day-to-day lives of the family members change---subtly at first---but then dramatically, as the life they all once knew crumbles around them.The author provides a true insider's version of events, albeit from her point of view.I especially enjoyed the glimpses of celebrity family life, for despite the traumatic events, a kind of normalcy was sought by the parties involved. In this book,Mia & Woody: Love and Betrayal, one fact shone through---Mia's love for her children."},{"Title":"Mia & Woody: Love and Betrayal","review":"Very well written, thoroughly engrossing. Both fair in that the author does not give specific opinions on the alleged abuse, but gives the reader a feel for what the Farrow-Allen relationship was like day-to-day and what the Farrow family went through during the &quot;trial of character&quot; that took place. I would like to read a follow up on what is going on now and how it has ended, and if it has ended? What is the Farrow Brood and Woody doing now. 2001-Lee"},{"Title":"Mia & Woody: Love and Betrayal","review":"Straight from Woody and Mia's Nanny (Kristine Groteke). She did everything with the family and it shows throughout this book. You will get the inside scoop on what Mia, Woody, and the kids are really like.Here's a couple fun examples from the inside info: Woody had a special shower built for him in Mia's house but refused to use it because he felt the germs built up inside it. Another one is that when Woody and Mia were not getting along well, Woody would bring a pre-cooked chicken to the house because he was concerned that Mia might poison him with her cooking.Not everything is so light hearted, as we find out that Woody's daughter Dylan may have been coached by Mia into saying he molested her. Even worse, Woody may have molested Dylan (the charges were dropped). Also, it turns out that Soon-Yi has a double-digit IQ and may have been duped by Woody. Interestingly, Groteke says she does not know for sure about either of these issues but admits that she found it strange that Woody and Soon-Yi wound up together romantically.Overall, I think the only way we could get a closer look at their lives would be if Woody, Mia, or Soon-Yi wrote a book themselves."},{"Title":"Act of Mercy: A Celtic Mystery","review":"This series has always been one of the best of its genre, and, unlike other similar series, it shows no sign whatsoever of losing steam as more books are written. In fact, this was one of the best Fidelma mysteries. As always, Fidelma is positively Holmesian in her deductive abilities, and she is a much more multi-faceted character than the illustrious Mr. H. Also, Tremayne always creates memorable characters, both the foils and the criminals, and, for the most part(certainly here), cracking good mysteries. Also, there was a nice teaser at the end that leaves the reader definitely anticipating the next entry in the series. (...). Anyway, a great read."},{"Title":"Act of Mercy: A Celtic Mystery","review":"Sister Fidelma of Cashmal, daughter and sister to kings, takes a pilgrimage to Iberia to visit the Shrine of St. James. She needs a respite from her royal sibling and from the Saxon monk Eadulf. She knows she has found her life's calling as a religieure, but hopes this odyssey will help her sort some mixed feelings especially her feelings about Eadulf.Alas, poor Fidelma received no respite on her trek as her luck deserts her from the start when she meets first love Cian, who unceremoniously dumped her years ago. Soon two women are killed and attempts on Fidelma's life occur. With the ship's captain blessing, Fidelma begins investigating the homicides.In the eighth installment of the Sister Fidelma historical mysteries, readers obtain a glimpse at the heart and soul of the heroine that paints a vivid picture of life in eight-century Ireland. The who-done-it is a marvelous piece of misdirection, as the villain remains hidden until the end. When revealed, the audience will feel pity towards the culprit. ACT OF MERCY is a fantastic Dark Ages who-done-it.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Act of Mercy: A Celtic Mystery","review":"Sister Fidelma, court advocate in Seventh Century Ireland and sister to Colgu, King of Muman, is on her way to Iberia. The ship on which she takes passage carries other pilgrims heading for the tomb of St. James, all of them from two associated abbeys. Fidelma has no interest in becoming part of the group, and she's horrified when one of the monks turns out to be Cian, who ten years ago was a warrior in service to the High King and Fidelma's first love. For Cian, she gave up her legal studies and nearly wrecked her life - but she's grown up now. While Cian, who married another woman without even telling Fidelma his intention to do so, still seems to be the same self-absorbed boy he was back then. He's simply older now, handicapped by a battle injury, divorced, and doing his best to salve his damaged ego.Before the ship leaves port, one of the pilgrims - the nun who organized the pilgrimage - is murdered. Far at sea, another death occurs; and it's mysterious enough so that Fidelma feels obligated to investigate. The ship's captain gives her his authority to do so, which forces the other passengers to grudgingly cooperate. As Saxon slavers pursue them and the captain and his crew struggle to keep from falling into the slavers' hands, storms batter the ship; and the body count grows. Fidelma herself escapes being murdered more than once, and she begins to realize that the mystery somehow revolves around Cian. But can she trust her perceptions where he is concerned, since she still detests this man?Like Fidelma, I missed Brother Eadulf during this book's events. But the glimpses into her earlier life proved illuminating, and the story moved along at a rapid pace. This one I finished in a single evening. While I'm enjoying each installment in this series as I read it, I don't usually find it impossible to put the book down and go to sleep - but this time, that's exactly what happened.--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner \\"Regs\\""},{"Title":"Act of Mercy: A Celtic Mystery","review":"I love Sister Fidelma mysteries for a variety of reasons, predominately:excellent mysteries with good character development, an excellent and a readable presentation of ancient Irish history and Brehon law. I have learned so much about the battle between the Irish Catholics and the Roman Catholics; and sadly, that the harsh views of Christianity held by the Roman faction were the final winners of the battle for the soul of all Catholics. I have also found fascinating the blend of Brehon law, Druid beliefs and practices and Christianity--the world would be a better place had the Irish version succeeded. My Irish heritage seems somewhat vindicated and less &#34;priest-riddent&#34; by the knowledge that Ireland was the world center of learning in a very dark time and had some of the most progressive practices of the day (and possibly even more than those extant in the world today).Yes, I know that Peter Tremayne has been sometimes critiqued as not being &#34;scholarly&#34; enough. But as a retired college professor, I know that criticism is sometimes a cover for people that don't want certain viewpoints allowed. However, what is really important is the STORY--we need stories to tell that are more humane, more loving, and more intelligent that those stories that are currently being told. And certainly Brehon law was more progressive and humane than anything we have seen to date. I advise you to read these in chronological order because the story is historical and should be read that way. I really love these stories, they are like candy and equally addictive.That said, I have read eleven of the Sister Fidelma books so far, but with every Kindle edition I have read, I have become more and more exasperated and disappointed in the editing of the books. It is not as though these are one or two dollar books, they are expensive for e-books. In some pages I have found 2-4 editing errors, in some editions scores of editing errors. As a former editor, this grates on my nerves. AMAZON: hire people like me to edit these books, sometimes e-books written in English look as though they have been edited by a machine or someone who is not familiar with English. Again, hire professionals to edit these books. This would have been a 5-star rating had the editing been up to par."},{"Title":"Act of Mercy: A Celtic Mystery","review":"In this story Sister Fidelmas is making a pilgrimage to visit a Saint's shrine in Iberia. She is without the faithful Eadulf, and , in fact, she has deliberately made this trip in order to try to assess her feelings for Eadulf and to asses the validity of her religious calling. In order to get to Iberia she must take ship. She books with a group of pilgrims that are going to visit the same shrine that she is going to, but what an ill-assorted group they are. There are a lot of tensions in the group, and it's not long after they get out to sea before murder occurs. We meet a lot of wonderful characters in this book, and the sea theme is good. Fidelma does manage to figure out the murderer, but not before other bodies turn up. In fact, she narrowly misses being one of them herself."},{"Title":"Act of Mercy: A Celtic Mystery","review":"I freely admit that Peter Tremayne is not a good writer. At his worst he sounds like he is across the room shouting the narrative at you. His detective, Sister Fidelma comes across like a mixture of Perry Mason, Kung Fu and Sherlock Holmes, with poor old Brother Ealdwolf her happy bumbling Watson. However there are simply not enough books about Dark Age (he would dispute the term) Irish judge magistrates in a religious order.In this book where we have Sister Fidelma leaving Ealdwolf behind as she ponders her dedication to law and religion, she sets sail with a group of contentious and mismatched pilgrims. And, lo and behold, she finds one of the pilgrims to be a blast from her own past. And he hasn't changed much at all. Then a woman disappears and is presumed lost overboard and Fidelma begins to investigate that and other strange happenings on a small boat.Add Saxon slavers (Wo-DEN, Wo-DEN), heavy weather at sea and a dreadful ship wreck resulting in a rescue that further complicates the case.You can tell that Tremayne is really trying to give Sister Fidelma more depth and character and because he is doing something different I'm inclined to give him an A for Effort."},{"Title":"Act of Mercy: A Celtic Mystery","review":"This was my first Peter Tremayne purchase, and it will be my last. Mr. Tremayne doesn't seem to know if he is writing a historical mystery, a fantasy novel, or a really bad romance. I finished this book because I couldn't believe it was so bad--it gradually assumed a kind of horrible fascination for me. The prose style is clumsy, the diction overblown, and the motivations are silly.If you want historical mysteries, stick with Brother Cadfael. If you want hokey but fun fantasy, read Barbara Hamblyn. If you want romantic mysteries, read Elizabeth Peters et al. Or read Lindsey Davis' &quot;Falco&quot; mysteries for a bit of all three."},{"Title":"Creatio Ex Nihilo (Academic Paperback)","review":"This book is THE classic work on the doctrine of Creatio ex nihilo ('creation out of nothing'). May describes in exquisite detail how this doctrine developed out of theological discussions with contemporary rivals (especially with Gnostic theologians) in the first four centuries AD. Thus, May describes mainly the motives for developing this doctrine.Although this is a scholarly work, the translation of the original German text is wonderfully readable, and May puts the scholarly details in footnotes. The main text, therefore, is fluid and surprisingly readable for a scholarly work. Also, because of the many bibliographical details in the footnotes, this book lends itself for self-study.All in all, if you want to know what the doctrine of Creatio ex nihilo is about (and also what process theologians throw away when renouncing this doctrine!), this is definitely the place to start."},{"Title":"Official Guide to Using OS/2 Warp","review":"This manual is comprehensive in it's coverage of Os/2 Warp 3.0.

Not by a long shot. Albert Schweitzer wins that distinction hands down. In the 20th and 21st century, too much emphasis has been placed on the relationship between technological advances and the corresponding impact on society. Schweitzer simply transcended achievement by weaving a legacy of the most accomplished Renaissance Man in the last 200 years. Combining intellectual brilliance and an amazing thirst for humanitarian service, Schweitzer simply made the world a much better place. He accomplished more in one life time than anyone I can think of.The Philosophy of Civilization is a monument. This was Schweitzer's labor of love, and predictably, he produced yet another masterpiece. Reading Schweitzer should be required reading in philosophy, humanities, and religious studies at all universities and colleges in America. He should be the standard by which all GLOBAL thought is measured."},{"Title":"The philosophy of civilization","review":"This book should be more widely known.

He was a mere twenty six years old when IT IS TIME, LORD was published. One thinks of Hemingway, also twenty-six when THE SUN ALSO RISES was published, and the energy and mastery of technique he evinced early on.A better analogy, though, would probably be James Joyce, whose PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN, provides clear correlations with Chappell's novel. Both are concerned with young artists, writers, struggling to come to terms with the weight of their pasts and in those attempts trying to turn experience into art. Each youth labors under the shadow of a forceful, not always sympathetic father.Chappell does something here, way back in 1963, that not many other subsequent novelists have been able to do, at least not in my estimation, and that is to justify use of the present tense narrative form. Too many writers today use the technique as a showy gimmick, but Chappell is not playing around here. The present tense narrative of James Christopher's dissolute present life is starkly contrasted with his rural upbringing, told in the form of an aborted memoir, but in each we can see the seeds of James's self-destruction.IT IS TIME, LORD also plants the seeds for Chappell's later quartet of autobiographical novels beginning with I AM ONE OF YOU FOREVER and recently concluding with LOOK BACK ALL THE GREEN VALLEY, and this first novel makes for a compelling warm up for those fine books."},{"Title":"Mr. Madam;: Confessions of a male madam","review":"The title and taglines play up the prostitution aspects of Mr Marlowe's life story, but it is a pretty straight forward and unapologetic autobiography. He describes the activity in such a way, it is not lewd or obscene. The Dr.'s forward is a bit condescending while trying to be impartial. Very much in the vein of Hate the Sin, love the sinner. After finding a copy of this book at a used bookstore, I read it pretty quickly. I am buying a second copy to donate to our Pride Center library. There is so precious little \\"gay history\\". I am curious if the author is still living. I've not had much luck googling him."},{"Title":"Deep-Sky Wonders","review":"Walter Scott \\"Scotty\\" Houston is a name many astronomers know well. Author of the Sky &amp; Telescope Deep Sky Wonders column from 1946 until his death in December of 1993. He was a passionate amateur astronomer to the end of his long life. Houston's last column appeared in Sky &amp; Telescope in July 1994 issue, and since that time, amateurs have had to scour back issues to excavate Houston's gold mine of observational knowledge. Enter Stephen James O'Meara. O'Meara has been on the staff of Sky &amp; Telescope magazine since the late 70's, and was editor of Houston's column from 1990 until his death. O'Meara began the compilation by working with photocopies of the nearly 550 individual columns spanning Houston's career. He sorted, organized, and collated each of the works and produced a chapter for each month of the year, into which he inserted Houston's colorful prose, descriptive history, and observational commentary. O'Meara begins each section with some light annotation, but most of the words in this book are Houston's, and as a collection, they jell beautifully into a seasonal observer's guide that challenge Burnham's for the sheer elegance and depth of feeling that emanates from the pages. Upon receiving the book, I quickly turned my attention to a few of my favorite deep sky objects and marveled at the timelessness of Houston's descriptive prose. Before I knew it I had been reading for over an hour and could have spent several more lost in the beauty of Houston's finely knit web of description, quotes from other authorities, and the words of his readers. An example from his description of NGC2403, a little known but beautiful galaxy in Camelopardis:&quot;My 4-inch Clark refractor shows it as a lovely gem. I logged it as an \\"ocean of turbulence and detail\\" as seen with a 10-inch reflector under dark Kansas skies in the 1950's. In 1992 I saw it with a 20-inch telescope from the Florida Keys - a view that transformed it into a hurricane of cosmic chaos.&quot; (pp 28-29)O'Meara's compilation of Houston's works has quickly taken its place as one of my favorite cloudy night books. It is also a valuable resource for planning observing sessions. It's organization by month lends itself well to selecting some prime targets for easy observing, with a generous does of difficult challenges for the more adventurous. This book is destined to be an instant classic."},{"Title":"Deep-Sky Wonders","review":"Deep Sky Wonders is a collection of issues spanning several decades of the late Walter Scott Houston's monthly column in Sky and Telescope magazine. The noted astronomer and author Stephen James O'Meara organized Houston's writings by subject matter and further by month of optimal viewing for better readability. O'Meara also only edited the text for consistency in a couple places, so it remains Houston's work. I think he did an excellent job in the compilation. A section on any given constellation or deep sky object may contain excerpts from many of Houston's articles, yet O'Meara managed to make the transitions seamless and got the flow right.I read this book over about a month and it was a most enjoyable experience. Houston's writing is superb, which is not surprising considering he held degrees in English. Also, his love and enthusiasm for amateur astronomy comes through better than in any work I've read so far barring perhaps Burnham's wonderful Celestial Handbook. Houston knows the sky and was an active observer right up to his death in 1993.Both beginning and veteran observers will enjoy using this work to plan observing sessions, to check what interesting or challenging objects are up during a session, or to read in a comfortable setting on a night of no observing. I plan to take this book with me on every observing session. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Deep-Sky Wonders","review":"Walter Scott Houston was a dedicated amateur astronomer whose monthly column, \\"Deep-Sky Wonders\\" appeared in Sky & Telescope magazine for almost 48 years, from 1946 to 1994. Though he passed away in 1993, his writings live on to educate and inspire both new and old generations of stargazers. Noted amateur astronomer and author Stephen James O'Meara compiled Scotty's monthly columns and edited them into book form, Deep-Sky Wonders (1999, Sky Publishing Corp.).There is a chapter for every month of the year, with Scotty's engaging descriptions of the objects and how to find them. Many are challenging, with a brightness of 10-11 magnitude or less. Each chapter begins with O'Meara's personal comments and ends with a table of that month's objects, in ascending order by M- and NGC- number, showing the type of object, its RA and Dec, and page and chart numbers in the Millennium Star Atlas, Uranometria 2000.0 and Sky Atlas 2000.0.Scotty blazed trails in amateur astronomy, never content with the status quo. This book illustrates his spirit for seeking out elusive objects and his love for the wonders of the heavens. He often asked readers of his column to submit their comments and observations. Many of those observations are recounted in this book. Scotty was a master, with vast knowledge of the realm of space, but was ever down-to-earth in his discussions with his readers. In the pages of this book you will find friendly, familiar Messier objects and exotic, hard-to-find challenge objects, all skillfully described in Scotty's own words, with anecdotes on how he came to see them.O'Meara's preface to the book explains his relationship with Scotty on the S&T; staff and as editor of Scotty's column in the 1990s. O'Meara idolized Walter Scott Houston, and attempts in his own books to emulate the nearly-poetic writing Scotty was famous for. Two other well-known astronomy figures, Brian Skiff and Dennis DiCicco added their comments in forewords to the book.But Scotty's own colorful words make up the bulk of Deep-Sky Wonders. Here is a long passage from the first page of chapter one, \\"January\\":\\"I learned my constellations in Tippecanoe, Wisconsin, a town that long ago vanished into the urban sprawl of Milwaukee. Back then Tippecanoe was a rather treeless tract of farmland bounded by the great clay bluffs of western Lake Michigan. The sky ran right down to the horizon and, with an almost irresistible force, called for you to look at it. In January 1926, after a midnight walk home from ice-skating, I wrote:\`Snow crystals sparkle like blue diamonds, but with a dreamy gentle radiance totally unlike the harsh gem. A rail fence as black as Pluto himself runs along the road. The forest is black in the distance. The landscape is a masterpiece in ultramarine and sable.\`As if in contrast, the heavens above blaze with a thousand tints. Incredible Orion leads the hosts with blue Rigel, ruby Betelgeuse, and bright Bellatrix. His silver belt and sword flash like burnished stellar steel. And more advanced is dark and somber Aldebaran, so heavy and gloomy. In fitting contrast are the delicate Pleiades, who sparkle \\"like a swarm of fireflies tangled in a silver braid\\".\`How can a person ever forget the scene, the glory of a thousand stars in a thousand hues, the radiant heavens and the peaceful Earth? There is nothing else like it. It may well be beauty in its purest form.' \\"**(Scotty referred to a stanza in the poem Locksley Hall by Alfred Lord Tennyson.)Get the book, Deep-Sky Wonders, and get to know Walter Scott Houston.

So when I saw that they were going to publish a \\"compilation\\" of his works, I knew I would have to get the book. And get the book I did.

If you are not all that financially savvy then you may have to re-read certain sentences and passages to understand what the author is talking about. He fails to give adequate examples and case studies to help readers envision real-life circumstances that other people have gone through. Examples are probably unnecessary but I've always thrived on examples and case studies.What is comes down to is this:1.) This book contains a lot of useful information that is not written for the benefit of the reader. It is written much in the same way as college texts - professors writing to impress other professors, bankers writing to impress other bankers. This book could have been written with more clearly for the everyday man and woman. At least that is what I come away feeling. I've read better and more concisely written books that are more easily understood.2.) Only barely touches up on obtaining money for start-ups. Start-ups are about only 5-10% of the book at most.

Well, he lives a disconnected life, and finds meaning in the stories of others, but doesn't want to get too close because that would require an investment in time and care he isn't willing to make.

The first half of the book is brilliant. He discourses on how losses obtain from analysis and how gains obtain from holistic views. Function is put as an emergent quality, a something more than a mere sum of its parts. The ideas expressed in this book had great influence on the research methods and expositions in biology and medicine and have since extended to all systems studies. From the less edited second half of his book it becomes clear that he decided to publish before he finished the editing he had so carefully begun.

What gave Martin Luther lion-like boldness in defending the supremacy of Scripture? What fueled John Calvin's God-entranced preaching and writing ministry? A stoic, disinterested obligation to do what is right? No! It was white-hot passion for their Sovereign Joy: God. They were radically converted as they encountered the real, risen Jesus and His liberating gospel in the written Word of God. And for the joy of having found the Pearl of great price, they sold everything to obtain it. Join Piper as he examines what captured the hearts of these three flawed saints whom God has used so powerfully to teach His church what grace really means.&quot;How sweet all at once it was for me to be rid of those fruitless joys which I had once feared to lose! . . . You drove them from me, you who are the true, the sovereign joy. You . . . took their place, you who are sweeter than all pleasure . . .&quot;Aurelius Augustine,(The Legacy of Sovereign Joy, p. 57)"},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"This insightful book lays historical foundations for the philosophy of Christian Hedonism (Biblically known simply as discipleship to Jesus Christ!) which John Piper first outlined in his book Desiring God: The Meditations of a Christian Hedonist.These chapters on Augustine, Luther, and Calvin (originally lectures delivered at the Bethlehem Conference for Pastors) are thought-provoking, heart-stirring mini-biographical studies aimed at fanning the flames of God-centeredness in the lives of Christians.Piper beautifully develops the Augustinian understanding of grace as &quot;sovereign joy&quot; which liberates us from the power of sin, by showing how this dynamic worked to free Augustine himself from the bondage of lust.From Luther's life, Piper delves into the importance of studying the Word of God even in the midst of suffering. And with Calvin, we are told how devotion to the exposition of Scripture is the means by which the Majesty of God is revealed with life-transforming power.Piper preserves the careful balance of admiring the virtues of these men without condoning their flaws. He gives insightful and objective reflection on Augustine's sacramentalism, Luther's vulgarity, and Calvin's consent to the barbarity of his violent age. But he doesn't let these sad mistakes obstruct from view the important contributions each of these men have made to the history of the church.I am glad that these studies are being published (this is the first book of a series of such biographies). They will prove helpful to both the serious student of Christian History, as well as the average curious reader."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"An excellent addition to the literature on biblical joy, following the lead of Sherwood Wirt's 'Jesus: Man of Joy', et al. John Piper is one of the foremost champions of classical theism in its contemporary battle against inroads from a minority view called 'open theism', which seems to (even if unwittingly, by implication, in all sincere intentions) unbiblically restrict God's absolute sovereignty. Many these days recoil at such a concept, but the author puts the doctrine in Scriptural perspective: part of God's sovereignty is Sovereign Joy. A wonderful invitation to research the works of Augustine, Luther, Calvin, other fathers of the evangelical faith to discover a deeper, brighter, more robust, full-orbed, delightful insight into another facet of the Character of our Wonderful God. Must reading, especially for those open to 'open theism' (see BGC Foreknowledge website for some of Piper's and others' excellent essays) to recapture a more plenarily Biblical theology for personal life and witness."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"This is a wonderful book for the layperson. John Piper brings the realization home that God works through flawed human beings. Because of this, you and I can be freed from the misconceptions that only superheroes of faith are used greatly by God. It is God and God alone that shines through the cracks in our earthen vessels. May God have the glory in the lives of Augustine, Luther and Calvin. And may God use us in a way in which he recieves all the glory. Thank you for these biographical sketches that explore three giant men but shows a sovereign God who dwarfs them...much to the pleasure of these giants."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"John Piper's series of biographies, The Swans Are Not Silent, of which this is the first book, is so named for multiple reasons that come out in the preface. When Augustine was handing over his administrative duties to an assistant named Eraclius, Eraclius was asked to give a message. As Augustine sat silently on the bishops throne behind, Eraclius said, \\"The cricket chirps, the swan is silent.\\" This is how I feel looking at the way that God has impacted men like Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Edwards, Owen, and even Piper. Being motivated by the grace that God has shown them in their lives and learning from their lessons, as I go out to the world with the motive of Paul that is seen in so many of these great men in history, \\"Him we declare, warning everyone and teaching everyone in all wisdom so that we may present everyone mature in Christ (Colossians 1:28 ESV),\\" my words feel like the chirps of crickets next to the songs of these gifted swans. Sometimes, one of the best ways to let their songs be sung is to let them sing them for themselves through the words that they wrote and the testimony that they left. That is what John Piper has done in this book, and it has definitely had its desired effect."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"I have only good things to say about the man John Piper, both as a theologian and pastor. I was however, a little disapointed with this book. I love all three of these Christian heros and was very excited to read about their lives and ministries especially agaist the backdrop of their blatent failures. Piper however, spends more time molding their lives into three preset themes he wishes to discuss then their lives themselves. His chosen themes are Sovereign Joy, Sacred Study, and The Divine Majesty of the Word.This book is certainly not a biography (something that is tipped off by its 150 pages of large type) but is interesting if you wish to read about all of the aformentioned ideas. It certainly is a quick read and worth the edification. I would reccommend though that after this book you read some of the men themselves to get a fuller picture of their lives and more importantly, how they display God's glory."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"Most reviewers have hit upon the highlights of this book. I do not feel the need to repeat it.This book is a set of mini-biographies of the lives of three flawed saints. I emphasize the word &quot;flawed&quot; because one of the things I appreciated most about this book was how it emphasized each man's weaknesses and sin. These were flawed saints. There is no saint who is not flawed. When it comes to heroes, there is an easy downward slip from the desire for imitation to the discouragement of intimidation to the deadness of resignation. Seeing their weaknesses and how God's grace triumphed in them is to see Christ's strength perfected in weakness.And seeing how they sang of their sovereign joy of God in the midst of incredible opposition both from the world and their sin gives me hope; for I am flawed, I am imperfect, and I struggle with sin. But oh, I sing for my Sovereign Joy! There is hope in these pages that even men of God sin, but God pulls them out of the mirey clay as an example of His grace, not their greatness.While I wish Piper could have gone a little bit deeper, I found in his book enough to meditate upon, and a spark has ignited a desire to learn more about these men in order to see their God, their Sovereign Joy."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"A quick and eye-opening read. Mr. Piper opens the doors of a cellar that has been closed to evangelical Christianity for too long. Mr. Piper's text is void of deep theological language, in-depth historical jargon and is perfect encouragement and enlightenment for the layman. A great book for getting congregations thinking again. Read it. Even if you have an aversion to reading, be encouraged, you will be through this book quickly. This is an excellent companion to J.I. Packer's translation of Martin Luther's Bondage of the Will. Piper is not apologetic and is quite forthcoming in relating the &quot;flaws and sins&quot; of these men. What is most remarkable and refreshing about the sketches he presents is the overwhelming sovereignty of God choosing man, not man choosing God (Romans 9). What is obvious from the lives of these men is that they served, strived and conquered, not by any self-determination, but by the absolute joy and delight in Christ which overcame each one of them in a unique way and of course this was accomplished through the power of the Holy Spirit. The book was a great lift for me, I struggle with some of the things these &quot;giants&quot; struggled with. I drew encouragement from these brief biographical sketches. Overall, Piper's text is a small compass which points to the true North of our lives, loving God and worshipping Him with all we have, motivated by His unyielding and relentless love. It has aided me in being still and knowing God is the great I AM."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"Our devotion to God often gets mired in the traps and snares of everyday living. We fall into complacency or a feeling of inadequatcy to God's purpose. We then look to our historical, spritual fathers and feel that the zenith of their devotions is far beyond what we think we could ever achive. But, we miss that the nadir of their depravity is far beyond what most of us have ever had to face in the call to Christ.This book is brief in its number of pages, but the testimonies of their lives ought to help us become more desperate for God who out of His grace will return to us passion, devotion and joy. If God can use these men, He can use me. If God can overwhelmingly entrall these men, He can do the same for me. If God can bring joy to darkness in these mens lives, what will He do in mine if I devote myself to Him.I read this book in two days and it was well worth it"},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy is Book One of John Piper's series The Swans are Not Silent. Each book of the series (of which there is currently four) collects three of the biographical lectures Piper gave at the annual Bethlehem Conference for Pastors over the past two decades. When Augustine resigned as Bishop of Hippo it was said that the \\"swan is silent.\\" Piper aims to show that the swans, those in our heritage of Christians throughout the centuries, are in fact not silent.This book expounds on the lives and thoughts of Augustine, Martin Luther, and John Calvin. It begins with an introduction about \\"savoring the sovereignty of grace in the lives of flawed saints.\\" Piper explains that each of these men \\"had this in common: they experienced, and built their lives and ministries on, the reality of God's omnipotent grace.\\" (18) Noting some of the flaws of each of these men, Piper believes that \\"the glory of God, however dimly, is mirrored in the flawed lives of his faithful servants.\\" (37)Each chapter is about half biography and half theological survey and averages 34 pages. There is a pattern to each chapter: after a brief introduction John Piper provides a biographical sketch and then brings out a prominent theme from author's theology. For Augustine, the theme is sovereign joy, for Luther it is sacred study, and for Calvin it is the divine majesty of the Word.After these chapters, Piper concludes with four lessons we can learn from the \\"flawed saints.\\" \\"1) Do not be paralyzed by your weaknesses and flaws... 2) In the battle against sin and surrender, learn the secret of sovereign joy... 3) Supernatural change comes from seeing Christ in his sacred Word... 4) Therefore, let us exult the exposition of the truth of the Gospel and herald the glory of Christ for the joy of all peoples.\\" (143-148)It is evident throughout the book that John Piper has done his homework; quoting often from primary texts and secondary sources. While there may be some over simplification in regard to the theological themes, Piper's points are nonetheless insightful and practical. Each chapter serves as a great introduction to the lives and thoughts of these Christian men. The Legacy of Sovereign Joy provides a stimulating resource for those looking to discover some of the motivating themes of the Reformed tradition."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"As you can see by the book's subtitle, this little book has three biographical pieces on well known historical Christians. Though most Christians know the names of these men, few know any more than that. So this book serves as a useful introduction to their lives and work.But this book offers more that just a general introduction. These essays were originally conference talks given by the author to an audience of pastors. So there is a specific theme and purpose to them beyond summary historical information. Lessons from the lives of these men are drawn out to inspire and equip a new generation of Christian leaders.I was personally most inspired by the chapter on Martin Luther. I was greatly convicted to be more diligent in the study of God's word. But all three essays were interesting and provoked personal reflection."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"The books in the Swan series are taken from a conference for pastors, where Dr. Piper presents these biographies. The biographies are never meant to be exhaustic treatment, but tailored to encourage pastors.I find these brief biographies to be so wonderful and often whet the appetite for more. One can only be encourage and motivated to do more for the Lord, having bathed the soul in these well-written, tailored sketches."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"This past week, I felt like I needed to read something soul stirring. So I grabbed John Piper's The Legacy of Sovereign Joy.So glad I did.This is the first in a series of books that Piper has written on people in church history. Each book is centered around a specific topic. This one is around joy and grace and what they really mean. He looks at the lives of Augustine, Martin Luther and John Calvin.What makes this different from a mere biography is that throughout the book, Piper interjects some commentary on each person. Which is fascinating.Each life was interesting and challenging in its own way. Easily though, the chapter on Luther should be mandatory reading for any pastor. I was reminded in that chapter and in the chapter on Calvin about the weight of preaching, the amount of work it takes and what is at stake. I think too many pastors stand up in church every weekend, give their opinion on a verse and sit down. Many pastors give more weight and time to college football than they do to their preaching. For Luther, preaching and studying a text was likened to Jacob wrestling an angel. That is the struggle he saw in coming to terms with a text to be able to preach it. I wonder if preaching would improve if we saw it that way as pastors. As Piper points out, \\"Too many pastors preach as if nothing is at stake.\\"I'll step off my soapbox now.What was interesting is the struggle, the hardships, death threats, illnesses and tragedies each man went through and yet, seemed to live a life centered on joy. What Piper points out, what many of us miss and what these men discovered is that joy, true joy is rooted in God's grace. To experience joy, we must understand the depths of grace. Until we understand the depths of grace, we will miss joy because we will be to focused on deeds and performing for God.Definitely worth a read if you are looking for something soul stirring on the subject of joy and happiness.For more, check out [...]."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"Concise but comprehensive might sound like a contradiction but I couldn't think of any other way to describe it. John Piper really introduced me to Jonathan Edwards, and between the two of them I would say that no other author has had as much of an impact upon me in the last few years as these two. Now Piper introduces us to Augustine, Luther, and Calvin also. This is the first book in a series of three and well worth the investment. I read it in my spare time in just 1 week, have the second book ready to go, but regret not purchasing the third at the same time. Piper's strength is not only in presenting one very compelling argument about the triumph of God's grace (or \\"Sovereign Joy\\"), but to do it by presenting numerous facets of the work of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin, which are easy to follow and understand, gives an excellent overview of their lives and ministries, and which leaves you wanting to (and feeling confident of being able to) read from the original sources. Every page was a gem. Be warned though, I got about 10 pages into the book then realised my mistake ... I should have read this book with a pencil and note pad in hand! There are so many great quotes from Augustine, Luther, and Calvin, not to mention Piper himself that you'll want to write some of them down to chew over later (or file away for sermon illustrations). This is an easy read and a great introduction the some major figures in church history, not to mention excellent food for the soul. In a day when people are so biblically illiterate as well as ignorant (or contemptible) of church history, this book demonstrates that our impoverishment is foolish and unnecessary. We need more books like this! I would have given it 6 stars if I could, simply on price, readability, and content alone."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin (The Swans Are Not Silent)For the avid reader of John Piper this series (The Swans are Silent) is different from what you have come to expect. The book is made up of a series of brief biographical sketches of Augustine, Luther and Calvin. While they are good this reviewer has enjoyed (many times) the section on Luther. That is probably because I am a pastor and the description of his untiring study and preaching of the Scripture is both inspiring and humbling. Any believer in Christ will profit much from reading this book but it should be strongly recommended to any one who regularly preaches/teaches the Word of God. It also would make a great gift for your pastor if he/she doesn't already own it."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"After receiving The Roots of Endurance from a colleague of mine one year ago, I decided that one day I would read The Legacy of Sovereign Joy. Both of these books are part of a five book series from John Piper called The Swans are Not Silent. I have completed nearly a dozen Piper books, and each time I have come away having benefited tremendously. The Legacy of Sovereign Joy examines God's triumphant grace in the lives of three giants of the Christian faith - Aurelius Augustine, Martin Luther and John Calvin. God used these men powerfully to teach his church what grace really means. Reading about these men reminded me that they certainly had their flaws and that I am to only exalt our Lord Jesus Christ. Yes, these men had a white-hot passion for the sovereign joy of God, but it is God who put that in them. If you are interested in learning more about how God opened the eyes of totally depraved men helping them to overcome their struggles to become God-glorifying men of the Word, I highly encourage you to read The Legacy of Sovereign Joy."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"This is the first of the series of \\"The Swans Are Not Silent.\\" This series is a series of books that are quick bios on the the lives of different people in the history of Christendom. The reason for the title of this series comes from a quote from Eraclius. Piper tells us the following:At the age of seventy-one, four years before he died on August 28, A.D. 430, Aurelius Augustine handed over the administrative duties of the church in Hippo on the northern coast of Africa to his assistant Eraclius. Already, in his own lifetime, Augustine was a giant in the Christian world. At the ceremony, Eraclius stood to preach, as the aged Augustine sat on his bishop's throne behind him. Overwhelmed by a sense of inadequacy in Augustine's presence, Eraclius said, \\"The cricket chirps, the swan is silent.\\"The reason that Piper chose to title this series, \\"The Swans are NOT Silent\\" is because the legacy of understanding of the sovereignty of God by Augustine has been anything but silent. So, the idea behind this book of biographies is to show that the swans from Augustine to Luther to Calvin were not silent but heralded the truth of Sovereign Joy.In this book, Piper gives three biographies in Augustine, Luther and Calvin. He focuses on four topics to which he really wants to drive home in these men:1. Do not be paralyzed by your weaknesses and flawsPiper does admit that the men being studied in this book are flawed. They are not perfect. Which is good, because they are not Christ, and we, as humans, can learn from them and their understanding of working out their salvation with fear and trembling. These men, although imperfect, continued to bear fruit for the sake of the glory of God.2. In the battle against sin and surrender, learn the secret of sovereign joyThis was shown most clearly in the life of Augustine. Although he went from complete paganism and the love of women, to believing in complete heresy, God brought him through this to his side for the glory of God. Augustine saw this as God's complete work of salvation through him, which if it weren't for God, Augustine would have never come to God on his own.3. Supernatural change comes from seeing Christ in his sacred wordLuther was the found in the light of this thesis statement. Luther focused in on the sacred study of the word of God. He saw that this is where Christ was to be found through the Holy Spirit, prayer and meditation. He made sure that people, especially those caught in the bounds of Catholicism, realized that our only hope is found in the Word of God and not in the knowledge and tradition of men.4. Therefore, let us exult over the exposition of the truth of the gospel and herald the glory of Christ for the joy of all peoples.Piper shows this in the life of John Calvin. When Calvin found Christ in the Scriptures and was caught up in Reformation doctrine, he did what he only knew he should do: Preach. John Calvin's life was known for his preaching. Preaching for John Calvin was faithful, verse by verse, exposition of the word of God. Here he found that through this preaching the exaltation and glory of Christ was found and given for us all to enjoy. So much so that when he was preaching in Geneva, he was banished by the city council. When he was allowed to return three years later, he picked up the exposition in the next verse. John Calvin firmly believed in the preaching of the word of God.This small book was a great quick intro to the lives of these men. By no means it is exhaustive, but that wasn't its intent. I would recommend this to anyone who either wants a quick refresher or for those who know very little about these men. You will notice that the overall these in these pages is the Sovereign Joy of our God. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"Incredible. This is the first book of a series of four that Piper wrote to expose this generation to some of the great saints of the past. I started by reading book three, moved to book four, just completed the first and am looking forward to diving into the second book to finish the series. This book was very powerful, enlightening and challenging. As a Reformed believer, I've grown up with a tremendous appreciation of Luther and Calvin, but knew little about the incredible influence of Augustine. As I've matured in my walk and the more I read, the more I see the fruits of Augustine's thoughts in the works of so many great thinkers and writers that followed. Piper's expose on Augustine gave me an even greater appreciation for God's sovereign grace in the life of Augustine and for how God used him like the source lake from which mighty rivers of knowledge and grace have flowed down throughout history.I think what I enjoyed most about the book is the concept that the central theme that connected these three men was their love for God's Word - they digested it daily, they wrestled with it, they sought to squeeze out every truth that could be known about God Himself from His divine and inspired Word. Their lives were devoted to the study of Scripture and to the accurate and passionate teaching of God's Word to the people. While each lived in tumultuous times, it was amazing to read about how diligent they were with their time and how much they accomplished without any of the modern conveniences that we enjoy today.I would highly recommend this book and the entire series to all followers of Christ to gain an even greater appreciation for God and how He has used ordinary men throughout history to accomplish extraordinary things. The books are easy to read and relatively short, but are packed with great encouragement for every believer."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"Love the this third book of the trilogy on Joy.

Very good."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"This book by John Piper was first published in 2000. It provides brief biographies of three of God's most influential Saints. Piper weaves a connection of God's triumphant grace in the lives of Augustine of Hippo, John Calvin and Martin Luther.This four part book opens with a chapter that discusses the pure grace demonstrated by God in the use of three greatly flawed men for His glory. The next three sections are each brief biographies of Augustine, Luther and Calvin respectively.Each of these brief biographies is nowhere close to exhaustive, nor are they intended to be. Still, they provide a great treat to have discussions of arguably three of the most influential men in the history of Christendom. The focus of these biographies is on the admiration or accomplishments of these men. The biographies concern how these enormous men greatly impacted the kingdom in spite of their major flaws and sinful lives.Everyone loves to root for an underdog. We love to watch as the flawed, less then perfect competitor triumphs for the victory that nobody anticipated. How refreshing to read that God received so much glory from such flawed and sinful individuals. If God can use such sinners to accomplish so much, maybe He can use me.Piper, always a fluid writer, does a superb job at outlining deep scriptural truths in a way that is digestible to the average reader. Piper helps the reader understand who these men really were, and how glorious God is by achieving so much through flawed vessels."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"Excellent summary on the three men who pulled the truths of reformed theology from our Bible, explained it, defended it and gave it an enduring foundation.Book arrived new, fast delivery, good price. Recommend this Seller."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Sovereign Joy: God's Triumphant Grace in the Lives of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin","review":"John Piper's biographies are written with a pastor's eye and so are more than just the story of a famous individual. Rather, they focus on how the person ticked, and how they lived for Jesus. This book looks at 3 great men in the history of the Church, and even though each man had serious flaws, Piper points out the evidences of God's grace and how these men were used so mightily for God.It would be hard to pick three more trans-formative individuals in church history than the three Piper surveys in this book. He focuses on the pastoral heart and preaching of John Calvin. He looks at Augustine's dramatic conversion from the bondage of sin. And with Luther, he focuses on his study and work as a scholar. The thread that binds the lives of these men is the power of joy in their lives. Or you could say the presence of sovereign joy in their personal lives and ministries.This short book offers an excellent introduction to the life and legacy of each of these towering figures from church history. But it offers much more. Piper knows just how to peel back the curtain, as it were, and show us how these men tick. He finds their heart for Christ and aims to encourage us all to follow in their footsteps."},{"Title":"Down and Out, on the Road: The Homeless in American History","review":"Dr. Kenneth L. Kusmer teaches history at Temple University, and his scholarly background is very evident in this carefully researched work on the history of homelessness in the U.S. Though there have been examples of 19th- and 20th-century tramps romantically eschewing the world of work (Sherwood Anderson, James Michener, Louis L'Amour, et al.), over the past almost 150 years since the Civil War, most of the homeless did not voluntarily seek out their condition. There have been many waves of economic recession and depression, layoffs and industrial accidents which have predictably swelled the ranks of the homeless across many generations. Dr. Kusmer's book does an outstanding job of describing the different constituencies of the homeless in the U.S. over the years, up to and including the present day, where about a third are now women, half are people of color and many are children.This book is well-documented enough to please the most exacting scholar, but so clearly written as to be very accessible to interested lay persons. There is not a huge body of literature on hoboes, and this book will greatly enhance what is currently out there. It helps to explain how our country which, though it doesn't (presumably) put a ceiling on potential economic and social growth of any given individual, consistently fails to put a floor beneath all its citizens."},{"Title":"Down and Out, on the Road: The Homeless in American History","review":"This book really opened my eyes to some common misconceptions about tramps and vagrants in American history. I found it to be erudite yet accessible. It is that rare example of a highly scholarly historical study that is as compelling as the latest mass market page turner.I would suggest that Down &amp; Out, On the Road is a must-read for anyone who wishes to understand a fascinating, yet overlooked, piece of American social history.I congratulate Dr. Kenneth Kusmer on this fine work. Add it to your library as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Down and Out, on the Road: The Homeless in American History","review":"This is by far the best and most definitive (and perhaps the only) account of homelessness from a sociological/historical perspective. No drama here, no political agenda, no sensationalism. It is a very matter of fact documentation of the rise of homelessness in this country.It begins simply enough with defining homelessness. Originally those we call homeless today were seen as social outcasts, called vagrants, beggars, bums, vagrants or tramps. Dr. Kusmer traces the origins of these words, something we often take for granted. The use of the word 'homeless' in the public vocabulary did not reach general use until the 1980s.The overarching theme is that these are people and as such deserve respect no matter what they're situation. Even though it is a historical account there are many personal accounts noted and one gets a good feel for the humanity presented in this book.As folks living in this situation, for whatever the reason and whatever the definition given, waxed and waned over time, so too did the perception of the public toward them. Factors such as wars affected this population, so too factors such as economic downturns and the rise of the train. Stereotypes are dispelled and this complex and diverse topic is laid out in a well-written style not overloaded with technical jargon.The documentation on this book is a feast. I have literally spent hours following up on many of his footnotes, especially the accounts in the New York Times from the late 1800s. Fascinating stuff grounded in history. He has a grasp of his material and gives such a broad, though thorough, sweep of the issue that it will become the seminal resource for footnotes in years to come."},{"Title":"Down and Out, on the Road: The Homeless in American History","review":"Is the open society no more than a brief era of open spaces? West of the Mississipi a man without a society can and always has survived handily in the interstices of the system,freely availing himself of the services of major railroads, there to wander the open spaces of a civil arrangement in which he was never included. One of the strange subworlds of the Great American Economy has been the realm of that curious gremlin of the reserve army of the unemployed, the hobo and rider of the rails. If you pass by a freight yard, and wait long enough, you will see the phenomenon, briefly, as departure and arrival is not announced, and the passengers will appear from out of the bushes. Much of this is tacitly condoned due to the need for cheap labor in the agricultural circuit, from Arizona to Washington, and the lines are almost the official transportation for the labor force at some times of the year.This work is a charming, and well documented, account of the whole history, not only of the hobo, but of the homeless in American history, and also gives an interesting chronicle of the skidrow world as it flourished and then passed away after the second world war. If you are ever unemployed, don't panic. Get west of the Mississipi, find a railroad yard,and wait. People will appear who can explain the ropes. May or may not be an open society. But there are still a lot of open spaces."},{"Title":"Successful Web Portals in Retail Banking","review":"I am a banker by profession and also a postgraduate research student for the MSc in Internet Banking. I have read several books and articles on this subject and I would recommend, this book if you want a concise coverage in the area of Internet Banking. The book is unique in the sense that it is the only book I know which covers the use of Portal model in online banking. The book is based on the authors' analysis of 1,753 banks in the US and dicusses areas of Internet Banking which I have not seen elsewhere. For example, chapter 14 of the book discuss exclusively on reasons why a successful bank web site must be entertaining.In addition, the book is geared towards designing customer effective online banking portals and I would recommend it to banks that are planning to enter into Internet Banking.However, the major draw back of this book is there is no biographies! I just cannot understand how the authors could have completely forgotten this important area especially as they are all professors. Hence, a student planning to do research or expand his knowledge will be disappointed with the book.

In today's commercialized Christmas, in which it is painful for a Christian to even call this season \\"CHRISTmas\\", this is a refreshing change even to contemporary Christianity's shallow \\"real Christmas\\". Hoeksema, in a beautiful devotional style, offers deeply biblical and Reformed thoughts about Christ's birth and the place of this event in redemptive history. Unlike Evangelicalism's Christ who is mostly divorced from the Old Testament, Hoeksema shows, in moving words, that all the faithful women of Israel longed for the promised Seed, and looked for Him in hope of eternal life, which belief was counted to them for righteousness.This book is highly recommended to ever lover of Scripture, and is of course especially appropriate for devotional reading during December. Reading it will stir believers up to a holy joy and wonder and awe over the birth and incarnation of Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Inside My Head","review":"Death row intimate, Reginal S.

She becomes addicted to drinking, and almost dies from it. Her mom, Bianca, finds out and wants Morgan to get back on track with her life. She sends Morgan to go live with her friend in Fort Wayne, Indiana for a year and go to an actual high school there. Morgan is devastated. What will she do in such a lousy place like Fort Wayne? She knows it's for the best, but Morgan still thinks her mom sent her away so she wouldn't have to deal with Morgan herself. But after Morgan gets there, she finds that Fort Wayne isn't as bad as she thought it would be. So no one will realize she is actually Morgan Carter, Hollywood starlet, she dyes her hair, wears fake glasses, and calls herself Claudia Miller. Yeah, school isn't that fun, but she kind of likes staying with her mom's friend, Trudy, who is the closest thing to a motherly figure that she's ever had in her life. She finds a friend after a couple of weeks of school, and also finds out that someone might even think she's cute. But then things start going downhill again. Her grades are slipping, she's been skipping school, and there have been more reporters than usual around town. Did someone actually know where she was? After all the secrets, will she be found out?\\"True Confessions of a Hollywood Starlet\\" by Lola Douglas, was a great read!! I could not put it down. Morgan told her story through journal entries, and she told it very well. I found myself laughing at her various experiences and firsts as she tried to play the part of an average American girl. I found myself overwrought with sadness and sympathy for \\"Claudia\\" with all the secrets she had to keep, and all of her thoughts she had that she didn't belong anywhere.

She has grown up among the rich and famous and can party with the best of them. Or the worst, as the case may be. When too much partying leads her to six months in rehab and endangers her career, Morgan's manager comes up with a plan that she likes to refer to as the \\"Witless Protection Program.\\"For a year, Morgan will call herself Claudia Miller, dress herself in Gap jeans and Target t-shirts, and live as a painfully average high school student in Fort Wayne, Indiana. No more Marc Jacobs clothing. No cell phone. NA meetings instead of parties. She'll attend classes with teachers who give her D's. She'll suffer through gym class volleyball. She'll have to make new friends, which definitely is not as easy as Hollywood makes it look.Oddly enough, she kind of likes it.Amid high-fat food and snow in October is a boy Morgan can trust, if she'll let herself. He is a class leader with a secret addiction to Dance Dance Revolution, the pride of doing charity work, and a lot of Midwestern charm. In abandoning Caesar salads for Scooby snacks, Morgan is able to think about who she really is and what she wants to do for the first time in her life. But what is she going to do when the year is over?Ignore what the media says about her. Morgan is charming (even when she's obnoxious), witty, fun, and most importantly, a multifaceted person who has to overcome a lot of garbage in her life.

It doesn't lie and pretend that childhood is all great for movie stars (or anyone) and shows that no matter how bad you're situation is, you can ALWAYS survive and come out even better than before. I'd recommend this book to anyone but especially teenage girls who always wish that they can be a 'starlet' because it will make their ideas more realistic and make them appreciate what they have.

Suddenly Morgan has newly dyed brown hair, a new name (Claudia Miller), and a new attendance of Narcotics Anonymous meetings. At first she is completely underwhelmed. Her friends at school are just slightly different from Marissa, her best friend in Hollywood. None of their clothes have labels, and the clothes they do wear don't exactly emphasize their assets and hid their faults the way they should. Their idea of partying involves soda (which they call pop) and pizza, and they fill their days with school, extracurriculars, and homework. Between guidance counselor sessions at school, NA meetings, school clubs, and a series of journal entries, Morgan is able to make some new friends and confidantes, and really get into her \\"role\\" as Claudia Miller. However, there's still that tiny something holding her back: her \\"real life,\\" knowing she's going to have to return to it, and the fear of being discovered. At first Morgan seems vapid and flat, but as she spends more time in Ft. Wayne, she really mellows and becomes a likeable character. Lola Douglas' writing style is both entertaining and genuine, much like the story itself. By the end, you'll be seeing that Morgan Carter isn't so different from Claudia Miller, if only she'd give herself a chance."},{"Title":"True Confessions of a Hollywood Starlet","review":"The School Library Journal review says, \\"At times, Morgan's mind and voice seem too adult-even considering a Hollywood upbringing.\\" I disagree.True Confessions of a Hollywood Starlet deserves five stars because it is exactly what it's supposed to be - and slightly more. I'm sixteen, but I don't often find something so readable in the YA section that is supposedly for people my age. I'm tired of books by authors impersonating ditzy teens without a mature thought in their heads, and it's great to find something that focuses on stuff a girl my age will enjoy without writing at me instead of for me. Georgia Nicolson is funny - hilarious - but if she materialized in my group of friends, none of us would give her rude, pity-partying self the time of day.

Marshall Ball is no doubt one such light in our world. His healing gift is through the power of his words. In this important document of our time [A Good Kiss] Marshall Ball uses his gentle and seemingly simple use of the English language to incite a healing effect that evokes deep emotions and directly effects the heart. Short of a miracle, both of Marshall Ball's books are a collection of communications poetically expressed and clearly echo teachings from A Course in Miracles, Eckhart Tolle's Power of Now and Stillness Speaks, and the Conversations with God books, none of which have been a source of study for this young man of 17. It seems Truth is spoken again by another source of pure love, but here, with heavenly gentleness and a poetic voice that can lift and heal the coldest of hearts. I highly recommend reading and studying both \\"A Good Kiss\\" and \\"Kiss of God\\" as material for spiritual study and personal growth.

After all, the rather innocuous front cover shows part of an historic painting of a naval engagement from 1794 above which are nothing more than the book's title and author's name. Behind that, however, lies an altogether excellent product.As with all reference works which cross my desk, I began by browsing through the book, pausing whenever I saw one of the many historic black and white pictures until I found the colour section in the middle. Whilst I was pleased to see Turner's famous painting \\"The Fighting T&eacute;m&eacute;raire\\" had been included, I was absolutely stunned to see the amount of detail on the stern of the Wasa which had survived over 300 years underwater. This was the Swedish warship which, after sinking on her maiden voyage in 1628, had been preserved in deep mud until raised in 1960. It was not until I saw this picture that I was aware of the incredible extent of that preservation.In a world of publishing where the word \`encyclopaedia' is used far to frequently to describe works which are no such thing, this book is exactly as described by its title. With many, many vessels listed in strict alphabetical order, this is a first-class reference source for anyone with even a passing interest in ships. There is no bias towards any specific country as the reader moves between the ships - sometimes famous, sometimes important protatypes, sometimes just different, of different nations.Of course, no work can include every vessel which ever went to sea but, with something in excess of 7,000 significant ships and submarines included here, this product gets very close. Altogether, the more we who study ships learn, the more there is to learn and it is books like this which provide the real teaching.Whilst I am surprised at not having come across this work before today, may I suggest you grab a copy while you can because there will come a time when you are glad you did.NM"},{"Title":"Ships of the World: An Historical Encyclopedia","review":"This is an excellent, comprehensive and detailed compendium of the \\"biographies\\" of hundreds of the notable ships, boats and other water craft of many nations throughout history.

At second glance, a few holes appear. There are some historical ships missing: USS Forrestal, CV59, commissioned in the mid-1950s as the first super-carrier built specifically for jets. USS Enterprise, CVN65, the world's first nuclear carrier and, along with the Long Beach and Truxton, the first surface ship to circle the globe without refueling. On the other hand, many vessels of marginal historical import get ink. In an error of fact, USS Wahoo, a WW2 sub, was sunk by its own torpedo, not by a Japanese patrol plane, as Paine reports. All of this makes the reader what else is missing or just plain wrong. Still in all, a very good book, and very well written."},{"Title":"Ships of the World: An Historical Encyclopedia","review":"This book is a must-have item for the bookshelf of anyone interested in ships.

Concise, well-written histories that dwell on the human as well as the technical, make this a must-have for any naval or maritime history buff's shelf. Just a few quibbles. The Essex class carrier U.S.S. Franklin was probaby named after the Benjamin Franklin and not the Battle of Franklin. Every other Essex class is name after something from the Revolutionary War, so I would assume that the Franklin is too. Also, I wished Paine had included the U.S.S. Pensylvania, the 120-gun wooden warship built for the Navy that was burned at Norfolk during the Civil War. I also was surprised to see H.M.S Kelly left out.

Roberts drew on his own personal records dating from 1874, and encompassing a long life of methodical, careful observation and collection. His accounts of birding in what is now south Minneapolis are amazing: ground-nesting whip-poor-wills amid the bur oaks; hundreds of wood ducks feeding on those oaks' acorns; thousands of migrating ducks resting on the Minneapolis lakes. One of the charming features of the book is the multiple artists employed to illustrate every single bird occurring in Minnesota. All were famous at the time; the work introduced the artistry of Frances Lee Jaques to Minnesotans. Some of the information in the book is now dated, not because Roberts was wrong, but because climate change and the so-called progress of civilization has greatly affected the avifauna of Minnesota."},{"Title":"The New World of Math","review":"Written in 1959, The New World of Math, for me to read in 2011, is particularly fascinating and interesting because of how much mathematics and computers have changed since then. George Boehm mentioned these unsolved proofs in the book in need for more research, and today, many of them are already solved. More interesting is the talk of speed and cost in computers, especially data processing. Today, we just take it all for granted, and supercomputers can do all of that in nanoseconds when in 1959, it would take days for an exorbitant amount of money. Also included are very nice examples of mathematics although pretty outdated in explanation. There are books and internet pages today that address these issues better. George did a nice job of addressing the problem in mathematics education and stressing a need for betterment of the teaching. Too bad, none of them is heeded. Most important of all, George did an outstanding job of explaining what mathematics is all about and putting it into perspective for general audience. All in all, anyone picking up The New World of Math will find it very interesting and notice the rapid changes the past six decades and how mathematics have been a huge catalyst behind the greatest technology upsurge that mankind has ever seen."},{"Title":"DIS-MOI!

De Camp and Pratt were at their best when working together. Both were masters of many disciplines and keyed off each other, creating tales of wild imagination, liberally sprinkled with humor. The beauty of these stories is in the variety of persons that are caught up in them and the sheer logical progression of the ideas. Harold Shea and his friends are pure delight, if a tad naive by today's standards. These characters do what we all do in our imaginations and insert themselves into the myths and stories of history. Sure, these are reprints -- the originals were serials in pulp magazines. I own several editions and reread them every few years. The important thing is not which printing or compilation you read, but that you do read them. While I do usually disapprove of the re printing and retitling of classic fiction, anything that keeps these stories being read by new generations has my approval."},{"Title":"The Compleat Enchanter: The Magical Misadventures of Harold Shea","review":"Yes, magic works by specific laws, but not always as you expect it to, especially if you, like Harold Shea, are new to the art. Harold trying to hold his own among the Norse Gods... the prison guard with huge, huge nose... Harold's first time on a flying broom... the laughing until your sides ache and tears are running down your face.

I thought this would be dealing more with gossip in the church and how to stop it. Instead, it was an attempt to cover up guilt and wrongdoings done by scandalous snake oil salesmen. Mr. Spencer is an ex-Mormon who doesn't seem to understand the importance of being able to ask questions and criticize religious leaders when needed. But instead, Spencer thinks no one should question any leaders in mainstream fundamentalism...even people like Pat Robertson or Peter Popoff. Even Mike Warnke is portrayed as a victim of slander, even though he finally admitted he lied about leading a Satanic cult of 1500 people. Oddly enough, Warnke seems to be innocent of the charge of character assassination, although he wrote the introduction to The Todd Pehomenon...a book which exposed rival (fake) ex-Satanist, John Todd/Lance Collins. Todd/Collins isn't mentioned in the book as a victim, that's because Todd/Collins was so unstable he started naming people like Jerry Falwell, Melodyland, and all Charismatic churches as being part of a world-wide Satanic conspiracy. Spencer describes Cornerstone Magazine as an \\"Avante Garde\\" (huh?) Christian magazine, and sees them as villains since they exposed so many of his peers as fakes and frauds. Bob Larson is yet another \\"victim\\", even though he admitted he sometimes ran past shows and claimed they were live. I also imagine many of the calls were staged as well, because they certainly sounded like it. I wish I had 1/10 the budget these \\"victims\\" have to run my ministry. All we have to do is look back at history to see what happens when religious leaders go unchallenged and unquestioned...just imagine the Roman Catholic Church during the Middle Ages. People should always question religious leaders, especially TV Evangelists. One person who wasn't mentioned in the book, even though he fought a David and Goliath battle with the FCC, was the late Dr. Gene Scott. Scott, who had a PhD from Stanford University and was a controversial figure who sneered at the hypocrisy of other TV preachers, even though he was no Boy Scout himself...and freely admitted it. So by omitting less than perfect people like Gene Scott and taking up for fakes like Mike Warnke but not Todd/Collins, the message is clear; Make sure you're one of us. Spencer is doing character assassination of his own by omission. I paid 25 cents for this book in a used bookstore, so at least I'm not out much."},{"Title":"Heresy Hunters: Character Assassination in the Church","review":"One is left with the feeling that whilst in principle it is right to judge doctrine, even publicly, in practice there are not many ways of doing this without offending someone of James' sensibility. He feels that certain teachers have been unfairly criticised for their 'little gods' doctrine, yet the only evidence he offers for this is a very shallow comparison with the patristic doctrine of divinisation. He fails to reasonably demonstrate, with evidence, exactly what is wrong with the critiques that have been levelled at this teaching. One cannot help but feel that the author's run-in with the Tanners (ch. 6) is a bit of a sore spot which, because of the personal and sensitive issues involved, Spencer would have been wiser to have left alone. Having said that, there are helpful points which need to be heard by the 'heresy hunters', and they are very serious points to do with integrity and honesty. It is just unfortunate that the tone of the book seems to pander to those whose teachings raise the most concerns (hence the book's popularity at TBN) and comes across as a defence of Word-Faith etc. an approach which will only alienate those who need to hear some of its warnings."},{"Title":"Heresy Hunters: Character Assassination in the Church","review":"This is an excellent book that exposes many of the lies out there today bout certain Word-Faith teachers. While not excusing some of the bad things a few of them have done, Spencer approaches the subject with an honest and open heart. He shows how they've been misrepresented by people such as Hank Hanegraaf and John MacArthur who aren't concerned with Christian unity, but instead are concerned with ripping fellow Christian brethren apart. He exposes their lies when using peoples' quotes of of context and their blatant and ruthless attacks to misrepresent and do nothing more."},{"Title":"Heresy Hunters: Character Assassination in the Church","review":"Amazing the lies that can be spread via the internet when someone exposes those who are attacking the ministers of the church. I believed the reports about this book until I actually read it for myself. Mr. Spencer exposes the tactics many so called apoligists use to destroy legitmate ministries such as the Word of Faith preachers.Mr. Spencer does not defend the sins of Warnke, Tilton or Larson. He simply addresses the ungodly tactics used by so called Christians to destroy these ministers rather than restoring them in a spirit of meekness as the Bible calls for (Gal. 6:1). I for one am glad he wrote the book.Heresy Hunters are crying &quot;injustice&quot; when they are the ones doing the injustice by attacking the brethren with no real research, denominational prejudice, and out of context quotes. Expose them for their tactics and many of them will come after you as they did to this man. It's a shame how low we have stooped in the Body of Christ. These things should not be.I recommend buying this book as well his other book &quot;Bleeding Heart and Propaganda: The Fall Of Reason In The Church. Also buy &quot;E.W. Kenyon: The True Story&quot; by Joe McIntyre and see how the things Kenyon has been accused of are untrue. Finally, also purchase &quot;Christianity In Power&quot; by Michael Bruno"},{"Title":"Heresy Hunters: Character Assassination in the Church","review":"To say the least, I was pleased to find this book. I for one am grieved daily to hear the bashing of ligitimate ministries by the heresy hunters over the airwaves. Only eternity will tell how many unbelivers they send running from Christianity with misinformation and outright lies. Not understanding the workings of the Holy Spirit, they arrogantly cricize and codemn anything which they have not experienced themselves. Mr. Spencer reveals their error in a balanced, factual and loving manner. In his dealings with the Tanners, it is obvious he showed restraint and self-control. His purpose is clearly not to condone the errors of any minister or ministry but to call for correction to be done truthfully and within the Body of Christ."},{"Title":"Heresy Hunters: Character Assassination in the Church","review":"I read this book when it first came out and it opened my eyes and broke my heart. Opened my eyes to the bitter betrayal of brother against brother, and broke my heart for the sake of our Savior, who died for us all and asked -- no, commanded -- only one thing from us: &quot;Love one another, as I have loved you.&quot; Instead of hunting heresy, we should be bonding in unity on that which we can agree .. GENTLY REBUKING one another on those things on which we believe that cannot be Scripturally defended. Just as we are to love the sinner, but hate the sin, in the same way we are to love the brethren without wrath or dissention (1 Tim 2:8). Who is the accuser of the brethren? Satan. Who does the work of Satan on this earth? The brethren who accuse other brethren. Does Jesus need our help to &quot;root out and pluck up&quot; the tares? No; He has expressly forbidden it, lest the tares be plucked up with the wheat. Our Lord is AMPLY ABLE to judge His own house and His own servants -- He does not need us to do so. Indeed, we are warned against &quot;judging another's servants&quot; are we not? I encourage anyone who has been hurt by believing accusations leveled by the &quot;heresy hunters&quot; against the brethren to read this book, then to put it behind them and then go forward in their Christian walk by observing the Eleventh Commandment as our Lord has bid us to do -- &quot;Love one another.&quot;"},{"Title":"Heresy Hunters: Character Assassination in the Church","review":"In this often-tiresome made-for-TBN tome, Spencer denounced so-called Christian &quot;heresy hunters&quot; for publicly criticizing other Christians without ever bothering to talk with them ... and then proceeded to publicly criticize them without ever bothering to talk with them. Go figure.Spencer attempts the impossible -- or at least the impossibly stupid -- in defending pseudo-Christian con-men like Robert Tilton, Bob Larson, and Mike Warnke. And the specifics of his defense are in many respects comical. God forbid that anyone in the secular community should, for example, see the incriminating details of Larson's 1991 divorce.Like Warnke and Larson, Spencer has been caught in an attempt to overstate his personal credentials, fraudulently palming himself off as a &quot;former AP journalist&quot; when his only experience there was a three-month internship writing copy."},{"Title":"Heresy Hunters: Character Assassination in the Church","review":"James Spencer is an ex-Mormon who ought to understand a thing or two about heresy and the importance of TRUE Christian doctrine. If Mormonism is NOT a heresy, Spencer had no reason to convert from his former position.It is this fact that saddens me in his counter-attack upon anybody and everybody who is not a Word of Faith Christian. Spencer's experiential Christianity is every bit as bad as his previous experience with Mormonism.I want to keep it clean, but Spencer's book is typically spineless. He has NO problem lambasting the ministry of John MacArthur (whose cessationism Spencer despises; Spencer devoted an entire chapter to MacArthur), but he doesn't want teachers who are DEMONSTRABLY lying (like Paul Crouch, Mike Warnke, and Benny Hinn) to be called to account for their lies.Heresy hunting is a new inflammatory term that was invented to dismiss any honest inquiry. Spencer defends this position immaculately, but his entire book misses the point. Paul Crouch, who wrote the foreward, states that &quot;one theologian's heresy is another theologian's orthodoxy.&quot; He further claims that contending for the faith (mentioned in Jude 3) refers to Christ, the virgin birth, crucifixion, resurrection, forgiveness by cleansing blood, and future judgment are the only &quot;essentials.&quot; Crouch concludes by writing, &quot;beyond these absolute essentials...there is infinite room for honest men and women to disagree...&quot; Thus, according to Paul Crouch - who, again, wrote the foreward - the authority and infallibility of Scripture, the Trinity, salvation by grace ALONE are NOT essential to saving faith. It is for this reason that both Crouch and his hired defender, Spencer, completely miss the mark.I will agree that critics of some Faith teachers have overstated their case (Hanegraaff in particular). However, Spencer uses the overstatement as a carte blanche for those who are teaching heresy to demonize people like Hanegraaff and Mac Arthur. He excuses retaliatory remarks made by Crouch and Hinn while condemning &quot;heresy hunters.&quot;If only James Spencer was as concerned about doctrinal purity and truth - i.e. &quot;the faith&quot; of Jude 3 - as he is about a straw man called heresy hunting, he might have written an interesting book. Sadly, his only means of defense is to demonize the demonizers. You would be much better off saving money or buying a fair and balanced book, &quot;The Word-Faith Controversy&quot; by now fired Hanegraaff employee, Dr. Robert Bowman."},{"Title":"See Jane Hit: Why Girls Are Growing More Violent and What We Can Do AboutIt","review":"Dr. Garbarino's book is indeed \\"shocking\\" and \\"scary\\"--not about girls, but about the continuing decline in scholarship regarding young people. The entire factual basis for this book is open to serious question.Dr. Garbarino rests his case on the claim that girls' violence has increased steadily and sharply in recent years, especially the last decade. Yet, virtually all of his sources for this alarming claim consist of secondhand citations; Garbarino shows no evidence of having looked at original data.A \\"footnote mill\\" has developed on youth issues, in which alarmist authors such as Garbarino cite other alarmist authors as their sources, who in turn cite him and each other, creating a round-robin of panicky myths with no basis in the factual references they pretend to be based on. At best, these misleading statistics cover only decade-old time periods (selected to make a few upward trends of the past appear to still be going on, while failing to note recent, sustained declines); in other cases, they're simply phony.As a result, this book is a compendium of outdated, recycled myths about girls, some concocted by unreliable interests and all of them seriously outdated. Examples:Garbarino: 25 years ago, the ratio of boys' to girls' aggravated assault arrest rates was 10-1, now it is 4-1, according to \\"official arrest data\\" (p. 4).Someone apparently made this up. In 1975, FBI Uniform Crime Reports (Table 35) shows 5 boys arrested for aggravated assault for every girl, not 10.Garbarino: From 1990-99, girls' rates of aggravated assault rose by 57%, while boys' rates fell 5%.Very misleading. Why are 1999 figures being cited in a book published in 2006? The FBI UCR (Table 40) shows girls assault arrests rose from 1990 to 1995 and have since FALLEN FOR NINE STRAIGHT YEARS. By 2004, girls' assault rates were 30% LOWER than a decade ago.Garbarino: There has been a \\"seven-fold increase in per-capita aggravated assault rates among youths in the United States from 1956 to 1996\\" (p. 184).Garbarino cites an unreliable website for this silly claim. The FBI's 1956 crime report covered just ONE-FIFTH of the country and relied on fingerprint records (most juveniles weren't fingerprinted then). The best source, the Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS, which includes crimes not reported to police), shows aggravated assault has plummeted among all age groups and both sexes, reaching its lowest level in 2004 than at any time since the survey first began in 1973.Garbarino: 7% of girls get into fights at school (p. 9).Nothing new about that. The same source (Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance) shows 9% of girls got into a fight at school in its first survey in 1993. Monitoring the Future shows the percentage of girls getting into fights hasn't changed much in at least 25 years.Garbarino: The 1990s brought a \\"growing mental health crisis in middle-class boys, coupled with the onslaught of violent images present in popular culture (TV, video games, movies, and music)\\" (p 14).Another absolutely baffling claim, contradicting Garbarino's own earlier statement that boys' violence is falling. During the 1990s, as all forms of violent popular culture proliferated, boys' violence rates PLUMMETED as never before--especially among middle-class youth.From the early 1990s to 2004, both the FBI and NCVS show boys (and girls) suffering and perpetrating dramatically less violence. Boys' rates of assault dropped 45%; girls' fell 32%. Murder, rape, and robbery among both boys and girls plunged by 60% to 70%, falling to their lowest levels in three to four decades. The NCVS shows assaults and other violence against teenaged boys and girls fell by an astonishing 60% over the last decade. Monitoring the Future, the leading survey of high school behaviors, shows violence by and against youth of both sexes, from fights to homicide, declined sharply.National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) figures show murders and hospital emergency treatments for violence fell sharply among youth. Instead of examining what the best references actually show, Garbarino cites emotional anecdotes (which could be found in any era or applied to any group in society) and outdated, secondhand sources.Garbarino: \\"Now, girls are getting more physical when they are assaulting themselves, cutting and stabbing, poisoning and shooting themselves, in record numbers\\" (p. 9).How does he know? Records of self-inflicted (suicidal) injuries are not available for past decades. Girls' deaths from drug overdoses, other poisonings, gunshots, cutting instruments, and suicides and possible suicides are much lower today than in the 1970s, \`80s, or \`90s. California posts hospital ER cases on self-inflicted injuries, whose rates among girls have dropped 10% to 15% since 1991, while Center for Health Statistics figures show girls' suicide rates have fallen by more than 50% (yes, you read that right) and are now at historical low levels.Garbarino: \\"fewer than 3,000 kids kill themselves each year,\\" and more kill themselves than others (p 180).The first half is true, sort of. NCHS reports 918 youths (under age 18) committed suicide in 2003, 203 of them girls. Quite a bit \\"fewer than 3,000.\\" The second half is not true. More than 1,100 were arrested for homicide. Garbarino is recycling made-up rumors. Why didn't he check primary vital statistics data?Garbarino: Note the \\"near absence of girls in accounts of killers in the past.\\"He must mean other than Caril Anne Fugate (14 year-old serial killer, 1959), Mary Bell (child killer, 1968), Brenda Jean Spencer (shot up elementary school, 1979), the Manson Family girls (1969-70), the murderous girls cited in a raft of official documentaries and books in the 1940s and \`50s, on and on. In EVERY era, adults say that youth, especially girls, are getting more violent and hypersexual. In fact, FBI and health statistics show the murder rate by girls nationally is now at its lowest ebb since 1975; in California, the lowest level ever reliably recorded.There are so many misstatements of basic fact in this book (and in most alarmist books on youth) that a book could be written to refute them. Compounding Garbarino's mistaken reliance on outdated data from the mid-1990s, and his failure to note that violence and other problems among girls plunged sharply since then, is his prediction, in the last chapter, that girls' violence will increase even more in the future.Ironically, while teenage girls and young women show declines in violence over the last 10 to 15 years, older women show large increases. The FBI reports violent crime rates by women ages 30 to 59--the parents of teen girls--leaped by 50% since the early 1990s and have nearly tripled over the last quarter century (all figures here are rates that account for population changes). In fact, teen girls show the LOWEST rates of violence increase (or an actual decline) over the last 10 to 30 years of any female age group, no matter what time period is chosen. The best evidence indicates that much of the rise in arrests of females of all ages for assault results from new laws mandating tougher policing of domestic violence, not real increases in violent behavior.Dr. Garbarino's book perpetuates a deeply troubling academic ethics crisis in depicting American youth. Garbarino and his colleagues who have made equally inflammatory statements about \\"girls' violence\\" surely must be familiar with the easily available facts from standard references that I'm stating here, yet they fail even to mention them. Predictably, without even rudimentary fact-checking, \\"experts\\" and media reporters quickly praise every book (note the reviews here) that claims youth are getting worse.Finally, I agree with Dr. Garbarino that there are many consumerist, exploitative, even \\"toxic,\\" elements in American popular culture. However, this does not license scholars and culture critics to buttress their criticisms by exploiting young people as handy metaphors for social decline. Branding girls, even \\"sympathetically,\\" as more violent and unhealthy exposes them to harsh stigmas, misdirected treatments, and more punitive policies. In reality, girls are doing remarkably well in their welcome transition to more active roles in society. They don't deserve the unwarranted fear campaigns this book and many others create.Mike Males, Sociology Department, University of California,Santa Cruz mmales@earthlink.net"},{"Title":"See Jane Hit: Why Girls Are Growing More Violent and What We Can Do AboutIt","review":"As I read the reviews of others for See Jane Hit, I noticed that the reviewers came from either the academic side of the fence or the \\"in the field\\" side of the fence. I would like to offer a perspective from both sides in the hope that we can look at Garbarino's work from a more balanced perspective. Having taught graduate counseling courses since the 1970's and being a contemporary of Dr. Garbarino, I can tell you that his research skills and body of work in the field of adolescent psychology is highly respected by academia. Both Lost Boys and See Jane Hit are considered classics in the field. I had training with Dr. Garbarino in 2008, and can say that he has consistently updated the statistics that continue to show a marked increase in violence among girls.Also, having worked in K-12 public education for over 30 years (and for the last ten in a program for at-risk adolescents), I can attest to the fact that violence among girls is increasing just as Dr. Garbarino warned. But, past the \\"warnings,\\" go to the suggestions regarding \\"what we can do about it\\" and read carefully how he outlines the positives.

Police generally are required to make an arrest in situations of domestic violence. So when teens get violent against their parents and the police are called, the arrest rate goes up. There is no reason for this book with its false claims to have been published.

As someone who works with teens, as an author and ministry worker and speaker to teens, I'm not worried about the statistics near as much as what I see happening in the lives of some of our girls. There is more violence among girls. Our younger girls are losing their innocence, many are accepting less than any other generation in terms of relationships, and many are angry.I love working with teens. This is an amazing generation. They are intelligent. They are able to do more than their mothers and grandmothers, but the reality is that a growing segment of young girls are reacting with violence, and this book offers some insight.

Absolutely not, but neither do I, but it asks some great questions and offers some interesting information that should trigger conversations among those who care about our girls."},{"Title":"See Jane Hit: Why Girls Are Growing More Violent and What We Can Do AboutIt","review":"I completely disagree with the previous reviewer who slams this book (and others with similar concerns about today's youth) in such a tunnel vision manner. This book is an important social commentary for any parent to read, and for any adult to ponder.Any parent who has had the challenge of raising a girl in today's violence-filled society, knows the real story. The complete real story may be too big to fit into one book, but THIS book is about an issue that is very close to parents' hearts. And it should be.Is it alarmist to be concerned about today's girls when it comes to the impact of violence in their lives?

They are much harder to break up, and it is much harder to keep the same girls from fighting again because girls are more apt to fight in retaliation for past 'offenses' and slights. QUite simply, girls just DO NOT give up.Liberal and feminist academics, most of whom do not live in ghettos or lower class neighborhoods (and who are henceforth not very concerned with violence among female minorities), will do absolutely anything they can to convince the public that violence among girls is not a problem, and that, of course, boys are the real culprits. If these people do happen to admit their is a problem, their solution is rationalization, \\"Yeah buts,\\" and more social coddling.Of course, the real liberal and femminazi goal is to continue to vilify boys and maleness in general and ignore that anything bad is happening in the world of girldom.Think back to grade school and high school. Remember the evil cliques, the back-stabbing, the rumor-spreading, all the nasty, covert aggression that girls partook in? Have you ever wondered why women have a hard time bonding with one another in adulthood? It's not because they were so nice to one another in girlhood.Think about it: How many boys wind up in the hospital for bulemia? How many boys pick on other boys and socially isolate them because they're not wearing the latest Tiffany's charm bracelet?

Growing up Christian, I felt some loss that we had discarded these remembrances of God from our daily life.

But it is especially useful to the Jew who either a)doesn't understand the role Jews played in History, or b)the Jew that has specific questions about the religion that were never really answered fully by any other book. This book answers questions regarding the many Jewish holidays, why we don't believe that Jesus is the son of G-d, why do bad things happen to good people (was G-d really there for us during the Holocaust?), and definitions and meanings of hundreds of Jewish items and customs that many of us use and follow, but never really understood the deeper meaning behind them.

From freeing oneself of slave mentality (&quot;I can't do this&quot;, etc.), to learning how to take advantage of investment options, to coping with bull and bear stock markets, health insurance, credit cards, and a great deal more, The New Underground Railroad offers solid financial and living advice in direct, easy-to-understand terms expressly for Black Americans, but would prove to be invaluable for readers of all backgrounds struggling to improve their financial circumstances. The New Underground Railroad is highly recommended reading, especially as a primer for the novice in a complicated world of finance and confronted with the conundrum of earning a decent living."},{"Title":"The New Underground Railroad","review":"According to author Robert Henderson, Jr. \\"A lack of economic power and lack of control of our economic future has further fueled the lack of awareness of what's going on in African-American communities.\\" Moreover, he intones this caveat, \\"We're no more than \`Modern day slaves' riding the new underground railroad\\". These are profound statements that beg for an explanation, but in his new book The New Underground Railroad Mr. Henderson gives a rather unique analogy to convey the concept that \\"the more things change, the more they stay the same.\\" What then, is the new Underground Railroad? How does it apply to Black folk, and most importantly, what comparisons does it has to the old underground railroad. I found this to be quite interesting if not intriguing to me relative to how he drew parallel to old slave mentality vs. the so-called new slave mentality. Albeit, if readers can get past the many tired clich&eacute;s and annoying inferences to an old slave to that of the current state of \`forced labor' that permeates our existence, perhaps the author's point of view could be better understood. With such a title, I'd imagine that the purpose intended indeed was to support why one slave is superior or inferior to the other.Lauded as a beginner's guide to understanding investing, it indeed is elementary in giving posits of truths as it pertain to some of the rudimentary terms and policies that govern the usage of stocks, bonds, and ordinary investment prerogatives. After reading all of the chapters I felt that perhaps more information could have been supplied to give this book more oomph. As such, even beginners should be privy with as much information to insure that they are on the right (railroad) track. Many working Americans are only one or two paychecks away from poverty as Mr. Henderson opines. According to which history book you read supposedly in 1865 Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves from physical bondage with a stroke of the pen. Today, as it is implied in the book, the NEW slave is in economic bondage, and cannot be released by the government. The NEW slave may have a nice house, sports car and a high salary, but he is STILL a slave because he is dependent on his job for his sole economic welfare. He is content with his current uncertain financial status of possible layoffs, down sizing, termination, and corporate reorganization, etc. The NEW slaves can only be freed with financial knowledge. Now comes this author who brings out some interesting facts to illustrate his points.The New Underground Railroad offers solid financial and living advice in direct, easy-to-understand terms expressly for those who may be looking for a better understanding of financial security. I found it to be rudimentary in the sense that anyone on any level can understand it. It's a good read despite the author's penchant for giving parallels to historic insight for not being a prime candidate for a slave to the system. In the present, he empowers individuals to step away from the slave-master mentality and be energized with the essentials of the 21st Century. One way of doing this is to have a winning attitude, think positive, and to stay focused. Certainly nothing that hasn't been harkened to us before, this author proceeds to say that faith and positive thinking does not work alone with one taking the necessary initiatives to stay tracked. repetitive but in view of the fact that it reads like good news that we slaves (people) need, so be it. I remember another author implying that to stay ahead one must \\"think and grow rich\\". This book is along the same mindset. I recommend that you read it to track your destination for a good start!"},{"Title":"The New Underground Railroad","review":"\\"The New Underground Railroad is about freeing people who need to be economically enlightened, as the author puts it.\\" Henderson built his own financial group on the declaration of Harriet Tubman; \\"Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death.\\" By the time you have read the last page of The New Underground Railroad, you too will declare the same.In the present, he empowers individuals to step away from the slave-master mentality and be energized with the essentials of the 21st Century. One way of doing this is to have a winning attitude, think positive, nothing we have not heard before right? Well this author proceeds to say that faith and positive thinking does not work alone, you need to take action. Gain control of your life, gain ownership of some real estate. The modern slave is of no race, creed or color.Robert Henderson, Jr. exercises the use of cliches and scripture lessons to expound on his point. Sometimes it is repetitive but in view of the fact that it reads like good news that we slaves (people) need, so be it. I believe the one message Henderson wanted us to walk away with is this, we as slaves need to begin taking advantage of America and all of its riches. Think and dream bigger than you ever have before then put those visions into motions.MissyAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"The New Underground Railroad","review":"Do not pick up this book to be entertained, it should do more thanthat, it should enlighten, empower and educate anyone who wants tobreak the chains of Economic Bondage.It is written by a young man who was so stirred by Harriet Tubman,that he wanted to empower individuals to step outside of theslave-master mentality and adapt to the elements of the 21st century.Because poverty has no color or limitations, it just exists.The New Underground Railroad is about freeing people who need to beeconomically enlightened.

The essays I've read to date are well-written, accurate, and on point. And as with any work of this magnitude, mistakes were made and left unedited. The mistakes range from minor typos to a few major mistakes [the chart of leptons on page 372 lists the 3 types of neutrinos as having POSITIVE charges]. The Nature Of Science is a case of excellent intent, but less than perfect execution. My hope is that the publisher is serious about this book becoming the indispensable reference that it could be and quickly edits the problems out of future printings. I wanted to give this book a 5 and out of frustration was leaning towards a 3, so I split the difference and gave it 4-stars."},{"Title":"The nature of science: An A-Z guide to the laws and principles governing our universe","review":"I typically dismiss survey books as being too superficial but I ended up buying this one. While Trefil's book does not cover anything in great depth he does cover a very wide range of interesting topics (in alphabetical order). For example, he offers a concise 2-page description of Exponential Growth, complete with a few simple equations, graphs, and some nice examples from biology. A few pages later he gives an accessible description of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem. The book's topics include everything from physics' Standard Model, to Molecular Clocks, to Le Chatelier's Principle, to Predator-Prey Relationships, and he doesn't omit more mainstream topics like DNA, Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Newton's Laws, or the Periodic Table.I am reasonably well read in science but I found lots of topics I knew little or nothing about. The author kept coverage of each topic short enough (1-3 pages) that I was willing to jump in and read about topics I would typically neglect. And the author didn't dumb down any of the coverage so I was able to walk away from each topic with new and useful information.I am having a blast going through these topics, and I would strongly recommend this book to any science buff who wants to quickly broaden their knowledge of science."},{"Title":"The nature of science: An A-Z guide to the laws and principles governing our universe","review":"What a fascinating book!

The book is in actuality a miniature Encyclopedia of Scientific Thought of 464 pages, wherein a great variety of established theories and their creators are described and explained in detail. It is not a textbook but a handbook of established scientific ideas spanning Physics, Medicine, Astronomy, Mathematics, Computer Science, Optics, Biology and etc. The book contains hundreds of monographs on theories with background information of the creator of the ideas. Additionally there is a Glossary, Index, Table of Contents. For example the monograph entitled \\"Cell Theory\\" spans time from 1663 to 1995, with direct commentary on Schleiden, Schwann and Virchow. It refers you to a separate monograph entitled \\"Molecular Biology\\", which also refers you to another monograph entitled \\"Mendel's Laws\\" and on and on. It does \\"Cell Theory\\" in one straightforward page! So what this book gives you is a great variety of individual monographs and then it ties them into each other for more intensive reading and education, with time lines and biographical information. You will also find generalized/philosophical concepts such as the description of \\"Murphy's Law\\" which in part reads:\\"Of course Murphy's \\"Law\\" is not a law in the sense in which that word is used elsewhere in this book. It has not, in other words, been put through the rigorous testing required by the scientific method. Nonetheless, it is a comforting bit of folk wisdom we can all use to help us get through those times when life just doesn't want to cooperate with us.\\"This little book is amply illustrated with photographs and charts and tables. It has a 24 page Introduction and Preface and then your launched into world after world of ideas. Use this book as an educational, testing and training aid in that you can ask page by page for an explanation of the ideas denominated/titled in this book and then compare your answers and knowledge with what is written within. Kind of a super flash card challenge. If you learn all the contents or even part of it, you will have a mind able to engage in discussions and have insights into a reality that escapes many people concerned with the noise and nonsense of the day. Wouldn't it be wonderful if you walked into a room and found your children and their friends playing a game and keeping score of who can answer and explain the title of each monograph. \\" OK, your turn, what is the Chandrasekhar Limit\\"?Next Sally, what is the BCS Theory of Superconductivity? Now John, explain Kepler's Laws. Each child gets points for how close their answer is to the explanation in the book. As a parent you could walk away thinking you just saw a scene from a science fiction movie. But it would be wonderful. In any case buy this book for your children and give them an incentive to read and learn it all. Better than a video game or tv program garbage.By the way, Yes, there may be some small errata as described by other reviewers such as the chart of Leptons on page 372. But how interesting it would be if you heard your children debating such possible error and one of them said:\\"I don't think it is an error as associated with each charged Lepton is a neutral Lepton and so if the chart is thought of in that manner then it is correct. \\"You would wonder what happened to your children and walk out of the room in a daze. Make the competition interesting in that each child can total up their points and cash them in with you as the bank!! Better then the multitude of computers, television screens, movies and degradation surrounding your children. Thank you Mr. Trefil for this small, handy and interesting book .

And when I am dying how happy I'll be if my life was spent only for Thee.\\"This poem embraces this work by Gospel for Asia founder and president, K.P. Yohannan. Yohannan is a man with a burning passion to see the Church wake up and see how important it is to evangelise every nation in our generation. We in the West so often (to borrow from Leonard Ravenhill) sleep in the light while the world is dying in darkness. We alone have the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6). We alone have the only true gospel (Romans 1:16-17). We alone are the salt and light of the world (Matthew 5:13-16). And so what do we do with this good news is the question presented in this book.In our age of self-seeking, purpose-driven, flesh exalting, how we need to heed the message of Yohannan in this book. The book shows how we need to live our lives everyday in the light of eternity. Soon we will stand before the Lord in judgment (Hebrews 9:27) and our works will be revealed (1 Cor. 3:10-15). The way we spent our time, our resources, our gifts - everything will be laid before the Lord (Romans 14:11-12). We must choose now to live in the light of eternity.Everyday 144,000 souls go into eternity here on planet earth. Almost all of them will be cast into eternal fire because of their sins and their lack of salvation found only in Christ (Acts 4:12). Do we care? Do we waste our time, our prayers, our giving all for naught? Let this book show you how to truly live in the light of eternity (2 Cor. 4:16-18)."},{"Title":"Living In The Light Of Eternity","review":"K.P. Yohannan has a true heart for lost souls, and I was familiar with his ministry (Gospel for Asia) and his book \\"Revolution in World Missions\\" which described his ministry's efforts. Therefore, I knew before I read \\"Living in the Light of Eternity\\" that I would be in for a challenge, and Brother K.P. did not disappoint.Yohannan uses many illustrations from his own experiences to make his points, and this not only gives the book an easy-to-read, conversational style but also makes the examples he gives hit closer to home for the reader. I must admit that as I first began to read through the book, I began to see where I fall short in certain areas of my walk with the Lord. Then, probably in reaction (most likely a defensive reaction) to these insights, I began to question whether Brother K.P. was asserting that every Christian should be a missionary. I thought, \\"If we all become missionaries, then there will be a lot of other things that are left undone in the world,\\" and I was feeling woefully inadequate because I have not heard a calling to missions from God.After recovering my bearings somewhat, and reaching the helpful chapter titled \\"Guidelines for Living in the Light of Eternity,\\" I began to see that Yohannan was not trying to make us all into missionaries, but was truly challenging us to make the most of every opportunity that we have to make a difference in this world.As Yohannan states,\\"As a matter of fact, it may be more difficult to stay behind as a sender than to go yourself. You are not on the front lines. You are living simply, working a regular job, remaining faithful to the Lord and preserving your testimony before all your coworkers. Taking the money you earn and giving it faithfully to support a missionary in China or India or Bangladesh - someone you have never seen for whom you are also praying - is true sacrifice and living by faith. No one can dictate to you a certain standard of living or draw any kind of line, culture or no culture. Each of us must be persuaded to live before the Lord as we are led by Him.\\"In James 2:17 we are told, \\"Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself\\" (NASB). What this means is that, while faith is sufficient for salvation, our faith benefits no one but ourselves if we don't put what the Lord has taught us into action. Whether that means sharing your faith with your family, friends, neighbors, or strangers; helping others by donating time, money, and/or effort to lay ministries in church or to charitable causes; supporting missionaries and ministries; or (if called by God) entering into full-time ministry or missions, we are all called to do whatever we can do in order to further God's kingdom. If I start to get that self-satisfied (or self-righteous) feeling that I am doing a lot, then I will need to return to this book for a reminder that there is always more to be done and more that I can do. This is a challenging and, in the end, (thankfully) an encouraging book about the many ways in which people can live out their faith in the Lord and make an impact on the world and, as the title of the book indicates, on eternity."},{"Title":"Britain Uber Alles, Book One of the Uber Alles Trilogy (Uber Alles Trilogy)","review":"Dave Putnam is a very puzzling writer who either knows more about physics, eugenics, animal husbandry, politics, economics, history, religion than any person has a right to know or he really knows how to throw a lot of bull---like his beloved bull dogs.I enjoyed his first trilogy though I considered it a bit far fetched and there is no way that I can believe that the world's major religions would ever unite in a Zoarastrian-Anglican faith that would help unite the world under a British Empire. None the less, it was good alternate history, better than most including Turtledove. And, if you seemingly own the press you can get away with a great deal.Now in Britain Uber Alles, which I pestered and pestered Amazon to get, it is 800 years later. We've gone from alternate history to good old fashioned science fiction/space opera and Putnam carefully tries to write hard science fiction, examining technology and eugenics in great detail. Almost too much detail as it can be tiring going through the extrapolations of new weapons in a continual arms race and the creation of super animals. In this book there is much less emphasis on humans and we see the use of intelligent dogs, gorillas, Chimps, mammoths, spiders, scorpions, kangaroos, squids, slugs, and a variety of dinos. (Hey, why are cats left out? I love dogs and cats and consider them equal in their own way. Maybe cats are too intelligent to let humans use them the way they use other animals.)The British solar system empire expands into a galactic empire which means a war with 7,000 planets. Not as difficult as it sounds. There are echoes of Iraq in this with insurgents on various conquored planets and a looming war with another Galaxy. Here we are set up for the next book which will engage our God driven Galaxy against a Galaxy that is clearly run by Satan. Where is Putnam going? There are two more books coming and assuming we beat up the evil galaxy, who is next? The growth of science and technolgy, coupled with theology and philosophy seems to depend on always preaparing for bigger and better wars.I wish I could give this book more than three stars, however I have to be fair. It is not up to the standard set in the first trilogy and it is hard to appreciate drama between romantic slugs and squids as well as relations between jock gorillas and homosexual chimps, let alone Einstein geniuses and super robotic space ships. A little bit goes a long way and is fun. Too much leads to boredom. I will hope for better in the next one."},{"Title":"Britain Uber Alles, Book One of the Uber Alles Trilogy (Uber Alles Trilogy)","review":"The humor Dave Putnam used in this book made it by far the most enjoyable and engaging book he has written so far. I read the good doctor's review and what he failed to notice was this book is funny. I couldn't put it down, I chuckled throughout.The various characters were well developed and I felt empathy and understanding for animals I would never have thought possible, but Mr. Putnam truly brought them to life.The different planets and the creatures that live and thrive on them, how their enviroment has formed their attitudes and beliefs was both fasinating and fun. Mr. Putnam used many creatures to reflect our own attitudes and intolerance.I also enjoyed his very realistic methods of using economics to win the battle. I wish some of our own military leaders would read this book.I am impatiently waiting for the next in this trilogy."},{"Title":"Buy Your Home Smarter with Feng Shui","review":"Ready to buy a new home or property?

Some are utterly biassed and uninformed, others too objective and lacking direction, and every other angle in-between. Here we have an example of solid objectivity and direction. It's a quick read and I would say NOT for the first time Dean bio reader. This is simply because it does not delve as deeply into the recesses of the less known events and traits that are necessary to paint a well rounded portrait of an artist like Dean. At least not if you're serious. For basic facts and a well written and fluid approach-this is perfectly adequite. One of the nicest attributes is some rarer photos you won't find in most other bios. It's also nice as a second (or third or eighth) addition to a Dean collection. The perspective is legitimately supported by facts and the wording is pleasant to read. However, it brings nothing new to the table for a well-read Dean fan, and does skip some smaller events that are nice to know of. I read every Dean bio I find, and usually buy them (unless they prove to be fictionalized...written for fiction readers)-hence I'm Very discriminating of Dean bios. And here's my take on this one: Not a \\"must have\\", but a \\"nice to have\\"- and definitely good for those adding to their Dean library or those just dabbling in Dean-ology. Over all-pretty good."},{"Title":"James Dean: A Biography.","review":"This biography is very thorough on describing the life and history of James Dean.

Most of all it gives you an insight into how he was, is behaviours and what he was really like without sugar coating anything. Excellent."},{"Title":"James Dean: A Biography.","review":"This is the first biography I ever read on James Dean. The author does a great job working up from Dean's childhood to his eventual Hollywood days, and includes very interesting interviews and insights from various sources on Dean's personality. James Dean was certainly fascinating and immensely talented; what is clear is that he had a lot of passion for life, and wanted to live it to the fullest extent possible. I also like the fact that the book did not focus on Dean's sexuality for about 90% of the time, the part of Dean's life I find the least relevant; who the hell CARES who he slept with? Was he gay? Nope. Did he date only women? Probably not; the only person who knows is James Dean. Does it really matter? Not at all; he was still an actor with an extraordinary gift and the looks of an angel. I don't think it's right for any one \\"group\\" to claim him as their own; if there is one thing I've learned about James Dean, it's that he hated labels and most certainly would not want to be categorized into anything. What I do know is that he really loved Pier Angelli, and reading about their complex relationship is one of the most interesting parts of the book.This book is a quick read, and I polished it off in about four or five days. I really enjoyed it, and will doubtless read it again and again."},{"Title":"James Dean: A Biography.","review":"hell"},{"Title":"Psychic Surgery","review":"A miracle a week for the old National Tattler.I would rather have alopathic surgery myself!"},{"Title":"The American Directory of Writer's Guidelines: A Compilation for Freelancers from More Than 1,300 Magazine Editors & Book Publishers","review":"As a writer and writing teacher, I highly recommend this book by John Mutchler.

Section one gives tips and advice on how to market your literary work, covering such topics as query letters, proposals, electronic aubmissions, making it past the first cut, and an example of a standard manuscript format.Section two lists hundreds of periodicals with complete contact information. It has a detailed description of the periodical and offers detailed advice from the editor/publisher describing in detail what is expected from authors who wish to have their work published in their periodical (query letters, topics, length, SASE's, format, as well as technical information such as type, font, spacing, etc.) Payment for approved works is also discussed. Some publishers pay by the word; others offer a flat fee.Section three has a list of book publishers which essentially has the same information as section two: a general description and background of the publisher, contact information, types of works they are accepting (poetry, non-fiction, fiction, biographical, etc.), technical specifications, etc.Section four is called the &quot;Topic Index&quot; and is especially helpful if you already have a literary work to submit. For instance, if you write poetry, simply go to &quot;Topic Index&quot; and look up &quot;Poetry&quot; and you will see a list of periodicals and book publishers who publish poetry.I highly recommend this book for any author who needs a reference book containing a list of periodicals and publishers which they can submit their literary works to."},{"Title":"The Art of Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style","review":"This photog is for traditional style photos.

It was well worth purchasing. The book gives you great tips and secrets of the trade that I could not get else where. Some of the reviews I read here complain that the book concentrates on film too much and is dated, but I don't think the medium, or the equipment is what this book is all about. It's not really a Photoshop primer, or how many megapixels your camera has, but it's more about a particular style of wedding photography. In this case \\"Photo Journalistic weddings\\".

I didn't feel there was enough content. I read the entire book in about 1.5 hours, including all of the photo captions. I took a couple notes, but I don't think I'll ever read it again.It wasn't terrible.... it did have some good points and I learned a couple things, but it's a bit old and outdated (i think it was published about 10 years ago). There were too many references to shooting with film for my taste. Sure some people still shoot with film, but because so much has changed in the photography world since this was written, I just felt like there is probably something out there that's more current, and more applicable to the modern day photographer.Of course there are some things that are still applicable, but overall I just didn't think it was worth the money. I thought it was worth my time spent reading, but not worth buying (at least not at it's current price). Maybe check it out at a book store first, see what you think there before forking out the money."},{"Title":"The Art of Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style","review":"I am in the photography business and this book had help me to improve my wedding photos.

Its completely film based and frankly its not that informative. You've got a lot of nice, if dated, pictures and a few cute comments next to each picture. Comments such as, \\"Don't worry about how much film you're using. You're goal is to capture the excitement, sensitivity, and passion of the ceremony\\"(p56). That's about as good as it gets unless your looking for some info on the film types that she likes; or you want to hear for the twentieth time how much she likes her Hasselblad fisheye.

Her passion about photography, her artistic style, and her simple explainations of technical ideas all work together to create a wonderful resource for photographers. This book is full of photographs with captions that tell why and how she captured each image. Don't photograph another wedding without reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Art of Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style","review":"This book's almost 5 years old now, and it's showing its age. Almost every photo in the book is taken with a medium format camera, 35mm cameras are rarely mentioned, and digital cameras aren't mentioned at all. To do things the way this book recommends you need an assistant and at least $15,000 worth of gear, minumum. You can extrapolate to work out how to do some of these things by yourself, but it's not mentioned. There are a lot of great inspirational photos in the book, with camera settings and instructions on how to reproduce them, often with your assistant helping with lighting.The book's squarely aimed at very traditional American weddings, but mentions other cultures in passing. Virtually no mention is made of the photojournalism style, the phrase is mentioned, but that's all.If you've never done a wedding, this book will give you one useful viewpoint, but it's not a single book that will teach you how to take photos at a wedding. Some important topics, such as hwo to take photos of the actual ceremony, are touched on but not in the depth that I would have liked.If you want to take traditional pictures, this book, along with others to compliment it, is for you."},{"Title":"The Art of Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style","review":"This is one of the best exposes on the art rather than the technique of contemporary wedding photography. It is not intended as a beginner's guide to the technical aspects of wedding photography--although beginners stand to learn much from this inspiring book. But this book will be of most benefit to more seasoned wedding photo artists interested in broadening their horizons and capturing a visually more demanding and sophisticated wedding market. To date there is no better book on the art of sensitive insightful wedding photography."},{"Title":"The Art of Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style","review":"The imagery in this book is of a fairly high quality. The locations and scenes look believeable; nothing over-the-top and extravagent like some books show (by that I mean, obviously created by wedding photographers who shoot only for the wealthy in the best locales). The complete lack of digital is a real weak point to this book. As of the time of this review, I'm told that nearly 95% of wedding photographers shoot digital, especially starting out. Therefore the equipment suggestions, while still somewhat informative, are heavily dated (the primary emphasis on medium format, while compelling, is no longer the most efficient way to get going in the business). The images are all high quality and quite inspiring. It's a decent work, but I'll probably buy a few more wedding photography books before finding the one that does me the most good."},{"Title":"The Art of Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style","review":"I wish Ms. Cantrell would write more books. I loved this book. While I have been out of wedding photography for a few years, this book got me back in with a new, inspired vision. Not only does she cover the basics of how to shoot a great, realistic wedding, she discusses marketing, bridal shows, how to assemble an album, pricing, and equipment. Every one of her photos carries the camera type, lens used, film used and other details. Here's a hint even if you don't buy the book. Keep an antique wedding album in your display at bridal shows. How could you better communicate the value of photography with that kind of display."},{"Title":"The Art of Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style","review":"I've been an amateur photographer for many years but have never shot a wedding. Recently a friend asked me to shoot his wedding and how could I refuse? So, off I go to Amazon to look for a book on the subject.With this book I wasn't disapointed. It tends to be focused on people with general photography knowledge and does go to deep into the technical. Instead, it focuses more on what to shoot and when and where.This is exactly what I needed. The book is written in a manner that is easy to read without being a \\"Dummy\\" book. The photos illustrate the points well. The book also talks a lot about a photographers conduct at a wedding. This was a huge benefit for me. I wish professional conduct would be discussed more in photography.

You should be thoroughly familiar with f/stops, film speeds, and shutter speeds to get the most from it. Above average information and ideas will be found within. Truly inspiring examples throughout. And the sections on the business side contain much useful information for the beginner on up to the advanced pro.

I am not a professional photographer. I am a lawyer by trade.I was disappointed by the lack of any discussion of digital camera techniques. The word \\"digital\\" is nowhere to be found in this book's index. There are many suggested techniques for film and developing, but much of this has no application to the digital realm. The implication of this book is that if you are not using a Hasselblad you are out of tune. I would suggest instead that the writer join the modern world.Secondly, I was disappointed by the rambling style of the discussion. I know it is likely my professional bias, but I wanted a comprehensive table of contents with a thorough discussion of each point. Instead, the book's style is more of an informed ramble.Yes, the book has many pretty pictures. But this is not the up to date and well written book I had hoped for.E.

You'll also begin thinking about your services and the value you can offer your clients. This book will have you thinking about adding an assistant to your list of must-haves for every Wedding job--an assistant who understands your vision and goals for the wedding day adds so much to the quality and quantity of images you can take on that day which (hopefully) is a once-in-a-lifetime event for your clients.This book does not cover so much about Engagement photos, group formals, or the marketing of your services (although these topics are covered briefly).I also recommend \\"The Best of Wedding Photography\\" by Bill Hurter."},{"Title":"The Art of Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style","review":"This book is really about the ART OF WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHY.

I anxiously awaited the arrival by mail, and it was well worth the wait. The portraits are a visual pleasure, and lots of little unique ideas get your creative juices flowing.

During that time she killed a man, rescued a novice who later became her friend and the nanny to the four children she adopted after the war. Now it's 1920 and Jayne and her family are returning to the US to make a life for themselves Jayne sees the man she killed on the wharf in New York. But perhaps that's just travel weariness. The main problem Jayne has is finding a job to support her family--lady jobs don't pay enough. As a truck driver for the mob running booze she can feed and clothe them but then a woman doing a man's job never has an easy time of it.Next thing she knows, a mob driver on another route has an illness similar to the one she saw in Europe and her partner on the truck might just be more than he seems. Before she knows what's going on, Jayne finds herself forced to work for the pre-Federal Bureau of Investigation (minus pay of course), and in a flying saucer on the way to Japan trying to stop the development of a weapon of mass destruction. The investigator who forced her to work with him won't listen to her or tell her anything and she thinks she knows more than he does about what he's dealing with based on what she saw during the war.There's a definite feeling of the '20s going on here. There's the story which is interesting enough in its own right but also the subtext of a woman trying to make ends meet in a world that thinks she's better as a decorative accessory on a man's arm. This is the decade that saw a lot of big changes in women's rights and while this doesn't deal with the issues of the vote it does deal with the everyday issues of trying to survive.Blood and Roses.is an interesting blend of the old hard-boiled detective fiction and gee whiz science fiction. It's a lot of fun in a strange off kilter way."},{"Title":"Blood and Roses: A Jayne Taylor Novel","review":"Each of Ann Zeddies books is better than the lastTyphon stories that she wrote under the name, Toni Anzetti, are great. Definitely worth reading at least once. I'm glad she's started using her own name (see Steel Helix)... makes it easier to find her stuff.I haven't read the Deathgift books, but I plan to.Blood And Roses is excellent.The characters have depth. The scenes and action are real. Ms. Zeddies is really an excellent story teller.Many science fiction heroines are portrayed as over-the-top superwomen... tougher & meaner than any men. It's like the authors, in trying to overcome the 'weak woman' stereotype go too far and end up with characters that are cliche.Jayne Taylor is nothing like that. She's an interesting and courageous individual who just happens to be a woman. She's intelligent, resourceful, and just won't give up. Zeddies makes Jane alive.While this is a science fiction story, I think that people who aren't generally into sf would like it. It's just an excellent story, written well. It would be an excellent story even if the science fiction aspects were removed... although they do add a lot.I hope that Ms. Zeddies writes more Jayne Taylor novels, soon!"},{"Title":"Blood and Roses: A Jayne Taylor Novel","review":"After spending three years in France as a relief worker, Jayne Taylor goes one step beyond her usual heroics when she kills a German soldier who is holding Sister Madeline hostage. Madeline looks like she is suffering from radiation poisoning but she receives medical attention and recovers. When the war ends Jayne adopts five war orphans and with Madeline brings them home to America. Needing to earn some money she convinces a mobster to let her drive the truck carrying liquor during prohibition. On her first run, she and another end up in a flying ship heading towards Japan.They land on Sado Island where they become separated. Carmeron is held prisoner by sentient insects that look like monsters while Jayne is in the same underground chamber of caves trying to find Cameron with the help of a mysterious stranger who knows more than he should about the bugs and their plans. The Japanese warlord Noriyama wants to use the same substance that the alien prisoners are mining to make a weapon that will give the Japanese dominance in world affairs. Jayne, Cameron and the mysterious stranger will do everything in their power to stop them.Combine the action of a Lara Croft movie with the premise of H.G. Wells book War of the worlds and readers will have some idea what BLOOD AND ROSES is all about. Jayne is a modern day heroine who is living in the 1920's doing things that are usually the province of men including saving the world. The audience will like Jayne for her loyalty, her humanity, passion and bravery but they will find themselves paying attention to the mysterious stranger and hope he and Jayne will have more adventures in future books. The premise of this tale would make a fantastic movie.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Affair of the Mutilated Mink (Missing Mysteries)","review":"Takes place in England during the 1930's. It's the 2nd novel in the Inspector Wilkins series. The Earl of Burford has stars in his eyes when he finds out someone wants to film a talking picture at his country estate starring one of his favorite swash buckler heroes. His wife isn't thrilled at all and now a long-lost relative is arriving at the same time as the star and soon their home is inundated with invited and uninvited guests. Here we go again a house party that leads to the same extra curricular activities as the last one. But this time Inspector Wilkins boss wants Scotland Yard to help out.The author as in his last title The Affair of the Bloodstained Egg Cozy just as masterfully weaves this mystery. I found myself following the leads closely to see if I could figure out whodunit before the end of the book, but I couldn't. I am honest in saying both Inspector Wilkins novels will go on my favorite mystery list."},{"Title":"The Affair of the Mutilated Mink (Missing Mysteries)","review":"Dear Mr. Anderson,Please, sir, if we all ask very nicely, might you be persuaded to write more of these books? As with the Bloodstained Egg Cosy, this was pure delight, and I am sure I am not alone in wishing for more, more -- more!!Once again, Lord Burford and his stately home, Alderly play a major role, this time because of the Earl's love for movies. He is especially fond of Rex Ransom, one of the talkies' first cowboy/action stars, and blithely offers Alderly as the setting for a proposed new movie about the English Civil War. The Countess is not quite so certain about all this, but would never bespeak her husband. Further, it provides their daughter, Lady Geraldine, the opportunity to invite her two most amorous, and possibly serious suitors, the Olympian track star, Paul Carter, and the rather Bohemian painter, Hugh Quartus, to come stay for a week or so.The producer of the film company, Cyrus Haggermeir, is delighted at the prospect of such a visit, even if he does have to put up with the writer of the original screenplay, Arlington Gilbert. And here, he'd thought he could re-write at will. Then, of course, there are secretaries (the sly Maude Fry) involved, as well. And finally, a long-lost cousin of the Countess, Cecily Bradsaw (as was), now Everard, and her current husband, Sebastian, recently from Australia.Well now, isn't this an interesting mix? And it is, too, but it gets far more interesting with the advent of the famous Italian actress, Laura Lorenzo, who has come to Alderly from London, because of a telegram she received from Cyrus-who doesn't recall having sent it. And finally, we have Miss Dove, Jemima, that is, who has been engaged to catalog the library, but gets her dates mixed up and arrives a week earlier than expected.A blizzard, an auto that runs out of petrol, a stolen motorcycle (carefully separated from the side-car first, however), and a local talent show all combine to produce a murder. Thus we have not only the delightful Inspector Wilkins and his trusty Sergeant Leather to investigate, but -- (fanfare, please!) St. John Allgood of the Yard. One of the Three Great A's, the other two being John Appleby and Roderick Alleyn, no less!Allgood is rather full of himself, and needs to be taken down a peg or so, and in spite of himself, Wilkins is just the man for the job. One after the other, Allgood makes a case for each of the inhabitants as first murderer, only to have the case crumble around him. Surprises tumble all over each other, presenting laughs galore before the final, final d&eacute;nouement. Hardly anyone is quite who or what they seem, and my best advice is to not only read the book, but be sure to pay special attention to the prologue. Marvelous. More! More!"},{"Title":"The Affair of the Mutilated Mink (Missing Mysteries)","review":"The Case of the Mutilated Mink is a marvelous mystery that perfectly evokes the ambiance of the classic English country house mystery and at the same time spoofs it (with affectionate Wimsey, I mean wimsy). My only regret is that Mr. Anderson's corpus is not larger. I hope he's just getting warmed up!"},{"Title":"The Affair of the Mutilated Mink (Missing Mysteries)","review":"Second in Anderson's series of affectionate parodies of the classic 1930s country house murder mystery. I thought this one was better constructed than the first, with enough there to make it possible to deduce who the killer was if you were paying attention. I did work out who the killer probably was fairly early on, but not his motive, which is very cleverly hidden. I missed some of the clues and was distracted by some of the red herrings, so wasn't certain until close to the end.The Earl of Burford has discovered the joys of the talkies, and is having a wonderful time being a starstruck fan. So wonderful that he can't believe his luck when a Hollywood film producer wants to hire Alderley as a setting for his latest film, starring the Earl's favourite actor. Naturally, the producer wishes to assess the building and grounds for practicality first, and to encourage the Earl to agree asks if he can bring his star along as well. Thus starts a weekend house party which snowballs, continually acquiring invited and uninvited guests until the house is full of people -- many of whom are not quite what they seem on the surface. And when one of them ends up shot dead in the middle of the night, Inspector Wilkins has a job on his hands untangling the many motives which have brought the characters to Alderley.Great fun to read, with some appealing characters. I'm being more ruthless about getting rid of books now, and this one isn't a keeper for me, but it was well worth the time spent reading it."},{"Title":"The Affair of the Mutilated Mink (Missing Mysteries)","review":"This is a charming and amusing mystery evoking the era of the old black and white British movies. It takes place in England during the 1930's and the Earl of Burford is hosting another zany, house party. The Earl of Burford is very house proud, or in this case country estate proud, so he is thrilled when he finds out someone wants to film a talking picture at his country estate starring one of his favorite movie heros. His wife, the Countess, isn't thrilled at all and on top of the film stars and film crew, she now has a long-lost cousin who arrives at the same time as the film people. Before long the country estate is overflowing with invited and uninvited guests. Then, inevitably, the house party leads to a murder, and Scotland Yard comes to solve the crime. This is the second Inspector Willkins case, and there are also some additional characters from James L. Anderson's first hilarious \\"The Affair of the Bloodstained Egg Cosy\\". Merryweather, the imperturbable family butler, Ins. Wilkins of the Westshire constabulary, Geraldine, the beautiful daughter of the Earl are all there to delight the reader.My advice: unplug the phone, lock the door, and delve into this wonderful British caper."},{"Title":"The Affair of the Mutilated Mink (Missing Mysteries)","review":"Thoroughly entertaining country house party of strangers with a few good twists along the way and a murder thrown in for good measure."},{"Title":"The Affair of the Mutilated Mink (Missing Mysteries)","review":"This was my very favorite mystery for many years. It's the second Burford Mystery, but it's even better than the first book in the series. The Affair of the Mutilated Mink may be silly and tongue in cheek, but it never tips into outright spoof - it's more an affectionate goof on the classic country house murder. Anderson clearly loves the genre, even if he doesn't take it too seriously.I looked for a sequel for many years, but eventually gave up - I'm thrilled to see that a third volume (The Affair of the Thirty-Nine Cufflinks) was published twenty-odd years later!"},{"Title":"The Affair of the Mutilated Mink (Missing Mysteries)","review":"The Earl of Burford invites a Hollywood producer, an actor, and a scriptwriter to his country estate for the weekend, hoping that they'll decide to film their next swashbucker there.

Meanwhile, the Countess invites her distant cousin whom she has not seen for twenty-five years and her husband over. Along with a couple of uninvited guests, the house party assembles at Alderly for a weekend of socializing, drinking, and riding around the estate. But in the middle of the night, there is a gunshot, and one of the guests is found dead in her room with another guest standing over her holding the gun.This is a fun and well-written mystery. There are also several hilarious scenes where Lady Gerry pretends to be a homicidal schizophrenic."},{"Title":"The Affair of the Mutilated Mink (Missing Mysteries)","review":"An intriguing and exciting mystery, slightly marred by the author's mistakes.

These novels are not for anyone already taking Prozac; _Union Street_ in particular is unrelentingly depressing, with rape, physical abuse, unwanted pregnancies, and other unpleasantness. Both novels contain scenes that are deeply, shockingly horrible.So why read these two novels? Barker skillfully makes the lives of these women come alive for the reader: the tedium of their jobs, all the sensory attributes of their homes, the nature of their relationships with their husbands, boyfriends, children, and women friends. She allows us to look in at defining moments in these women's lives: moments that shape their lives, moments where they are forced to make choices, moments where they come to terms with their circumstances.Neither of these novels are exactly what you'd call fun reads, but they are thought-provoking, absorbing, well-achieved, and memorable. I prefer _Blow Your House Down_ to _Union Street_, perhaps because it is a bit more unified. The accumulation of different horrible circumstances in _Union Street_ can be a bit overwhelming. Both books impress you with these women's ability to survive despite extraordinary hardships, but neither book ever waltzes into the potentially mawkish territory of triumph over circumstances. These women are survivors, not victors.Pat Barker is one of the greatest contemporary British writers. If you are a fan of her better-known later work, I recommend this volume."},{"Title":"UNION STREET AND BLOW YOUR HOUSE DOWN.","review":"Pat Barker's earlier work impresses the reader with the same fearless vision that brought her fame with \\"The Regeneration Trilogy.\\" Her compassion, and respect, for the tough lives of the British working class never flags. She sees her characters, whether they are admirable or not, as complex people with challenges in life that would make most of us shake our heads and give up. But they don't give up, they persevere to do the best they can for one another and especially for their children. Her honest writing drives right through the depressing aspects of their lives, not avoiding them for a moment, and comes out on the other side with real understanding and admiration for the human spirit they embody. I have now read all of her work to day, and continue to count her among my most admired living writers."},{"Title":"UNION STREET AND BLOW YOUR HOUSE DOWN.","review":"'Blow your house down' by the wonderful Pat Barker, handles working class, northern women in such a non-judgemental, fragile fashion, it is ever so difficult to perhaps judge them from your own point of view. Rather than portray these women, as sad, desperate and dirty, Pat barker has written about strong, determined, inderpendant working mothers, lovers and friends. 'Blow your house down' recognises the dreary, miserable, mangled environment these women are forced to work in as a result of their own situations, which life has left them in.The main story line tells us of a murderer who kills one of the prostitutes. It establishes the fact that no matter how much danger is lurking in and out of these women's lives, they still carry on working the streets, earning their living. Still haunted by their friends murder, they don't reject their own lives- they risk them.A truly good, honest and disturbing read from one of my favourites."},{"Title":"UNION STREET AND BLOW YOUR HOUSE DOWN.","review":"very interesting novel which explores the living standards of middle class women. I found the life of each woman very exciting. I am studying this novel as part of my coursework and would be happy to hear anybodys view on this book"},{"Title":"UNION STREET AND BLOW YOUR HOUSE DOWN.","review":"I wanted the basis for the movie Stanley & Iris which Union Street is but it isn't the screenplay or anything close. So I have no rating. I'll donate the book to the library."},{"Title":"The life of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"This piece is an excellent portrayal of life during the Italian Renaissance, but more importantly, the book is purely entertaining. Benvenuto Cellini tells the story of his life in a vivid tale of kings and prostitutes, artists and dukes, soldiers and necromancers, all the while proclaiming himself the absolute protagonist of his world. Cellini's autobiography is filled to capacity with egotism, but this only makes the story more interesting. In a good piece of literature of this type, a person wants to see a main character with absolute confidence in himself; a superhero if you will. Benvenuto may not be a superhero, but he tells his life story as if he was the greatest of all such legendary folk heroes. If children read this book or were read this book during their childhood, perhaps on the playground at recess, kindergartners would say: &quot;Hey let's play superheroes, I get to be Superman, I get to be Benvenuto Cellini.&quot; With the master goldsmith's stories about fending off six armed men with a single dagger, without a thought of fear in his mind, who wouldn't be solidly entertained?"},{"Title":"Pictures from the Water Trade; Adventures of a Westerner in Japan","review":"As an introduction to Japan this novel is superlative. It reads as a collection of memoirs on the Japanese lifestyle bound by a loose but well-sketched narrative. It covers the life of an English cultural visitor to Japan in the early 1970s, detailing the elements of Japanese culture, attitude and character that particularly affect him during his stay. The narrative parts of it are quite entertaining but it is the insghts that this book provides that make this a valuable text for understanding the Japanese."},{"Title":"Pictures from the Water Trade; Adventures of a Westerner in Japan","review":"This is a mildly interesting book that explores aspects of Japanese culture from a Westerner's point of view. The cover of my edition describes it as an \\"extraordinarily evocative, at times erotic,\\" story. Given that the book is ostensibly about the steamy nightlife of the mizu shoubai, one might expect a rather heady description of what goes on after dark in Japan. Despite the title, the book does not particularly concern itself with the water trade. When it does, it's often just a description of the author sitting in some little bar or other drinking. The book does devote lengthy stretches to things like calligraphy and home furnishings, and I'm sorry to say that I found it rather boring.It is hard to imagine who the target audience for this book would be. For those with little knowledge of Japan, many of the descriptions lack enough context to make much sense. For persons already acquainted with the culture, the long musings are hardly revealing and some of the author's conclusions are questionable. Ultimately, it feels like the author wrote this as memoir for himself. It should give hope to diarists everywhere that they too can one day be published. There are a few genuinely evocative moments in this book (especially notable was a good description of a funeral at the very end), but not enough to justify the time it takes to read it."},{"Title":"Pictures from the Water Trade; Adventures of a Westerner in Japan","review":"This book is rightly considered a classic, and his description of Miss Suzuki in the chapter \\"Slaying Dragons\\" is, oddly enough, one of the most erotic things I've ever read. It describes a severe and businesslike woman, dressed all in black, in a cold white room. As she works, the room warms and he catches the scent of her skin coming from her hairless forearms. (But he writes it far better than I.)The author was young when he wrote this book, and it shows, but it's pretty dead accurate of what it's like to be young and full of life in a very foreign land."},{"Title":"Pictures from the Water Trade; Adventures of a Westerner in Japan","review":"The story concerns a European student who comes Japan to learn the language. He falls in love with a young Japanese girl who &quot;transalates&quot; the culture to him. As a piece of fiction the storyline fails to deliver but it gives the reader an excellent insight into aspects Japanese culture, at least to my unsophistocated eye. Having experienced a ten day trip there and having come away with numerous questions about the highly evolved culture, I found it it be very interesting and helpful in explaining some of the cultural differences."},{"Title":"Pictures from the Water Trade; Adventures of a Westerner in Japan","review":"I'm afraid this is a bit of a howler, but after reading this book, which I thought fine, I searched J.D. Morley's name on the web and discovered that he's the one who wrote the Memoirs of a Geisha review in the Sunday NYTimes several years ago that I still remember! It was a real howler. He didn't seem to understand that the translator's note at the beginning of the novel was PART of the novel, and in various ways completely missed the point of the book in a way that few people have. Now that I've read Pix from the Water Trade, I suspect it was a matter of jealousy, which is really kind of sad. So what do I think of this book? Adequate; not bad, really. But the author will probably be remembered best for his ungenerous and in fact rather boneheaded review of a much better book that will survive the ages."},{"Title":"Pictures from the Water Trade; Adventures of a Westerner in Japan","review":"Morley's character, Boone, supposedly fluent in Japanese, leads us on a wild romp through his version of fin-de-millennium Japan. His grand tour includes an expos&eacute;e of the affairs he had with two young women during his brief stay there. Thus the misnomer \\"water trade,\\" though neither of Boone's girlfriends worked in that occupation.I got the impression that Boone was a sort of smelly chap. Strange that the book left an olfactory impression rather than a visual one, as its title suggests. Maybe it's because a nice girl in Japan would not, under normal circumstances, speak with a foreigner, much less have an affair with one. For this reason we conclude that the \\"translation\\" of Japanese culture that Boone received used a lower-class dictionary as its authority. Boone, like many foreigners in Japan, came from a middle-class environment, which afforded him the luxury of making such a trip in the first place. Was this really the Japan that he wanted to see?I can't resist mentioning two stories that draw on a native informant, for comparison. In James Clavell's Shogun, we see an upper-class Japanese woman (who speaks fluent Latin, oddly), \\"translating\\" her culture to the stranded seafarer whom they call Anjin-san. Little by little Captain Blackthorne is drawn into the culture, never realizing that there is no escape. In the movie Karate Kid (1) Pat Morita's character, Miyagi, \\"translates\\" the culture of Japan (transplanted to Southern California) for young Daniel LaRusso (also transplanted there from New Jersey). Sadly, for Miyagi, there is no escape. Both the book and the movie far outclass Pictures from the Water Trade, which depicts, after all is said and done, nothing more than Boone's \\"escape\\" to his dream-world Japan.I would not be surprised if this book, due to its graphic nature, was black-listed in Japan."},{"Title":"Pictures from the Water Trade; Adventures of a Westerner in Japan","review":"I read this book some time ago and very much enjoyed the first chapter. After that it went a bit flat, though I did manage to finish it. For readers interested in the world Morely explores here, I'd recommend Liza Dalby's &quot;Geisha,&quot; or perhaps Ian Buruma's &quot;Behind the Mask.&quot; Probably best of all is &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha,&quot; which is set in the 'water trade' and quite an astonishing book."},{"Title":"Visions of Buddhist Life","review":"VISIONS OF BUDDHIST LIFE is a beautiful documentation of the diverse world of Buddhist life and practice. It's hard for me to review this book without succumbing to the familiar cliches of &quot;inspiring,&quot; &quot;moving,&quot; &quot;breath taking,&quot; etc., because, well, that is exactly what this book is.Many of the photographs have corresponding text to describe what is happening; though such text is informative, it is also often incidental. These pictures are so crisp and so clear that they really don't need much description. My own personal favorite photo is the one of about a dozen monks sitting at a table in full ceremonial attire and performing a solemn ritual blessing on the food they are about to eat. What is so endearing about the picture is that each monk has a can of Coke sitting next to his plate.

I would recommend this book to any American that would go to Brazil, since it's only natural that one would compare that country with their own."},{"Title":"Coyote's in the House, A (Leonard, Elmore)","review":"I started reading adult novels when I was about 10 or 11 with authors who were very popular at the time. I didn't realize until I was much older that most of them couldn't write for beans. So until I was 18, I didn't read nearly as much as I might have. But at 18 I read Glitz by Elmore Leonard, who showed me how cool the written word could be.A Coyote's in the House, Leonard's first children's novel, ought to be required reading in classrooms everywhere. Kids are subjected to so much lame, stilted, uninteresting reading material it ought to be a crime. This book reads like Technicolor in that black-and-white world. It will inspire kids to read more. Adults will love it too. There's simply nothing like it.The story features Antwan, a coyote living wild in the Hollywood Hills; Buddy, a German shepherd that formerly starred in movies; and Miss Betty, a poodle living with the family that also owns Buddy. Antwan and Buddy run into one another one day, and a plan is eventually hatched for each to see how the other half lives. Can Buddy run with the pack? Can Antwan \\"pass\\" as a dog? The social commentary lying beneath this fanciful storyline shines through constantly. If it doesn't bring a smile to your face, you're a statue.Early on, Antwan and his little coyote sister, Ramona, are hiding in the bushes overlooking a dog park, where owners are walking their pets. Antwan is explaining the way of the world to her.\\"Here comes a working dog, a Border collie,\\" Antwan said, \\"only he's out of work. Rides around Hollywood in his owner's car looking for sheep to herd.\\"\\"I know what collies look like,\\" Ramona said. \\"They have that long, pointy face.\\"\\"Other dogs do, too,\\" Antwan said. \\"Your borzois, your Afghan hounds ... What's that white one coming?\\"\\"A greyhound?\\"\\"You're close, but it's a saluki.\\"\\"What's it do?\\"\\"Lays around the house thinking it's somebody.\\"Later, Antwan gets invited inside the house with Buddy and immediately scarfs down a plateful of cookies on the table. He thinks there must be something wrong with the dog:(Antwan) said, \\"Homes, can't you smell?\\"\\"Of course I can smell.\\"\\"You know cookies are sitting here and you don't eat none?\\"\\"We're not allowed cookies,\\" the big German dog said, sounding like a wimp. He turned his head to point to two dog dishes sitting on the floor, each with a name on it. Buddy on one, Miss Betty on the other.Antwan said, \\"Which one's yours, homes?\\"Ultimately, the plot centers around efforts to make Buddy feel like a hero again, like he was in the movies. Leonard peppers enough excitement into the 149-page novel to keep young readers plenty interested, and enough observations, allusions and commentary on social strata and the Hollywood movie industry to please adults. A book that can be read on many levels, A Coyote's in the House deserves the widest possible audience."},{"Title":"Coyote's in the House, A (Leonard, Elmore)","review":"Antwan, a coyote, notices Buddy, a German Shepard, in a fancy yard, in the Hollywood Hills. Buddy calls to Antwan, invites him in the house. Buddy wants to trade lives with Antwan. He wants Antwan to live in his house while he runs with the gang (pack). When the family comes home, the young, snippety daughter discovers Antwan in the house. She yells, \\"There's a coyote in the house!\\" Antwan escapes, but later returns as \\"Timmy.\\" The family adopts Timmy (Antwan). While living with them, Antwan comes to understand dogs and cats, but isn't sure he will ever like their masters.The females in the storyline are Miss Betty, the poodle princess, Lola, the movie star cat, and Romana, Antwan's sister. They get in the act when Miss Betty decides she doesn't like Buddy being depressed. She wants him to feel like the hero he played in the movies. She creates a plan involving Lola. (Lola steals the show during this thread of the storyline.)Elmore Leonard shares the tale of a wild coyote who swears never to be tamed. He likes running with his gang. The story begins with Antwan talking to his gang, about the various dogs and their backgrounds. Antwan, Buddy, and the rest experience various adventures. There are fun and of course gross moments. Kids will love it.Actor Neil Patrick Harris narrates A Coyote's in the House. He brings out the hip, jazzy personality of Antwan and the older, wiser tone of Buddy. But it's with Miss Betty and Lola that Harris seems to have the most fun. I have to say, Lola is my favorite"},{"Title":"Coyote's in the House, A (Leonard, Elmore)","review":"Elmore Leonard's A Coyote's in the House is a fun read and I recommend it for folks both young and old with one small reservation. Thinking about the book with my adult analytical mind disengaged, I found the story of Antwan the coyote, Buddy the movie star dog, and Miss Betty the show poodle to be a fun fast read. The story takes place in the Hollywood Hills where Antwan the coyote lives in the hills and Buddy the movie star dog lives in the house his family bought using the money Buddy made in the movies. Antwan and Buddy become friends and through the course of the story go through a series of adventures and switch rolls. My usual dislike of anthropomorphized animals did not wreck my enjoyment of this story. Now my reservation [adult analytical mind reengaged] - I found that Leonard's choice of names for the characters and use of urban dialect [inconsistently] for certain characters raised my stereotype hackles. When Leonard uses broad stereotypes in his adult novels, the audience is adult and sophisticated enough to get the point. It concerns me that a slightly less sophisticated young reader might get the wrong message from the characters in A Coyote in the House. I recommend that if you are an adult thinking of getting a copy of A Coyote's in the House for a young reader, scan a copy first to see whether you feel my reservation might be valid. Better yet, read it, enjoy it, and then decide whether to hand it down to the young reader."},{"Title":"Coyote's in the House, A (Leonard, Elmore)","review":"I was going to buy this book for my friend for her birthday. But after I bought it and started reading it, I couldn't let go of it! So I ended up buying 2 copies. One for my friend, and one for me.This book is so funny and I love how, for a change, the book tells the story from an animal's point of view. It really got you thinking about how a coyote's life is compared to a pet dog's. This book is great for reading when you're bored. You'll start off planning to read for only a few minutes but then you get addicted and end up reading for hours!"},{"Title":"Coyote's in the House, A (Leonard, Elmore)","review":"This book is nicely written but I think the ending was a little unsatisfying.

I loved how Antwan was both lovable and a little dangerous, like all of Leonard's best characters. Picture Chili Palmer as a Hollywood Hills Coyote and you'll be pretty much on the mark.This will make an excellent animated film (take notice, Disney!)- one that, like \\"Shrek\\", will delight adults as much as kids. One star off for the brief toilet humor, which wasn't necessary...."},{"Title":"Coyote's in the House, A (Leonard, Elmore)","review":"We'll just have to face it - some writers are so deft that they can switch genres as easily as changing jackets. That seems to be the case with Elmore Leonard who after winning legions of adult fans has now set about capturing the younger generation. He'll probably do it with \\"A Coyote's In The House, a delicious animal fable set in Hollywood.It's not easy being the voice of animals but performer Neil Patrick Harris is superb as listeners hear the story of Buddy, a past his prime German shepherd movie star; Antwan, a lone coyote who's always been down on his luck; and the gorgeous Miss Betty, a pulchritudinous poodle.Late one evening Antwan is poking among tempting garbage in the Hollywood Hills. Surely he'll find a more than appetizing meal there. Instead, he meets Buddy. A little bit bored and discouraged Buddy thinks it would be exciting to live as Antwan does, so why don't the two switch places? Well, Antwan has never been a cosseted coyote, so that sounds like a good deal to him. The rub is in passing Antwan off as a dog. But, it works.You know the old saying about the grass always looking greener - Buddy soon decides that he misses his family, and he sure doesn't like not having any attention at all.Leave it to Leonard to come up with a satisfying conclusion for all. Listen, laugh, and enjoy.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Coyote's in the House, A (Leonard, Elmore)","review":"Elmore Leonard is, of course, renowned for his realistic adult crime books, in which his amazing dialogue conveys the seamy side of the criminal caper genre. When I saw he had written a book for kids, I knew it would be perfect for my 12-year old son,who craves the dark humor and lack of sachrine that typify Leonard.We listened to this book together on tape. It is not a crime caper at all, but we were not disappointed. The book is considerably less dark than his work for adults (a change I frankly enjoyed), but the lean Leonard writing, the skill at avoiding undue sentiment and the dark humor all carried over. We couldn't put it down, so to speak. A clear winner.There was one matter, though, that disconcerted me. The book is concerned with two worlds: the domestic, behave-yourself world of Dogs, and the dangerous, do-what-you-want world of Coyotes. For some reason, Leonard injected race into this characterization--the Coyotes seem African-American. They have black names (Antwan,Cletus) and use black vernacular -- words like \\"homes\\" and \\"crew\\" for friend and gang, sister for female Coyote and so on. This Coyotes-as-African-Americans is reenforced in the book-on-tape version by the vocalization of Neil Patrick Harris. The Coyotes are not portrayed negatively in the book---ultimately their freedom and independence is given the highest value, and the Coyote hero is consistently cool and able. But there is a stereotyped aspect to the cultural characterization, and I found it unsettling---not quite sure what to make of it or why Leonard put it in there. There's some subtle racial image being portrayed here that parents may at least want to be aware of."},{"Title":"Coyote's in the House, A (Leonard, Elmore)","review":"I really liked this book.

And naturally, the overall reading is as the tale of how a proud culture pulled itself back together after being overrun and almost destroyed as a consequence of European settlement.Our local Heinz Regional History Museum somehow manages to overlook the story about the origins of the Handsome Lake spiritual movement. It so happened that there was a bend in the river, where now stands the Kinzua Dam, a flat spot surrounded by steep hills and cliffs, where the Cornplanter band, the largest remaining band of free living Senecas, took refuge after the Revolutionary War. The Senecas had served as winning warriors for the losing side, and as a result, refugee camps up near Fort Niagara filled up with thousands of Indians in need of British relief, mourning their burned-out towns and villages. In the ensuing atmosphere of despair, Handsome Lake and some of his Cornplanter band buddies decided to bring a raft with plenty of liquor up the river from Pittsburgh. The party that followed was-- well, let's just say that the repentance occurring in the wake of that rave gone awry launched a spiritual movement which continues to this day.The author's synthesis of the tremendous amount of material buried in regional historical records is truly amazing. Even if the life of the Senecas wasn't really that way at all, it may not matter. There's nothing like a great story which will continue to shatter its readers' preconceptions about cultural norms and human potential for many years to come."},{"Title":"The death and rebirth of the Seneca,","review":"Required reading on the subject of the Seneca. The author paints an objective picture, but also manages to add emotional poignancy to a very thorough historical account.

Using examples from their own experiences and Christ, The Jacobsen brothers cleverly and thoroughly go through 22 verses in the Epistles that focus on the concept of \\"one anothering\\". The chapters are masterfully ordered to display the progression of relationship building. The first section starts with one's relationship with God. The next progression is the genesis of a truly authentic relationship. The authors follow this portion with a section called, 'Sharing the Journey'. As the title states, this portion of the book details relationships within an authentic community. The final chapters deal with what happens with true spiritually linked relationships deepen. If this was not enough, the end of each chapter lists discussion questions that really allow you to search your heart and challenge the authenticity of your relationship with God and others.I have found the Jacobsen brothers to have true spiritual insight concerning what it means to walk the Christian journey in community with God and one another.Currently, I am involved with a fellowship of young adult believers who wish to reach out to our surrounding community and friends. I am going to purchase a few more copies and use it as a mid week study tool.

The chapters are not long and can be red one at a time in any order you like. What they address is how the instructions to live by in the bible are not a checklist and set of rules but stem from a motivation to please God. Far from being another rule book, Authentic Relationships deals with how to live as a Christian and compares church life to CHRIST life in a practical real-life way. Nearly every church I know would benefit from the book if their pastors read it and took it to heart.

In a day where technology appears to be increasing communication almost exponentially it's remarkable to listen to how much people are crying for genuine and personal relationships.In an age of \\"10 Steps to ....\\", \\"A Dummies Guide to ....\\" etc. it's refreshing to see a book that avoids the normal prototype of laying out step by step how to do something. There are practical suggestion here to be certain, but when they are given they are almost an afterthought or a casual aside.The book addresses several misconceptions and this reader appreciated the observations of how traditional Church bodies often miss this important area in terms of deliberate and targetted effort to bring people together in real relationship. What's is impressive to me however, is that while those observations are made and address significant issues, the entire focus of the book presents its truth in such a way that the wisdom contained can be applied in most any context. Institutional Churches, Home Churches, Home Fellowship Groups, Organic Churches, Informal Neighborhood Bible Studies, Casual Friendships. The point isn't so much the context of the relationships, nor the quantity of relationships but rather the quality of relationships and how to look for and develop reciprocal relationships, free from manipulation and authoritarian abuses.This book was great as an individual read but it also is laid out in such a way that it could serve as a small group study (although maybe not in a traditional taught by only one person type of way.)This book works very well in the tradition of popular books such asThe Shack,So You Don't Want to Go to Church Anymore,He Loves Me!

I think this is a great book and I plan to buy many copies to give to people I know. BUT a friend warned me that he thought there might be something wrong with Jacobsen because he does not go to a church - and hasn't for many years now. You can read his own article about it here:[...] or go to his web site at [...] and search for the article titled: Why I Don't Go To Church Anymore.I am not judging Jacobsen in this regard, its just that I cant help but think that the body of Christ would benefit even more from his ministry if he were a regular attender at a local church. I sense an unhealed hurt in him that is reacting against the \\"organized church\\". Jacobsen himself writes in this book about Paul's teaching to give up his rights in order to not become a stumbling stone for anyone. I think Wayne's rejection of \\"meat that has been sacrificed to idols\\" (that is, NOT worshiping together with a local church body) is a \\"stumbling stone\\" that impedes the reception of his message among some people (like the friend who brought this to my attention).

I like the writings of Brian Masters and Stephen Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth as in depth analyses of particular perps.This book is written by the detective who recounts his years long effort to convict a perp he believes to be responsible for a series of killings in France. What I found most interesting was his recounting of the many interactions he had with the killer over a number of years in which he attempted to understand and \\"crack\\" the guy into a confession. He remains perplexed by the perp. even though he succeeded in convicting him.One thing that strikes the knowledgable reader of true crime is how primitive European agencies response to these killings are because they have such limited experience of serial killings. The Monster of Florence also bears this out:The Monster of Florence(another good read).As the recountings of the frustration of one detective in attempting to bring a killer to justice this is an interesting read. I would have liked to see more speculation by the author of what he thought was going on with the killer (e.g. it is short on psychological insight) yet I can understand that the author is sticking to what he knows (e.g. his own experience) rather than attempting to be something that he is not (a psychologist or expert on serial killing). I also suspect that he was limited in what he could write by official agencies or his own discretion (e.g. the killer has a sister but little is said about what she may have revealed).I note that the price of this book seems to vary - I bought mine at about $4-5 and its current price in $9.79. I probably wouldn't buy it at that price but it's certainly worth $4-5. It is certainly a worthwhile read for those who are into more serious true crime accounts and it would certainly be of interest to law enforcement personnel because it provides a very vivid account of a dogged pursuit of evidence by a frustrated detective."},{"Title":"Collins Bradford's Crossword Solver's Dictionary","review":"Anne Bradford's Crossword Solver's Dictionary would be my first choice, along with Chambers, to take on my desert island.

I dressed as the maid so I could serve food and clean up. My husband dressed as a cook. He grilled steaks and chicken outside on the grill. Luckily he and my dad did not play parts. To my surprise they helped serve and clean up. Which is really rare for my father. However my mom was really enjoying herself. All and all it went realy great. Everyone said I did a good job decorating the castle. I used china and crystal and made pictures on my computer. My dad is from Scotland so the castle idea went over very well.

Short examines the religious content of Schultz's beloved little universe of Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus, Snoopy, and the rest to reveal, from a Christian perspective, the prophetic and theologic meanings manifested by these charming and universally known cartoon characters that became pop culture icons the whole world over. The Gospel According To Peanuts is highly recommended reading all Schultz fans and anyone who has ever noted the enduring wisdom embedded and embraced by the little folks who inhabited his daily and Sunday cartoon stories."},{"Title":"The Gospel According To Peanuts","review":"In contrast to an earlier reviewer, I see sound theology here. Mr. Short never says that everyone will be saved regardless of their actions or beliefs; he clearly expresses the true Gospel - that one must be saved through faith in Jesus Christ alone. With that out of the way, this is both a solid statement of the Good News of atonement through Jesus' sacrifice but also an entertaining and novel way to illustrate its principles. While some may be put off by the expressions &quot;Good grief!&quot; &quot;Auuuggghhh!&quot; and the like, they represent our reactions to life and show that we all struggle daily. Even the Apostle Paul said that he &quot;die(d) daily&quot; in his struggle with the sin of daily living. The late Charles Schulz (whether intentionally or not) reflects through his Peanuts gang this struggle and the joys that can be experienced if we pursue them, in our case through a true faith in Jesus Christ! God bless Charles Schulz!"},{"Title":"The Gospel According To Peanuts","review":"This fun and interesting book has become a classic in its field since its original publication -- but it's still fun and interesting! In simple style, it reminds us there can be &quot;much wisdom in a little joke&quot; -- and Charles Schulz's work is exhibit number one. If you are interested in popular culture, cartooning, or theology, you'll find much to ponder here."},{"Title":"The Gospel According To Peanuts","review":"The Gospel According to Peanuts is a truly fascinating little book filled with insight, wisdom, and the type of joy that Christians should naturally espouse. Robert L. Short certainly does not argue that every single Peanuts cartoon carries a theological message, but he offers up an amazing selection of comic strips that do in fact encapsulate a number of important Christian beliefs. He begins the book with a justification for Christians embracing the arts as a means of spreading the Gospel to those around them. The fact that Charles Schulz himself was a Christian is, in a sense, immaterial; as Short argues, Christians should embrace all manner of things which will allow them to connect with others in a subtle and less holier-than-thou manner. You can't go around beating people over the head with God and get results, no matter how good your intentions. Engage them in the arts or some other object of mutual interest, and you open up innumerable outlets for Christian witnessing. For those who would scoff at the notion of linking Christianity with comedy, Short reminds us that, to the world, Christianity is itself rather comical. It is a wonderful argument that offers up much food for thought.In the same vein as the parables of Jesus, Short makes use of dozens of Peanuts comic strips to shed light on a clear and understandable theology, finding many illustrative parallels in the lives of the Peanuts gang. Charlie Brown, in a very real sense, represents Everyman, a jolly good fellow who is always looking for something to improve a life that is, by and large, rather miserable - he never wins, just as mankind, on its own, never wins. Charlie Brown is also prone to moments of great anxiety, a fear of nothingness and emptiness. Short's most memorable comparisons, though, are to be found in the other central characters of Peanuts. Lucy's psychiatric business represents the rather modern fad of humans looking toward psychiatry to solve their problems and to reveal to them why they are so unhappy. Then there is Linus, who tends to try to run away from his problems and finds comfort only in his blanket. In Short's hands, the Great Pumpkin becomes a symbol of popular religious sentiment - Linus says, at one point, that it doesn't really matter what you believe as long as you are sincere. Of course, the Great Pumpkin never appears. Even more interesting is Linus' attitude toward Santa Claus, for, in Short's analysis, it represents the attitude of many professed Christians toward God. As Linus expects to be rewarded by Santa for his good behavior, some Christians seem to believe that by obeying God's commandments and doing good works, God owes them a reward. You can't pretend to be good and get to heaven, Short reminds us. Eternal life is a gift from God that no man can possibly earn on his own merits.Short also expounds upon the dual nature of God's love, illustrating his argument with comic strips featuring, for example, the positive and negative qualities of rain. He concludes by offering a brilliant analysis of the words uttered so often by Charlie Brown: &quot;Goof grief.&quot; Because you must become lost before you can be found and seek before you can find, grief can ultimately be a good thing, thanks solely to the death and resurrection of Jesus.I was amazed at the insights into Christianity this book delivered. Non-Christians, even the Peanuts fans amongst them, may not enjoy this book because of its tenaciously theological design and purpose, but the truths that can be found in the comic strips of Charles Schulz can very effectively serve as the individual's exposure to and understanding of Christian faith. This is a remarkable book, and its importance goes far beyond its pages. Short shows how modern art and entertainment can help redefine and improve the effectiveness of the church in spreading the message of the Gospel to all men, women, and children."},{"Title":"The Gospel According To Peanuts","review":"This is the first book of theology that I ever read - and what a great introduction to theology! Short pulls out the theology of love and grace, the very human-ness of Christian faith (rightly understood), from the cartoon Peanuts, written by the unique Charles Schultz. This is actually the best introduction to real Christian theology that is available. Tillich, Kierkegaard, Niebuhr, Luther, Kafka, T. S. Eliot, and Karl Barth are only of the people you'll encounter in this splendid summary of essential Christian thought. I have valued this book for years, from when I first read it in high school to when I gave it as a gift to a lay minister in the diocese that I serve when I was consecrated as a bishop. Of all the dull and boring books of theology out there, this one is fun, and one of the best ever!"},{"Title":"The Gospel According To Peanuts","review":"I found this book in a church Library and fell in love with it. the more I read the more I realize Short's Excelent perception on human nature and Christianity. I was especially fond of the titles of the chapters including: &quot;The Wages of Sin is &quot;Aaaughh&quot;&quot;, and &quot;Good Grief&quot;. These Titles and the titles of the book however are going to be offencive to some Fundimentalist Christians. That is a shame because if they read this book they would see how good of an evangelical tool it could be. I hope anyone struggling with their own faith could read this book. It really Pokes fun at human nature."},{"Title":"The Gospel According To Peanuts","review":"It is, surely, a matter of basic courtesy to an author to read his or her book before reviewing it. The pseudonymous &quot;lexo-2&quot; (see below, six reviews down) knows his Peanuts and his Preachers, and his verdict on Short is &quot;Wrong, wrong, wrong.&quot; Well, six months after reading that review I have at last got around to finishing my used-bookstore copy of &quot;The Gospel,&quot; and I find myself feeling so annoyed that I simply must respond.&quot;Whether or not Schulz is a devout Christian I could not say,&quot; writes lexo-2. If he had taken the trouble to actually read Short's book, however, he would have found numerous quotations from Schulz himself concerning his religious views. Speaking of a Bible-study group he attended shortly after his return from the Second World War, Schulz says, &quot;The more I thought about it during those study times, the more I realized that I really loved God&quot; (quoted on p. 70). Or again, &quot;I don't even like the expression 'take communion.' You cannot 'take' communion. You are a part of the communion. You are communing with Christ; you are a part of the community of saints&quot; (p. 80). The rhetoric, complete with its anti-Catholic bias against the notion of &quot;taking&quot; communion, is clearly that of a born-again evangelical (in Schulz's case, Church of God). And lest there be any doubt of Schulz's authorial intentions, he is quoted in the very first chapter as saying, &quot;I have a message that I want to present, but I would rather bend a little to put over a point than to have the whole strip dropped because it is too obvious. As a result . . . all sorts of people in religious work have written to thank me for preaching in my own way through the strips. That is one of the things that keeps me going&quot; (p. 20).Schulz was worried about being too obvious. Clearly he wasn't obvious enough.Short's book is cogent and well argued; it certainly is not a collection of &quot;homilies.&quot; Contrary to what lexo-2 implies, Short does not ignore the darker side of the Peanuts world. Indeed, of lexo- 2's &quot;three phrases,&quot; Short uses two or them in chapter titles: &quot;The Wages of Sin Is 'Aaaugh!'&quot; and &quot;Good Grief!&quot; Good grief! Read before you review!Yes, lexo-2 is quite right that the world of Peanuts is a &quot;sunlit hell, in which the characters never grow, never change, etc.&quot; Where he goes wrong is in assuming that Short--a Ph.D. in literature and theology, a man who had taken the trouble to study the cartoon in depth and even write a book about it--couldn't see that for himself. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Short's whole point is that we all live in a &quot;sunlit hell,&quot; suffering &quot;unimaginable fears&quot; and &quot;wreaking appalling cruelties on each other,&quot; and that we will never escape that hell unless we can find . . . (you guessed it!) the saving grace of Jesus Christ. The salvationist message does not come across too strongly in the cartoon (Schulz did not want to be &quot;obvious&quot;) but it just as surely is there, between the lines, in the occasional epiphanies of love and reconciliation that illuminate the otherwise bleak moral landscape of Peanutopia.You can agree or disagree with the Short-Schulz analysis of the human predicament. Personally, I disagree strongly. But in a world in which evangelical and fundamentalist Christianity have so much influence and power, it simply will not do to be idly dismissive. Indeed, I particularly recommend Short's book to freethinkers of every stripe, if only that they may remind themselves just how subtle and persuasive evangelical discourse can be. There is more, much more, to Short's little book than &quot;pious ramblings&quot; and that is precisely what makes it, depending on your point of view, so inspiring or so insidious."},{"Title":"The Gospel According To Peanuts","review":"It's been many years since I first picked up this book. I love the way Robert L. Short juxtaposes Christian values with scenes from life in the world according to Peanuts. I always saw the little Peanut strips with Lucy, Linus, Charlie, Snoopy and the others as parables, really, rich with life lessons and deeper meaning. I was so glad to see that someone else saw that, too, and wrote a book, writing in detail, where this symbolism was found, and how it could be connected to the teachings of the Bible.Though, I am not Christian, I believe that the messages about sin, life, love, envy and the other streams of emotions that these little characters, wise beyond their years, go through, as children, together, really speak volumes about the struggle of humankind. Every character is rich with symbolism about the plight of humankind, and, even Snoopy the Dog struggles with the same level of self doubt, anger, resentment and discouragement that his human counterparts must endure as part of the universal struggle. Great book!!! It has definitely stood the test of time. I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"The Gospel According To Peanuts","review":"The book is great. It allows the reader to gain insights to difficult Christian topics with the help of Cartoons. A picture is often said to be worth a thousand words and in this book the cartoons are. Shults somehow captures the essence of the human condition that each one of us experience and displays it in a non confrontational way. This allows you to look at yourself in a non threatening way and explore your ideas and experiences. A great book!"},{"Title":"The Gospel According To Peanuts","review":"I have bought many copies of this book,I just love it. I mail it to friends and family."},{"Title":"The Gospel According To Peanuts","review":"This book is a view of Christianity and Christians as compared with the wonderful characters of Charles Schultz famous cartoons. Robert Short uses various Peanuts strips to illustrate the similarity with the lessons of the Gospels and Leters of the New Testment and the message from the strips.Using the Peanuts characters has allowed the author to update the messages of the New Testament so that a modern person can relate better to the circumstances described. Each of the chapters focuses on a message from the New Testament and then uses the various situations in the strips to back up the discussion.I decided to read this book after several readings of a very dog-eared copy of \\"Parables of Peanuts\\" that I have had since my childhood. The message in Gospel is a lighter read, but no less entertaining and enlighting. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a new way to look at the Gospels and/or someone who loves Peanuts (like I do) and wants a new way to look at them."},{"Title":"The Gospel According To Peanuts","review":"this book is great! easy to understand by all ages.

The book gets better as it goes along."},{"Title":"The Gospel According To Peanuts","review":"Let me take a completely different approach than earlier reviewers here at Amazon -- to point out why I think many people still will enjoy this 1965 classic.Robert L. Short launched a very influential new genre in spiritual media with this book, a point that religious historian Martin Marty makes in the introduction to this newer edition. Short's book has sold more than 10 million copies -- and, essentially, made it safe for pastors and Bible-study teachers to pull lessons from popular media. More than four decades after this book took America by storm, we've now got entire congregations booking showings of new films like \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" and \\"The Nativity Story.\\" Short played an important, catalytic role in that whole creative trajectory.Is Robert Short a proper Christian, as some earlier Amazon reviewers have asked? Is his theology big enough? Or limited enough? Does he do theological damage to Peanuts? Does Peanuts do theological damage to us?They're all great questions -- but I'd humbly suggest they're precisely the questions that will fuel a great small-group study of Short's book, Schulz's comics and the gospels.As a journalist myself who has devoted more than 30 years of my life to work in American media, I would not for one moment claim that popular media -- and popular culture -- are entirely enlightened and spiritually uplifting. On the contrary -- media is a sea of messages, some inspiring and some depressing, some life-giving and some deadly.The power of Short's book in 1965 -- and today -- is in pointing us all to engaging in that analysis. We may very well disagree with some of Short's arguments in this book -- but it's a fun journey and, even though many others have followed him into this genre, the basic Peanuts book is a classic that still opens our eyes toward a joyous pilgrimage.If you do like this book -- check out Short's expansion on Schultz in his later book, \\"The Parables of Peanuts.\\" He even did a book on \\"The Gospel According to Dogs\\" with cartoons from various artists about dogs! And -- Short's back in 2008 with \\"The Parables of Dr. Seuss\\"!"},{"Title":"The Gospel According To Peanuts","review":"Seriously. this is so much fun to read with the kids on a lazy day. Like the message of course."},{"Title":"The Gospel According To Peanuts","review":"I don't think many people would be surprised that Charles Schulz used his popular \\"Peanuts\\" comics as a vehicle to convey Christian messages. In truth, at times, these messages were quite overt within the strip. So, at some levels, this book is merely stating the obvious. But beyond that, it is an argument for the appropriateness of using pop culture media as a vehicle for sharing Christian values. As noted here, the Church often becomes its own worst enemy when trying to spread the faith. So often its attempts are so heavy-handed that the non-believer is alienated by the approach and never has a chance to appreciate the true nature of the message. This is the value of conveying these ideals using popular culture methods. By entertaining the audience, it predisposes them to be more open to the content.While the argument is certainly valid, this book is a bit heavy on the theology, devoting the bulk of its pages to extracting possible Christian principles from a large number of Peanuts comic strips. This does show how the strip can be viewed as an evangelical vehicle, even when it isn't obvious, but the dense theological discussions weigh the book down and create some of the very problems that the author accuses the Church of facing in spreading its message.An interesting book that includes lots of entertaining Peanuts strips, there is some food for thought, especially for those who believe in the Christian ideal and are looking for more effective ways to spread the Word. But it requires more effort than seems reasonable for a book of its size."},{"Title":"The Gospel According To Peanuts","review":"I must have read this book long before I moved to Saint Paul, where Charles Schultz may well be more of a saint for these people who pride themselves in everything normal than the overactive apostle that the town is actually named for. As a comic, I would consider Peanuts much closer to the book of Job than to the Gospels. What I remember is a strip discussing Job, in which Lucy complains that Job's wife doesn't get enough credit. If that strip is not in this book, subtract a few stars from my rating and consider me confused by the serial process effect which is more like life than any sure foundation offered here. The main key to popularity in these things is the regularity: daily comics and church once a week form a framework that people can depend on because they fulfill expectations. In our comic society, split along lines of people who know the same jokes, there may be millions of people who would think of this book if I stole the sign from the neighborhood shrink booth, &quot;The Doctor is In&quot; as the title for my review of General Psychopathology by Karl Jaspers, who once wrote that his father had stopped attending church when he reached a certain age because he had been embarrassed by too many things that had been said there. It takes a lifetime of withdrawal from certain addictions to realize what people are going through now, as it may be a sad day when people realize that I have anything to say about this book. A little shared intimacy can hurt a lot more than the typical joke, but the experts spend all their time arguing about what is typical here. Is this the end?"},{"Title":"The Gospel According To Peanuts","review":"Robert L. Short has written a few books ostensibly attempting to interpret Schulz's Peanuts cartoons as Christian parables (another title of his is &quot;The Parables of Peanuts&quot;). What he really does is write short Christian homilies and use cartoons (or more frequently, isolated frames from a cartoon) to illustrate his points. Whether or not Schulz himself is a devout Christian, I couldn't say; I know he's spoken about his churchgoing, but not having read his biography I can't say anything for certain about his belief. What I would suggest with some force is that there is no Christian spirit in the Peanuts cartoons (I speak both as the son of a preacher and as a big fan of Peanuts - I've got sixty-odd books of them, more than I have by any other author.) Peanuts is, if anything, a kind of deadpan, sunlit hell, in which the characters never grow, never change, never escape from childhood, suffer unimaginable fears (think of Charlie Brown, always terrified of actually approaching the red-haired girl), labour under never-dispelled illusions (think of Charlie again, always believing he can kick the football; or Linus, who for all his theological acumen still believes in the Great Pumpkin - surely Schulz's most scathing comment on Christianity); they wreak appalling cruelties on each other (Lucy and her fists, Violet and her sharp tongue, Snoopy and his utter indifference to his owner), and generally remain locked into static relationships. This is not what most people think about Peanuts, but read them often enough and you soon discern the chilly pedal-point beneath the unassuming surface. What three phrases are the most used in the strip? &quot;Good grief!&quot;, &quot;AAUUGH!&quot; and &quot;I can't stand it...&quot; I recall one strip, in particular, set at a summer camp, in which Charlie Brown helped an even shyer little boy to come out of his shell and join in. The other boy then went home, and Charlie was left feeling proud of himself for having helped another. The following strip depicted the boy on the bus home, reflecting that that wasn't such a bad camp after all, and thinking of all the friends he made: &quot;...and then there was that round-headed kid...what was his name?&quot; Don't be put off by the Hallmark cards and sanctimonious books like Mr. Short's. There ain't no redemption in Peanuts. It's one of the great dark masterpieces of American fiction, and the pious ramblings of a book like this only trivialise it."},{"Title":"Douay-Rheims New Testament of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Translated from the Latin Vulgate","review":"The Douay-Rheims New Testament is a faithful word for word translation from Jerome's Latin Vulgate.

This book has remained one of my all time favorites for many years and is well complimented by it's sister books. What I like best about it is it's combination of fantastic and scientific aspects and realistic characters. The \\"hero\\", if he can be called that, is neither good hearted nor blundering, but cold, single minded and down-right terrifying - but you like him anyway - and that is one of the hardest things to do well in a story - it's worth reading just to get a chance to meet him.The story takes place on another planet called Erna, reached by ancient people from earth. The environment of Erna, for a change, is as rich and complex as the characters. Imagine an enviornment that can respond directly to your needs. But what humans need comes through in complex emotions, too complex for an alien world to interpret. Unfortunately, you may fall asleep in such a world and have a nightmare, and when you wake up it's really there - and ripping your legs off. C.S. Friedman does an excellent job of exploring the positive and negative aspects of this kind of environment. There are some nasty things which really go bump in the night which I can still picture clearly years after reading it. Another thing that sets this book apart is that at no time, that I can remember, does the author get trite or cute, but handles a large vision of the spiritual/supernatural and of human psychology with a straight-forwardness and realism that gets you involved from page 1.It's hard to talk about the characters too much without giving away the plot, but the reluctant comrades of this novel are one, completely self-serving, frightening mostly dead man (evil), one sword-wielding church enforcer (for lack of a better term - aka. good), one adept who can see and manipulate the planet's raw power (intellectual - wild card) and one apprentice (you guessed it, the weak link). The team joins forces under the only circumstances that could make them, a terrifying threat to the whole planet's survival. There are enough battles, intrigues, magic and trials to satisfy even the most jaded fantasy reader.So, in summary, if you want well constructed science ficition setting with a nice dash of terror, good psychological and emotional exploration from the characters, a little magic, the supernatural and a fantastic story, this is the place to look. The series continues and does an excellent job of rounding out not only the plot and the characters, but the complex ecology and nature of Erna. Won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"I really enjoyed the book tarnished gold. VC Andrews is my favorite author and the only books that even intrest me are the books that she has written. I really enjoy stories about real life things that go on in life. I have read a number of her books. This book is exspecially good because it had good suspense throughout the whole book, wondering what she would do next. When I was reading the book it made me want to be there and see all the beautiful sights that she saw in the swamp. I think that this was a great book and I am really excited to read the rest of the series, it is so addictive. So I think that the book was definetly a five star book, maybey even a six."},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"Standard formulaic V. C. Andrews/Ghostwritten fair. A pretty young girl, sexual trauma in her background and a seducer. Gabrielle (called Gabriel for some unknown reason) is seduced by a wealthy cannery owner and gives birth to a son named Paul who will later unknowingly fall in love with his half-sister, Ruby.It's just another tired fraternal incest installment and twins are part of the Landry series as well.

People in this time of age are more concerned with morals and values -sex before marriage is completely out of the question. Catherine Landry is portrayed to bring out the goodness in her family particularily in her corrupted husband, Jack. Her daughter, Gabriel however does not even listen to her mother's beliefs of Pierre who is merely using her youthful body for the sake of his own satisfaction. Gabriel does whatever she wishes, ends up pregnant, and just adds to her mother's misery. Her mother, however who is preaching such values is a hypocrite for she too became pregnant with Gabriel before her marriage to Jack. Gabriel and her mother both lack respect and this shows us that the Landry family are not in fact that concerned with morality and values in a time of age in which those attributes of life are most important."},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"I enjoyed the book very much.

The book was good, but does anyone else get the feeling that the person writing this book was not paying attention to details in 'Ruby' or vice versa? I mean in 'Tarnished' Gabriel (Gabrielle) is blonde, innocent, naieve and raped by Pierre Tate. But in ruby she is described as having red/auburn hair, being kind of a tease (taking advantage of her looks and the fact that boys like her), and had an affair with Pierre tate. And Gladys tate was described as fair and blonde in 'Tarnished' and totally afraid of sex, which didn't seem like it would go away soon. And then in Ruby she is described as 'dark' and has 2 kids after Paul. Argh!It just really bugs me that those details couldn't even be kept the same considering they are in the same series and I believe the same ghost writer. I never realized it the first time I read it because it was over 10 years ago, but man it really makes this ghost writer look bad. Did anyone else have an issue with this?"},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"Although this book was written last in the series as a prequel, when I recieved the whole set as a gift, I read this one first.

The only person who cared was Gladys Tate.The same goes with when she got pregnant with twins by Pierre. It's cute to know that Gisselle was the first to be born, and Ruby was the last!!!

Once she landed, she past away in real life."},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"I really liked this book. I too, have noticed the \\"Trademarks\\" of V.C. Andrews. There are always twins, always incest and always some terrifying experience that requires a massive amount of strength to get through. The grandmothers (And sometimes the mothers) Always seem to be evil as well. There is also the name swapping and misspellings. I would recommend you read this book first, before the rest of the series. I really like how it answered a lot of the questions I had at the very end of the series. It is an all around good read.

This is absolutely the worst book in the Landry series. This book is even worse than the entire horrendous Melody series.Why do I hate this book so much?Well, it's absolutely, 100% unbelievable. The GW tries his best to write from the viewpoint of a teenage girl, but fails miserably. None of the characters in this book felt developed at all to me. They were all stereotypical and flat, and the plot was just the same plot we've seen since V.C.'s death replayed once again with different characters and a different setting.There was no flow to the story, the major plot points weren't built up to properly, or at all. All of the actions undertaken by the heroine were completely unbelievable. Again, I believe this is the fault of a writer unskilled at writing from the viewpoint of a young woman.The main problem with the story is the romance between Gabrielle (or Gabriel as she is referred to in this book) and Pierre. In what I can only assume is an effort to keep the book to an acceptable number of pages, the relationship develops much too quickly, with the two being pained to be apart instantly. What follows is just too flowery and awful to endure, really. Then, the relationship ends just as abruptly, and it all goes downhill from there.I honestly cannot think of even one redeeming quality about this book, and cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"Tarnished Gold is an interesting book, but i think that the plot is not that great. Why would Gabriel give up her babies? The first time she gave up Paul, I understood. Frankly, I felt sorry for her. But the second time, Gabriel is just so dumb. Although she kept one of the twins, why would she agree to give up her baby for Daphne?? Why?? Because Daphne sweet talk her. I think that Gabrielle doesn't really love her babies. Once she met Pierre, she forgot about Paul(the baby she gave up!) I think that Gabrielle is just infatuated (not in love with Pierre). I can't believe some said that this book has impacted in their lives. Tis true that Gabrielles struggle to keep her life together is truely inspiring...but giving away your babies just because of reputation?? Gabrielle even said that she gave up Paul so he can have a good life. How can Paul have a good life? Octavious (his supposed-to-be-father is a rapist) and Gladys (eccentric supposed-to-be-mother) doesn't even care for him. Gabrielle knows this but still she doesn't care. Like she said...\\"This is the best for Paul.\\" Well, it isn't! The best for Paul is for you to take care of him!Sorry, I got so carried away to the story. The story would have been great if the ending was different...Oh well...some of you may say this is just a story. I guess it is but.....

She is missing her baby and wonders if she will ever find her true love when one bayou morning she meets Pierre.Though he is married he tells her he loves her and love hungry Gabriel believes him but all Pierre does is prance around painting pretty pictures in the sky.Then a thunderstorm erupts over their love when Gabriel tells him she's pregnant and the oh so brave Pierre scampers away like a little rabbit back to the protection of his New Orleans mansion.Gabriel is shattered at the loss of Pierre but the final blow comes one night when a limousine pulls up to her humble shack.

If that was me, I would of got rid of him the first chance that i had but I guess that is not easy when your in love as much she was. When she gave up the first child that she had after she got raped by Octvious and then got pregant. I thought she would of had some sense in her mind to not give up the second baby. I think she was smart to keep the other twin when she was pregant the second time by Pierre, because now she can feel what the tate's feeled when she gave the first baby to them after she was raped by Octvious."},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"Pierre and gabrielle the prefect coupal if oly pierre wasnt married!

This was the very first VCA book I read and never had I been so touched. I have never met a character quite like like Gabrielle, so absorbed in nature and so unaffected by material possesions, boys, and other teenager wants. Her mother is one fantastic woman, and her father, well, a well dimensioned snake. All the characters were exceptionally complex, Gladys was one deranged woman, Octavious a confused sinner yet sinned against fool, Pierre an idealistic weakling. The plots were gripping and taught a very important lesson: innocence is precious but never be too trusting and project your own innocence onto others, expecting everyone to be just as good natured as you."},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"According to the blurb on the book jacket, this fifth book in the Landry series is actually the prequel, and in fact, I'm reading it at the right time ie. before I read any of the others. This famous series has been made into movies, including \\"Flowers in the Attic\\". Gabriel Landry is the daughter of two Cajuns, living in the swamp land of a Louisiana bayou. Her mother Catherine is a \\"traiteur\\", a healer and a midwife and is much loved and respected by all. Her father Jack is a whiskey swilling, no-good dead beat who is always looking for an easy way to make money without working for it. Gabriel is completely at home in the swamps with her animals and plants and falls easy prey to a lecherous, wealthy neighbour who rapes her when he finds her alone in the swamp. When she discovers she is pregnant, her father makes a deal with the neighbour's wife to hide Gabriel in her house until the baby is born so that no one will know of Gabriel's disgrace and the neighbours may pass off the baby as their own. After the birth, Gabriel sees her baby son only a few times and from a distance. A year passes and this poor, naive(stupid?) girl once again falls victim to a rich man, but this time, very willingly, and the same process starts again, with Gabriel agreeing to give up her baby to the rich couple, to raise as their own. The baby, Ruby, is apparently the star of M/s Andrews first book, and, although this review reads like a gigantic soapie, I'll now simply HAVE to find this first book, Ruby!"},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"This is the 5th V.C. Andrews series that I've read & I need to start taking my own advice and read the 5th book in the series before I read the others. The 5th book is always the actual beginning of the series & I have no clue why it's like that. You already know everything that happens so I can never make myself finish the last book because there are other books that I'd rather be reading. I'm sure if I had read this book first I would've really enjoyed it but I just see no reason to read a book where you already no everything that happens. Overall though, this is my least favorite V.C. Andrews's series. It was just o.k. for me. Nothing special."},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"You know right away what happens to Gabriel when you start reading 'Ruby', so reading this book is a bittersweet experience. It was nice to see a time where Jack and Catherine were happy together - at least some of the time. I can't help but wonder what would happen if Gisselle had inherited some kind of gift, since it seems to run in the Grandmere bloodline. Anyhoo, Gabriel comes off as a very likeable character. She's very sweet and loving - maybe a bit too sweet for some - but she was a character I was genuinely fond of so it's hard to take what happens to her at the hands of Octavarius Tate.I feel that Gladys was a bit overdone with the revelation of what had happened to her as a child, and she knew of Jack's reputation, so she should have made her offer directly to Gabriel, or Catherine should have been the one Gladys went to Still, this is a good book, and a rather bittersweet one. Definitely one of the ghostwriter's better books."},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"I have read every book by VCA herself and every VCA book that the GW has written. I am also the webmaster of a large VCA site called Midnight Whispers and feel that I am qualified enough to say that this book was the best in the series and one of the best books yet. You can really feel for Gabrielle as she goes through the trials and tribulations that occured in her short life. Her romance with Pierre is just like Romeo and Juliet - sweet and tragic. You can't help but picture the setting of New Orleans during the time of the book and you can almost feel as if you are there. The imagery is wonderful and complex and the book just flows. I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"Virginia sait toujours trouver les mots pour nous transporter dans ces merveilleuses aventures.J'ai devorer ce livre.Je l'ai lut en 2 jours.Le pere de Gabrielle etait vraiment sans coeur,avavt de mourir Gabrielle aura connut l'amour avec son beau Pierre..."},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"I usually hate reading books, but when i started reading V.C. Andrew's book entitled, Tarnished Gold I couldn't stop reading. This book kept me wanting to continue to read to find out what happens next.A southern girl named Gabriel goes through many ordeals in this book. She faces many situations that causes her heart to break and teaches her lessons. At the beginning of the book, Gabriel is just a little girl playing outside in her yard. She finds a dying bird under a tree and wants her mother to heal the baby bird. Her mother could throw away her baby and her mother tells Gabriel with time she will understand. Gabriel later on understands when she gets raped by a rich man named Octavious Tate and gets pregnant. Gabriel decides to allow Octavious's wife Gladys to act pregnant and take the baby as her own. Gabriel had to live in the Tate mansion during her entire pregnancy, secluded from everything around her. She felt the baby would have a better life living with the Tate's rather than herself. For months a plague rested in Gabriel's heart causing her lots of pain. This gives meaning to the saying, \\"you don't know what you got till its gone.\\" Everything is gloomy until she meets a young man from New Orleans named Pierre Dumas. He gives her a new meaning of life and they fall in love with each other. Gabriel thing finds out Pierre is married, but is very much unhappy and not in love with his wife. She is torn on what she should do; follow her heart or mind. I don't want to give away what happens so go read the book.This book contains romance, deceit, and lust. It had me laughing one minute and crying the next. Everything was wonderful about this book except for the very last page. I was on the edge of my seat every moment of the way while reading this book, until the end when the breaks got slammed and threw my body back into the seat. It lessened my views about this book but not completely. Tarnished Gold is still a very exciting and wonderful book so don't let the ending stray you away from reading it. [I didn't like the ending], but everyone has different views on certain endings. So you never know if you are the kind who fancies the ending like the one in Tarnished Gold.I recommend this book to anyone wo loves novels that contain sex drive and romance. This book is also more for teenage women. Southern women could be drawn to this book because of the fact it is located in Louisianna Bayo. I would not recommend this book to people who like novels wit sci-fi or lots of action. I would also not recommend this book for any man becuase this book is extremely sexist against them. Please do not let any of these recommendations change your decisions on reading Tarnished Gold. If you think you would like to read this book then I say, \\"Go for it!\\""},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"This final book in the wonderful Landry series goes back to before Ruby's time, to Gabriel Landry, her mother. I can't say that this was my favorite book in the series, but then, that's only because each seperate book has, in my mind, molded together to form one story, and I even find it difficult to distinguish them sometimes. Anyway, I just want to say that this series is absolutely addictive, and anyone and everyone can get attached to it in a split second. This is also one of the most well thought out and well writen endings I have ever read (which is not uncommon with V.C. Andrews' books), despite how sad and empty it made me feel afterward. But that's only because I get really involved in my books. Anyway, I reccommend this books to all the V.C. Andrews fans out there, and to anyone else who's looking 4 some inspiration and insight on life. And just by the way, I'm only 14, and I can't even begin to describe how deeply this book has impacted my life. That's how touching and beautiful it is...V.C.

Some connect... are a series.In the lectures several things are recorded:- Dreams, relationships with planets and the three parts of soul (sentient, intellectual, conscious).- Dreams and recognizing presentation of ether body, astral body and I in the dreams.- Dreams and relationship to spiritual cognition / awareness... in terms of symbolism and that dreams are of present Eartly sojourn and what one dreams is testament of what will be in future sojourns, while spiritual cognition is about previous Earthly sojourns and essence... i.e. essence as related to all, and not specific to individual as in dreams.- One chapter on Imaginition (a.k.a. Imaginitive Cognition - the first (or only) level of clairvoyance.)- That there are only two types of dreams: related to I and related to astral body.- The relationship between own will-power and state of dreams...The book started out kinda weak... not much about dreams, but more about other things and the word 'dream(s)' was used in the lecture.Lecture 9 is OK... lecture 10 starts to get very interesting... from lecture 10 on the lectures become more in-depth. Lecture 13 about interpretation of dreams: very strong... talks about how own will works dreams .... and how what one dreams is the only thing one does in real life... the rest is done by \\"the Gods\\" (other beings).Chapter 14 I found interesting from the viewpoint that Rudolf Steiner had lectured how dreams differ with people who are \\"gifted\\" - e.g. with Imaginitive Cognition. How images in dreams are then more defined / more sharply outlined... and with higher levels of spiritual awareness, more interaction (for someone who has Inspired) and more as feeling one with the dreams / being part of it (Intuitive).The book started out with not so much info on dreams... more about other things and then dreams were mentioned.The later lectures (from 9 on) go more and more about dreams... except for lecture 14 which is about Imaginitive Cognition, and at the end of the lecture there is an comparison made with dreams of those not gifted with spiritual cognition and how dreams differ from those with Imaginitve Cognition specificallyIn conclusion: the book contains lectures about how planets, three parts of the Soul (sentient, intellectual, conscious) and four parts of the Body (physical, ether, astral and I) are related to dreams. I found the explanations very spiritual for a layman and some relatively hard to understand for those not gifted with \\"seeing the Spiritual world\\". For example:It is mentioned that there are two types of dreams: (1) related to Self, (2) related to physical organs. Well... there is an explanation in the lecture, but not mentioned directly, that in the 1st kind of dream images could relate to:(a) own person - 1 dimensional dreams(b) receiving from other person in the Earth one is tuned into - 2-dimensional dreamsThis could be the case when both you and the other person (that one is tuned into) have the same kind of experiences, same kind of dreams, therefore same kind of vibrations, vibrations resonate and then (part of) experiences from the other person could become part of one's own dream. This could happen when the burden is too much for the other person to handle all at once and you help the other person by taking part of the load.(c) A non- (or dis)incarnated entity - from \\"spirit world\\" decides to share some information in the dream. - 3 dimensional dreams.There are also \\"predictive dreams\\" (aka 4-dimensional dreams)... dreams projected in the 4th dimension (= dimension where different points in time meet: say future meets present, so that future is experienced as present).Also... there is mentioned that symbolic images have to do with the astral body... Well... when person, who is dreaming, lacks the rational abilty (= I ability) to rational / understand the information in the dream, the information is translated into symbols... much like souls in higher spheres don't have names (like in the Earth) but are known as symbol (like the symbol Prince, or Artist Formerly Known as Prince, used for example).What it comes down to is that when ratio fails, feeling takes over... like a fairytale is more \\"felt\\" when a person does not get the spiritual message rationally. In fact, there comes a point that things are not able to be rationalized anymore because rationally places limitations of life which higher spiritual life does not have... i.e. there comes a point where trying to rationalize something - mean limiting it - leads to confusion because one tries to limit sometime to a point where one does not see the whole... Information then turns to symbols, and eventually moves beyond that --- one simply \\"knows\\"...Another example for 2nd kind of dreams: related to physical organs... well, related to 12 spiritual aspects of life... each aspect being related to a part of the physical body. I.e. testicles developed under influence of one aspect / is related to one aspect, while stomach is related to another.I therefore recommend another book were examples of 1-,2-,3- and 4-dimensional dreams are given and explained. Additionally, in the book I recommend, it is recorded what dreams are in essence (images from memory - that one has stored in memory but had not time to process during daytime consciousness / waking time) in more layman terms.In the book is NOT recorded about 12 spiritual aspects of life and how they related to parts of the physical body.Recommendation:Dromen Paragnostisch verklaard (1984)By G. van der ZeeuwISBN 9020205668Publisher: Ankh-Hermes bvLanguage: Dutch"},{"Title":"La solitude du dserteur : Un autiste raconte son combat pour rejoindre notre monde (French Edition)","review":"The opening of this book really irritated me. The very statements that people on the autism/Asperger's (a/A) spectrum don't relate to others and that nothing registers are not only illogical, but are harmful fallacies. People with autism, which is a neurobiological condition have difficulty communicating and responding to stimuli based on the severity of the condition. Suggesting that nothing registers with people who have autism is a crock.I also didn't like the way people with autism were compared to Rain Man. Seriously, I wish that 1988 movie had never been made because I am really sick of the savant stereotype being dumped on the autistic population! The term \\"Rain Man\\" has become a slur in many a/A circles for this very reason. The irony of it all is that savantism only affects less than 10% of people with autism! I also wish I had an umbrella with the Autism Puzzle design, with the logo \\"Rain Man Busters\\" to ward off these tired misstatements. Saying one knows about autism based on one fictitious character is tantamount to saying that one has been to Paris when they've only been to Charles De Gaulle Airport!Tired, disproved myths about autism such as refusal to speak due to trauma and having no desire to communicate were rampant throughout this book. Bull manure! The desire to communicate is inherent in all people regardless of neurobiology and autism affects that part of people's lives. The irony of it all is that Dr. Asperger, the man who first described this form of autism in 1944 wrote many works IN GERMAN about it as well as its spectrum partner, autism. When Birger was born in 1973, the ironic claim that \\"little about autism was known in Germany\\" at the time is all the more reason to question the veracity of this book. Niko and Elisabeth Tinbergen's writings are cited and they, too have touted questionable claims. They support the asinine and disproved \\"refrigerator parent\\" theory and claim that forcing people with autism to endure hugs against their will is a sure-fire cure, which it most emphatically is not. If such were the case, then \\"curing\\" autism would have a 100% success rate!Many parts of this book really bothered me. The \\"facilitated communication\\" technique is praised throughout the book as the key to Birger Sellin, an individual with severe autism. Sellin is nonverbal and has allegedly been able to communicate via poetry through this method.There are too many unanswered questions about facilitated communication. This book fails to mention that in the majority of cases, the facilitator's hand is typing the messages and that it is the facilitator's thoughts that are being expressed, not those of the person with autism. In 99% of the controlled studies performed on this method of communication have shown this to be the case. In many instances, the facilitator forcibly holds the person with autism's hand down on the keys to make it appear that the the person with autism is doing the typing.Small wonder Sellin's meltdowns and extreme frustration appear to be exacerbated since the advent of facilitated communication in his life. One wonders if Sellin is actually doing the typing. At no time are these questions addressed in this book.Don't just take this with a grain of salt. Take it with a whole BOX of salt!"},{"Title":"Beneath the Raven's Moon","review":"Catherine Carmichael learns that she has been named as one of the heirs in her Uncle Malcolm Blount's estate. Catherine has not seen her deranged uncle, an author compared with Poe for his horror tales, since her mother fled their jointly shared upstate New York castle over two decades ago. Though she does not need the money, the London Symphony Orchestra concert pianist is curious about her renowned relative and wants to find out anything about her father who vanished just before her mother and she fled Ravenswood Castle.At the castle, Catherine meets three other beneficiaries, actor Everett Steele, an illegitimate cousin Billy Fortune, and her uncle's agent Madeline Treadwell. The estate lawyer Jacob Steiner plays a video in which Malcolm manipulates everyone from the grave as he did in life to play in his game of inheritance. As Everett and Catherine fall in love strange things happen as if the castle possesses an evil presence that no one can escape as the ice has stranded everyone.BENEATH THE RAVEN'S MOON is an intriguing modern day gothic romance with an eerie Twilight Zone twist that will shock the audience. The story line has all the elements of the sub-genre so much so that readers will feel the foreboding atmosphere through Catherine's concerns and contrast that with her growing love for Everett. Though some purists may dislike the closing coil, Emily LaForge knits a delightful tale that most gothic fans will savor.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Beneath the Raven's Moon","review":"I normally do not post bad reviews; however, by the first page I had this unresistable urge to break out the proverbial red pen and start making corrects. For a die hard reader the fact that I never made it past the 3rd chapter is a telling comment. I've better things than to spend my free time reading poorly written books. I'd rather clean my toilet."},{"Title":"Beneath the Raven's Moon","review":"I really wanted to like this book... the setting was amazing, the mystery behind the characters was a bit intriguing, but.... alas, the overall story was actually a bit dull. The author tried so hard to create suspense in this story that it ended up crawling at a snail's pace. The \\"paranormal\\" elements of the story were not really all that interesting and were slim compared to the dragging suspense. And as far as the romance between the leading lady and her dashing hero, I would say it was lukewarm at best. And I can't stress enough how annoying it is to have everything explained and clarified in what seems to be a hurried rapid fire mess of a last chapter. I would say this book had some potential, but just wasn't executed to the full extent that it could have been."},{"Title":"Beneath the Raven's Moon","review":"that doesn't mean it stuck strictly to the Gothic romance formula most writers use.I expected it to lean much more on the Supernatural. For the story to be supernatural in its very nature.It wasn't.I have to admit that I didn't see the twist at the ending, but I found the secret of the story and the ending to be preposterous. I don't think it fit well.However, the writing is more than decent and the characters are well fleshed out.It kept me totally engrossed for several hours."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"Well, I struggled through this one, putting it down several times for a week or more at a time. The biggest problem with this book? The characters engage in pages-long soliloquies in order to fill in the story. I know it worked for Shakespeare, but it just isn't working here. If I ever engaged in a conversation where the other person was giving me five-minute speeches like this I would go to sleep, or go hang myself.The next biggest problem? Very sterotypical & flat characters. The wife is your stereotypical angry witch-wife. The protagonist is your stereotypical good-guy-trying-to-deal-with-angry-witch-wife. No story or relationship is that simple. It would have been much more interesting to read if these main characters had been realistic, or had realistic interactions. Neither one of the main characters inspires your pity or your interest. What is interesting about reading about a dysfunctional family & crumbling marriage -- all of which is failing because of two completely selfish & self-serving people? They can't even be bothered to take proper care of their children. This sort of family tragedy is all too common & isn't appealing when it is glorified as just a \\"life choice\\" & portrayed so unrealistically in its affects on the people involved. I was also appalled that the character was so \\"moved\\" by the events of 9/11 that he felt inspired to abandon his marriage & family, and that this is portrayed as perfectly reasonable & good behavior--all while remaining extremely critical of his wife for doing the same thing.This book was hard to read because of its long, unrealistic character speeches, its unrealistic characters acting like stereotypes. And the ending is just disappointing & makes me feel a bit pessimistic about the whole human condition."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"I really enjoyed this book; however, I felt the book ended before the story was done. I feel like it's all still hanging in midair. I HOPE MR. PILCHER DOES A SEQUEL SO I CAN HAVE SOME CLOSURE!Some of the characters were more developed than the others. I understood Dan re-evaluating his life, family and career (I did the same thing, having myself been laid off from a dot.com company in July just before 9/11). I did NOT understand Jackie (nor did I like her much - which was probably the point of her), however from Dan's reminiscences of their early relationship I would have thought she would have more depth and character than to abandon her entire family - she struck me as the martyr type.With all of that, I must say I quite enjoyed myself. I'm a huge Rosamunde Pilcher fan and find Robin to be an equally satisfying author."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"I enjoyed this book for its contrasting settings and characters. The main character is Dan Porter who faces problems the rest of us confront too. He is a man who cares about his family and enjoys his career. Quite suddenly he loses his job in the the dot com crash. After about 20 years of marriage Dan and his wife find they have different goals. Dan goes to rural Scotland for one day to check into a business venture and ends up staying much longer. I especially liked the author's description of Scotland and and the prawn packing plant.

I no longer attempt to compare his writings with his mother's. He stands alone and he's doing a splendid job. I have been a fan of Rosamunde Pilcher for quite a while now having read every one of her novels and enjoying them thoroughly."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"After two false starts, Robin Pilcher has come into his own with his newest novel, &quot;A Risk Worth Taking.&quot;This is the story of Londoner Dan Porter, a dot-com wunderkind whose entire fairytale life falls apart on 9/11, when he loses several close and dear friends in New York, and is subsequently laid off (made redundant, as the Brits say) due to the crash of the dot-com industry. As the book opens, Dan is a house husband, dealing with his three surly teenagers and his equally surly wife Jackie, a high-powered executive in her own right who has no patience or sympathy with her husband's jobless condition.Dan is going in circles, both emotionally and professionally, when, on pure whim (unlike him completely), he suddenly decides to invest in a Scottish clothing company he has read about in a magazine. Dan's trip to Scotland, his subsequent reawakening, the friends he makes, and the unexpected turns he experiences, both in his own life, and that of his three children, change him, his marriage, his view of life, and his very soul forever.I could not turn the pages fast enough to finish this wonderful book, and I am thrilled that Robin Pilcher has finally found his way, free of his mother's formidible reputation and finally able, like Dan Porter, to stand on his own. Bravo, Robin! Well done indeed."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"A Risk worth Taking follows the adventures of Dan Porter, unemployed, unsuccessful house husband of career-driven wife, and father of three. Dan impulsively goes to Scotland, gets himself involved with a woman running a mail-order business, and changes his life completely.Trouble is that Dan and the other characters are entirely two-dimensional, the plot dreadfully contrived, and the whole tale boringly predictable. All Robin Pilcher's male characters are somewhat similar - selfish, irresponsible and foolish. The women are all sex objects, with the occasional career thrown in to make it PC. The kids are cardboard cut-outs from a \\"choose your own problem child\\" handbook. Throw in the odd Type A, B, or C businessman/politician, etc., and there you have it.This level of writing and story-telling is acceptable if you want something like a \\"Woman's Own\\" story. If you want something a little more creative and challenging, more of a meal than a gooey doughnut with your cup of tea, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"Rosamunde Pilcher is one of my favorite authors. Sadly, her son, Robin Pilcher, cannot pull off a writing coup such as his mother's immortal \\"Shell Seekers\\" or \\"Winter Soltice\\", books guaranteed to give you a long, cozy read, full of well-crafted characters, meticulous descriptions and highly enjoyable narrative. Robin Pilcher's work provides nothing but doom and gloom, with stiffly written characters, forced plot lines, inconclusive and feeble endings, and a boring storyline. I read this entire book because I kept hoping it would get better, but unfortunately it did not improve. I find Pilcher's writing stilted and his characters shallow. His plot is obvious, the conclusion even more so. For more enjoyable reading, check out the wonderful writings of Rosamunde Pilcher, acclaimed British novelist."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"This book was awful. First of all, it took just about half the book to get to the real plot. (It followed a couple other potential plot threads first before the author settled on one.) Once the plot was settled on, the ending was easy to determine. No need to read the rest of the book.I won't be reading another one by this author."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"Like many of Robin Pilcher's readers, I tried a second book by him (the first was \\"Starting Over\\") in a vain attempt to find something similar to the books written by the author's far more talented mother, Rosamunde Pilcher, who, sadly, has stopped writing. Again -- a complete disappointment. Robin Pilcher has learned some of his mother's narrative skills but has never managed to make any of his characters into someone most of us actually want to read about: Dan Porter is another obtuse, unlikeable man, whose wife I wholeheartedly symphathize with -- I'd leave him too. Pilcher's characters are shallow and uninteresting, with ridiculous motivations (for example, why would Dan Porter decide to \\"stay home for his family,\\" turning down all job offers and knowingly causing chaos in the process; but neglect to tell his family about his reasons for doing so?).I have trudged through two Robin Pilcher novels and I won't try another one. For those who think they might like to read this book, I strongly urge them to start with the Rosamunde Pilcher novels instead."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"I didn't think that I would enjoy this book when I picked it up. And while reading it, I was amazed at how much I was getting into the story. I say this because it really lacks a driving plot. Maybe because I have read way to many mysteries and thrillers where its almost impossible to break the mold of tradition where you start in point x and end in point y that it was very enjoyable to be swept up in a story where you truly do not know what was going to happen next.The author, Pilcher also does a great job of second hand story telling. By this I mean he will have a character sit down say in a pub and tell an engrossing tale to another character which allows for the reader to be swept off on a tangent. I found that Pilcher really knows what he is doing when it comes to moving a story along and it was hard to put down this title because of that.Lastly, the only fault that I found here was that besides the main character 'Dan the Man,' the supporting cast was not fleshed out very well. I liked Dan and found him to be very human as he was undergoing a life transforming change. But the others in the book (his children, mother, wife, and acquaintances) were not pushed as far as they could have been. They change, but the change is too simple.I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Robin's first book when it first came out years ago, and I was happy to see this one on the shelf. I needed a quick read in between reading books for review ~~ and this one fit the bill.Dan Porter is unemployed and his wife is getting highly irritated with him as she has to work fulltime in her career and keep things going. His two daughters are upset with him because they couldn't go to their expensive private school where they were very happy. Dan Porter was living a life based nearly on depression ~~ ever since he got laid off just before 9/11. When he reads of an interview of this woman in Scotland who started up a clothing business right off the ground ~~ and that the business was for sale, he thought perhaps he should go check it out. His son, Josh, offered to come with him and together they started off on an adventure that changed their lives and outlook on life completely.It's a quick read and very entertaining. Some of the conversations can be wordy but that's what is so entertaining about them. This is just a brief glimpse into a life of a frustrated man who decided that working for fast money isn't just enough anymore. And yes, his wife is a stereotypical character, angry at him all the time ~~ but even there, the reasons for her affair are so flimsy and weak ~~ that is really the weakest part of the novel. But fortunately, she doesn't figure into the novel as much as Dan and Josh are.It's a comforting read. And I think it is fair to say that Robin will not be confused with his mom who is one of my favorite authors. He has a totally different style of writing and his way is just as interesting and engrossing ~~ with a modern flair to ages-old issues of love, infidelity and life. It's a good bet that his book won't be considered boring.4-11-05"},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"Dan Porter believes his life is near perfect as he has a wonderful job with a dot com firm, married to a loving wife for twenty years, and three precocious children. However, when his company hits bad times, the policy of last in first out leaves Dan unemployed. Meanwhile his wife Jackie is managing director of Rebecca Talworth Design Limited, but makes little money as profits are returned to the company.Dan fails to get a new job, which leads to a tear in his relationship with Jackie because she feels he has become complacent while their lifestyle slips. When he reads an article in Women's Weekly about a small Scottish firm Vagabonds needing help to expand, he races north while Jackie is on the continent on business. Though the makers of the popular \\"Vaggas\\" is not what Dan expected, he finds his life changes perhaps even more than when he lost his dot com job, but Jackie's resentment grows.This is an engaging character study of a person who once was riding the crest, but since has lost his self esteem. He begins to regain his confidence with his trip to Scotland, but the cost may prove too high. The cast is a delightful ensemble, especially Dan, his family, and the Turnbows (owners of Vagabonds).

This book faces changes in a few lives, including Dan's, at a slow \\"real time\\" pace. This novel does not have a quick, to- the-point plot, but instead it is a story of daily normal domestic (some very humorous) situations lived by interesting characters going through changes in their lives and lifestyles and how these changes are molded by the decisions made in the course of the story. I did like this book a lot, I believe all of the characters are interesting and all of the secondary characters could have been a tad more enticing if their personalities had been developed a touch more. Nevertheless, what I loved the most is that while reading this book, I was permanently reminded of Fort William and I was amazed of how well the author has caught the daily rhythm of life of a Scottish highlands town. For me, it was like being there."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"I've read both of his previous efforts, loved &quot;An Ocean Apart&quot; frowned over &quot;Starting Over&quot;. This book I enjoyed for the development of its principal character. The motivations and decisions that Dan Porter made were clear to me. I could only give it three stars as I felt some of the characters were superficially developed. His wife Jackie for example, I had no sense how she felt about her children, what motivated her to not consider custody of them, what was so attractive about Stephen. And Kate, the pivotal action she took was out of the blue, Maxwell Borthwick was a flat caricature. All of this aside, Pilcher has a lovely way with words, an adept, preceptive and warm manner in his presentation of children and adolescents, and wins me over every time portraying friendships of kindred spirits. I have to admit to taking him as he came, I haven't read any of Rosamund Pilcher's books, if having that name before him enhanced his being published, I am glad for it."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"Mr. Pilcher puts together a fine story focusing on relationships and personal transformation. His characters are believable though not too deep or complex. The story moves along and is interesting.I listened to the cd of the book, and the narrator does an exceptional job reading the book and speaking for the characters' accents. You will thoroughly enjoy listening to him. I found myself sitting in the parked car to continue to listen--it is the audio equivalent of a page turner.I think this is well-written and fluid and explores some of the dynamics in today's family that has two working parents trying to fulfill themselves in careers and family."},{"Title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"Superb writer---my favorite author!!!

Historical Jesus scholars assume Christianity began in Palestine and spread from there. They put their theoretical feet too firmly in Palestine, when Christianity was actually a product of the Hellenistic urban world, which somewhat violently took over the old, thus respectable, Jewish scriptures to give credibility to the new, Christian religion.Rieser has his theoretical feet firmly planted in the urban Roman empire, with an emphasis on my favored period of 70-313 CE, with a bit of focus on the pivotal change after that as the Christian religion became officially accepted and then co-opted and mandated by the same kind of power hierarchy it was originally designed to resist.Rieser recommends we study the detailed socio-economic realities of Palestine as a backdrop for religious, pseudo-historical, edifying political fiction. He shows how Christianity was started by the Jews of the Diaspora. It was soon taken over and fully Hellenized by the lower class throughout the Roman Empire (with an increasingly artificial Jewish veneer).Christianity arrived last, not first, in Palestine -- that's why Christian archeological finds appear in Rome but not in Judea until the fourth century. Jesus, the Apostles, and Paul are entirely fictional, though loosely based on types of actual individuals. Christianity was initially started by Jews, though these were the very heavily Hellenized Diaspora Jews, not the less-Hellenized Jews in Palestine.The heavily Hellenistic communities gradually invented and pulled together the pseudo-historical single figure and retroactively set him into the pre-70, Palestine backdrop.Once you abandon Historical Jesus -- and Historical Apostles and Historical Paul and that whole way of thinking -- many superior theoretical options open up for understanding the early Christian religion in terms of a mythically allegorized socio-political counter-religion to the hierarchical honor-hyperinflating system of divinized Caesar. (I would point out that it also opens up the researcher's ability to think of earliest Christianity in terms of mythic allegory that describes and conveys primary religious experiencing.)Christianity was almost immediately co-opted by the gentile lower class of the large cities of the Roman Empire, especially Rome, Alexandria, and the cities of Asia Minor (just to the east of Greece, including Byzantium/Constantinople), with increasing animosity between the Hellenists and Jews. The Hellenist lower class found the Hellenic transformed version of the Jewish Diaspora messiah religion to be useful politically.When Christianity finally arrived in Palestine, the Jews there shunned it as alien, unfamiliar, and just another attempt to invade and corrupt Israel with Hellenism.Rieser mentions the central importance of sacred meals in mystery religions and mentions Jesus as the \\"drug, or pharmakos, of immortality\\", but has no insight into entheogenic experiential allegory. Why would wine and bread deserve to be placed at the center of any Hellenistic religion? Historical and socio-political treatments such as this tend to completely omit religious experiencing from their theory of Christianity.They assume that the ritual makes the eucharist or sacrament seem potent, rather than vice versa. Though Rieser explains how the Hellenized transformation of the messiah story was politically meaningful and useful to the Hellenes, he doesn't mention that it was also fully amenable to allegorically expressing the standard core mystery-religion with a storyline that is fictionally set in Palestine rather than in the mythic realm as such.Instead of a story about a mythic Prometheus chained to a rock, or a mythic Attis tied to or encased in a tree trunk, or Isaac bound to the altar, the pseudo-historical Jesus figure is fastened to a cross, just like (as Rieser states) the actual rebel slaves and underclass in Rome or in Judea.Rieser has only passing, shallow coverage of the mystery religions. But if the Hellenistic mystery-religion mythic storylines were intended to describe the initiation experiences encountered by the mystery-religion initiate after consuming something sacred, the pseudo-historical Jesus storyline may also be experienced firsthand after the Christian initiate partakes of a Last Supper before entering the kingdom of God that is revealed when time ends.Rieser provides plenty of hooks for such an explanation, but, like almost all the overly historical-oriented modern researchers, is unable to treat this experiential allegory dimension which calls out for coverage.Rieser reduces religion to the socio-political realm instead of recognizing the overlaid, richly interpenetrating layers of political allegory and mystic-state experiential allegory. The mythic-only Christ theorists Freke and Gandy, conversely, explain experiential initiation in the original Christian religion, in The Jesus Mysteries, and in Jesus and the Lost Goddess, but omit the socio-political layer of allegory.The socio-political perspective without mystery-religion experiential allegory is less than completely convincing, because it implausibly omits Hellenistic-style primary religious experiencing from early Christianity.Rieser's plausible and realistic view of the Roman Empire and the changing Hellenistic/Jewish relationships is still ahead of current research in the U.S. Every Christian-origins scholar should read The True Founder of Christianity and the Hellenistic Philosophy. Its style, perspective, and sensibility are valuable and it makes an essential contribution to the field.I have read The Jesus Myth, The Jesus Puzzle, The Jesus Mysteries, Deconstructing Jesus, The Christ Myth, The Christian Myth, and The Christ Conspiracy. See also Rieser's book Messianism and Epiphany: An Essay on the Origins of Christianity."},{"Title":"The True Founder of Christianity and the Hellenistic Philosophy","review":"Rieser covers the motives of the Diaspora Jews and then the Hellenes in creating the Christian myth-system.

It was soon taken over and fully Hellenized by the lower class throughout the Roman Empire (with an increasingly artificial Jewish veneer).Christianity arrived last, not first, in Palestine -- that's why Christian archeological finds appear in Rome but not in Judea until the fourth century. Jesus, the Apostles, and Paul are entirely fictional, though loosely based on types of actual individuals. Christianity was initially started by Jews, though these were the very heavily Hellenized Diaspora Jews, not the less-Hellenized Jews in Palestine.The heavily Hellenistic communities gradually invented and pulled together the pseudo-historical single figure and retroactively set him into the pre-70, Palestine backdrop.Once you abandon Historical Jesus -- and Historical Apostles and Historical Paul and that whole way of thinking -- many superior theoretical options open up for understanding the early Christian religion in terms of a mythically allegorized socio-political counter-religion to the hierarchical honor-hyperinflating system of divinized Caesar. (I would point out that it also opens up the researcher's ability to think of earliest Christianity in terms of mythic allegory that describes and conveys primary religious experiencing.)Christianity was almost immediately co-opted by the gentile lower class of the large cities of the Roman Empire, especially Rome, Alexandria, and the cities of Asia Minor (just to the east of Greece, including Byzantium/Constantinople), with increasing animosity between the Hellenists and Jews. The Hellenist lower class found the Hellenic transformed version of the Jewish Diaspora messiah religion to be useful politically.When Christianity finally arrived in Palestine, the Jews there shunned it as alien, unfamiliar, and just another attempt to invade and corrupt Israel with Hellenism.Rieser mentions the central importance of sacred meals in mystery religions and mentions Jesus as the &quot;drug, or pharmakos, of immortality&quot;, but has no insight into entheogenic experiential allegory. Why would wine and bread deserve to be placed at the center of any Hellenistic religion? Historical and socio-political treatments such as this tend to completely omit religious experiencing from their theory of Christianity.They assume that the ritual makes the eucharist or sacrament seem potent, rather than vice versa. Though Rieser explains how the Hellenized transformation of the messiah story was politically meaningful and useful to the Hellenes, he doesn't mention that it was also fully amenable to allegorically expressing the standard core mystery-religion with a storyline that is fictionally set in Palestine rather than in the mythic realm as such.Instead of a story about a mythic Prometheus chained to a rock, or a mythic Attis tied to or encased in a tree trunk, or Isaac bound to the altar, the pseudo-historical Jesus figure is fastened to a cross, just like (as Rieser states) the actual rebel slaves and underclass in Rome or in Judea.Rieser has only passing, shallow coverage of the mystery religions. But if the Hellenistic mystery-religion mythic storylines were intended to describe the initiation experiences encountered by the mystery-religion initiate after consuming something sacred, the pseudo-historical Jesus storyline may also be experienced firsthand after the Christian initiate partakes of a Last Supper before entering the kingdom of God that is revealed when time ends.Rieser provides plenty of hooks for such an explanation, but, like almost all the overly historical-oriented modern researchers, is unable to treat this experiential allegory dimension which calls out for coverage.Rieser reduces religion to the socio-political realm instead of recognizing the overlaid, richly interpenetrating layers of political allegory and mystic-state experiential allegory. The mythic-only Christ theorists Freke and Gandy, conversely, explain experiential initiation in the original Christian religion, in The Jesus Mysteries, and in Jesus and the Lost Goddess, but omit the socio-political layer of allegory.The socio-political perspective without mystery-religion experiential allegory is less than completely convincing, because it implausibly omits Hellenistic-style primary religious experiencing from early Christianity.Rieser's plausible and realistic view of the Roman Empire and the changing Hellenistic/Jewish relationships is still ahead of current research in the U.S. Every Christian-origins scholar should read The True Founder of Christianity and the Hellenistic Philosophy. Its style, perspective, and sensibility are valuable and it makes an essential contribution to the field.See also Rieser's book Messianism and Epiphany: An Essay on the Origins of Christianity."},{"Title":"Rocky Sung's Guide to Chinese Astrology and Feng Shui 2002","review":"Like the last years, Rocky Sung's predictions have been as true as possible in the first months of this year.

Only those who should understand will understand; the others will accuse our work of being obscure and incomprehensible.&quot; Such does Papus describe his literary style... and it IS virtually incomprehensible! But for those who understand the work, by stopping to think about what is being said, and by contemplating the Qaballistic correspondences with IEVE which the author proposes, one can glean from this book several truths. However I don't recommend it to beginners. Moreover, whoever reads it should bear in mind that 1) they have to make a choice between the &quot;Martinist&quot; or French Qaballistic correspondences Papus gives, and the Golden Dawn correspondences. 2) they have to keep in mind that Papus is now outdated in such areas as philology (when he mentions the Hebrew alphabet)... thus I suggest this book only to the well-read on the topic... as it may be confusing. However, I repeat that this book has given me much to think about ... so many questions have arisen since I read the book, about IEVE in nature etc. etc. If you feel up to it... read it!"},{"Title":"The Tarot of the Bohemians","review":"I have owned this book for quite some time and have referenced it often. It generally seemed to make sense in terms of understanding Tarot meanings and a basic foundation of learning Kabbalah. But recently, I find myself re-reading it in depth to access it better, but now find I do not agree with it as blindly as I once did.I once thought Papus (Gerard Encausse) was a pupil of Eliphas Levi, however, researching more, I realize that was not the case, but rather he was heavily influenced by Levi, and you can see that in Papus' writings. Levi wrote romantically, while Papus attempted a more serious or even \\"scientific\\" approach to the Kabbalah.This book was translated by A. E. Waite, and he does not scrutinize Papus in the way he did Levi, perhaps, because Papus wrote without any vagueness or utilize poetic devices to capture his meanings. In my opinion, Tarot of the Bohemians serves as a sloppy translation to 'Dogma and Ritual of High Magic' peppered with Theosophy and other ideas from his order of the Martinists. The result is, what I feel, one of the best laid out structures of learning the Tarot via the Kabbalah that I could find today.Most Tarot books seem to just get to the meanings of the cards and assert no justification of where the meanings come from, and this probably irks me more than anything about Tarot books. Papus starts from the seed of all things based within the Hebrew letters, specifically starting with the YOD, the sperm of all that follows. After spelling out the Tetrgrammaton and explaining its attributions, he would apply numbers to them and the positions would have their meanings until we understood clearly how 1, 2, 3 and 4 all have their part with YHVH.Then we get to what is called \\"Theosophic Reduction and Addition\\". This is simple math that any 4 year old should be able to do. 1+2=3. Yet, Papus attributes meanings to these to help develop the symbolism. So Theosophic Reduction is done simply, if you have a number, say, 10, then to reduce it is to simply add the 1+0=1. Easy enough. So a reduction is, to my understanding to reduce the value to less than 10 to have a single number, and furthermore, to reduce it to 4 or less as all numbers are made up from the 1 (even 4, which is 1+2+3+4=10=1+0=1). You might be wondering what I did. If you missed it, well, Papus sometimes meanders over points thoroughly from chapter to chapter, while other stuff he seems to skirt through fairly quickly. Theosophic Addition is to extrapolate the number from 1 to the number in question. So 4 becomes 1+2+3+4. The answer is not 10, but 1 because he reduces the 10. I am not sure why he does this, and he does not answer for large numbers like 26, which equals 340. So am I to reduce this? 3+4+0=7. Then do I add this? 1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28=2+8=10=1. Ok. It all seems to work. But when you play with numbers in this manner, it seems like you can get lost with no apparent rhyme or reason. It becomes busy work for the mind. If I decided to take 26 and just reduce it as 2+6=8, then add that as 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8=36=3+6=9=?? If you take 9, add it, it gives you 45, so, now you are in a loop of 9's. If anyone understands this better and I missed something, please step forward and explain it to me. I feel I have understood it well enough to take it at face value and move on.Ultimately, what you need to know is that 4 and 1 are the same, in that 4 becomes 1 both mathematically (as explained above) and symbolically, as 4 becomes a transcendant number that takes the place of 1. So, for instance, the card Ace, two, three, the fourth card is a mirror of the Ace, but in lesser form. So the card is a transition card from one plane or world to another. And when you have gone through the cards, it leaves with the 10 card, which is the transition card to the next suit. And final suit card (the 10 of coins), becomes the transition card to the Major Arcana.Whether you agree that the Trumps come first or the Minors are, more or less, irrelevant, but rather the the system that Papus builds up is a logical one and can be followed well enough.Papus is thorogh and goes over his points again and again, so by the time you are done with the Minor Arcana, you have a pretty solid understanding of what he is getting at. It can be confusing at times because it breaks down into multitudes of groups of 4's stemming from the original YHVH. So yes, it is a different approach from the modern traditional mapping onto the Tree of Life, the 10 sephira. Papus does not even attribute the four elements, which is surprising considering Eliphas Levi emphasized those well in his book.When he gets into the Major Arcana, similar explanations come through, with the exception these are done with terniaries, or Triads rather than Quadrants. But the premise is the same, the fourth card is the transition card. So you would have Magus, Empress, High Priestess as your triad, and the Emperor becomes the transition card to the next realm.His Tarot attributes leave a little to be desired in the way of his describing of symbolism. His organization at this stage does not come across as clean or as well developed as the previous part of the book. Following the Major cards, he explores more of the cards as a totality. Then some articles from Stanlislas de Guaita, and Ch. Barlet, along with applications of the Tarot and various other symbolism.In sum, I find the book value in its basic principles of building up a symbolic foundation for the Minor cards specifically, and perhaps to draw some base ideas for the Trumps, but ultimately, the writing is never interesting or has a narrative that draws you in. Contradictory to the organization he placed on learning of the Kabbalistic Tarot, the book itself needs better organization.Being as it is, the book has been an influential piece in the history of Tarot and Papus has made a major contributions in both occultism and Tarot that you cannot ignore it entirely."},{"Title":"The Tarot of the Bohemians","review":"If your looking for a book on symbols or interpeting tarot cards in a kabalistic way or some silly book on what do the cards mean . than you may be let down, this book goes beyond tarot cards.I have studied this book for some time ,not this edition but a much much much older edition , this is the ancient book of initiation. the full title is \\"The Tarot of the Bohemians: The Most Ancient Book in the World for the Use of Initiates\\" .

To correct these it is highly recommended to read The Secret Doctrine by Helen Blavatsky (Vol I, pp. 152-162) where it is specifically addressed.2) Although being new, the actual book that was purchased through Amazon was of a poor quality print. Some pages could not be read at all being \\"photo-copied\\" from old books.

I will now refer you to Joseph Campbells works that teach how to \\"extract the elementary or universal\\" truths from all religions and mythologies.

And the activity immediately associated therewith are the field notes taken on the spot which the anthropologist then transcribes so the immediacy of his findings is preserved.Then there is Claude Levi-Strauss, often called the 'armchair anthropologist.' This literate personage journeyed through central Brazil in the 30s, only to record his findings some 20 later in his book Tristes Tropiques, an untranslated title because no equivalent can be found in English.Reminiscent of his forebear, Marcel Proust, Levi-Strauss presents us with memories distilled through time from which a structure emerges. Let me make clear that Tristes Tropiques is not a chronological account of Levi-Strauss' travels through South America.Recollections, filtered in Tristes Tropiques, are further distilled in subsequent works and become systems or units which can be analyzed structurally, resulting in the fundamental concept of structuralism, that of universal analogies whose 'differences resemble each other.' One social organization, one myth is without value. Compared to a multitude, they acquire meaning.Proust's universe is that of his personal recollections, whereas Levi-Strauss extends his own and from there goes on to establish cross-cultural analogies.

He assumes you know the basics about people like Freud, Marx, Darwin and the Buddha, and then shows you a trip through largely non-industrial societies which unfolds from anthropological description into deep philosophical speculation on the meaning of society and life.In Brazil, Levi-Strauss watches an illiterate but canny chieftain use his anthropological fieldnotes to intimidate his illiterate tribesmen subordinates, and speculates on the parallel origins of writing and slavery. In Matto Grosso, he meets a butcher fascinated with elephants, since \\"he could not imagine so much meat in one place.\\" On the banks of the Amazon, a non-industrial tribe is dying, hypnotically lost in the symbolic intricacies of an ancient social system that makes its citizens inbreed. In India, Levi-Strauss watches Islam and Hinduism-- the \\"locker room\\" and \\"mother\\" religions-- wage symbolic and then real war post-Independence.The book starts as anthropology, turns into philosophy, and ultimately becomes a critique of the West, driven by \\"reason\\" and technology to shake off what Levi-Strauss calls the \\"thick blanket of dreams\\" with which non-industrial civilisation arranges the Universe into Meaning, which remains for the industrialised world the greatest and unanswered question.But Levi-Strauss does not idealise the primitive. His point is that through the study of those and that which are different, a kind of \\"ideal model\\" of society-- one which will never exist-- can be built in the imagination, and people can evaluate their world by reference to this community of mind.This is a remarkable book-- easy to read, engrossing, and endlessly thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Tristes tropiques","review":"One way to gauge who's in among fashionable academics is to read the catalog for the &quot;Writers and Readers' Documentary Comic Book&quot; series.

Translations of his principal works appear to persist in print, but the sales numbers are look low, and he seems almost to have disappeared from the trendy book reviews and such. This is perhaps a matter for at least idle curiosity: Levi-Strauss is surely no more abstruse than his magisterial contemporaries - but no less so; one is perfectly willing to be relieved the obligation of ever picking him up again.With one exception. In style and temperament, Tristes Tropiques is so different from almost everything else Levi-Strauss wrote that it is hard to believe it is written by the same man. Oh, the primitive tribes are there, and a brief personal intellectual history, that offers a bow to Freud, and Bergeson, and Saussure. In my own copy, which I first read about 1980, I even have a pencilled notation &quot;structuralism&quot; - this at page 375 (Pocket Books edition, 1977). But there is almost none of the portentous vacuity that you had to cope with in the so-called &quot;serious&quot; works.What you get instead is Levi Strauss the raconteur, full of travelers' tales. He dines on roasted parrot, flamed with whisky. The termites make the earth rumble. Virgins are made to spit in pots of corn, to provoke fermentation - but &quot;as the delicious drink, at once nutritious and refreshing, was consumed that very evening, the process of fermentation was not very advanced.&quot; You almost expect the anthropophagi and the men whose heads grow beneath their shoulders, that you meet in the Voyages of Sir John Mandeville, Knight.Laced through it all, you get a kind of austere sadness which is either (a) a tragic view of life; or (b) a kind of self-indulgent posturing, depending on your temperament for skepticism. &quot;Every effort to understand,&quot; he says, &quot;destroys the object studied in favor of another object of a different nature.&quot; Or: &quot;Anthropology could with advantage be changed into 'entropology', as the name of the discipline concerned with the study of the highest manifestations of [a] process of disintegration.&quot;Well, call me anything the like, they say, as long as you call me for dinner. It might even be an elaborate con. But so, for that matter, might the stories of Herodotus were you get the same mix of the eclectic and the tolerant, the surreal and the sly.

Levi-Strauss places himself (or inserts himself), in a number of so called 'savage' tribes in Brazil- the Caduveo, Bororo, Nambikwara, and Tupi-Kawahib. This is also an anthropological memoir, Levi-Strauss retraces his training in philosophy to his break and subsequent beginnings as a professor of anthropology in Brazil. This is a universal text by a man searching for universal structures of meaning. He poses questions that remain central to the role of the anthropologist to this day. How can the observer not also be an intruder? What is the basic object of inquiry? Can one avoid proselytizing ones subject? Levi-Strauss is searching for the purely human society, which he finds perhaps most completely in the Nambikwara. \\"Whether traditional or degenerate, this society offered one of the most rudimentary forms of social and political organization that could possibly be imagined.\\" Is this search an essential rejection of the West? In the final analysis, Levi-Strauss laments the eventual disintegration of the purely human society.

Upon beginning to write about them I invariably discover how much time I gave to something which seemed so worthwhile at the time, and which I have almost completely forgotten. I then ordinarily do some catch- up learning about the book. And my review becomes an amalgalm of distant past and most recent present impression. And meanwhile the heart of the book is forever unknown to me and lost. And my review is only a minor tracing an impression both of the book itself and what of my mind knew when reading through it.This certainly applies to my reading of this particular work, ,the one work of Levi- Strauss which I remember reading with any degree of real understanding and pleasure. His making of a life and career as an anthropologist which are a good part of the first part of the work interested me then.The long travelogue and explorations into Amerindian society and mind, interested me less.I understand though that the real voyage is into and along with the mind of Levi- Strauss itself, a mind much more complicated than I was ordinarily used to meeting and ingesting .I do remember however the somewhat majestic tone, the tone of restrained sadness of quiet mourning which seemed to go through the work as Levi- Strauss met with worlds being lost and deterorating , in part through their meetings with the very kind of Western mind he himself exemplified. It is the mind destroying the object in the process of knowing it , as the Western explorers of these tribal societies transformed them out of their own natural state by meeting with them.For Levi- Strauss and this I remember, the ' primitive mind' is not ' primitive at all' and may be in its linguistic complexity and social structure far more intricate than the ' civilized ' as it were sophisticated worlds we believe we live in.I read this work as a way of being acquainted with a great mind, a mind which to my mind proved to be quite elusive and even distant.But clearly the exploration made by Levi- Strauss of his own inner and external worlds is one which calls to the curious human mind and heart in its quest for understanding ' of the other'Montaigne took a trip in the Brazilian jungle in the twentiethcentury, looked in the mirror and saw the face of Levi- Strauss."},{"Title":"Tristes tropiques","review":"Claude Levi-Strauss begins TRISTES TROPIQUES by noting how much he hates traveling. It is fortunate, then, that he managed to overcome this aversion since his book is one of the most startling and engrossing books of the decade (published in 1955). TRISTES TROPIQUES is a book for academics but Levi-Strauss' prose style is anything but. Part autobiography, part philosophy, and part cultural anthropology, the book details the wanderings of a man who chose to wander into the Amazon rain forest to study a variety of indigenous tribes like the Bororo and the Nambikwara. The book title translates from the French as \\"sad tropics,\\" but the sadness of both title and theme does not emerge until midway when Levi-Strauss has a chance to reflect on the meaning of his travels. In chapter 28, he notes the unforeseen deaths of hundreds of natives who died ten years earlier of pulmonary oedema, probably from contact with Europeans. He continues in the same vein by noting other and similar mass deaths. As an experienced anthropologist (oddly enough his academic preparation was in philosophy and sociology), he observed with a sharp eye the all too human foibles of the Nambikwara with whom he was then dwelling. In his interactions with their chief, a puffed-up charlatan, Levi-Strauss taught this chief about the existence of writing. Though the chief knew nothing of the alphabet, he was quick enough to foresee the power that the printed word could offer so that by pretending to read to his tribe, he could \\"borrow\\" the totemic significance of words on paper. I almost accused Levi-Strauss of violating STAR TREK's Prime Directive by inserting new technology denied to competing tribes.One of the joys of reading TRISTES TROPIQUES is Levi-Strauss's ability to place himself in the line of fire even as he makes that line a point of drama. Levi-Strauss is not bashful about taking frequent digressions that after reading them one can see that they are not digressions at all. In that same chapter, he waxes philosophical about the nature and history of writing after he sees what that chief has tried to co-opt it for. Levi-Strauss concludes from this that mankind did not invent writing to better himself in any aesthetic sense. Instead, writing was simply seen as yet another handy tool by which one race might oppress another. It is possible, I suppose, to intuit the embedded structuralist tenets that later came to mark Levi-Strauss's worldview. There are plenty of binary polarities lurking in the margins that typify traditional structural thought, but I prefer to read TRISTES TROPIQUES as an extended metaphor that puts to bed the competing philosophy of Sartre who looked in all the wrong places to find Meaning in the Universe."},{"Title":"Tristes tropiques","review":"After disdaining 'travel writing' Levi-Strauss went on to write a masterpiece that among many other things is ultimate travel writing. This is a rich feast of past and lost worlds and cultures, of nature, an entire chapter beautifully describing the ocean sky at sunset, a vivid description of the ocean's doldrums, and then of course, the story of the people of the Amazon basin and the upland rain forests. All of this, prefaced by a horrific account of escaping the Nazi regime. Definitely a book to savor."},{"Title":"Tristes tropiques","review":"This book is really a number of books in one - a diatribe against the New World vis a vis the Old World, time spent with the natives in South America, and a bemoaning of the lack of progress by Mankind in its development.His comparison of the New and Old Worlds is probably quite apt - the Old World, with its social and physical structures evolved during a slower moving time and \\"was made to last\\". The New World came when progress was increasing much more quickly, new materials became available, and social and physical structures were relatively short term. His description is probably reasonably accurate, but I would have thought a little more thought as to the reasons and causes would have helped (along with a little more gratitude to the New World for giving him a home, all the while he was grizzling about them!)His accounts of his time with the various South American native groups I found disjointed, purely narrative, little rationale for the few conclusions that he did try to draw, and, in his descriptions of the various components of the Bororo society in Chapter 23, almost fanciful.Finally, as though he had put together the first two parts of the book for some other purpose, he launches into a different dialogue about the progress of mankind. He compares Islam society with the society of France, in that both have become fossilised at a time some centuries before, continuing to believe that what they evolved at those much earlier times should still stand them in good stead for the future. Although, in some ways the most interesting of the three parts, this last was to a large extent contradictory to the views espoused in the first part - in the latter he bemoaned the progress of mankind, and in the former he bemoaned the lack of progress of mankind.All in all, interesting read, but a little disappointing."},{"Title":"Tristes tropiques","review":"Having been a fan of Levi-Strauss based on his book THE SAVAGE MIND from some years back,was delighted to find this book.While it is part travel,largely anthropology,one of the gems is his analysis of the thrust of Islam toward other,non-Moslem societies. A very good read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Educational Psychology (McGraw-Hill's College Review Books)","review":"This book is full of a lot of wonderful information. The best part I would have to say is the Praxis quizzes that are included in the book.

It explains everything clearly and makes it easy to understand. I liked working on the &#34;Crack the Case&#34; as they lead you trough the last chapter and ensures, that you can apply, what you just read about. At least theoretically.Working with this book was easy."},{"Title":"Educational Psychology (McGraw-Hill's College Review Books)","review":"This book was rather ponderous, with little attempt made to make it readable. That's not the worst of it, though; that's to be expected in a psych textbook. The worst of it is, there was an unforgivable amount of sloppy editing in this book; most of it was in the first half of the book, with only one or two errors slipping through after chapter 8, but that still leaves me thoroughly unimpressed, although the book IS less sloppy than the Adolescent Psych textbook by the same author.In general, the errors are of the typo or proofreading variety, not relevant to the subject matter, although the author does still have a tendency to confuse correlation with causation in spite of his clear disclaimers to the contrary.Some examples of the errors that I'm speaking of:1) At the end of chapter 2, on page 68, in the \\"reach your learning goals\\" section, under the \\"Developmental Issues\\" subheading, he speaks of the conflict between \\"nature and nature\\", rather than \\"nature and nurture\\".2) In chapter 3, on page 83, under the subheading \\"Children in divorced families\\", second paragraph, he speaks of \\"...a time when parents are often in conflict with other.\\" rather than \\"with EACH other\\".3) Still in chapter 3, on page 94, under the subheading of \\"Effective schools for young adolescents\\", he references a report by the Carnegie Foundation which he dates as being from 1989, and then later in the paragraph, goes on to say that \\"twenty five years later, experts are still finding...\\" Given that the copyright for this book is 2009, not 2014, that just doesn't add up.4) In the \\"Crack the Case\\" at the end of chapter 4 (page 145) question 6 asks us \\"What type of grouping is Mr. Adams most likely discussing?\\" That's awfully difficult to say, because NONE OF THE TEACHERS IN THE ANECDOTE WERE NAMED MR. ADAMS! (My suspicion is that in the first draft, there was a Mr. Adams, and in the final draft, that name was changed to add ethnic diversity to the group; perhaps \\"Mr. Adams\\" morphed into \\"Mr. Hassan\\". In any case, the change did not make it into the questions.5) In chapter 5, page 151, second paragraph from the bottom, he references \\"connectectness\\" when he clearly means \\"connectedness\\".6) Still in chapter 5, on page 155, in the \\"Through the Eyes of Teachers\\" interlude, we have the sentence \\"She visits students at home early in the school year in A EFFORT (emphasis mine) to connect with them...\\" Particularly ironic in an interlude dealing with attempts to improve literacy.7) Still in chapter 5, on page 160, under the heading \\"Bilingualism\\", we are told \\"The ability to speak two languages has a positive effect on children's cognitive development. Children fluent in two languages perform better than their single-language counterparts on tests of control of attention, concept formation, analytical reasoning, cognitive flexibility, and cognitive complexity.\\" Now, both of these statements MAY be correct, but the first does not necessarily follow from the second. If it is true that bilingual students perform better in all of these ways than single-language students, it MAY be because bilingualism \\"has a positive effect\\", but then again, it may simply be that students who are better at all of those things ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO learn a second language. Perhaps the cited study controls for that variable; Santrock says nothing to suggest this. This is a case of confusing correlation with causation, given the information in the text.8) In chapter 8, on page 271, second full paragraph, Santrock tells us that \\"...in one study, 10-year olds were approximately 1.8 times slower at processing information than young adults...\\" and later goes on to say that 12-year olds were \\"approximately 1.5 times slower...\\". The concept of (some number) of times slower is Mathematically meaningless. If we want to speak of someone taking twice as long to do something, we say that they are \\"half as fast\\". \\"Twice as slow\\" is not a valid concept. So we can say that they took 1.8 times as long to do something, but that does not make them \\"1.8 times slower\\". That's like saying that something is 180 percent cheaper, which would mean that they would pay you 80 percent of the original price to take it off their hands.9) In chapter 10, at the top of the page, we are told that \\"(Research concludes) that cooperation and postive interdependence needs to occur...\\" rather than \\"need to occur\\".Now, obviously, some of these errors are more important than others; still, the fact that there are so many indicates a sloppiness that I find troubling in a textbook. Most of the information here is worthwhile, but I can't rate something with so many careless errors higher than three stars."},{"Title":"Educational Psychology (McGraw-Hill's College Review Books)","review":"I was very satisfied with my purchase!

R. Dull. My wife (now ex) won and took the book, much to my consternation. When I discovered that a brand-new reprint of the original was available I ordered it immediately and reintroduced the sorely-missed book back into my kitchen. The new one is printed on acid-free paper, so it'll probably outlast me. This cookbook must have been in just about every kitchen in the the state of Georgia during the forties and fifties. For any cook who wants to prepare delicious old-fashioned Southern recipes from scratch this book is still the best!One of the reasons that this book was so popular with new homemakers and newlyweds, and still should be, was that it did not assume that the reader was a knowledgeable cook. The first chapter describes the best layout for a kitchen, how to select kitchen appliances, defines the differences in degrees F for a very hot, hot or quick, medium, slow and very slow oven and has a measurement conversion table.There is a section called \\"Preparing a Meal\\" that goes into detail about things that should be, and should not be done during the preparation of a meal. There is a cooking time table that helps the food preparer determine when to start cooking certain items, so they come out at the same time. Many recipes contain helpful tips for varying the results and ensuring success."},{"Title":"Southern Cooking","review":"Watching my Grandmother cooking on a wood stove when I was young, that's how.When I started cooking (after having a job that required extensive travel for a long time) I remembered some of my grandmother's recipes.

I have the 1941 edition (not the current one) and find that some of the instructions a bit lacking if you aren't accustomed to cooking. On the other hand, the information in the preface to most chapters is invaluable - almost like having a grandma there to give you insider tips. It's also a great resource for hard-to-find recipes. If you fondly remember it from your (Southern) childhood, you're bound to find it here."},{"Title":"Southern Cooking","review":"I have had a copy of Southern Cooking by Mrs. Dull for years. I loaned my old copy to someone and it never came back. You can't imagine how happy I was to find it again on Amazon.

Some of the lessons in this book describe the basics of cooking that many don't get at home anymore.The best cook book ever written."},{"Title":"Southern Cooking","review":"This book is the classic tome of Southern cooking. If you are interested in learning &quot;old-fangled&quot; Southern recipes, it all begins here with Mrs. Dull's very famous volume. If you collect cookbooks and have an interest in Southern food, this belongs in your collection, whether for study or for cooking."},{"Title":"Southern Cooking","review":"This is a classic that belongs on the shelf of any serious foodie or cookbook collector. If you're a collector, try to find an original edition. Sit it beside your copy of the original Fannie Farmer and Mastering the Art of French Cooking. For those who complain that the recipes are too vague, you must understand that this is how ALL recipes were written until recently. An experienced cook doesn't need temperatures, precise timing, and minute instructions and readily understands what a \\"hot oven\\" and \\"simmer until tender\\" mean; back in the day, you had no business in the kitchen if you couldn't follow these directions. If you are modern, casual cook who needs precision and non-kitchen lingo to prepare a recipe, then consider this an historical document rather than a working cookbook."},{"Title":"Southern Cooking","review":"I had to write a review about 'Southern Cooking' by Mrs. S.R. Dull to dispute another review found on this page. The review is replete with ignorance and anyone who has ever grown up eating or used Mrs. Dull's recipes is well aware of that. If you are able to get a copy of this book, consider yourself very fortunate. More than one of these books has saved a marriage and helped a new bride become a wonderful cook.My grandmother received a copy when she got married that she still uses (at age 93). My mother received a copy when she got married that she still uses and I was thrilled to receive the same when I got married. I still use it and cherish it. The terms used in this book are old fashioned but the recipes are tried and true. So learn what a slow and a fast oven are and what 'done' is to you - it is subjective to every southern cook. If you appreciate cooking from scratch and desire to know how to cook southern food, grab one of these books while you can - you will not be disappointed. Be on the lookout for a book at a local charity sale, you might be lucky and get it at a bargain price ;)"},{"Title":"Southern Cooking","review":"Fifty years ago when I was a bride, this was considered the classic standard gift for a Southern bride -- because it was simply the best there was.

In &quot;Eve's Apology,&quot; this portion of the poem is spoken from the point of view of Pontius Pilate's wife, who is begging for the life of Christ. She explores who really bares the guilt in original sin. She is passionate, yet uses reason in her argument (something women were not thought cabable of doing) and makes her point that any guilt all women may bear in original sin will be far overshadowed by the guilt men, in turn, may bear for Pilate's order to execute Christ.In addition, in &quot;To the Virtuous Reader&quot;, Lanyer states that her purpose in writing is to praise women, and to make it known that they are not all lazy, gossiping, lecherous, deceitful, or stupid as most men of the time supposed. She includes a list of virtuous women to encourage and praise other women to use them as exemplum. If you are interested at all in a female writer's perspective on Renaissance ideas, I highly recommend Aeilia Lanyer's beautiful poetry."},{"Title":"The Altar of the Body: A Novel","review":"a rare match between a picaresque storyline and excellent writing. the heartland of america is the setting for a variety of quests undertaken by the all-too-human characters of this page-turning novel. there's the quest for maintaining one's youth, as embodied in the bodybuilding character of buck root. other characters are in search of, if not happiness, then a level of understanding and acceptance by others...and, more importantly, coming to accept their own selves. The dialog is crackling, the scenes compelling, humor that is sometimes black and sometimes outright funny...though never solely at the expense of the characters; rather, it illuminates their natures. One of the most enjoyable reads I've had for a long time (and I read A LOT)."},{"Title":"The Altar of the Body: A Novel","review":"Duff Brenna has been called one of our best and most original novelists and THE ALTAR OF THE BODY confirms that he is. This is the story of an easy going man who lives in Minnesota minding his own business when one day his cousin Buck Root shows up after being gone for 30 years and he pretty much turns George's life upside down. Buck has in tow his Las Vegas Legs girlfriend Joy and her mother Livia. George falls in love with Joy, but she seems to him to be too far above him. He is short, fat and bald and has never done well with women, but he proves to be just what Joy needs. Buck betrays her. Livia gets sick and as her condition gets worse, she mentally slides into the pages of a western novel she is reading and becomes the hero Cody Larsen riding the plains of Colorado. Livia is a powerful creation, a character that is both fascinating and heartbreaking. A mothering instinct awakens in George and he begins taking care of Livia. He also awakens for the first time in his life to the same rage to live that afflicts Buck and Joy and is consuming them. The book is wildly funny at times and tragic too. It is a muscled-up page turner that is impossible to put down. Brenna is a masterful stylist and the book never lags as it carries you toward its cataclysmic climax and its bittersweet denouement. As in all of Brenna's books the story is riveting and there is a lot going on beneath the surface. This is one amazing book that fully lives up to the blurbs on the jacket."},{"Title":"The Altar of the Body: A Novel","review":"I flew through Brenna's novel in a couple of days, which is not usually the case with me. I am not a fast reader, but this story and the characters in it were so engaging, I couldn't put it down until it was finished.So much happens in the novel. It is quick paced and consistently interesting. The novel has incorporated within it many unexpected literary treats such as a lewd saloon song contest, sappy poetry, ethnic jokes and excerpts from a western dime novel. You never know where the story is going to go.The characters and what happens to them resonated with me for days afterward. It is a gritty book, unflinching in its examination of how we handle aging, fading beauty, death and personal failure. The \\"American Dream\\" goes horribly wrong for many of us.Brenna examines interesting questions through four vividly imagined rather sleazy characters. There is much to like and dislike in all of them.A cleverly written, enjoyable and disturbing novel."},{"Title":"The Altar of the Body: A Novel","review":"Duff Brenna's The Altar of The Body is an odd, not too likable, but hard to forget book.Brenna's ability to define character in a few lines is a strength of this book.

Briggs has a really engaging way of writing and I read the guide book like I would a novel. There are a few times during our trip when I quibbled with his description of the quality of a hotel, but by the time the trip was over, I agreed with him (ie, hotel quality is very much a matter of relativity in Ethiopia).

I ended up hooking up with another traveler who had the lonely planet for Ethiopia and Eritrea and the two were no comparison in terms of historical and cultural background and practicality. This was my first time using a Bradt guide, so I'm not sure if it was just a function of Philip Briggs' writing (informative, humorous, and down-to-earth) or indicative of the whole line, but I cannot recommend this book enough if you are planning on visiting Ethiopia."},{"Title":"Guide to Ethiopia (Bradt Guides Ser.)","review":"Hi all of you, I did travel 2 years ago with the &quot;The Bradt guide&quot;.

When I read about plonkers and met them in Ethiopia I laughed, they behaved and talked in the same way as described in the guide.There ever I needed a hotel room or a restaurant I looked it up in the guide. Every time the information in the guidebook was correct, I did agree all the time. I visited the following cities or places Addis Ababa, Harar, Dire Dawa, Hirna, Lalibela, Bahar Dar, Tis Abay, Gonder, Simien National park, Shire, Axum, Adrigat, Rock hewn churches in Tigray, Mekelle, Hayk, Dessie, Awassa and Ziway. As you can see I have a lot of experience from Ethiopia in my bag when writing this review. I can only say buy this guidebook if you are travelling to Ethiopia. I didn't find one single error in the guidebook during one month travelling in the country. It was great fun to read the guide and compare it with my own experiences. It was amazing to see Philip Briggs hit the nail every time. The text was fun, clear, correct and colourful.

The book is essential reading for those wishing to travel to Ethiopia. ANY information on Ethiopia is scarce and the excellent conversational style of the author makes for an enjoyable and, at times, humorous read. Compared to other travel books on Ethiopia, this book is unsurpassed in providing positive down-to-earth information without glossing over the negative aspects of travel in this country. I am sure the 'mud maps' of major towns, accommodation and dining out information will prove invaluable to the independant traveller. And if you are interested in wildlife the author obviously has a sound knowledge of this topic, particularly the birdsof East Africa. He provides comprehensive summaries, scattered through the body of the text, on the birdlife (and other wildlife) you can expect to see in different habitats of the country."},{"Title":"Guide to Ethiopia (Bradt Guides Ser.)","review":"This is the most recent and most useful of the small number of guidebooks for Ethiopia available in the U.S. Descriptions of places to see were clear and informative, and the sections on how to get around, where to stay, good places to eat, and other tips for each town were accurate and well-researched. This book also contains useful sketch maps of many towns; these are now FAR more accurate than those in older editions, and I found them easier to use than similar maps found in other guides. There is also a thoughtful section on general issues related to travel in Ethiopia. I found this far superior to the other commonly available guides I own for information on Addis Ababa, the so-called &quot;historical circuit,&quot; and the lowland desert areas (information on this last region is pretty scarce, but this book has more than others). The book is focused on providing useful travel information and not on long descriptions or photographs; if an informative guidebook to use while travelling is what you're looking for, this one is your best bet. (Be sure to get the newest edition, though-- the previous ones weren't nearly as good!)"},{"Title":"Guide to Ethiopia (Bradt Guides Ser.)","review":"I am planning my third trip to Ethiopia, and Philip Briggs' 4th edition of Ethiopia: The Bradt Travel Guide has proved to be indispensable. I have used his previous guidebook editions on my trips, and his information and tips are always exactly right. As an extra added bonus, he is an entertaining and perceptive writer, and the books are fun to read as well. This is the only book a traveler needs for a trip to Ethiopia."},{"Title":"Guide to Ethiopia (Bradt Guides Ser.)","review":"In preparing for a trip to Ethiopia, I found information about the country both scarce and scant. Phillip Briggs' guide has become a valuable tool for planning and introduction to this remote area of Africa. The fourteen chapters cover everything from history and culture to tourist information, health preparations and travel specifics for nine distinct areas of the country. Though Mr. Briggs admits that he found it very difficult to find pertinent information about Ethiopia, the factual portions of the book are both readable and accurate. It is, however, the specific information for the traveler in Ethiopia that is most valuable. In a very readable style, the author relates, for each area, information about climate, routes, sightseeing, transportation, accommodations, food, religion, local practices, parks, wildlife, and specific topics of interest. The humor of the writer makes this guide very interesting and readable. His maps of each of the areas a! re most often of his own making, as regional maps for many remote areas seem to have been nonexistant. The treatment of the &quot;Faranji,&quot; or &quot;foreigner,&quot; in Ethiopia is dealt with throughout the book. The author tells of his encounters with friendly, but nonetheless, persistent children who accompanied him everywhere with pushing, touching, staring, screaming and, on occasion, rock-throwing. Briggs' humor keeps him and his reader going as both progress through the book. For example, in his introduction, Briggs tells of his own introduction to Ethiopians while visiting Nariobi: &quot;A troupe of white-robed musicians approached our table and erupted into smirking discord. Then, signalled by an alarming vibrato shriek, all hell broke loose in the form of a solitary Ethiopian dancer. Her mouth contorted into the sort of psychotically rapturous grimace you'd expect from Jack Nicholson at his most hammy. Her eyes closed. Her shoulders jerked a! nd twitched to build up a manic, dislocating rhythm. Benea! th her robe--driven, presumably, by her metronomic shoulders--a pair of diminutive breasts somehow contrived to flap up and down with an agitated regularity suggestive of a sparrow trapped behind a closed window. I left that room with one overwhelming impression: Ethiopians are completely bonkers. I knew, too, that I had to visit their country.&quot; ...and visit he did. And he has left an account for the reader of a remarkable journey into an area of the world that the reader will certainly want to get to know better. I look forward to his upcoming revision of this indispensible travel guide, to be published soon."},{"Title":"Guide to Ethiopia (Bradt Guides Ser.)","review":"I just returned from Ethiopia and this guide was extremley helpfull.

We wish to thank Mr. Briggs for his incredible attention to detail, which greatly enhanced our trip. Don't go to Ethiopia without it!"},{"Title":"Guide to Ethiopia (Bradt Guides Ser.)","review":"I have just returned from Ethiopia and found this book to be indispensable. Most of the travelers there had this book and were reading it. As a travel book addict (I often buy 3 or 4 for every place I go, including my local town) I can say that this is the best travel book I have ever used. Bring it with you also as you will find the history and background more interesting as you go. Also, information on Ethiopia is difficult to find in the US. Once you are there, the bookstores have more information on history, culture, language, etc. so plan on buying some books. One problem in Ethiopia, especially Addis Ababa where I spent some time, is that the maps are very difficult. The author does mention this problem and has maps that are more helpful for Addis than any others that I found. However, the mapps for Addis are spread over several pages, making it difficult to figure out how to get from one place to another in town. I never once was yelled at with Ferengi (sp?) or any other obnoxious event, so this is different compared to what is described in the guidebook. Perhaps things have changed (see below)? For your first trip, it is reasonable to use a local travel agent. I used Sophia at Leisure Travel in Addis, and there are others who advertise in this book that are probably reasonable. If you call for reservations at hotels they will speak English but don't expect to make online reservations. One online reservation service was going to charge double the hotel rate. The agent might get a referral fee from the hotel. This seems reasonable to me for the service provided, but you might be able to find something less expensive by yourself.As far as quick recommendations for your trip: bring cash unless you are staying at the Sheraton or other similar very upscale place (in which case you are not really going to Ethiopia!). Cash means US dollars or Euros. It is likely that this situation will improve soon and that credit cards will be more widely accepted but right now, it is cash that you need. The money used there is the birr and, if you get money from a legitimate place, like a bank, be sure to get a receipt if you might need to change the money back. The limit on how much birr you can take out of the country is a few hundred birr (about $40) but this does not seem to be enforced and it is a good idea to take some home if you ever want to go back as banks here do not have this money available. Internet is basically not available in ET though you will be able to use email somewhat if you have a lot of patience. The people are wonderful, hard-working, and helpful. Most people speak English unless you are dealing with uneducated people or in rural areas. The Lonely Planet Amharic guideEthiopian Amharic (Lonely Planet Phrasebooks)is helpful and not necessary, but people like it if you try to speak the language. The language guide in the back of this guidebook is really all you need. Unfortunately, I did not find it until the end of my trip. You will need an adaptor for any electronics. The only one I used was a 2-prong adaptor. I did not need a converter as my laptop could use 110-220. Mosquito spray and possibly a net is useful if you are out of Addis. Travel clinic is a must at least 1-2 months before you go. It is $70 to get the visa from the embassy and it took me 3 weeks to get mine back, vs. $20 at the airport for Americans. However, I guarantee that, once you are in Addis, the last thing you want to do is spend an hour in line to get a visa. Also, I wrote the embassy a nice letter about why I was going and they gave me a one year visa, even though that went past my passport expiration. Due to lack of an internet, you will need a cell phone in the country and these will be easily available for about $50, including all the airtime you need, once you get there.Ethiopia Airlines is the way to go. I met many people who fly to ET all the time or go to Ruwanda and other sub-Saharan African countries who say it is the most reliable. They now have one of the newest Boeings for the flight and this is a very comfortable airplane. Also, the movie selection is great. Consider the Indian movies if you are tired of the Hollywood formula. There are also Nigerian movies, which I did not test. I drove 5 hours to Dulles, stayed overnight at the Staybridge Inn (free parking for my 2 week trip) and flew out of there for the 12 hr flight (vs. 24 on other airlines, at a much higher price). If you live father away, it might be worth it to fly to Dulles and then transfer to Ethiopian Airlines. Another advantage of Ethiopian Airlines is that flights incountry are about 1/2 price if you fly into Ethiopia with Ethiopian Airlines. I did not plan to travel but once I got there, I ended up taking five flights, for a total of $300, vs. $600 if I had flown with another airline. Of note, you can take water on domestic flights, but not international.There are a lot of beggars but I did not find it more difficult to deal with than San Francisco, NYC, or Washington DC. I stayed downtown at the Ethiopian Hotel (older, but I liked, not in guidebook) as I like to walk but most tourists stay on Bolle Rd in Addis and it seemed that there were more beggars there (also more restaurants, bookstores, etc.). There are lots of little shops and people selling things on the street. It seems reasonable to spend some money at these little startups which are now encouraged by the government in order to make people self-sufficient. Perhaps there are fewer beggars now as people are able to support themselves better with these free enterprise undertakings? Tourist money also helps the country.Ethiopia is a beautiful country, with much history, hard-working and kind people. You will like your trip there, so enjoy yourself!"},{"Title":"Guide to Ethiopia (Bradt Guides Ser.)","review":"I left the safety of my overland truck in Kenya to travel Ethiopia independantly in April 2004. I found myself being shot at by bandits with AK47's in Northern Kenya about 50km south of the border with Ethiopia. We were treated OK but all I was left with was the clothes I was wearing, my invaluable Bradt Guide to Ethiopia and of course a bin bag to carry these in.Due to my determination not to let the bandits win I then spent 7 weeks travelling around Ethiopia. Your guide is the best I have used as it really does tell you how to get from tiny villages, to ancient sites, to cities, and to meet the ordinary people. If you want to experience life in a different culture as apposed to a holiday overseas then this is the guide for you.Despite such a stressful start to my adventure, and the difficulties with bus travel in Ethiopia, I will never forget what wonderful people Ethiopians are. Philip Briggs writes not just an informative and very practical guide but a fascinating story of the history of Ethiopia and the lives of the people there today. I read and re-read every word on every page.Without this guide book I would have turned back and missed this memorable adventure.Thank youNatalie Cousins"},{"Title":"Guide to Ethiopia (Bradt Guides Ser.)","review":"I purchased the 5'th edition of this guide only a week before leaving for my first visit to Africa (actually to any non-Western country). I chose to visit Ethiopia because of its rich monumental patrimony -- hundreds of little known medieval churches -- but I was a bit nervous preparing for the trip, and an American intelligence officer who sat next to me on the flight to Addis scared the living daylights out of me. It turned out that Brigg's guide was just the remedy for my terror, because one of its most important features -- and one that is not at all apparent from a first reading -- is that it inserts you directly into a human network of good people connected to the local institutions he recommends. I had made so many friends by the fourth day of travel that I completely lost the paranoia which had accompanied my first 48 hours. At the end of 3 days in Addis I was taking the minibuses -- whose routes he describes in great detail -- all over town. After a week I gave away my copy of the Lonely Planet guide to a young couple. Lonely guide was fine for what the needed, a catalogue of hotels, restaurants and bus routes which would let them survive in Ethiopia for the longest possible time on the least amount of money. However Brigg's guide, as from the fact that has more complete and more up to date listings of hotels, restaurants, and other practical travel information than Lonely Planet, is a far more detailed introduction to the history, culture, and politics of this extraordinary country and its myriad of complex societies. It is a guide for the traveller who wants to understand Ethiopia, and not merely observe exotic spectacle on the cheap."},{"Title":"Guide to Ethiopia (Bradt Guides Ser.)","review":"This is a very useful travel guide. Some of the information is outdated (several new regional airports have been constructed and roads paved since this edition was published) but presumably the forthcoming edition will bring the descriptive material up to speed. What really makes this guide, though, (and why I think it is superior to the Lonely Planet guide)is the background material on Ethiopian history and culture. Since it is for historical and cultural reasons (as opposed to say viewing wildlife) that many travellers will visit Ethiopia, this part of the book is a real strength, as is the chapter on intercultural interaction. Reading this guide you get the sense of real human beings writing it, not some generic &quot;three stars for this castle and here is a good restaurant.&quot; Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Superior Person's Book of Words","review":"I cannot believe that the publisher of this charming, funny book doesn't have it on the market for a PERFECT Christmas gift!

Frankly, the book gives me a headache, not because of the content---though it does have the undeniable smirk of one engaged in jactation---but because of its typography.Each entry is set in justified, centered type, a design that causes the words to vellicate the longer one scans the myriad entries. Though the ratio of type size to line length falls short of that of unreadable, sesquipedalian manuals, one's eyes soon tire from the effort.This lexiphanic book is best nibbled like a rich chocolate cake: too much at once proves overwhelming. Instead, try absorbing a word or two as part of a regimen to build vocabulary. Keep your dictionary nearby for pronunciations (a quisquous omission).A bevy of oddball illustrations are amusing, conjuring up some of Thurber's more amiable (and less misogynistic) sketches and providing some relief from the rows of justified, centered type.All in all, this tome is entertaining for the Scrabble factor---you really could make use of \\"ataxy\\" should you have an \\"x\\"---and can be fun for insulting dull-witted athletes. But mostly it just looks good nestled among the reference books on my desk."},{"Title":"Superior Person's Book of Words","review":"I just found this book at Restoration Hardware and it looks delightful.

But, of course, I cannot find it now."},{"Title":"Superior Person's Book of Words","review":"I could feast all day on a book of fine words. To me, words have colors, flavors and textures. They roll around the tongue like savory morsels, each distinct. There is an art to combining them, much as there is an art to marrying flavors in haute cuisine. Sometimes a chef is adamant about a certain spice or food element for his special dish, as only that one will do to complete a complex palate. In the same way, I will search carefully for just the right word to complete my thoughts. It is a labor of love.The Superior Person's Book of Words is just the thing if your dictionary proves uninspiring. Not only will you find just what you are looking for, but the entertaining and wry wit employed in the definitions will sally the keen reader upon new directions in sassy verbal repartee. Many of the listings are invaluable as veiled insults, and the author frequently highlights these with sample usage sentences. My only comment on that is, living with Peter Bowler must be like living with Oscar Wilde.There are *some* pedestrian listings thrown in, presumably as padding. Or maybe they are intended as mollifiers for the \\"inferior\\" readers? In any case, words such as \\"heterosexual\\", \\"pastime\\" and \\"impalement\\" hardly count as tidbits for the esoteric lexicographer in my opinion. Thankfully, they are relatively few.The best part of this book though is the way the author words the definitions. Some examples:Papuliferous. Pimply. Typical condition of a groak.Groak. One who stands around while others eat, in the hope that he will be invited to join in. A good name for a female relative's boyfriend.Nugatory. Of no value, trifling, insubstantial, pointless. Unfavorable criticism of the present book could properly be so characterized.Now how could you not adore a \\"dictionary\\" like this?-Andrea, aka Merribelle"},{"Title":"Superior Person's Book of Words","review":"I was lucky enough to find this book at a local used book store. I have always loved words, but I didn't know that books like this had been compiled for people like me. In introduction of this book, Peter Bowler states that words are weapons, which is exactly what you need to have in mind when attempting to use them. Although this world is full of a plethora of ignorant people, readers of this book must beware of using certain words that they think people won't recognize. For instance, beware of telling a teacher, boss, or client that he or she is acerebral. That person may have an easy time figuring out that this means that you are saying that the person to whom you are speaking doesn't have a brain. In other words, use your words wisely, and never assume that person who is taking your verbal abuse isn't reading the same book that you may have spent hours memorizing.I am having a great time with this book. I'm just not able to give this book the highest rating. It would have been nice if Bowler had put a pronunciation guide to the words that are in this book. For some of the entries, it is easier to spell the words than it is to say them. Although it is no fault of the author, it is too bad that this book is no longer being published. This is the perfect kind of book to find at a used book store, but it would be nice to give this book as a gift (I won't give away my only copy).

This calefacient book would surely have put a smile on his face.The book contains 500 words of varying difficulty. Some of the words are rather abecedarian (the first word in the book), others so magnificent that I'm going to force conversations as to be able to use the, while others are so outrageous as to be completely void of any use. I read it in several hours and kept 3x5 cards with me to record the words I want to memorize and incorporate into my daily use. This is a very thin book with very thick words. There are 118 pages of words, and a brief introduction. This isn't a book I would recommend to a person looking to expand their vocabulary with mostly useable words but it does fill a place for those of us who glamorize pretense. If you are looking to vastly expand your vocabulary buy William F. Buckley's book, \\"The Lexicon.\\" If you want a fun read to pass the time as you sit on the John, buy this book.

Words are not only tools: they are also weapons. The major objective of this book is to provide the ordinary man in the street with new and better verbal weapons, words which until now have been available only to philologists, lexicographers, and art critics. Hitherto, the man who has known the precise meanings of exigent, usufruct, pejorative, egregious and pusillanimous has been able to enjoy a position of \\"unfair advantage\\" over the rest of us. We yield to him in debate not because his arguments are more cogent, but because they are less intelligible.

I did enjoy this book. However, my disappointment with this book stems from the writing style. I would compare the flow of this book to a music video. The author jumps around a lot while telling his stories. He mixes fragments of scenes and stories together concurrently, introducing something, but then moving on to something else only to return later. At times the reading is very disjointed, therefore, hard to follow. It is a good book that could have flowed better."},{"Title":"In search of living water","review":"Susanna's life reads like a fairy tale, complete with the villains, the locked room with a treasure, the clandestine meetings, and the frantic escape.

Lots of great stuff in here, including the classic title tale, &quot;The Coffin Trimmer&quot;, and &quot;The Monster,&quot; which has appeared in mystery year's best books (although it's more suspense than mystery). It's a sizable collection (26 stories) and while it bounces all over the place in style and tone, you'll easily find quite a few stories in here that stick with you. It's unfortunate that mystery and thriller fans will probably miss this when it's shelved in the &quot;horror&quot; section, since only a handful of the stories are outright horror, but lovers of dark fiction should pick it up."},{"Title":"Night Freight","review":"Good Stuff!

I guess the best compliment I can pay is that I plan to seek him out again. This is a collection of short stories published by the author over about a 30 year period. Perhaps because of the length of time it covers, it is not as consistant as it could be. Pronzini writes suspenseful mystery tales and some outright horror stories, though the former tend to be more effective than the latter. As a horror writer he is fairly conventional, without the imaginative flair of say, Stephen King. Nevertheless, there are some memorable shocks such as &quot;Peekaboo&quot; which are sure to keep you up at night. The mystery stories are better, particularly the single entry in his &quot;Nameless Detective&quot; series that appears here as well as the almost novella length &quot;Stacked Deck&quot; that kicks things off.Overall, this is a hard collection to categorize, but lovers of both mystery and horror writing should find plenty of nuggets to enjoy."},{"Title":"Night Freight","review":"Night Freight was the best short story collection I have ever read. Every story a polished gem, and every one delivers the scare usually with a twist. I haven't read Pronzini in a long time, but I intend to catch up on this author this summer.

All the stories are very good and unlike most short story collections there are no losers in this group."},{"Title":"Night Freight","review":"I had not ever had the chance to read any of Bill Pronzini's novels...but I am certainly going to sample a few following this is a fine collection of short stories.Of those included, I most enjoyed: The Monster, Thirst and Wishful Thinking.There's a little something to be had here for everyone. All the tales had a wonderfully unique writing style. Some were very pulp-esque, while others displayed some great straightforward narration!The rating should actually be 3 and 1/2 stars. I would have gone higher, but some of the shorts simply weren't my cup o' tea. But that doesn't mean someone else won't like them!Not bad at all. A fun and interesting collection."},{"Title":"The Myth of Irrationality: The Science of the Mind from Plato to Star Trek","review":"The nature of human consciousness would have to be about the most interesting subject around, and that is what this book concerns itself with. It is objective, honest, unemotional and is written by an intelligent educated person expressly for intelligent educated people, without being ponderous. It is the most comprehensive, accessible and sensible account of the matter to date, and I recommended it without reserve.But it has not been without critics, mostly coming from positions of vested interest and clever-than-thou qualifications. Well, I'm pretty well qualified to express opinions on neurobiology, psychiatry, psychology and anthropology which means I'm more qualified than most to comment.So I will.Essentially, there are three positions here, put with great persuasion.#1. The Enlightenment model of human consciousness, particularly in view of recent findings, is the best one available, is probably pretty close to the mark, and has been left languishing disgracefully long. Consciousness is the mainly internal use of language - any language - to construct, mobilize and initiate: memories, hopes, fears, explanations, narratives, plans, and so forth. Humans without language never develop human consciousness, they are animals. And if you doubt that read the well-documented wolf children accounts.#2. We are and do what we think, and our thinking is self-determined. We think a certain way because we choose to; we could easily think differently if we were aware that other choices existed. This is a profound point and it also introduces a very pragmatic element to the otherwise sterile and interminable free will debate.#3. Our thought patterns have been influenced, very much for the worse, by about 300 years of romantic claptrap; and to this extent we are victims of our own social history. That influence must be faced up to, recognized for what it is, and assigned to the trashcan when appropriate. This is where McCrone really makes enemies. He cold-bloodedly rubbishes virtually all of contemporary psychology and absolutely all of the psychoanalytic movement. This is a man worthy of respect and support.These are wretchedly muddled times screaming out for for rational thought and action. Don't wait for other people to set an example. If you want to purge your brain of all sorts of nonsense and start feeling and acting like a rational human being then put this book next to Dr D D Burns' &quot;Feeling Good&quot; and refer to both frequently. They share that tragically scarce commodity - common sense."},{"Title":"The Myth of Irrationality: The Science of the Mind from Plato to Star Trek","review":"Ignore the (bizarre) Kirkus review that claims that there is 'nothing new' here. In fact McCrone's claims are bold and revolutionary. The key point he makes is in the title: there is no such thing as irrationality. The corollary of this is that there is no such thing as rationality either. In fact this has been shown by work by Damasio (see his 'Descartes' Error' for details). People with brain damage to the parts of the brain which regulate emotions exhibit behaviour which seems (to us) profoundly IRrational. Therefore it is false to claim that there is such as thing as 'rationality' (meaning being unemotional or logical). Instead what we term rationality (and really, common sense would be a better word) is an emergent property of our emotional AND the logical parts of the brain.Therefore the battle between attackers and defenders of the 'Enlightenment' is shown to be profoundly misguided: both sides were right and both sides were wrong. What both sides shared was a view of human beings as being fundamentally individuals, and that cognition is an 'internal' process.It's a shame that the Kirkus reviewer stated that this is merely a rehash of Enlightenment psychology. Actually as McCrone makes clear, his viewpoint is fundamentally SOCIOLOGICAL. He therefore echoes philosophers and psychologists who have emphasised the social aspect of thought: Vygotsky and the later Wittgenstein.The implications of this are rather radical.Firstly, the view of Artificial Intelligence and 'Cognitivism' is incorrect. There is no such thing as emotionless reason, or cognition without a social context.Secondly 'cognitivism' (and similar views: i.e. those of Fodor and Chomsky) cannot be correct. Cognitivism argues that cognition was an 'internal' process. But McCrone shows (in the case of feral children) this is false. Cognition is intrinsically external and social. The 'internal monologue' (as Vygotsky proved) developed AFTERWARDS.Finally this is a very interesting and well written book. McCrone's other books are also excellent as is his webiste 'Neuronaut'.

Still, if you don't know much about the brain itelf and how it functions this book is an fascinating place to start learning about it."},{"Title":"Core knowledge sequence: Content guidelines for grades K-8","review":"This book is basically a series of checklists.

It shows growth both in the characters and in the writing. It is a most satisfying ending to a riveting trilogy. I love how the author brings to life characters that are just like real life. Although Katie and Ben are wealthy business owners, they face the same problems you and I do; the pain of loss, sickness, separation, and yet through the strength that comes from faith, they can rise above those problems.

Enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Shadows of Light (Shadow of Dreams Series #3)","review":"Eva Marie Everson has given readers an enormous gift: a trilogy of novels with characters to love and hate, and a plot that keeps you tapping your fingers from one chapter to the next. From the time Katie Webster wakes up hazy in a filthy apartment, to the moment of her final celebration in a Hamptons mansion, Ms. Everson keeps the reader engaged in a suspenseful tale of desperation and success, betrayal and loyalty.I especially enjoyed Katie's relationship with her best friend Marcy, and the fact that her marriage is not all bliss and romance. Katie evolves from a young girl not quite sure of her own self into a powerful woman who fights for, and finds, a place of her own. Her cat-and-mouse game with a man determined to destroy her makes for many moments of cover-clinching, while her self-depreciating humor and intelligence will make the reader both admire her - and want to BE her.Katie is a woman to love reading about - and remembering."},{"Title":"Shadows of Light (Shadow of Dreams Series #3)","review":"Eva Marie Everson has given her readers a satisfying conclusion to the &quot;Shadows&quot; trilogy.

The basic speed reading strategies are not that many and are not that difficult to master. For some unknown reason, it is not even offered as a class in most high schools and colleges! Imagine all the hours you will save if you could finish your required reading in half the time or less?In 1989, I was preparing to take the GRE test to come to America and was intimidated by all the reading material I had to go through in order to prepare for the test. Then, as I was passing one of those street sellers that are such a common sight in India, I saw a copy of this book and the title caught my attention. I decided to make this my first book to read so I could finish the rest of the books faster. The strategy paid off and I increased my reading speed from 100 words per minute to over 2000 words per minute in less than 6 months! In the process, my engineering grades picked up as I was not only reading faster but also retaining complex material better. Needless to say, I did fantastic on my test scores and came to America to attend graduate school in 1991.The basis behind the author's theory is that speed reading, high concentration and material retention are all linked. You can't do one without the other very effectively. So, if you start reading fast, you are forced to concentrate and this increases retention. The high concentration that is induced when you try to read faster results in some interesting physiological changes in the brain where the memory of what you are reading gets etched more permanently than the times when you don't have high concentration. This is not explained in the book, but I came to that conclusion after I became curious about what makes the book's techniques so effective and researched deeper into the subject. I don't want to go too much into the book's techniques because I think they are more effective if you read them directly from the book for the first time.Since then, I have purchased several other books on speed reading but I still find this to be the best book on the subject. My perception may be skewed because I had already increased my reading speed to the physical limits of how fast my eyes could move. But the reason I like this book is because Norman Lewis does not make any ridiculous claims and his methods are very simple, common-sense techniques that are easy to follow. In some of the other books, I found a few of the techniques to be so silly that I never even tried them.People who meet me and eventually learn about my reading speed always ask me how I was able to make such a dramatic change. When I tell them about this book, they try finding it at the local bookstore and are never able to find it! So, I end up parting with my copy and picking up a new one the next time I visit India. I am glad that one can find this book on Amazon.com now. I can tell my friends to get a copy from here.Your reading speed tends to drop over time if you don't relearn these techniques once every few years. Of course, people with glasses will see results that are less dramatic than people without glasses due to the restriction in their field of vision. But everyone benefits from these solid, proven techniques. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did and recommend it to your friends that are interested in sharpening their brains."},{"Title":"How to read better and faster","review":"This is the most useful book on speed-reading I've found so far. It goes from the goals of reading (getting the main idea, getting specific details, overall perception) to specific techniques that help achieving those goals.

I find this approach much more useful and productive than blind acquisition of techniques with the broad ill-defined goal of reading faster that other speed-reading books (at least the ones I've run into) seem to concentrate on."},{"Title":"How to read better and faster","review":"This book offers techniques that I will continue to use.

The forces of nature play a major part (both good and bad) in life on the trail. You get a true feeling for Irish country life and love and honor and pride.

Hersey worked for Sinclair Lewis and his mentor's style is obvious. It is done in the same rather superficial narrative style.as Lewis' works. Admittedly, I like a novel with psychological, spiritual and symbolic aspects. A Bell for Adano does have the the overly obvious symbolism of the connection to our Liberty Bell. Basically this is a propaganda piece for W.W.II. It did have over 20 printings in a short period of time which brings to mind the expression that no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American and, in this case, also British people.

A BELL FOR ADANO is basically a series of vignettes centered around this story, not a tale of personality transformation. The good guys remain good, but bad guys will be bad.Hersey presents his story in a very nave style, similar to Saroyan at the same period. It was a morale-boosting effort, self-praising by Americans to tell themselves \\"this is what we stand for, this is what we are fighting for\\". It was a moment in history when Americans believed they had something very special to offer the world. The American way, democratic and hardworking, is contrasted to whatever existed in Sicily before. Even if there's army-navy rivalry, if there are bad apples among the Americans, the newly-arrived victors mean well. The American characters are rough and smooth, good and bad, but nothing is very philosophical or psychologically deep. The characters are all pretty thin. Some parts seemed very sappy to me with their \\"sweet\\" Italian characters, most of whom came from some stockbook of stereotypes.Fifteen years after Hersey wrote this novel (which was a great success at the time), \\"The Ugly American\\" tried to show a similar thing---that we have a lot to offer the world, but we are our own worst enemies. After another half century---how many invasions more ?--- today we are perhaps a bit wiser, a little more cynical. The American occupation of Sicily is an interesting bit of world history, but our approach to the period has changed over 65 years, and it would be hard to convince most contemporary readers that we are so benign. That's why I would say that this is a book that has not stood the test of time very well. It may have made Americans proud in those days of world war, but I think three stars are more than sufficient today."},{"Title":"A Bell for Adano","review":"Back in high school, I made a vow to myself that I would eventually read all of the Pulitzer Prize winning novels. A Bell for Adano was one of the first that I read. Now, a few years later, I have read around 30 of those novels, and while many have been wonderful, few have matched the experience of reading A Bell for Adano, and I continue to return to it.The splendid novel is set during World War II, though it isn't really a war novel. The novel is about how very different people can, and should treat one another, especially when in a difficult situation. A Bell for Adano primarily concerns Major Joppolo. He is an American officer placed in charge of the city of Adano after the invasion. Joppolo is a wonderful, though flawed man. He's always practical but remains sentimental. He sets out to make the lives of the people of Adano the best he possibly can. He does so by not treating them as the enemy but as People. The &quot;bell&quot; of Adano refers his attempt to restore an historic bell to the city that it had lost during the war.I can never do justice to my favorite novels when I review them, and this is one of them. I can't say enough good about it. The characterizations are strong and the interactions between the characters are touching and thought-provoking. Joppolo's relationship to the city's people is truly remarkable. It makes one think about America's relationship with foreign countries. The story is heart-tugging and humorous. There are few novels written this century that can touch a reader as much as this one does, and this one can make you think a little, too. A Bell for Adano certainly deserved its prize, and it definitely deserves to not be forgotten."},{"Title":"A Bell for Adano","review":"John Hersey would go on to win the Pulitzer Prize and become a prominent star in the pantheon of twentieth century writers. This book was written during World War II and was a best-seller when released in 1944. And it still resonates today. In short, it is the story of an American officer given civil responsibility for overseeing the coastal Italian town of Adano following its liberation by American forces.How Major Victor Joppolo goes about this task is interesting as are the variety of Italians-former fascists and anti-fascists alike--he meets and, eventually, wins over. More gripping, though, is the character of Jappolo himself who, in many ways, Hersey repressents as Everyman--or at least EveryAmercicanman. He is practical, yet sentimental. He wants to do good, but also wants to be loved. He has a strong sense of loyalty, yet hungers after an Italian woman despite loving his wife back home. He admires the Italians, but shapes them in our American mold. He is--in modern psychobabble--conflicted; imperfect, yet very admirable.The title refers to the city's most prominent--it has dozens of them--bell which for seven hundred years called the people to work, to eat, to love, to church, to life. It was shipped away by the retreating Germans to be made into bullets at some northern foundry. Its lack leaves a gaping wound in the civic fabric. Joppolo, of course, gets the town a replacement bell. How he does it fills you with pride. His first hearing of its strong voice can break your heart. This is a worthwhile book both as a story and as a still provocative look at the American character."},{"Title":"A Bell for Adano","review":"My head read this book and said: &quot;If only Iraq were this easy. The Americans invade Sicily in World War II and Major Joppolo is put in charge of the small town of Adano. Despite the grisly casualties in the taking of the town, the whole place falls instantly in love with the American major. And what about those ethnic stereotypes? The Sicilians all seem like goodhearted but slightly retarded children, an impression reinforced by their comical dialogue, both when they speak English (&quot;Okay, a boss, you're a not a kid Giuseppe&quot;) and in literal translation, when they speak their native language (so &quot;Viva il Signor Capitano!&quot; becomes &quot;Live the Mr. Captain!&quot;). Sicilians who were there during the war say it was not this way at all: the Americans installed members of the mafia as mayors to keep the Sicilians under control.&quot;My heart, who also read the book, replied: &quot;You just don't understand. This is a beautiful tale about how a single individual can make a difference. Two vastly different worlds collide, but the result is pure magic because Major Joppolo throws the rule book away and reaches out to the town with his heart, inventing novel solutions to problems, trying to get a replacement for the bell that the Germans stole, and, above all, connecting with the people. The humor is marvelous: The scene in which the priest holds an interminable church service waiting for the major, who promised to attend but who has lost track of the time, will guarantee at least one chuckle. And Hersey choreographed the poignant scene when the Italian prisoners of war come home to their women as pure ballet.&quot;In the end my heart prevailed when my head remembered that Aristotle said that the purpose of drama was not to represent reality, but to effect &quot;a catharsis of pity and fear.&quot; This book will do more than that: it will make you smile, and it will make you feel a little better about the human race."},{"Title":"A Bell for Adano","review":"As another reader has said, I also am making my way through Pulitzer winners. I'd intended to save this one until the end, because for some reason I was under the (much mistaken) impression that it was going to be boring. Boy, shows you first impressions aren't always right! This is a heartwarming and yet bittersweet story - you wish there were more people out there like the Major and less people like the General, and the types they represent. I read the novel in about three hours; it's that compelling and ultimately enriching. I'm glad I didn't wait!"},{"Title":"A Bell for Adano","review":"A Bell For Adano is heart-warming story set in an otherwise horrific period of history.Illustrating the charm of an American soldier and the filling of the voids in a war-ravaged Italian town, Hersey makes you smile and beg for more. While the tone is ethnocentric in its portrayal of the Italian vision of the Americans, A Bell for Adano is a read that I emphatically recommend."},{"Title":"A Bell for Adano","review":"A great story and great dialogue. This is a well constructed book that has great characters and great imagery but also manages to keep the story moving along. While i am sure my enjoyment was enhanced because i read it while in Italy, I would have enjoyed reading this anywhere. It is a great portrait of small town Italy and of people.It is also interesting in this story of the US liberation of Italy, that it was written in the mid-1940s and has a thinly-veiled very negative portrayl of General Patton."},{"Title":"A Bell for Adano","review":"I read this back in High School in the sixties. I recently saw the movie and remarked how I did not remember much of anything about it, so I got the book and read it. It is an easy read and quite entertaining. The movie is excellent but the book is outstanding. It is charming, warm and real. It demonstrates that in this world we have bureaucrats and politicians out for themselves (like Gen. Marvin.) We have people who want to do better but cannot because they are jaded(Borth, Purvis). And fortunately we have some Jopollos who are kind and caring. Too bad there are not many of them in leadership. They are lacking even in the church but there are notable exceptions. I recommend this to anyone looking to read soemthing inspirational to life them out of the doldrums. I had read Hiroshima and that seems to get more attention than this work. This is a thoroughly worthwhile read."},{"Title":"A Bell for Adano","review":"I loved this book. I will admit that I'm a fan of the 1940s, both movies and books. However, this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel transcends all that -- it's simply a fine story. Even though the theme is World War II, this is not a story of battle. Instead, it's about a compassionate major and his attempts to bring humanity to a war-torn town in Italy. The books is funny, charming and moving. It's a quick read and a worthwhile one. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Bell for Adano","review":"I read this book because I was reading all of the Pulitzer Prize winning novels.

Set in Adano, Italy during WWII, it gives the reader a sense of another point of view of the war. The townspeople and the situations are hilarious, you'll laugh the whole way through. Keep this in mind, but keep some tissues nearby."},{"Title":"A Bell for Adano","review":"This a truly outstanding story. It can be enjoyed on many levels. Most obviously, it is wonderfully refreshing in showing American soldiers at their jobs -- winning a war and improving the lives of their former adversaries. It is also a poignantly understated love story. It is also a humorous and brilliant study in how organizations work, including the countless ways that underlings attempt to undermine \\"orders\\" from the top. It is also a true-to-life tale about the many ways an American occupation of a foreign country can go disastrously wrong, though in Adano disaster is narrowly averted over and again. The writing style is beautiful and spare.Adult themes are treated with good taste. This treatment makes them all the more powerful in the story.Not so long ago, Adano was a common fixture on school reading lists. The general lack of comments from students here on Amazon confirms my impression that schools are not teaching Adano much these days. That's a shame. Adano is a vastly better work than the politically correct tripe that so many schools dish out (a very partial list: My Brother Sam is Dead; Farewell to Manzanar; The House on Mango Street; The Bomb; The Slave Dancer). If you are home schooling, note that Adano won the Pulitzer Prize and is a proper substitute for almost any book that appears on current \\"recommended\\" lists."},{"Title":"A Bell for Adano","review":"Have heard this title for years and finally decided to read it.

I encourage everyone to read this book because it Truely is a great book."},{"Title":"A Bell for Adano","review":"Decades ago, a high school classmate raved about A Bell for Adano, but for some reason I never got around to reading this novel until recently. It is not only a heart-warming story, but a realistic portrayal of the best of America's soldiers not only in fighting during World War II, but also in carefully rebuilding nations. This well-crafted novel also offers a civics lesson, so desperately needed today, about the wonder of democracy and ethical leadership, especially to the people of the small Italian village of Adano, who have suffered so long under a totalitarian regime. Hersey takes readers on a bittersweet, yet hopeful journey as his humble hero struggles against the entrenched corruption of the former fascist regime and the incompetence of his own military bureaucracy to convince the people of Adano that in a democratic society they may decide their own destiny. Very highly recommended to anyone who enjoys reading the finest American literature."},{"Title":"A Bell for Adano","review":"This book has been on my mind a lot since I read it.

A must read."},{"Title":"A Bell for Adano","review":"I read John Hersey's The Child Buyer in college and enjoyed a spirited discussion of it with a professor. Now I remember nothing about it, but I've wanted to read another Hersey novel every since. Written in 1944 about the Allied occupation of a coastal Italian town, the Pulitzer winner A Bell for Adano is surprisingly funny at times. Obviously Hersey is making a patriotic point and a plug for democracy with his American hero Major Victor Joppolo, whose fairness and good will contrast sharply with the corruption of the former Nazi regime. His real nemesis, though, is General Marvin--the type of bad-tempered American whose behavior Joppolo is continually having to apologize for. Joppolo has his hands full as he tries to fulfill basic needs like food and water, but he also wants to restore morale. One of his big tasks in this latter regard is to find a replacement for the town's bell, which was confiscated by the Nazis to be melted down into ammunition. Quirky Italian characters abound, from the head fisherman who refuses to set foot in a government office, to the town crier, who likes to put his own spin on proclamations. I haven't had this much fun reading about the military since I read Joseph Heller's Catch-22, which was a much more challenging read. Unlike Revolutionary Road, I think that this book has held up well over time."},{"Title":"A Bell for Adano","review":"This book is wonderful in its clear language and soft touch. You will instantly feel a part of the town and its inhabitants. The book tells the story of a small town in Italy occupied by the Americans at the end of WW2. It relates how the occupied village interacts with its human, caring &quot;occupier&quot;, an American army officer. Much like Corelli's Mandolin by Louis de Bernieres, this book puts a massive event in world history into focus. I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"A Bell for Adano","review":"This is John Hersey's wonderful \\"feel good\\" novel set in Italy during WW II. Major Victor Joppolo has been assigned senior civil affairs officer of the allied occupied town of Adano. Joppolo, an Italian-American, is a good man who only wants to do what is best for the town. He befriends the town's citizens, determines their needs, and tries to accommodate them. In addition to the major concern of getting the people fed, he learns that the town once had a bell that was rung every quarter-hour until Mussolini had it removed to be melted down for ammunition. Joppolo goes on a mission to get the bell back or replaced somehow.Of course there must be a black hat countering Joppolo's every good move, and that person is General Marvin, the dictatorial, self-important, and ultimately destructive Commander-in-Chief - obviously based on Gen. George Patton. Joppolo is willing to bend and even subvert orders to accomplish what he perceives his task to be: to bring order, decency, and democracy to the war-torn and defeated town. He succeeds marvelously, despite Marvin's interference, and receives the praises of all the Italian civilians he deals with (sometimes this is overdone just a wee bit). Hersey's Italian characters are warm and very human; especially good are the proud fisherman Tomasino and Joppolo's interpreter Giuseppe. Hersey based his novel on a short article he'd written for LIFE magazine, which told of a visit he'd made to the American military governor at Licata, Italy, in 1943. The book is entertaining and life-affirming - interesting for a war novel."},{"Title":"A Bell for Adano","review":"another 5 star vote for a great book.

Thanks for your support..."},{"Title":"A Bell for Adano","review":"In early 1944, the United States of America was completely engaged in World War II. Although national confidence and resolve were high that America would win the war, there were still many months of hard, costly fighting ahead. Most Americans supported the war effort, and considered the conflict to be justified, although the desire that it be over was virtually universal. Nonetheless, some Americans may have questioned why the U.S. was even involved in what to them seemed to be a \\"European\\" war, or a war in Asian theaters which many people had never even heard of.John Hersey was a war correspondent. Released in February, 1944, his work, \\"A Bell for Adano,\\" was a fictional creation based on his own experiences and observations during the war. In it, he tells in a simple, often humorous manner the story of U.S. Army Major Victor Joppolo, the son of immigrants, who is assigned the task of governing a small Italian town during its American occupation. In doing so, Hersey portrays everything America -- and Americans -- were fighting for in the war: to make the world a better place through democracy. Early in the book, in an address to the towns officials, Joppolo tries to explain to them that it is their job to serve the community, not master it. \\"What makes a man master of another man?\\" he asks. \\"It is that he pays him for his work. Who pays the men in the government? The people do, for they pay the taxes . . . \\"In telling the story of Joppolo and the town of Adano, Hersey gives the reader a glimpse into the characters and personalities of typical American servicemen. Some are admirable, such as the Navy's Lieutenant Livingston. Some are honest but flawed, such as the military police commander, Captain Purvis. Some are difficult to embrace, such as General Marvin. One of the strengths of this work is that Hersey did not put make-up over their warts and flaws, but allows the reader to see their shortcomings. It is one of the more subtle aspects of the moral that the American system of democracy works despite the Americans themselves.As the United States now moves well into the 21st Century, it is more than worth a gaze back to 1944, to use that glimpse to try and determine if we are still on a course our grand-parents and great-grand-parents would approve. This, for me, is the true contemporary value of the 1945 Pulitzer winner, and why it is still a worthwhile and relevant read nearly 75 years after its release.\\"A Bell for Adano\\" is a delightful and quick read that will linger in your thoughts long after you have closed the back cover. Enjoy."},{"Title":"A Bell for Adano","review":"This Pulitzer Prize-winning tale recounts the experiences of Major Victor Joppolo, an Italian-American officer put in charge of administering the American-occupied village of Adano, Italy in the final days of WWII. Joppolo's ostensible mission is to rebuild the village's infrastructure in the wake of the war and the toll exacted by decades of facist rule. However, Joppolo understands that he has been charged with a less tangible but even more important duty: to demonstrate the advantages of American governance, justice, and empathy and win over the hearts/minds of the townspeople. To this end, he devotes himself to locating a replacement for a beloved and deeply-mourned town bell looted by the facists. I admit I quickly fell in love with Hersey's beguiling characters, his courtly prose, and his gentle but penetrating eye for irony.It is easy - perhaps too easy - to label the author's depiction of characters in the novel as stereotypical, and his depiction of Joppolo's attitude towards the citizens of Adano as condescending and paternalistic. At least part of the problem is that the charm of Hersey's prose tends to mask the extent to which his characters embody both virtue and vice. Joppolo's aide-de-camp cleverly humiliates a former facist official up to no good, but his intentions towards the women in the town are unabashedly crude. General Martin delights in liberating Italy from wicked facists, but thinks nothing of brutally slaughtering a donkey belonging to a peasant, simply because he has the temerity to get in his way. Even the actions of Joppolo are depicted as a recognizably human balance between idealism (believing in the superiority of the \\"American Way\\") and vanity (wanting to win the love/admiration of the townspeople), loyalty (to his country) and disloyalty (to his wife).In short, I believe that perceived anachronisms in this tale may accurately represent actual anachronisms that existed at this fascinating moment in U.S. history. It was a time when average villagers in small rural European towns genuinely were unsophisticated, when America genuinely did feel a paternalistic responsibility towards the rest of the world; a time when Americans embraced cultural stereotypes as a way of celebrating their country's diversity, and when American servicemen saw nothing hypocritical in idealizing their wives while simultaneously seeking the physical solace of foreign damsels. Hersey's gift is helping us to see how these anachronisms have shaped (and continue to shape) the way the world has come to view Americans, and the way we have come to view ourselves."},{"Title":"A Bell for Adano","review":"At first I was thinking, this is Pulitzer prize winning novel? Please.But on second thought, A Bell for Adano has a lot of wonderful qualities.Thematically the novel is very rich and unapologetically honest. It deals with the theme of authority, and the consequences of going against authority. Even though the Americans have arrived to Adano after the fall of Mussolini to try to usher in democracy, the reader discovers quickly that, in some instances, the Americans with their democracy are sometimes no better than Mussolini and his Fascism. In many instances, some of the American and British characters are insensitive to Italian culture, and make no effort to even understand the people and their way of life. The indifference and bureaucracy displayed by Mussolini's government is also infuriatingly rampant among the American Army and Navy occupying Adano.Many of the scenes were so endearing I had make myself slow down to enjoy them all the more. They were artfully done. Using quick and sharp dialogue, Hersey managed to capture the nuances of everyday life in this Italian town.But when I finished, I was sort of thinking, this is it? This novel is basically about a man, Major Jappolo, who runs the small Sicilian town of Adano during WWII. His long-term goal is to get the town a new bell. Other than that, he helps these people recover their life after years of a miserable existence under the rule of Mussolini. That's all great ... but there didn't seem to be much of a STORY.The character development of the protagonist felt a little thin to me. His character was the same throughout the novel. Not a major problem, but had their been some growth on the part of his character, the novel could have been richer.So, while A Bell for Adano had many great qualities, when you put it all together it still left me rather lukewarm."},{"Title":"Whiteoaks","review":"Quite a few years ago I was introduced to the Jalna series.

Conditionning is under-covered (by far) which could be dangerous. Pitching strategy is fast-covered and won't help a young pitcher nor a coach establishing a systematic approach. Pitching mechanic seems uncomplete or contains erroneous descriptions. However, some pictures of feet-only position or different arm path types and release points are a (rare) great tool for aspiring pitchers. Pick-off description and pictures, pitcher fielding responsibilities are covered and well described, certainly not exhaustively.

Without a doubt, the projects in this book are made up in the most sophisticated and exciting palettes ever seen in a quilt book. And the quilts--all of which look eminently doable, even by a rank beginner--are photographed in such lush, visually sumptuous settings that you can happily spend hours simply &quot;reading&quot; the photos. The other thing I like about this book is that these quilts are quite possible. We are not talking about quilts with 75 differently shaped chunks of fabric that must be pieced into each block. These quilts are not exercises in perfectionistic anality, but are made of simple geometric shapes that let the fabric do the talking, and leave the quiltmaker with sanity intact. Admittedly, one of the authors does have a signature line of fabric, and many quilts photographed make extensive use of that line. But any quilter's fabric stash already contains many comparable textiles that could be put to more sophisticated use, in exciting new combinations shown in this book. Several of the quilts in this book make use of &quot;orphan&quot; blocks that are showcased by being re-set with imaginative new uses of color and fabric pattern. This seems a respectful use and transformation of handwork from earlier times: the newly-made quilts look fresh and exciting, even when they used segements of old cliche patterns such as wedding ring and grandmother's flower garden. But you don't have to be a quilter to love this book. Although it has simple, easy-to-follow diagrams and directions for each product, the book could just as well appeal to knitters, painters, weavers, decorators or anyone else with a love of and appetite for color used creatively. I have already picked out my next few quilting projects inspired by this book. (The &quot;rice bowl&quot; and &quot;hatbox&quot; quilts are particularly compelling). That I would use quilts in this book as a model is certainly something I could not say for nine out of every ten other quilting books published. But \`\`Passionate Patchwork'' has sophistication and verve, appealing to both the traditional quilter and and the fans of the cutting-edge contemporary. Bottom line? I love this book."},{"Title":"Passionate Patchwork: Over 20 Original Quilt Designs","review":"I agree with vikinges perfect description \\"drunk with color\\" as this book takes simple traditional patterns and explodes them through the creative use of color. I've always been pretty bold with color but I never knew chartreuse could look so wonderful in a quilt.However my chief complaint, which keeps it from getting 5 stars, is that in a world made easy with strip piecing, all of the patterns are presented with templates. An experienced quilter will be able to adapt the patterns to rotary cutting, but why torture a beginning quilter? So I must disagree with the earlier reviewer who felt this was the only quilting book one would ever need. Instead, it should be looked at as a fabulous addition to a diverse quilting library.That said, I am very inspired by the quilts in this book and have my sights set on making the Suzani quilt soon. I'm off to get that chartreuse fabric now..."},{"Title":"Passionate Patchwork: Over 20 Original Quilt Designs","review":"The people at my local quilt were eagerly anticipating the latest book by Kaffe Fassett and Liza Prior Lucy, and now I understand why. After browsing through the store copy of the book, I had to buy a copy for myself. The quilts in this book are not the boring, traditional quilts that you see in most other books, but great new designs that any contemporary quilt artist will enjoy. As a new quilt artist, I will certainly use the elements from the quilts in this book in my future quilts. I especially liked the Indigo Courthouse Steps, the African Weave Throw, and the Shirt-Stripe Boxes. The stories behind the development of these designs also show that quilt artists should take inspiration from everyday happenings. The final chapter is also especially helpful, as it provides instructions for making all of the quilts in the book that quilt artists of all skill levels could follow."},{"Title":"Passionate Patchwork: Over 20 Original Quilt Designs","review":"PASSIONATE PATCHWORK is another fun and color drenched book by textile artist Kaffe Fassett. He and Liza Prior Lucy designed and created over 20 original quilt patterns for this book. Upon receiving the book, I immediately spent over an hour of time just perusing the pages and reading the descriptions of the gorgeous patchwork quilts.Fassett's patchwork interpretations are wonderful, but, as always, it's the rich color combinations that make his work so enjoyable. Some of my favorites are: the Gypsy Garden Quilt in lush reds and greens; the Moody Blues Quilt is rich in jewel tones; the Japanese Brocades quilt is a garden of large and small muted flowers; the Hat Boxes Quilt has 36 different boxes, each made up in a different flora pattern; Nona's Quilt, which Fassett patterned after an embroidery piece that had been a gift from his grandmother, is done in a geometric design of yellows, pinks, lavender and greens. Fassett says that the original piece had been stolen from him and he did the design from memory. I believe my overall favorite is the Haitian Fonthill Quilt. It's an angled quilt done in rich vibrant colors and bordered with purple and lavender flowers.I also enjoyed several quilts that were a combination of old and new. The authors purchased old bundles of patchwork blocks and put them together with new material and made quilts. Those quilts are featured in the introduction to the book and are called: Medallion Circles, Granny's Flower Garden and String Stars. Kaffe spoke of attending a quilt festival where vendors \\"bring old patchwork tops or just bundles of blocks that were meticulously sewn together to become part of someone's bright idea for a quilt. Either the creator of these died, or just got distracted. All that work will have gone to waste if someone else doesn't take these blocks and build a quilt around them. I can't tell you how stimulating it is to do just that.\\"I believe that anyone who enjoys making quilts or just looking at beautiful handmade creations would love PASSIONATE PATCHWORK."},{"Title":"Passionate Patchwork: Over 20 Original Quilt Designs","review":"This book is inspirational to me. There are so many brilliant colors and designs that I am sure I will be busy for years trying to make even a few of them. The quilts in this book have the power to transform a room. They are real show-stoppers. I read some of the other reviews about this book and was shocked to read comments like, only the quilt on the cover has bright colors, the others were drab. That is just not true. If I had a complaint I would say the text is not as detailed as I would like. The book was clearly written to showcase quilt design, not to teach patchwork quilting. But that is exactly why I bought it, so I am not the least bit dissapointed."},{"Title":"Passionate Patchwork: Over 20 Original Quilt Designs","review":"I've seen and collected all the knitting and needlepoint books just for the fabulous photography and amazing color that permeates Kaffe's work. And now Liza Lucy has transposed his color sensibilities into quilting by using the simple geometric designs that quilting is based on, while fixing it with that supersaturated color. There is something here both for the quilt appreciator as well as the advanced practitioner, and I am hoping that we are only on the beginning of a very long series. Worth having on your library shelf for the visual appeal even if you never intend to sew a seam!"},{"Title":"Passionate Patchwork: Over 20 Original Quilt Designs","review":"If you have a passion for patchwork -- or for beatiful things in general -- this will be one of the favorites in your library.

I ordered this one primarily because I loved the quilt on the cover, and figured that I would like the other quilts. Well, the one on the cover is one of the few that uses those vibrant, rich colors. Many of the others use light-colored, &quot;busy&quot; fabrics that I don't really care for. It's a matter of taste, of course, but the cover is somewhat misleading. That said, the quilt patterns are beautiful and I can just use the colors I like. It's not a beginner's book, but it didn't present itself as one.

In fact, the Kaffe Fassett sweater I knitted my husband has to be the peak of my knitting &quot;career.&quot;Glorious Patchwork was a fun book, but as a knitter AND quilter, I feel that Kaffe's quilting is just a regurgitation of his knitting designs.

It is my favorite quilting book in my entire quilting library. I have bought all of his quilting books since, but this remains the best. Any time I am considering a new project, this is in the stack of books I bring to the couch for brainstorming. I have probably looked through the whole thing at least 100 times. I have taught several friends to quilt, and I lend this book out often because the patterns are so easy! It helps them think carefully when they start making trips to the fabric store (an overwhelming prospect).The patterns are very simple and can be easily made by a beginning quilter. The challenge that Fassett offers his readers is how to create the effects of saturated color (either rich and dark or light and airy) that he gets using the fabrics he designed, but using your own stash. I have learned so much about color just reading this book over and over again. I love that he gives two different color options for many of the quilts, and writes out the proportions of the colors for each. I have jumped off into creating my own palettes with great success due to this book."},{"Title":"Passionate Patchwork: Over 20 Original Quilt Designs","review":"Kaffe Fassett has wonderful fabrics and quilt designs.

I did find it inspiration."},{"Title":"Passionate Patchwork: Over 20 Original Quilt Designs","review":"I'm probably just repeating what others have said, but how could anyone say anything bad about this book? When it arrived I sat down just to skim it until I had more time. An hour later I was still there, reading every word! The colors are so gorgeous, as all of his colors are.

It's a good book but I suspect some publisher marketing or a weak year for the competition. Butchers Hill is a solid read but hardly earth shattering.First and foremost, this is a very urban tale and not about the pretty side of city life. The book revolves around Tess' first two clients at her new office. What start out as simple cases to locate missing persons quickly grow complicated and intertwined. Tess is thrown into the world of urban foster care issues. The plotting is strong and I found myself thinking about the book between chapters.My jury is still out on this series. The Baltimore setting doesn't do much for me - it's pretty bleak through Tess' eyes. Tess doesn't stand out among her peers in the female P.I. land. Kinsey and V.I. have been doing similar stuff for a long time. Of the new generation, I'd rather read Evanovich's Stephanie Plum who seems genuinely orginal (and funny).Bottom-line: Still not sure what the fuss is about concerning Lippman. A perfectly adequate read but nothing outstanding. Reading of previous books in the series (Baltimore Blues and Charm City) is helpful but not essential."},{"Title":"Butcher's Hill : A Tess Monaghan Mystery (Tess Monaghan Mysteries Ser.)","review":"My favorite character in the Tess series is Baltimore. Lippman carefully maps out a city every bit as complex as any of the human characters. If you like Peretsky's Chicago or Grafton's Santa Theresa, then you'll love the Tess Monaghan mysteries. While the ending is just a bit too pat, Tess and her city are very convincingly portrayed."},{"Title":"Butcher's Hill : A Tess Monaghan Mystery (Tess Monaghan Mysteries Ser.)","review":"Tess Monaghan feels good about switching careers and officially opening up a private investigator's office in a not so nice address in Baltimore.

Luther, known as the \\"Butcher of Butcher's Hill, hires Tess to locate the kids who witnessed his actions in order to make reparations.However, the witnesses to the Butcher's crime start getting killed. Tess wonders if she has abetted her client whose reparation might really be revenge. As she investigates what is going on, Tess finds herself butting heads with a system whose victims are the children it allegedly was set up to help.BUTCHER'S HILL, the third novel in the Monaghan mysteries, proves that three is the charm as it is as good as the superb first two tales (see BALTIMORE BLUES and CHARM CITY). The dialogue, especially on race relations, is some of the most realistic and believable to grace a mystery in years. Tess is a terrific character and the city of Baltimore adds a special flavor as used by the talented Laura Lippman. This trio of novels is top rate, enjoyable literature that fans of female sleuths need to read.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Butcher's Hill : A Tess Monaghan Mystery (Tess Monaghan Mysteries Ser.)","review":"Is it my imagination, or are my favorite paperback authors writing faster while the books get weaker?

I find myself looking at the clock while reading Lippman or after about 1 hour I find I have to stop.I think the reason is the stories are detailed. You meet several characters and find out all about them quickly. Also, her characters often meet at certain places or go someplace together so you get quite a description about what the locale is like.I don't want to say I need an easy read or that I can't concentrate it's just that I don't lose track of time reading these stories.

Five years earlier, Luther was imprisoned for shooting a young boy vandalizing his car, and Luther wants Tess to find the children who witnessed the shooting so he can make amends to them. Almost immediately, two of those children are found murdered and the police target Beale as the killer. Tess's second case, which becomes a parallel investigation, involves a sophisticated fundraiser who wants Tess to find the child her sister gave up for adoption thirteen years earlier. Tess soon finds herself chasing clues on two cases based on deception, one of which will lead Tess back to her own childhood.Tess Monaghan is a refreshing character; an athletic woman with flawed characteristics and a dysfunctional family who strives to do the ethical thing.

Against the advice of her lawyer, the local homicide detective, and sometimes her own better judgment, Tess agrees to help these clients. The intertwined mysteries unfold as Tess once again plumbs the gritty, familiar neighborhoods of Baltimore searching for the lost children. What's wonderful about this growing series is Lippman's shrewd ability to keep the drama real and close to the vest as far as her heroine is concerned. This is Tess' story as much as it is the story of the disenfranchised lower classes of Baltimore and the two worlds collide and mesh in wholly unexpected ways. For Tess and the reader. Well done, Ms. Lippman. Another riveting read."},{"Title":"Butcher's Hill : A Tess Monaghan Mystery (Tess Monaghan Mysteries Ser.)","review":"I wasn't as impressed by the book before this one, Charm City, so I hoped this one would be more like the first one in the series (Baltimore Blues), and I'm delighted to say it was.In this, book three of the Tess Monaghan series, Tess opens her own PI agency with the help of her mentor/friend Tyner and a retired PI who lends her his name and status while he dashes off to enjoy his golden years.What makes this book so good are the following things:1) the two basic intertwined stories (Tess' search for children who'd witnessed a shooting some years before, and her search for the daughter a client gave up for adoption);2) the extra glimpses we get into Tess' family life (that is, the way that her grandmother, et.al., are interwoven into the story; the whole concept of family is important throughout the entire novel);3) the new detail we get about Tess herself (her previous battle with bulimia, etc.);4) the way Baltimore continues to be a character in Ms. Monaghan's novels; and5) the way this book sets up what will come in the next one [(In Big Trouble)by this, I mean that Tess personal life gets a LOT more attention here, and that leads directly into what becomes her most personal \\"case\\" in book four].Some characters cross over from book two, and some you likely loved are missing. I particularly missed Crow because he seemed such a good balance for Tess in book two.

With only her adopted greyhound Esskay for company, she interviews her first client, an elderly black man, who has just been released from prison for the supposed accidental shooting of a boy, years before. He wants her to locate the children who were present when the shooting took place, in order to make financial restitution, but as Tess locates them, some of them die, under varied circumstances. The local press and the police are convinced that the former prisoner is responsible for the deaths, but Tess believes the man's story. Another side issue to this story is the appearance of a young, black woman who wants Tess to find her child who was given up for adoption many years before, and, in pursuing this case, Tess finds members of her own family involved.

Then the witnesses start turning up dead.A new character is added to this series. Tess takes over the care of Esskay, her uncle's greyhound, while he recovers from a beating in the hospital.The plot is well developed and tight. Although the setting is Baltimore, you can imagine the story happening anywhere. Lippman seems to deal with social issues in her stories. In this book some issues mentioned include adoption and foster homes. I can't wait to get my hands on number 4 in this series."},{"Title":"Butcher's Hill : A Tess Monaghan Mystery (Tess Monaghan Mysteries Ser.)","review":"This is the novel where Tess Monaghan opens her PI office (using a little scam to get the license) and takes on her first clients. The two cases run together a little because they deal with the foster care system. They involve things that happened in the past. When Tess looks for the children who had been witnesses to a shooting, it stirs up a lot of trouble and eventually reveals related crimes. The novel covers her family (possibly as interesting as Plum's) including the uncle that neither side seems to claim, and an unexpected addition. There are social issues, and the underside of Baltimore, including black vs. white issues. A lot of the plot is based on the foster care system.Some readers may not be able to deal with some of the sticky issues covered in the novel. I don't think the author ever had the Klan burn a cross on her lawn, but that is probably because the novel was writen in the closing years of the 20th century (that did happen to another author at an earlier point in time).There is some coarse language in the novel. It seems to digress at points, but as you finish the novel it becomes apparent how some of the digressions fit into the plot. There is also a lot of background color on present day Baltimore."},{"Title":"Butcher's Hill : A Tess Monaghan Mystery (Tess Monaghan Mysteries Ser.)","review":"If you like your mysteries to be more than the cozy, sicky sweet variety, this series is for you. I don't understand about the previous reviewer's reference to bias. This book seemed to tell the insider's story of Baltimore, warts and all."},{"Title":"Butcher's Hill : A Tess Monaghan Mystery (Tess Monaghan Mysteries Ser.)","review":"This is the third of the Tess Monaghan books. Mysteries are often filled with cardboard characters and one or two well developed characters. Laura Lippman doesn't work that way. All her characters are imperfect, but then, so are real people. The characters in this, and the other two novels in this series are interesting and have twists and turns in their characteristics that are as amusing as are the twists and turns of the plots. Normally, I don't identify with female protagonists, but Tess is such an interesting person that even a straight guy such as myself enjoys her point of view.I recently had the opportunity to meet Laura Lippman when she came around to the local library to talk to her fans. She's also an interesting character."},{"Title":"Butcher's Hill : A Tess Monaghan Mystery (Tess Monaghan Mysteries Ser.)","review":"Even though I didn't particular care for the first two books in the Tess Monaghan series, a friend's recent relocation to Baltimore gave me enough of a nudge to go ahead and try the third. This installment opens with a prologue involving an altercation between a proud old man and a group of foster children running wild, which doesn't end well. Fast forward five years to the present, and we find former newspaper reporter Tess hanging out her shingle as a private investigator, complete with office in the titular semi-seedy neighborhood. (Given her relative ineptitude in the other two books, I'm not sure why her lawyer-rowing coach-mentor Tyler Gray thinks it's a good idea to push her into becoming a detective, but whatever.)Her first two cases present themselves on the same day. The first is Luther, the old man seen in the prologue, just released from five years in prison on gun charges stemming from the incident in the prologue. He wants Tess to track down the kids so that he can try and do some good. Her other client is a young professional black woman around her own age, seeking to track down her estranged sister. Of course, neither case is quite what it seems at first glance, and various reversals and revelations make for a rocky start to Tess's detecting career.They also make for a somewhat more compelling read than the previous two books in the series, although this one is also far from perfect. For one thing, the prologue presents a very obvious clue to the reader about the events of that evening five years previously, leaving the reader wondering for more than half the book just when Tess is going to be given the same information. And of course, when she does, it isn't the stunning scene it's meant to be. There's also a logical problem involving the other client's case, involving a \\"test\\" the client gives Tess, and its relation to the client's motivation for hiring her. I don't want to reveal anything, but the rationale for this test makes no sense in light of later revelations. Finally, Tess continues to be a rather dim investigator. Her two cases here are basically tracking people down, and she seems to have little notion of how to do this, and once again, she has to rely on family connections to arrive at one of her breakthroughs, and outsource computer searching to another person.On the plus side, Tess emerges as a richer character in this book (although still not one I'm hugely fond of). As in the last book, one plotline ends up entangling her family, and here we get a richer picture of her family dynamics (although her colorful Aunt Kitty is thankfully absent for most of the book). The book's highlight is the nicely realized construction of a friendship between Tess and her female client. The two plotlines also take the reader into the politics and economics of adoptions and foster care, making some interesting public policy commentary along the way. On the whole, I'm still rather underwhelmed by the series (given the amount of positive press it's received), but this is a notch better, so maybe like a lot of crime fiction authors, Lippman gets better as she writes more."},{"Title":"Butcher's Hill : A Tess Monaghan Mystery (Tess Monaghan Mysteries Ser.)","review":"Butchers Hill is the best of the series. There are many surprising twists. And well-constructed: I quickly got trapped in the dream of the novel, switching focus as the author placed different lenses of perspective on the &quot;facts&quot; presented to Tess. I also like that Tess herself puts together incorrect suppositions. It's real to life -- unlike, say, Mickey Spillane. Though mystery aficionados might find Tess' humanity a nuisance.Nice touch with the convict's dictionary-derived pedantry; I wish it had been carried further (in Charm City Laura did a similar thing with Spike's assistant's forming statements as questions).One caveat for the author: the heroine's family/friend environment is starting to resemble a Tom Clancylike picture of social palatability, albeit with an NPR-approved, nineties urbanite twist. Sigh. I mean, what's next? Kitty becomes a lesbian and finally can enjoy a meaningful relationship? There might be more dimension in revealing the humanity of one who is politically anathema to the author. Readers should check out NYC journalist Sparkle Hayter's wacky mysteries. Though I prefer Baltimore!"},{"Title":"Butcher's Hill : A Tess Monaghan Mystery (Tess Monaghan Mysteries Ser.)","review":"I read a series mystery for character, and a character is not interesting if she doesn't grow. With Butcher's Hill, Lippman takes us, and her character, inside the seedy side of Baltimore and adoption politics, and Lippman is a mistress of both. You always feel Baltimore when you read her books. More important, she takes you along with Tess. I love Tess. Lippman's protagonist is delightfully human. Like your little sister, the one you are frustrated with, hope the best for, love, admire, and wish she'd straighten up and find someone decent to love, Tess bumbles and fumbles her way through a life that's wonderfully rich, complex and authentic. Welcome to Baltimore. Welcome to Tess's world. And welcome another Lippman success. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Butcher's Hill : A Tess Monaghan Mystery (Tess Monaghan Mysteries Ser.)","review":"Lippman's writing continues to improve. She does a wonderful job of letting her characters age and learn from life, and the actual &quot;mystery&quot; is better than the two previous books. I do tend to think Lippman throws in a bit too much at the end (facts that suddenly change the direction of the story), but this fact didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book. If for no other reason, this book is worth reading to get to the next (In Big Trouble) - the best of the series, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Butcher's Hill : A Tess Monaghan Mystery (Tess Monaghan Mysteries Ser.)","review":"Tess really becomes a person in this third entry in this series. As the reader learns more about the missing children, more is also revealed about Tess and her relationships with her somewhat unorthodox family. The secondary characters become nearly fully realized and Tess becomes a likable hero. The two plot lines are nicely interwoven and believably resolved. Living close to the scene of the action, it's fun to recognize the foibles, flaws, and strengths of the book's setting."},{"Title":"Butcher's Hill : A Tess Monaghan Mystery (Tess Monaghan Mysteries Ser.)","review":"It took me a while to start enjoying this book. There are a number of subtle references to current pop culture (commercials, country songs, coffee salons) that feel extraneous to the story and don't really add to character or plot development.On the plus side, that seemed to diminish by the second half of the book, the plot picked up and there were plenty of surprise twists to keep me guessing.Overall, it's a decent light read, but its a far step from great literature."},{"Title":"Butcher's Hill : A Tess Monaghan Mystery (Tess Monaghan Mysteries Ser.)","review":"Lippmann's Tess Monaghan is gradually growing on me.

Good for a light read."},{"Title":"Butcher's Hill : A Tess Monaghan Mystery (Tess Monaghan Mysteries Ser.)","review":"This is a solid addition to the Tess Monaghan series. What it lacks in characterization is made up through a solid setting and some very good plot twists. It is interesting to read Lippman's books in order to see how Tess grows and also how the author develops better stories and mysteries."},{"Title":"Butcher's Hill : A Tess Monaghan Mystery (Tess Monaghan Mysteries Ser.)","review":"With each Tess Monaghan book I read, the more I like her. In Lippman's first book, \\"Baltimore Blues,\\" I was disappointed in Tess's character, coming to dislike her as much as I dislike Stephanie Plum in Janet Evanovich's books. She seemed bumbling, unintelligent, and generally unlikable.In \\"Butcher's Hill,\\" Lippman has Tess juggling two cases, which means two separate storylines for us. Lippman does a marvelous job balancing the two stories without neglecting or overdoing either of them. While both cases where underwhelming for my taste, I enjoyed watching Tess develop into a stronger, sharper, independent woman while she still struggles with her own flaws. I was pleasantly surprised at the turn of events at the end of the book, although I felt the ending was a bit rushed. I think the case involving Luther Beale seemed a bit rushed at the end and I feel like it could have ended a little more gracefully.I'm very pleased with Lippman's books and her further development with Tess. I look forward to reading more!The Last Saint"},{"Title":"CARDIOLOGY AT A GLANCE","review":"This book is a necessity for any first year cardiology fellow or housestaff managing cardiovascular patients.

Great book if you love two and three move checkmate puzzles."},{"Title":"303 Tricky Checkmates","review":"As a thirteen-year old, I bought this book at Borders as part of my birthday money. It's a wonderful book on checkmating (maybe one of the bests). Although I'm only up to chapter two, the rest of the book will probably be good too.However, if I could have looked at every checkmating book on Earth, I probably wouldn't have bought this. For example, Fred Reinfeld's &quot;1001 Brilliant Ways to checkmate&quot;, probably beats this book by a mile. It's slightly cheaper, I think, and has 698 more diagrams! (I haven't bought this book, but look at the reveiws for it, and you'll know why I'm saying this.)Even though this probably isn't the greatest checkmating book you can get, it's good enough, and will keep you busy. One more thing: I suggest that you get a used one, because if you want to use about $12.00 or so on a book, don't use it on this one."},{"Title":"303 Tricky Checkmates","review":"This book presents fun chess puzzles in an easy to understand, progressively difficult format. While it may be true that these puzzles are carefully constructed rather than the result of actual play, they teach the dynamics of checkmate in a simple, yet challenging way. The puzzles are designed and arranged to show how the various pieces work together in diverse circumstances and how slight changes influence the checkmate. This book teaches how to find that all-important first move in the series of moves that lead to checkmate and is good for young players just getting started and for more advanced players who want to stay sharp."},{"Title":"303 Tricky Checkmates","review":"This book appears to be a sequel to &quot;202 Surprising Checkmates&quot; by the same authors, and both books appear to be indebted to the much older &quot;1001 Brilliant Ways to Checkmates&quot; for their title. &quot;1001 Checkmates,&quot; by Fred Reinfeld, gives hundreds of positions which are apparently drawn from actual game situations, and the student who applies himself to the book can take away practical knowledge that will help in actual play. The positions in &quot;202 Checkmates&quot; and &quot;303 Checkmates&quot; could never be mistaken for actual game situations, and the mating patterns are not normally seen in actual play. Although the book appears to have little practical value, the problems were both challenging and entertaining.

Drawn from personal family history, he captures the brutality and the compassion of the early pioneers and the Indian nations that they were dispossessing.Lewis Wetzel &quot;Le vent de la mort&quot;, (Death Wind) is a prominent figure in this book. Wetzel is a genuine historical personage and is accurately portrayed as both a guardian to the border settlements and the Indian hater and killer he was known to be.The book follows the life and adventures of two brothers Jim and Joe, Jim a Christian missionary and Joe a gregarious newcomer to frontier life. Wetzel always known as a loner, develops a friendship with the young man Joe and trains him in the ways of forest woodcraft. All the while Jim struggles to strengthen and protect the already established Morvian Indian mission. All of this set against the intrigue of Indian politics,war and the rampaging murders and kidnappings of the white renegades Simon and Jim Girty.Although an historical novel, Zane Grey uses the various characters and happenings as a vehicle to give us a clear picture of the sentiment surrounding the precarious daily life for both the defenders of the Indian nations and those who acted as the American border rangers."},{"Title":"THE SPIRIT OF THE BORDER.","review":"Read this book almost twenty years ago and this is one novel that made its greatest impact on me.

After the first three stories about cheating husbands I put this book back on the shelf and probably will not pick it back up again."},{"Title":"Carrying the Torch: Stories (Prairie Schooner Book Prize in Fiction)","review":"The author writes well and can spin a yarn, and the first four stories are standouts. Past the fourth though the collection starts lose some variety and edge. It isn't the ubiquitous problematic husband that's tiring, but just the way this character is approached again and again, seeming to have the same voice over and over. Plus, some of the stories are too long and talky. That said, if you're wanting to see the same sad, inarticulate husband or marriage examined in several scene changes, this is your book.Some great stories still, and every one is graced with fine sentences. \\"For Those of Us Who Need Such Things\\" and \\"The Reason Was Us\\" are really great stories and definitely worth the admission price."},{"Title":"Carrying the Torch: Stories (Prairie Schooner Book Prize in Fiction)","review":"I thought \\"What We Won't Do\\" was an excellent collection of stories and was looking forward to \\"Carrying the Torch.\\" I haven't yet read every story, but the stories I have read are extremely disappointing, for a number of reasons. For one, in at least four stories, Clarke gives us philandering husbands. The author seems to see no other way to create domestic turmoil than to have a loutish man cheat on his wife. This seems to be a form of politically correct (and outdated) male bashing rampant in some liberal academic circles, but not every man cheats on his wife, nor is every woman a victim. By using cheating husbands over and over, it seems that the author has an axe to grind regarding infidelity, but the axe quickly becomes dull with repeated use. Also, in \\"Apology,\\" a male character tells his three previous wives that a priest had abused him, and each wife gives a callous response. Again, the author is using some rather shallow and unconvincing behavior to create a dramatic context. \\"For Those of Us Who Need Such Things\\" is a weak attempt at some sort of neo-Barthelme fiction, minus Barthelme's brilliant language, surrealism and satire. In Clarke's story, the narrator buys Savannah, Georgia, the sort of implausible act that happens frequently in Barthelme (see \\"The Dead Father,\\" \\"The Balloon,\\" etc.), but the mistake that many neo-Barthelmaniacs make is that they try to mix the fantastic with the mundane, with tepid results. (In a previous Clarke story, a grown man goes back to elementary school. I think something similar also happened in a Barthelme story.) \\"The Fund-Raiser's Dance Card\\" (featuring a cheating husband) is such an obvious homage to John Cheever's \\"The Swimmer\\" that Clarke even names one set of neighbors \\"the Cheevers.\\" Overall, Clarke treats his characters with contempt, not compassion. There's a school of thought that believes an author should have compassion for his characters, even if they are creeps and losers. One sees this compassion in Raymond Carver, where many of the male characters are louts, yet Carver manages to impart some dignity and forgiveness to his wounded men."},{"Title":"Moving Mountains: Lessons in Leadership and Logistics from the Gulf War","review":"General Pagonis has written a very informative book about his experience in the 1990-91 Gulf War with an emphasis on the lessons that the civilian bussiness sector can derive from it. Without a doubt he was a most capable officer for the job he undertook and his on the spot promotion to Lt General proved the great value of his work. The best parts of the book were those where Pagonis came close to General Shwarzkopf, either to receive laconic instructions or to guarantee that everything will be ready on time for the great outflanking maneuver he planned. Pagonis is a living example of what Greeks can achieve when they work inside a meritocracy system, open to talents like the american model (the complete opposite of what Greek political system encourages in our country in the last decades), and he gives many tips for the military and civilian logistician, like the stand-up morning meetings, the use of the 3X5 cards for the flow of information, the \\"ghostbusters\\" idea of mobile problem solvers, the great value of the vision in the leader's mind and how it can be materialised in the lower echelons and many more. Although I would like to learn more about the myriad details of army logistics, I understand that Pagonis' target was not to drawn his readers into the sea of information he handled but to outline the principles of his command and management style. I would recommend reading Douglas Menarchik's excellent \\"Powerlift\\" as a more data heavy companion to Pagonis' book."},{"Title":"Moving Mountains: Lessons in Leadership and Logistics from the Gulf War","review":"An excellent anecdotal book on logistics by the retired general who deployed the massive resources for American military participation in the Persian Gulf."},{"Title":"Moving Mountains: Lessons in Leadership and Logistics from the Gulf War","review":"Wonderful took down the course of logistics in the Gulf War. Writer's military career was offered special administration skills that to be worth to consultation by business manager and all military officers."},{"Title":"Moving Mountains: Lessons in Leadership and Logistics from the Gulf War","review":"As a logistician, I bought this book in the expectation that it would enhance my professional knowledge. It didn't, and it didn't stay on my bookshelf, either.Written for the general reader in the profession of management, this book will enlighten no one in the profession of arms. The treatment of military logistics is all too shallow (and the treatment of the author all too deep).Gus Pagonis did a magnificent job in the Gulf under incredibly difficult conditions. I had hoped that this work would tell us in some detail how he did it. But no. I suspect his editors at the Harvard University Press had a lot to do with that. It's too bad the publisher wasn't Presidio Press or some other house that understands military affairs."},{"Title":"Moving Mountains: Lessons in Leadership and Logistics from the Gulf War","review":"From a military history point of view, logisticians get far too little credit for allowing the front line to even exist. Lt. Gen. Pagonis' book does attempt to offer some insight into the challenges of supplying the Army's needs as it built up during Operation Desert Storm in 1990-91, and then through Desert Storm. Very little is said about the withdrawal process of Desert Farewell.The problems with this book are that it is too much centered around a business school philosophy book- not to take too much away from the success that Pagonis had, but it seems less about the challenges of supply in a hostile environment than a depiction of how to solve problems. I greatly respect the efforts and solutions that Pagonis encountered and defeated, but wish this was more a military-oriented book and less of a business school effort.Regardless of these issues, Moving Mountains will give a reader some appreciation for all of the tasks and unsung duties by the rear echelon forces in combat, and how the Army has developed its ability to deal with any potential environments it may find itself in the future."},{"Title":"Moving Mountains: Lessons in Leadership and Logistics from the Gulf War","review":"The best book to date on military logistics.Explains in detail how the U.S. Army was able to accomplish it's mission in supplying over half a million troops when and where it was needed.Gen.Pagonis has written an excellent guide for officers and NCO's involved in logistics."},{"Title":"Moving Mountains: Lessons in Leadership and Logistics from the Gulf War","review":"While the victory in the gulf war of 1991 was obviously an accomplishment, it was perhaps most of all an achievement of logistics. Moving Mountains tells the story of that achievement and of the General who lead it.The book included a number of biographical references about General Pagonis. Fortunately these are kept brief. Pagonis's life, outside of the military seems to be largely unremarkable. In the military Pagonis reached a high rank. The text provides no clues as to what made him a success as an officer.Once the text turns to the gulf war it becomes much more absorbing. The descriptions of the early stages of the build up are interesting. So are some of the descriptions of the interactions with a few of his subordinates.The last chapter is a summary, or list of prescriptions of how to manage. These range from being specific to the military to being so general as to be trite and meaningless. There is nothing in between.In the end this book was fairly boring. It might be of interest to students of the gulf war, or to those in the military who might face similar situations."},{"Title":"Moving Mountains: Lessons in Leadership and Logistics from the Gulf War","review":"Anyone interested in buying this book must understand two things up front:1. This book is written by a professional soldier and not a business school professor.2. This book is one man's account of his duties and opinions on the subject of logistics and is not intended to be a textbook on the subject of logistics or a war novel.If you understand these two things before you by the book then you will find this book to be very interesting as it is one of the few books written on military logistics. Moreover, you will gain insight into as to how General Pagonis used his personal leadership style to manage the logistical challenges of the first Gulf War. For someone wanting to learn about the nuts and bolts of logistics this book isn't for you. However, for those of you who want to gain an understanding of how logistics can impact the success or failure of a war while picking up a few words of wisdom in leadership from one of the best in the business will enjoy this book. I have read this book twice and I enjoyed it each time. Although I couldn't use much of the material from the book in my MBA classes, I was able to apply some of the information from this book while I was earning a graduate certificate in Logistics and Supply Chain Management from Penn State."},{"Title":"Moving Mountains: Lessons in Leadership and Logistics from the Gulf War","review":"Very good book. Take my review as is or not. that is all I care to write. Why, Why, Why."},{"Title":"Moving Mountains: Lessons in Leadership and Logistics from the Gulf War","review":"I bought this book several years ago, as I was interested in reading from a general in logistics his memoirs on Dessert Storm.I did not approach this book seeking specific textbook information on:- Desert Storm- Military LogisticsFrom experience, the books that are written by those who participated in events we (ordinary people) may never get to see, always teaches us something we can never see in the texbooks. Therefore this book met ny expectations.I guess its easy to take for granted that if the US has the biggest army in the world, somehow all it operational inputs are a given for any state of action. This is true, but we must not overlook that this happens because of a non-glamorous activity that is called logistics. At the start of the book Gen. Pagonis gives us a very useful definition of logistics \\"Logistics is the careful integration of transportation, supply, warehousing, contracting and automation into a coherent functional area; in a way hat prevents suboptimization of any of these activities; and in a way that permits and enhances the accomplishments of a given goal, objective, or mission\\".It is interesting that through out the book we see specific cases of how each of the ideas in the above definition came to be. What really is a case of suboptimation was the Desert Storm war.. talk about an overkill.. americans won that war in 2 days yet they brought enough firepower to fight 10 WWIII!!!I am rereading the book and still find it illuminating. When I was in the corporate world, basically all major clots in the accomplishments of any objective can be attributed to lack of proper logistics, if you want sucess you have to think logistically (not logically) or be surrounded by someone like Gen. Pagonis who is!! BTW the story is fascinating since it debunks the myth that the real glory of war is in fancy strategy, in here strategy is a consequence of logistics.When I read this the 2nd invasion of Irak was years to come, I wonder what the logistic now is, certainly does not sem like the same overkill can be used."},{"Title":"Moving Mountains: Lessons in Leadership and Logistics from the Gulf War","review":"This truly is a fascinating account of just how the United States military was able to move 500,000 troops and all their equipment halfwar across the world, fight a war, and then bring it all home. The numbers and statistics of the effort are truly stunning.I am no logisticians and perhaps have missed some of the finer points of leadership as a logistician that this book apparently provides. Nevertheless, it can be an interesting for anyone who is interested in just how the US military works and what a complex organization it really is.Gen. Pagonis only has one flaw - his ego. He really does talk himself up in this book. If one should trust his account of his military career he singlehandedly saved an entire company from annihilation in Vietnam, preserved the M1 Abrams tank program from Congressional hostility, and then did the entire logistical planning and execution surrounding Desert Storm.But if one disregards Pagonis ego this is a great book."},{"Title":"Moving Mountains: Lessons in Leadership and Logistics from the Gulf War","review":"I read this book during the time I was doing my MBA. Many of the sources in the course of study having to do with production management referenced this text. Consequently I read it of my own volition. The techniques and tactics that Gus Pagonis detail are invaluable to anyone dealing with mentoring subordinates, coordinating multivariate product flows and needing to beat Murphy at his own game.I bought another copy for my nephew who (as of this writing) is now a first Lt in the US Army."},{"Title":"Moving Mountains: Lessons in Leadership and Logistics from the Gulf War","review":"First, let's clear something up. This is NOT a textbook on logistics, nor is it a history of the first Iraq war. Rather, it is a book about effective leadership. It is also about change management. If you want to improve your leadership skills, then I highly recommend this book. I first read it in 1995, as I write this review in 2010, the notes I took then still resonate.If you are faced with a monumental task with a short timeline, then this book should be relevant to you.For example, General Pagonis writes about the importance of building a vision, acting upon it, setting goals related to it, then getting your directs to set objectives that support those goals.He also discusses the importance of communication. Although the book was written long before the rise of social media, his points about communication are still valid.But then he goes further and covers points I don't often seen discussed in other books or media.All in all, a good investment, especially since it's available in paperback now."},{"Title":"Catalog","review":"Now here is something a bit different, a handsomely produced book with a small metal plate fixed to the front cover that displays the title, nice paper and printing inside.

Thirty one reviews are reprinted, ranging from the early 1930s to the mid-90s, divided into five categories of, \\"General Assessments,\\" \\"Nin's Shorter Fiction,\\" \\"Nin's Novels,\\" \\"Nin's Diary,\\" \\"Nin Herself.\\" They range in length from being a few paragraphs to several pages, extremely hostile (suggesting that Nin is sexist, self-indulgent, not quite literature, and an insult to feminists) to extremely supportive - such as Henry Miller's 1937 review originally published in The Criterion that predicts that Nin's diaries will, when published, take their place beside the great literary revelations of the century.I especially appreciate THE CRITICAL RESPONSE TO ANAIS NIN because it helps me understand the era in which Nin was working. I was 2-years-old when Anais Nin died. It would therefore be easy for me to remain ignorant of how revolutionary Anais Nin was. THE CRITICAL RESPONSE TO ANAIS NIN helped me see that the very fact that she was even writing was revolutionary! Can you believe the first review of a work by Anais Nin - a 1932 review of DH LAWRENCE: AN UNPROFESSIONAL STUDY - was titled, \\"Femininity of DH Lawrence Emphasized by Woman Writer\\"? How odd to hear her referred to as a \\"woman writer.\\" To me, she's just a writer. It adds a dimension of respect for her art to realize that just by creating her art she was taking a risk, challenging the world.This book is best suited for the Anais Nin scholar. If you are a casual reader of the diaries or the erotica then this book will likely be a bit much. If you are interested not only in Anais Nin's work but also the phenomenon of her career and the varied reactions it elicited, then this book will be an amazing addition to your library.

Edison: Research to Development at Menlo Park, January 1879-March 1881 (Volume 5)","review":"The fifth volume of The Papers of Thomas A. Edison covers Edison's invention and development of the first commercial incandescent electric light and power system. In the process he turned his famed Menlo Park laboratory into the first true research and development facility. This also enabled him to develop a new telephone for the British market in the midst of his herculean efforts on electric lighting.In the face of daunting technical challenges and skepticism from leading scientists and engineers, Edison and his team of experimenters and machinists found the solution to the decades-old problem of creating a practical incandescent lamp. By focusing on the characteristics of the entire system Edison reconceptualized the requirements of a successful lamp design. While rivals worked primarily on lamps, Edison developed other parts of a complete system as well. This approach was most notable in his revolutionary work on generator technology, one of the highlights of this volume. Successful exhibitions of the system in December 1879 drew crowds to Menlo Park to witness the softly glowing lamps. These spectacles gratified his financial backers but Edison realized the importance of following experimental demonstrations with the hard work of commercial development. He needed to make each component work effectively in daily use and to improve the designs so that they were easy to use and inexpensive to manufacture. To create a daytime market for electricity he also developed electric motors for a variety of uses, including electric railways, for which he built a small demonstration line at Menlo Park. To accomplish all this Edison greatly enlarged his staff to as many as sixtyexperimenters, machinists, carpenters, and office workers. He began manufacturing lamps at a factory in Menlo Park. At the end of 1880, Edison was ready to move his system into commercial production and made plans to produce other components in New York. He also invited New York officials to a demonstration in order to win their approval for running underground lines in lower Manhattan where he planned to put his first commercial central station. In March 1881, he moved to the Edison Electric Light Company's headquarters on Fifth Avenue and began the hard work of introducing the new electric light and power technology."},{"Title":"The Papers of Thomas A. Edison: Research to Development at Menlo Park, January 1879-March 1881 (Volume 5)","review":"Hi I read a book about Thomas Elva Edison. He was an inventor he invented the telephone, electricity, the light bulb, and the movie projector. When he was 16 he wanted to be an inventor. When he finished collage that's when he started to think of new inventions. His first invention was the telephone well he didn't invent it he helped Alexander Grand Bell finish it off. When he was 20 years old he invented the movie projector that was his biggest hit of all. Then he invented electricity and that led to the light bulb. By his inventions he's the biggest hit ever in history. All the people moved to the cities because of his new inventions. I sort of liked this book but it had a lot of facts I mean really my head was spinning. If they didn't have to many facts I would of probably loved it."},{"Title":"Cider With Rosie - Third Impression","review":"If you're looking for a rip roaring story this is not for you.

And, complying with the below reviews, I have to say that Stroud has become a concrete river, choked with litter, sidelined with Burger Stars, neon lights; a MacDonalds is in the blue print stages. Hills are lined with new developments. It's like, and I quote my mother, &quot;A disease is spreading.&quot;Yet there are places untouched by Americanisms, consumerism, electricity (and here I apologise, as this becomes less of a review, more an account of personal experience). But there are still rivers afloat with leaves, valleys deep that welcome sunsets. They frost the sky in winter, burn it by summer.&quot;There's beauty in decay,&quot; as someone said. Haven't got a clue who. But there you go. Although dying of shallow needs and commercial interests, snippets of the old way can be found. And in all their glory, too."},{"Title":"Cider With Rosie - Third Impression","review":"I refer to the audio edition. This is a great book, but unfortunately the author is not a good reader.

How wise we become with age. This is an astonishing book. Lee is such a master of description that, after only a few pages, you slowly start to smell the fresh country air and hear the languid sounds of summer as you are inescabably drawn into the world of his childhood - a world that you realize has already faded into the mists of history. But this special time has not been lost - it has been captured forever in this irreplacable series of pictures. The people in these stories become more real than seems possible with only pen and ink: his characterizations are as clever as anything by Dickens or Dostoevski, and he catches the very essence of the sights, sounds and people around him with a charm unmatched by any other English writer. But this is not a story-book universe: the people in his young life have all the frailty, vanity, delight and tragedy that you would expect in any small community - but what other has been crystallized with such talent and wisdom. A wonderful work of art."},{"Title":"Cider With Rosie - Third Impression","review":"I was introduced to this book in a recent class taught by literati Doug Marx in Portland, Oregon. The book was the summit of 10 weeks' studying how to read good works to learn to write masterfully. Cider with Rosie was introduced as the penultimate example of the fusing of poetry, prose, nonfiction, and personal essay. Laurie Lee tells the tale of growing up in the last of the feudal villages in the post WWI Cotswolds. He paints with luxuriant language his single mother of seven, scatterbrained and cloudminded, his older doting sisters, a dottering squire, feuding spinster neighbors, seasons of pure hot and pure cold, whole village excursions by omnibus...all simple and quaint, but heartbreaking in their recent passing into history. Sensuous, breathtaking, heartstopping in its ability to pluck that which is familiar and delicious in the human experience. The poetry is Dylan Thomas made understandable. Recommend this book above almost any other."},{"Title":"Cider With Rosie - Third Impression","review":"Rooted in the earth and shining with long gone summers and freezing winters this is a beautiful and poignant flower of a book. Written in a sensuous and lyrical poetic prose it tells the story of the authors's boyhood in the Cotswolds of the West of England. Spinning round the great orb of his clutter-minded and loving mother are his sisters and wider village life. There is Illness, murder, private sorrow, boiling summer and frozen winter and finally the running down of the feudal clock as long awaited change comes to the valley. A book, more even - a place to be visited again and again..."},{"Title":"Cider With Rosie - Third Impression","review":"There should be more than five stars for books like this one. All the reviewers who wrote about how poetic yet concrete, magical yet real this account of boyhood in the Cotswolds have said it much better than I can. It is pure magic.

He paints his home and land such that one can recall the visit to the Cotswolds region although the trip has occurred only in the pages of Lee's little book. I am not a traveler of the region, my limited visit to England centering on London and the immediate vicinity. However, I feel I know the place, and the author describes people and events in quaint, coarse, refined, exagerrated, and convincingly worldly anecdotes. A resident of the Cotswolds has told me that Cider With Rosie not only brought his homeland to worldwide attention, but describes it in a way that no other author has matched. I can only say it is a rich and wonderful collection of life."},{"Title":"Cider With Rosie - Third Impression","review":"Cider with Rosie steps out of late 19th century Enlgand like a week in a secluded place with no phones, and no timetables. There is a sense that time rolled on more slowly than it does in our agenda filled world of today, a sense that family and community is much more important then deadlines. There is another wonderful book that makes an excellent companion to Cider with Rosie. -- Lark Rise to Candleford by Flora Thompson -- set in England at the turn of the twentieth century . The village in Cider with Rosie reminds me very much of the little village of Candleford in the Flora Thompson book. People were so very poor but they had something we often miss in our modern world , contentment with what they had.They turned their attention to loving and caring for family and neighbors. It is a quieter time that does not exist anymore, a welcome breath of fresh air in the whirlwind life most of us live today. In addition to the Cider with Rosie and Lark Rise to Candleford books, the BBC made a fabulous TV series (available on DVD) called Lark rise to Candleford. I have been dying to purchase the whole series.....hopefully someday soon. This Illustrated Cider with Rosie and The Illustrated Larkrise to Candleford books are the best versions of the printed books to purchase,because of the beautiful illustrations within the pages of both books and lovely vignettes on the pretty and durable hard covers. If you love to escape and dream in a quieter time and place these two books will certainly be a wonderful journey, all you need to add -- a cozy place to sit, your favorite cup of coffee or tea and time alone, you will be transported and lose yourself in a peaceful quiet place even if it is for just an afternoon, you will be refreshed."},{"Title":"Cider With Rosie - Third Impression","review":"So pleased to find this old favourite again.This is possibly the best autobiography I have ever read and the illustrated version is beautiful"},{"Title":"Cider With Rosie - Third Impression","review":"I had no idea of what to expect from this book except that it was a classic and therefore worth reading. It was one of those books that end too soon and I was sorry when I reached the end. The book comprised the memories of a young boy growing up in Somerset in the early 20th century. The story telling was so brilliant that I could almost smell those country smells and feel myself living in that old cottage. It opened a door into a way of life that ebbed away in the wake of the motor car,electricity and telephone. Village life with all its pluses and minuses came alive and bore little resemblance to town life today. Laurie, the lad and the author, lived in a world restricted to the distance a horse could walk in a day. I would thoroughly recommend this book for both its content and its authorship."},{"Title":"THE SHAKING OF THE FOUNDATIONS.","review":"I picked up this book by the great Twentieth-Century philosophical theologian Paul Tillich and was pleasantly suprised. Being familiar with Tillich's rather dry systematic theology, I was expecting more of the same. However, I was greeted by an immensely readable collection of sermons which I found both inspirational, thought-provoking and masterful. If Tillich's dogmatic theology is now regarded as out-moded, this sample of his devotional literature marks him out as insightful and relevant: he speaks as much to our generation as to the one he was speaking to.While the opening sermon 'The Shaking of the Foundations' is a little anachronistic in that it is couched in the terms of a by-gone debate (critiqueing mid-Twentieth-Century liberal theology)its message is an enduring one: that humanity must recognise its dependence on God and trust in him rather than in humanity's own inadequate ability. What follows this sermon is pure delight. The remainder of the collection testifies to Tillich's honesty and profound insight into the human heart and the tensions of human existence. 'You are accepted' is probably the best of the rest, expounding on the frustrations of life, and being unable to live up to your own expectations, let alone God's. Furthermore, it sounds a confident note of grace. It certainly stirred up a few emotions in me, I can tell you.On the negative side, those of a more conservative Christian persuasion may be troubled by the implications of Tillich's Christology. The question I was left asking, however, concerned Tillich's eschatology (the 'last things'). It seemed to me that Tillich either didn't believe in an ultimate overcoming of evil, or he simply wanted to emphasise the present reality of God's victory over it. I suspect there is some truth in both alternatives: Tillich was a complicated man, with an ambiguous relationship to the Christian faith, almost, it seems, of a love-hate quality.Nevertheless, don't let this, or anything else you might hear of Tillich, deter you from reading The Shaking of the Foundations. It truly deserves to be regarded as a modern classic of devotional literature."},{"Title":"THE SHAKING OF THE FOUNDATIONS.","review":"Tillich is by no means the most accessible of contemporary theologians. However, this collection of his sermons speaks immediately to everyman. He speaks perceptively of the dilemmas and anxieties of human existence, pointing emphatically to God as the source of salvation from human frustration and guilt. He delivers poignant critiques of modernistic attitudes, distancing himself firmly from the old liberal school of the 19th century and destroying the enlightenment illusion of progress, directing our hopes to God instead.I must confess that it was against my better judgment that I allowed this little collection of sermons to affect me: I am an evangelical, whereas Tillich belongs to a decidedly more liberal stream of theology to say the least! This is not to say he does not speak like an evangelical, just that I couldn't escape the feeling of intellectual dishonesty as I enjoyed Tillich's writings with the nagging suspicion that he didn't mean anything like the same thing by his use of particular theological terms as I mean. A read of Tillich's far less digestable Systematic Theology will enlighten you as to his philosophy of symbolism in religious language. He clearly maintains that the Christian faith alone can exclusively lay claim to truth; yet the language of Christian doctrine, whilst irreplaceable, is only symbolic, participating in what it represents yet, nevertheless, incapable of objectively describing what it represents. The evangelical might well benefit from reading 'Shaking of the Foundations' if he can overlook this tension; the non-conservative will not need to.Tillich was a bundle of contradictions, in a sense. He argues passionately for the truth of the Christian gospel, yet he was hardly ever known to go to church, except to preach, perhaps. He is also reputed to have had a string of affairs. I suppose the greatest comfort one can draw from that is that Tillich certainly knew what he was talking about when, along with St. Paul, he affirmed the pervading despair and tension that characterizes human existence.The most impressing sermons contained in the book are: 'Shaking of the Foundations' in which the preacher lambasts the naive optimism of the enlightenment and prophetically challenges modernism with the warning of a 'shaking of the foundations' which will expose the bankruptcy of confidence in modern progress, leaving the (E)ternal standing; 'The Witness of the Spirit to the Spirit' on the subject of the Christian's assurance; and 'You Are Accepted', a life-giving exposition of Paul's thought on sin and grace in Romans 5:20: here also is Tillich at his most perceptive and penetrating."},{"Title":"THE SHAKING OF THE FOUNDATIONS.","review":"This is a masterpiece.The writings of Paul Tillich contain truths that touch us at the deepest level. Tillich was no perfect saint in his lifetime - far from it - but he had a quiet wisdom to discern the deepest truths of our human condition.This quote has stuck with me for more than 40 years....\\"Sometimes at that moment [of despair] a wave of light breaks into our darkness, and it is as though a voice were saying: 'You are accepted. You are accepted, accepted by that which is greater than you...\\"This is how faith really is: not something taught but something discerned when you least expect it, in the still quiet moments of our lives, in those moments when we feel most troubled and alone. Then, the light breaks through for what may only be a few moments and we realise that there is a love beyond our comprehension holding and caring for us if we only open our hearts to it.Tillich deserves to be read."},{"Title":"THE SHAKING OF THE FOUNDATIONS.","review":"Paul Tillich's The Shaking of the Foundations was a perception-changing book when I first read it as a 19-year-old. Tillich's God as the Ground of All Being is both obvious and shaking, since many of us have some sort of projection that we see as \\"God.\\" When we, like Job, are still and listen to the Voice in the Whirlwind, and when we listen to the Logos in the Gospel of John, we realize that the creative life force that informs the universe and all that it includes is greater than human logic can encompass."},{"Title":"THE SHAKING OF THE FOUNDATIONS.","review":"This book is the companion piece to The Eternal Now and The New Being. This is the most profound and important book of the three. Very readable (in contrast to acedemic theology) because these sermons were delivered live. Definitely Spirit-guided ministry. This work is very important in helping us to understand the difference between small spirit and large Spirit. Also very important for those interested in Christology, soteriology, and ontology, and the ways in which God, Christ, and the Spirit pave the way for self-conscious being. Also quite useful for those interested in a Christian concept of pantheism > mysticism and harmony."},{"Title":"THE SHAKING OF THE FOUNDATIONS.","review":"Paul Tillich (1886-1965) was a German-American theologian and Christian existentialist philosopher. He published three volumes of his sermons (many given at chapel at Union Theological Seminary), of which this is the first, to be folllowed byThe New BeingandEternal Now (scm classics).He states in the Preface, \\"Many of my students and friends outside the Seminary have told me of the difficulty they have met in trying to penetrate my theological thought. They believe that through my sermons the practical or, more exactly, the existential implications of my theology are more clearly manifest.\\" He added \\"A large part of the congregation at the Sunday services came from outside the Christian crcle in the most radical sense of the phrase. For them, a sermon in traditional Biblical terms would have had no meaning. Therefore, I was obliged to seek a language which expresses in other terms the human experience to which the Biblical and ecclesiastical terminology point.\\"Here are some representative excerpts:\\"The name of this inexhaustible depth and ground of all being is God... For if you know that God means depth, you know much about Him. You cannot then call yourself an atheist or unbeliever. For you cannot think or say: Life has no depth!... If you could say this in complete seriousness, you would be an atheist; but otherwise you are not. He who knows about depth knows about God.\\"\\"Jesus does not tell us that He will ease the labors and burdens of life and work... Jesus does not and cannot promise more pleasure and less pain to those whom He asks to come to Him. On the contrary, sometimes He promises them more pain, more persecution, more threat of death---the 'cross,' as He calls it.\\"\\"Man's knowledge that he has to die is also man's knowledge that he is above death. It is man's destiny to be mortal and immortal at the same time.\\"The psychologist Rollo May wrote a sympathetic biography of him (Paulus), and Tillich's wife Hannah wrote a less-friendly account (From Time to Time).

One chapter deals with the experiences of Tolstoy in this war.Barbary treats the Charge of the Light Brigade in a different light than some other authors. The General commanding the charge is praised as brave, while the fault is all laid at the feet of the Commander in Chief. In the references, the author lists The Reasons Why book as an authority, but Barbary lays the blame on the Commander in Chief for this self destructive action.I list this as an average read of the Crimean War.

It seems too esoteric for someone with merely a casual interest in robots, yet far too superficial for the serious robot enthusiast. I cannot imagine there being very many people in the intermediary group, so I suppose the book will have a fairly limited audience.Yet DK must be given credit for publishing it in the first place. It is not often one sees books delving into this particular subject matter.How well does it do it, then?The book is divided into a number of chapters dealing with a variety of robot types - toys, artistic representations, movie/TV robots, robot pets, robot kits, etc. The category boundaries, as well as the selection in each, seem at times somewhat haphazard.In each category is represented a number of \\"main\\" entries, giving a fairly comprehensive amount of information on each entry, and \\"gallery\\" entries, merely showing what else is out there in that particular category.Any assessment of the content must reasonably take into account two factors: First, how comprehensive and/or representative the selection of entries is, and second, how relevant and/or accurate the information given in the entries is.For the first part, the book does cover most of the basics, although there are a number of glaring omissions. I would have to say that the selection is fairly comprehensive, but fails on the representativeness criterion.As for the second part, I must say I am fairly disappointed. Most entries have some minor factual error, and some have grave, major errors. As for the relevance of the technical information presented, it is for the most part too limited to be truly useful.In the end, the book still gets four stars from me, partly because of the beautiful, picture-laden physical presentation, and partly because it represents a stellar starting effort. Whereas the information contained within the binders has serious gaps, omissions, misrepresentations, and outright errors, it is still a handy - as well as beautiful - compilation of robots in popular culture. But that is where I see its main value: as a compilation for those who already know enough of the subject not to depend on the information given for its veracity. As a source of information, it is seriously flawed.If Robert Malone gets around to writing a second, revised edition ... the work might live up to its potential."},{"Title":"Ultimate Robot","review":"Whether you are interested in Androids or robot pets, this book celebrates robots in all their forms.

At just under 200 pages it surveys nearly every avenue of things robotic. As such, it's a great overview, interest jogger or introduction to the subject whether your interest lies in toy collecting, robot building or sci-fi films. The flip side is that such a brief treatment can't hope to be exhaustive. My four stars is not due to any lack in the book, but merely because this book is easily used up. But not before it's achieved its purpose in directing the interested reader toward further study and reading.My take on this book is that it's overwhelming and covers so much ground as to be a jack of all trades and expert in none. Again, that's not a bad thing for an introductory book. The reading level is also curious. It's in the \\"adult\\" DK series but the writing is easily graspable by a smart teen. What it all comes down to is that robots are their own thing; like them or you don't. If you do, this is very much your book.This book does what other robot books fail to do in presenting humanoid robots and their toy-like offshoots. Since it's British, it covers The Hitchhiker's Guide (the original BBC mini-series, not the Disney movie), Dr. Who's K-9 and the Daleks and UK shows like \\"Little Robots\\" which will hopefully make it stateside soon. Malone sweeps briefly over robot toys but those covered get full page or even two page color spreads. He gives a brief, thoughtful summary of robotic history and touches on their aesthetic and imaginative appeal. Since the book is from 2004, it covers the first Robosapien and not the new model, but that's more than made up for by the bits on Japan's lesser-known PaPeRo and Sony's QRIO along with the AIBO robot dog. Casting such a wide net, this book cannot hope to be exhaustive of any one area, but it's lavish presentation will enchant any robot afficianado."},{"Title":"Ultimate Robot","review":"This is a great book.

We have not found another book with as many pictures, or so much information about robots. As a caution, the book deals mostly, though not exclusively, with toys.

The writing is good Cornwell mix of adventure, background and thrills. Horrible Obadiah Hakewell appears in his usual role of villanous sargeant at a time when Sharpe was vulnerable to his particular brand of sadism. A few minor inconsistencies with the earlier books of the series (written before the TV series and Sean Bean somewhat rewrote the texts).

The normally excellent Bernard Cornwell has written a story that, whilst undeniably of the same stable as the other Sharpe novels, differs sufficiently from his normal route as to lessen the impact the story would and should have had.Instead of our intrepid hero going off on his own to be the saviour of the day and the scurge of all evil, Sharpe spends most of his time as right hand man to the then Sir Arthur Wellesley, later the Duke of Wellington.This book is largely speaking a filler between the excellent Sharpe's Tiger and the hopefully excellent Sharpe's Fortress and provides a weak second installment of the India years trilogy. Sharpe should have been in the middle of the battle of Assaye that this book depicts, and not way behind the lines watching with the commander of the British forces, making sure that his superior always has a horse.Coupled with this, the awful Obadiah Hakeswill makes an unnecessary appearance as he tries to frame Sharpe for assaulting a British officer and the bad guy is overplayed with repeated use of the word \\"Monsewer\\" when describing his French second-in-command. In fact, the main redeeming factor in this book is the interest that Cornwell raises in his ever-present Historical Note at the end which mentions the true story of this book's arch villain, Lieutenant William Dodd. It is always these historical notes that provide Cornwell books with that little extra spice, of knowing exactly what did and did not happen, and bringing closer the reader to the action.It is, however, with heavy heart that I have to say this particular Sharpe is unusual in its mediocrity. A tale that may have merited being told, but perhaps not one that required an entire book; at least, not one told in this way."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"I have read all the Sharpe books and this one will not dissapoint, a historical masterpiece, fictional historic, or is it?"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"The second Cornwell novel I have read, and I thought it was spectacular!

It is fun, entertaining and very readable. Cornwell's research is as excellent as usual. He takes some licenses for the shake of the story and continuity, but this is OK. Some people are outraged by the portrait of some of the real historical characters, but historical characters are rarely depicted accurately in historical fiction, so I think this can be forgiven. Besides, usually a more serious account of these characters is given at the end of the book on the Historical Note.Many people insist in compare this series with Patrick O'Brian's Master and Commander. I don't think this is fair for any of the series, they are different entities. What they have in common is that once you start you may get hooked and devour one book after another...And in the literary world today that is a rare and marvelous thing."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"Now a Sergeant, Richard Sharpe finds himself feeling something like ambition to rise in the British Army. Despite his excellent fighting abilities, Sharpe is destined to languish in the British ranks. Despite this, he is happy, his job is easy and his hidden fortune makes him able to live better than some officers. However, it is almost impossible for a British soldier to become an officer unless he performes an act of suicidal bravery in front of an influential officer. As an aide to a member of the East India Company military, Sharpe seems unlikely to ever have his chance. But fate intervenes and just as the battle of Assaye begins Sergeant Sharpe finds himself as an aide to Arthur Wellesley, commander of the British forces at Assaye. When Wellesley is unhorsed and surrounded it is up to Sharpe to save him and claim his destiny. Cornwell continues to explore the background of his classic character. Readers of the initial Sharpe series have heard about Assaye, but here it finally is in all its bloody glory. Corwell is among the most realistic of combat novelists and his battle descriptions are as good as any history book. Well done Mr. Cornwell."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"This was my first Sharpe's book, but it sure won't be my last. On the strength of Sharpe's Triumph, I will read all the Sharpe's books in chronological order. I have already begun Sharpe's Tiger, and it is a captivating as Triumph.Like all the Sharpe books, this one follows the adventures of infantryman, Richard Sharpe, a lowly born Englishman serving and making his way in Her Majesty's Army around the turn of the 19th Century. This puts him in the midst of the great Napoleonic Era of war making. A fascinating time for Military buffs. This particular novel is set in India and revolves around the battle of Assaye.The strengths of this books are these:First, this is an excellent historical novel. The firearms used, the methods of combat, the Indian political settings, and the settings are very accurate and transporting. But please don't get the idea the book is a dry history lesson. Cornwall wraps the history within a great, old fashioned tale of revenge and blood.Secondly, the characters in this book, both real and imagined, are carefully drawn and utterly convincing. My favorite was the author's portrayal of General Arthur Wellesley (before he became the Duke of Wellington). The reader really gets a good sense of what made Wellesley such a great commander of men. The great General and future Duke is completely brought to life.Finally, the battle writing is superb. Cornwall supplies you with a map of the battleground, and his writing is so clear and concise that you can actually see in your mind's eye the movement of men and the progress of the battle. It all makes sense! Battle during this time period was especially horrific with cannons pounding into the infantry to soften them up and cavalry sweeping down on rows of men the heavy blades. Cornwall has a knack for making the reader smell the spent black powder and feel the splashing of warm blood.The fascinating aspect of this series is that Richard Sharpe is a war crazed soldier, seeking battle with joy in his heart. He really loves to fight and make war with no apologies and no analysis. This is the characteristic that makes the character so refreshing and exciting."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"I read this book out of sequence, after starting my 'Sharpe Experience' with 'Sharpe's Rifles.'I think I might have enjoyed it more if I'd read the chronologically earlier book in the series, 'Sharpe's Tiger'. I found myself trying to adjust to Sharpe with a lower rank and in a different setting. I was so used to Sharpe the officer gaining the confidence of his men, that 'sergeant Sharpe' seemed a very differeent character to me.In fact, I think 'Sharpe's Triumph' is hurt by its title character playing more of a supporting role. Sharpe is almost overshadowed by his superiors, and even by the story's villain!Also, the inclusion of a real renegade officer as the 'bad guy' makes for something of anticlimactic ending...though it at least offers a satisfying conclusion to one of the book's subplots, and a hint of the respect Sharpe will gain in the future.I would caution new readers not to start with this volume. Those who are interested in the 'India trilogy' should read them in the correct order. Personally, I'll go back to the 'Napoleonic War' stories."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"Considering events after September 11, 2001, it is perhaps appropriate to read the novel. The setting is in India in 1803 and it covers a relatively short time period ending with the Battle of Assaye on September 23, 1803. The Muslim armies from the northwest, reinforced by Arab mercenaries, have swept onto the plains of India with the intention of conquering the country. The Muslims have hired European mercenaries including British renegades. The are opposed by the British Army and the East India Company sepoys under the combined command of Major General Wellesley.The novel has considerable action including Muslim fanatics and British soldiers trained to march into enemy fire. This was a time period when little quarter was given and wounded enemy were commonly bayoneted. Victorious armies commonly plundered captured cities, robbed the enemy dead, and raped any women they found - the few perqs of a common soldier. The population suffers as armies concerned with loot, personal advancement, feeding themselves, and more loot, roam the countryside like plagues of locusts.Copyrighted in 1998, chronologically this novel is book 2 of the Richard Sharpe series. Cornwell, like Forester, reached the end of the Napoleonic wars, then stepped back in time to cover the early career of his main character. The novel starts with Richard Sharpe as a sergeant, being thrust back into action after spending the four years following the end of the previous novel (\\"Sharpe's Tiger\\") in a relatively quiet assignment. Colonel McCandless, his acquaintance from previous action, drafts Sharpe's services for a special assignment. Events lead Sharpe into making decisions about his future. He must contend again with Sergeant Hakeswill, and a new woman enters Sharpe's life. This is the novel where Sharpe steps up from the ranks."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"I would recommend this book and this series thus far.

Richard Sharpe, a Sergeant in the King's Army for four years, is sent on a dangerous mission to capture a former East India Company Lieutenant who is now a Major in the forces of an Indian prince. Sharpe, resolute as always, determines to find the traitor and bring him to justice in the hopes that this success will reward him with an officer's commission. But hot on his tail is Sharpe's old enemy Obidiah Hakeswill, a man so vile that he will stop at nothing to get his revenge. While it was fun to see characters like Hakeswill and Colonel McCandless again, the story boggs down at times. Missing is the humor that Sharpe's future Sergeant Harper brought to the series and the tense drama of fighting the armies of Napoleon. The view Cornwell gives us of the battle of Assaye, however, is stunning. Only Cornwell could make batttlefield action come alive in such a brilliant and unmistakable way. Fans of the series should check this one out but if you're new to the world of Richard Sharpe may I recommend starting with either 'Sharpe's Tiger,' or 'Sharpe's Rifles.'"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"Most of the Sharpe books I had read over a very short interval and the Cornwell formula started to get too dreary and predictable.

Just great!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"Up front, I'll tell everyone that I haven't had the pleasure of reading this book yet. However, I've read 12 of the Sharpe's books, and have 2 yet more to read and am looking forward to them with relish.Aside from the great stories, Cornwell deserves praise on two counts.First, the Historical Notes at the end of each book. Cornwell makes sure to point out what little bits of history he had to change to tell Sharpe's story. I admire his honesty.Second, I don't know how Cornwell did it, but he had Sharpe's entire backstory written before he wrote the first book. I love that now he's going back and writing the story of each of these little tidbits that are distributed so well through the entire series.The second greatest joy with these books is getting someone else to read them, and talking to them after each book. I've had the pleasure of addicting my father on these books. Now I have to get them back from him.If you haven't read these books, grab a copy of Sharpe's Tiger and start in!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"I recommend this to all shapre fans. However, I would not recommend it to people who are virgins to the Sharpe series. I would tell them to start out with Sharpe's Rifles. For non-virgins, I would say the best part of the book was learning how Sharpe made the jump from the ranks to the officer's mess. Other than that, I found the book not as good as other Sharpe books."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"This book is the follow up to Sharpe's Tiger; it's the second book of the series (in chronological order). Like the book before its building on the Sharpe character by showing how he became to be an officer. We also see the younger version of Sharpe, the Sharpe who has not yet commanded troops, the Sharpe who has only ever received orders opposed to giving them. It's different to the future books in that respect and if your a fan of the Sharpe series you see it gives Sharpe's Character alot more Depth. On top of that we get a great action book and an in-depth history lesson.The date is 1803, Muslim armies supported by Arab and European mercenaries are planning an invasion of India. McCandless drafts Sharpe from his quiet post, where he has spent the last 4 years, to hunt down a renegade English soldier. During his time behind enemy lines Sharpe is faced with great temptations and its down to him to decide his allegiance. To the British army, or to the Mahratta army. His choice is an obvious one and as the story progresses, by doing what he does best, being a soldier, Sharpe finds himself in a situation where the outcome will change his life forever.It's a great story and a great lesson in history. A tiny British army is faced by a huge Mahratta army, the British are vastly outnumbered and outgunned but with true British determination they go forward and fight. The rest is history, enjoy the book, I did.4 Stars"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"Sharpe's Triumph describes the seminal event that gave birth to what is the dominant theme of the 19-book Sharpe series. By rescuing his commanding officer and then being rewarded with a commission, our \\"son of a common whore\\" begins his rise into the officer ranks, where he has to deal with the disdain of the aristocrats and the distrust of the soldiers.Cornwell has created a deeply complex character in Sharpe. He's caught between the rock of his ambition to be more than a foot soldier and the hard place of an officer corps that is less than welcoming to someone from the gutter. Before Assaye, Sharpe was never totally happy, but after his triumph, readers will see surliness become his dominant mood. He's growing into the scarred, mean-tempered officer of the Peninsula campaign.A final note about Cornwell's description of the Battle of Assaye, which Wellington called his greatest victory. There's almost a surreal quality to it. Whereas Wellington was always outnumbered when fighting the French later, here there are suicidal odds against him, 20 to 1 by some reckonings. I kept expecting him to break off the engagement, but he never did until he'd won the field. It feels like three or four of your buddies and you are taking on the college football team. As a result, there's an intimate quality to the undertaking. With so few troops under his command, you understand how Wellington could control the battle as well as he did. And the fact that he would personally lead a charge against a battery makes sense. It's like seeing a great band at a small college hangout years before they are doing stadium tours.In some Sharpe stories, he's the center of the action; in others, he's just one exciting part of a larger story. Sharpe's Triumph belongs to the latter category. It's a tribute to Cornwell that he can write both types so well. This is the book where we see that Cornwell's inspiration for writing about the Napoleonic Wars was at least partially the fascinating figure of the Duke of Wellington."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"The adventure continues, along with some old characters, and some new.

That didn't keep me from beginning the series with this book, which is a rousing adventure story full of derring-do, knick-of-time escapes, and terrific battle scenes. Sgt. Richard Sharpe is a real \\"man's man\\" and comes across as being both noble, human, and rough around the edges at the same time. He's neither a saint, nor is he a sinner. Like most of us, he's a combination of both, but knows when it is time to do the right thing simply because that's what he must do...though he does struggle with his conscience now and then wondering if he really should stick his neck out. Fortunately, for all, especially Sir Arthur Wellesley, Sgt. Sharpe is close at hand when desperately needed and more than earns the promotion from ranker to gentleman (Though Sir Arthur, while grateful, does harbor upperclass beliefs about common men rising above their station). That said, I'm looking forward to reading all of the Sharpe books in chronological order.

After the introduction of Sharpe's early years fighting for King George in &quot;Tiger&quot;, we now are given the understanding of his ever burning passion for advancement - his field promotion by Wellesley from Sergeant to Ensign was presaged by an offer of a lieutenancy in the Mahratta army. Cornwell again gives a detailed and bloody account of this &quot;against the odds&quot; battle by Wellesley versus an army 20 times his size. It's a lovely story, and I can't wait until the next book (already available in the UK) is published here.I'm addicted to Sharpe."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"If you haven't yet read Sharpe's Tiger, I recommend that you begin your reading of this exciting series with that book. The characters and story in Sharpe's Triumph will make more sense that way.If you liked Sharpe's Tiger, you will probably enjoy Sharpe's Triumph even more. The story here is more historically accurate, the various battles are brilliantly described, and readers will find it easier to identify with Sharpe as the hero of the story.As the book opens, Sergeant Sharpe has been sent to pick up some ammunition . . . a seemingly dull assignment that soon becomes quite meaningful. There's a rogue lieutenant from the British East India Company who has a bounty on his head, and Sharpe is soon drawn into the search for Lieutenant Dodd and the sepoys he took with him.In the background, Sharpe has been enjoying a leisurely four years since he earned his sergeant's stripes in Sharpe's Tiger. The cushion that his wealth has brought is about to become a curse, however.In the search for Dodd, Sharpe is presented with the opportunity to better his station in life, meets a new love interest, and has some hard choices to make.The high point of the story comes in the detailed recounting of the Battle of Assaye which was important to defeating the Indian forces and helped establish the reputation of Sir Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington).Those who don't want to read about the bloody side of war would do well to avoid this book."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"This is a fine book about a forgotten but important battle in a long-gone empire. The battle of Assaye, won against far superior numbers of natives and European mercenaries by a great general who made his reputation there, quelled native revolt and let the British push north into previously unoccupied parts of India.Richard Sharpe is a sergeant here, longing for promotion to officer but with scant chance of it in the class-constrained British army. He is detached to hunt a deserter who has gone over to the other side, to become a coldblooded but effective officer. Sharpe is the sole survivor of a massacre by Major William Dodd's troops, and wants him taken down.Dodd serves Colonel Anthony Pohlmann, also a defector from the East India Company. Now army commander of the Mahratta Confederation, he has become in the process a fabulously rich, elephant-riding, harem-keeping nabob. Sharpe must weigh Pohlmann's atractive offer to change sides himself, and meanwhile dodge a trumped-up criminal charge levied by an enemy suspecting Sharpe's deepest secret.The period and place detail are excellent. The descriptions of India under the British Raj reminded me of Fraser's \\"Flashman in the Great Game\\", although the Flashman black comedies are quite different in tone.Bernard Cornwell writes Sharpe with some subtlety. His overall detail compares with Patrick O'Brian's, although not his tale's charm. Cornwell's battlefield descriptions of Assaye - not only of the battle itself but of its preliminary maneuvers - are exemplary. Readers of military fiction know how hard it can be for authors to describe multiple units maneuvering over complicated terrain, responding to each other simultaneously and in the smoke of chaos, and for readers to keep it all straight. Cornwell makes it all crystal clear despite the passage's length and the battle's complexity. And Cornwell plausibly fits the fictional Sharpe into a key moment of the historical general's career.I do have a few problems with Sharpe's character development. In opening chapters he is portrayed as scheming to embezzle part of an ammunition shipment. Petty graft like this may have been common among noncoms in India (and a lot of wars) but it's an odd way to depict someone intended to be developed as the hero of twenty or so historical novels. Perhaps Cornwell does it to dramatize the grim life and outlook of the enlisted ranks,and of someone from Sharpe's low birth, but it didn't work for me.A flaw, but not enough to compromise an otherwise excellent story."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"In this earlier installment of the Richard Sharpe series, we find Sgt. Sharpe performing his duties with the Royal Army in India. He is assigned to commissary duties and likes his CO and likes even more his newly received stripes. When he leads a group on a mission to pick up some ammunition recovered by the local garrison, though, things change. He is the sole survivor when a turncoat British officer conducts a massacre while attempting to retrieve the same ammunition. It is only dumb luck and a need to relieve himself that spares him.Since he is the only person who has actually seen the officer in question, he is assigned to help the intelligence officer tasked to bring him in. In doing so, the mercenary leader to whom the turncoat defected offers Sharpe a commission and gets him to thinking. He would like to be an officer. He is not, however, willing to betray the trust of those he likes. Still, the seed of the idea is planted.Those tasked with taking the defector are attached to Wellington's army. It is his first big campaign. Sharpe has come to Wellington's notice before but, in this installment, we finally get to read the story in which he saves Wellington's life during the climactic battle. The result is a commission for Sharpe and the expectation by everyone is that he will fail. You only have to read the original series to know how wrong that expectation is.This is neither Cornwell's best nor his worst. It does fill in a big piece of the Sharpe story and is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"After his Richard Sharpe series set in the Napoleonic Wars was an established success, Bernard Cornwall went back to write several prequels, including a trllogy set in 1803 India, of which this is the middle volume. This is the first Sharpe book I've read, although I have seen several of the BBC adaptations.This is a successful story, with adventures, interesting characters, and what definitely seems to be a thoroughly researched historical setting. A major character is the young Arthur Wellesley, eventually to be known to history as the Duke of Wellington. Several other characters are real historic figures, far less well-known.The villains in this book are not especially successful. Obadiah Hakeswill, in particular, is completely uninteresting, given little motivation and a series of repetitive conversational tics instead of a personality. He seems like a bad imitation of a Dickens villain.What is strong, along with the main character, is the adventure and the local color.The obvious comparison would be to the naval fiction of Patrick O'Brian. O'Brian has, on the whole, more interesting and fully realized characters. But Cornwall is definitely more successful in writing battles. Part of this is that Cornwall actually explains what is going on; he doesn't share O'Brian's infuriating habit of assuming that the reader shares his own encyclopedic knowledge of contemporary naval tactics, construction, and jargon, and therefore wil never need an explanation."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"Two weeks ago I bought this book on a whim. I'd never heard of the author or the series, but I was in the mood for some European historical fiction with a military theme. Little did I anticipate the addiction to which I would immediately succumb. At this point I've read four and I've ordered 5 more of the 13 remaining. I'm guessing I'll consume them all before September.The central character, Richard Sharpe, works his way through most of the major battles of the British military from India in 1803 to Waterloo, interacting with real figures of that time, the most notable of which is the Duke of Wellington. The series tracks Sharpe's struggle to overcome his humble beginnings and to discover in himself strengths and qualities he never realized existed. Each book traces Sharpe's extraordinary acts of bravery and leadership and chronicles his progress towards respect and self-actualization. And there's always a romance -- maybe even a wife eventually.The hero is significant and human. The villains are evil and powerful. The events are momentous. And there's a rags to riches thread that builds as each book sees Sharpe's reputation grow among those who would otherwise despise and demean him.There's truly never a dull moment.It's good reading, great fun and excellent escape."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"This is a sublime piece of historical fiction. We are taken back to the early days of Sharpe's adventursom career, when he was a lowly Sarjeant in the 33rd Foot (West Riddings) Aspiring to higher spheres of endeavor, Sharpe as usual must confront head-on the aristocratic and stilted system of promotion then existant in the British army. That system is personified in the character of Sir Arthur Wellsley. Cornwall's depiction of Sir Arthur, seems an astonishingly accurate one. Wellsley was cold, arrogant, and extremly compitent. The battle of Assaye (1803) which smashed the Mahratta confederation and paved the way for ultimate British conquest of India, was one of the Duke's most inspired and risky battles. He even rated it higher than Waterloo, and one is apt to almost agree with his opinion. As usual, Cornwall's depiction of napoleanic fighting is flawless. His description of Assaye is unsurpassed. Here sir Arthur confidantly lead his small army of 5,000 British and Seapoy troops against the Mahratta mass of over 40,000 and 100 guns. The advance of the 78th Highlanders, and their endurment of the horrific Mahratta bombardment must stand as one of the great epic infantry assults of the entire period. The two Scottish regiments in Sir Arthur's command, the 74th and 78th Highlanders, won the campaign for him, and Cornwall does not fail to do them justice in this long forgotton saga. Sir Arthur's victory at Assaye should dispel the notion that European armies defeated their colonial opponets by means soley of superior technology. Sheer determination, tactical brilliance, and iron discipline won the day for the British against an Indian opponet who was as well equipped as they, and far more numerous. Cornwall brilliantly depicts all these elements while giving us a colorful collection of characters, including a youthful Sharpe who must prove himself to become what he is later in the series."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"I have read all the Sharpe books and bought this particular chapter in England on a visit. At the time, the next in the series, Sharpe's Trafalgar was soon to come out, so I purchased it over amazon.co.uk and it too is wonderful. As a suggestion, if you are a fan of the Sharpe books, check out the Roger Brook series by Dennis Wheatley. These books are out of print and difficult to locate in the States, but they will fill the time in between the time while waiting for the next Sharpe novel.

This book, at last, tells the tale, and an exciting one it is! Cornwell is an excellent writer, with an eye for even the smallest detail. His description of the battle of Assaye is, in my mind, the finest portrayal of any Napoleonic-era fight that I have ever read.

The Sharpe series looks like a more \\"grown-up\\" Flashman. The books appear to be just as accurately researched and the writing is very good.This story starts with a massacre which Sharpe miraculously survives, goes on to the siege of the city of Ahmednuggur where Wellesley first demonstrates his military audacity, and ends in the hard-fought (and well-described) battle of Assaye. Throughout this overall arc there is an understory involving a hated pursuit of Sharpe by Sergeant Hawkswill (who first appeared in \\"Sharpe's Tiger\\") and Sharpe's own pursuit (aided by Colonel McCandless, whom Sharpe had befriended in the earlier novel) of the instigator of the massacre that opened up the tale.This is an exciting and engrossing read. The characters are perhaps a little cliche but keep the story flowing and the entertainment on the go. The battles are really very well described incorporating that \\"fog of war\\" one so often hears about. I finished this book wondering how men could endure such violent brutality - but evidently they did. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"I have read all of the Sharpe's novels and have seen the TV shows and movies.

Indeed, there is not much wrong with the ST except the onset of a formulaic pattern. Richard Sharpe is, apparently a killing machine--a 19th century James Bond, without polish and without maritinis (cheap arrack will suffice nicely).The officer rescued in installment #1, who helped our hero earn his sergeant stripes becomes mentor and father figure in #2 and enlists Sharpe to help him track down a rogue officer who has gone native, literally helping the Redcoats' enemies. Surprisingly Sharpe's nemesis in Tiger survives into Triumph--always remember to be sure the tigers are hungry before you throw your enemy to them, folks.What keeps this seeming as silly as its bare bones description is Cornwell's skill as a narrator and the still interesting exotic environs of India. This could however wear thin if each subsequent edition becomes just more of the same, with Sharpe moving relentlessly, ever-upward. One Fire and Ice fantasy is more than enough for my taste.

He's good at his job, but he has developed the ambition of becoming an officer, if only so he can go back home someday and swagger into his old haunts with a sash and sword. Meanwhile, though, he's sent off with Col. McCandless, General Wellesley's head of intelligence, to locate and drag back a traitorous lieutenant from the East India Company who has changed sides and is now fighting as a major with the army of an enemy rajah. Wellesley is seeking battle with yet another traitorous Company man who commands the rajah's huge army, and Sharpe, McCandless, and the general will all reconverge at the Battle of Assaye -- which, even after Waterloo, Wellesley (now Duke of Wellington) still considered his own greatest victory.

This is also the second of the novels to take place in India.The year is 1803 and Sergeant Richard Sharpe is an assistant in the armory at Seringapatam ; his malevolent mortal enemy Obadiah Hakeswill is plotting his revenge ; Arthur Wellesley's army is preparing to move against the armies of the Mahratta confederation. All of the elements are in place for a great tale from Bernard Cornwell , and the reader is not to be disappointed!The tale's start has Sergeant Sharpe lying wounded at a East India company outpost which has been treacherously attacked by a renegade officer , Lieutenant Dodd , leading a company of sepoy deserters. Sharpe manages to survive the massacre and reports the events to the kindly Scottish Colonel McCandless , the chief of Wellesley's intelligence service. McCandless , accompanied by Sharpe , sets after Dodd ,now a Major in Colonel Anthony Pohlmann's compoo ( an Indian version of a regiment) , a component of the Mahratta leader Scindia's army. Meanwhile Obadiah Hakeswill has schemed against Sharpe and has obtained an arrest warrant to aid in his plot to destroy and rob our hero of his riches obtained in &quot;Sharpe's Tiger&quot;.All of these elements come together at the obscure Indian village of Assaye--the scene of Arthur Wellesley's greatest military triumph. In the course of the battle , Sharpe is commissioned an Ensign by Wellesley , and the career of Richard Sharpe set in motion. This is one of the very best battles in all of the Sharpe novels I have read so far (I am up to eleven to date); probably the best of the three &quot;Indian Chronicles&quot; .Highly recommended , and very entertaining.

The map at the front of the edition I have showing the deployment and subsequent tactical redeployment of the opposing forces makes a nice accompaniament to Cornwell's depiction of how Wellington deployed his forces."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"Readers of Cornwell's Sharpe series have long been tantalized by references to infantry Sergeant Sharpe being raised (promoted) from the ranks of the enlisted men to the gentleman's officer corps by Lord Wellington in gratitude for having saved his life on the battlefield at Assaye in India, back in 1803. In this volume, we finally get the full story behind that seminal event in Sharpe's career, one that is mentioned in every volume in the series. At the time, a number of Indian princes (the Mahratta confederation) had banded together to resist further British incursion into their territory, and assembled a massive army of European-led units along with local and Arab mercenaries. As in many of the other books, Sharpe is sent on a small mission and ends up meeting the main villain of the piece, here a renegade English officer who is part of the Mahratta forces. Sharpe is later detailed to help capture the rogue officer, leading him to Wellington's first major set piece battle, at Assaye. And while the book is ostensibly a Sharpe book, it is this battle which Cornwell is clearly most interested in, and with good reason. In defeating an army some 10-20 times its number and equal equipment, Wellington's victory is one the great feats of military history (one which he ranked above his more famous win at Waterloo). Cornwell's recreation of the battle makes it eminently clear that two Scottish Highlander regiments (the 74th and 78th won the day for the British.Many of the usual Sharpe elements are there, bloody fighting, foul villains (including the odious Sgt. Hakeswill), treachery, and climactic massive battle. What's more interesting about this book, however, is how different this younger Sharpe is from the scarred veteran we meet in the Peninsular Wars. He has yet to be in a real battle, and is clearly tentative and bewildered by the fog of battle. He's on his own, with no men of his own to command, and without a sidekick to add any dram of levity to the tale (although the dour, Bible-thumping, vegetarian, Scottish Colonel he's attached to is a somewhat comic figure at times). There is a woman he beds, but she&#65533;s much more peripheral to the plot compared with the ladies of Spain and Portugal Sharpe later encounters. Perhaps the most interesting part of the book is when he is tempted by the offer to become an officer in the Mahratta army, with men to command, and riches to follow. He is clearly wavering but his true dream is to be able to return to his gutter origins wearing a British officer's uniform, the only one that counts."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"Cornwell takes us back to India in this book and the action is as intense as the novels set in Spain and France. These novels focusing on Sharpe's early career are especially interesting because the show him without the support of his Riflemen and without the officer's rank that is the source of much of his pride and many of his problems.But this is the novel where Sergeant Sharpe suddenly realizes that his ambitions go far beyond his non-commissioned rank. And in making the decision to try to rise to officer he knows that he is consigning himself to an almost certain death, because his only chance to become an officer is through an act of suicidal bravery on the battlefield that is noticed by a senior officer.The decision to attack at Assaye by Sir Arthur Wellesley gives Sharpe his opportunity. Longtime readers of the Sharpe novels know what he did to get himself promoted at Assaye, and Cornwell does his usual masterful job in describing this horrific, heroic deed.This book has everything Sharpe fans have come to love, and anyone who has never read this series should gather up their pennies and carve out a few weekends to devour them all. You'll find yourself addicted."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"This is the second novel of Sgt. Sharpe's early service (following TIGER), set in exotic India with places, battles, and currents of empire-building of which most American's haven't the faintiest idea. Here we finally see the enigmatic event (long alluded to in the original Sharpe series set later in Spain) that forever indebts the future Duke of Wellington to Sharpe; that icy young general in not one but two brilliant actions; Sharpe at his most ferocious ever; Sgt. Hakesbill at his absolute evil worst, consumed with jealousy and private revenge; and Sharpe receiving his first promotion to officer. After a meandering buildup, which includes a convincing Temptation of Sharpe by private pay, the climactic battle scene is horrendous, a vast set piece in front of Assaye where we witness the extreme heroism of the steadfast Scottish 78th under shot, shell, and shrapnel, 600 men (at the start) who rout 100,000. Just incredible. The battle that made the reputation of imperturbable Wellington. As usual, Cornwell brings the era alive through his details of everyday life, without the excessive technical fascination of techno-novels."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"Cornwell does it again with another installment in this highly readable series. This novel deals with probably the most amazing battle of the entire series, Wellington's early &quot;Triumph&quot; at Assaye. Cornwell's writing overall has gotten progressively better as the series has progressed. Here his prose crackles with energy in the battle scenes (especially Sharpe's long fabled and finally recreated rescue of Wellington) and gives us some of Sharpe's best personal moments when he is offered a position as a mercenary. Will he leave the British enlisted ranks to seek his fortune as a soldier for hire? Long time readers know the answer but it still makes for good reading. Of course I would be remiss not to mention the appearance of Obidiah Hakeswill. Cornwell knows he has a classic villian on his hands and he plays it to the hilt making his evil Sergeant worse than ever. This is a must read for fans of the series and an interesting historical novel about Wellington's most amazing military feat."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"This is the second of the Sharpe books I have read and the second in the series chronologically even though they were not published in this order. Already I am picking up on what I suspect may be a recurring formula for these books: an amicable working relationship with a somewhat disinterested senior officer, another senior officer who acts as a mentor, an ephemeral love interest, the sub-plot of the antagonist character (Hakeswill) dogging Sharpe's every step, the obscure battle (Ahmednugger) that acts as a precursor for the main conflict, the climactic battle in which Sharpe proves himself to his superiors, and the temporary resolution of tension while leaving enough loose ends for the next novel. This is exactly what I usually dislike about serialized novels.However, Cornwell does such an excellent job of creating realistic characters as Sharpe, McCandless, Hakeswill, as well as putting a human face on the true life characters of Wellington, Wallace, Pohlman, etc., that this novel stands far above the usual formulaic novels of the genre. Sharpe is not a monofaceted hero without flaws and, like most of us, experiences conflicting emotions and motivations. The malignant Hakeswill, a coward at heart, is obsessed with Sharpe's demise even to the detriment of his own career.But what truly makes this a first rate novel (and series for that matter) is historical accuracy. While concurrently reading Jac Weller's &quot;Wellington in India&quot;, one can trace every detail of the battles of Ahmednugger and Assaye in Sharpe's Triumph. Indeed, Cornwell himself praises Weller's trilogy on Wellington and uses it as his primary historical reference. So even though plot development may be a bit predictable on the fictional side, the historical aspects of this novel are so solid and absorbing that the result is a perfect piece of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"In this latest chapter in the life of Richard Sharpe, Bernard Cornwell takes us back to 1803 and Sharpe's life as a seargent in Wellsley's army. In Triumph, Cornwell gives readers more of the great historical fiction they have come to expect, while showing them a different side of Richard Sharpe. Having already written the end of the series, chronologically, Cornwell does a masterful job of showing us the young Richard Sharpe and relating experiences that help shape this character into the bold rifleman we know him to be. As always, the battle descriptions are excellent, and the attention to detail, within the fictional context, makes it all the more fascinating. Sharpe readers may find this book a little different than the others in the series in that a good portion of the book does not specifically involve Sharpe. I would recommend this book to any Shape reader and I would also suggest ordering Sharpe's Fortress, currently out in Britain, from Amazon.comUK. Once i found out these books were available in England I just couldn't wait to get them."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"Sharpe\`s Triumph is set in India around 1803. Richard Sharpe is a Sargent in one of the latest of the series by Bernard Cornwell. In this book he meets his ruthless enemy again, Sargent Oberdiah Hakeswill, who is intent on ruining Sharpe\`s career and life, but Sharpe has other amitions and fulfills them in an act of suicidal bravery at the battle of Assaye, where he saves the life of the then Major-General Authur Wellesley, who was soon to become the famous Duke of Wellinton. I really enjoyed this book because it is of the usual high standard that Bernard Cornwell insists on working in, and that is a good thing. I think that people who enjoy Bernard Cornwell\`s books would definately enjoy this book, the only regrets that I have about this book are that there was no cheerful, grinning Sargent Harper (see Sharpe\`s Rifles), and that, as allways, the books never seem to go on long enough."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"Richard Sharpe is the definitive Bernard Cornwell hero -- poor, uneducated, intelligent, strong, witty, and ruthless. \\"Sharpe's Triumph\\" is the second book in Cornwell's \\"India Trilogy,\\" which kicks off Cornwell's epic Richard Sharpe series that clocks in at well over 10 books. Fans of Cornwell's other books will see nothing to surprise them here, and that's a compliment. If you haven't read any of Cornwell's books, you should start with \\"Sharpe's Tiger,\\" the first novel in the India Trilogy.Four years have passed since Sharpe first won his sergeant's stripes in \\"Sharpe's Tiger.\\" Rationing the wealth he took off the dead Indian warlord, the Tippoo, Sharpe is living a pretty darn good life. All that is shattered by two events. The first occurs when Sharpe runs afoul of William Dodd, a British turncoat who now fights for profit for the Mahratta warlords. Dodd slaughters a British post and nearly does in Sharpe in the process. Soon, Sharpe is riding alongside the Scottish intelligence legend Colonel McCandless to track Dodd down and bring him to justice.The second event is largely unknown to Sharpe, and that is the hatching of a revenge plot by Sharpe's nemesis, Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswill. Sharpe left Hakeswill to die with the tigers in the last novel, but like so many fictional heroes he didn't stay around to witness Hakeswill's demise. So Hakeswill escapes, and has concocted a scheme wherein he will use the draconian system of British military law to lay Sharpe low.All this boils in the seething cauldron of General Wellesley's 1803 Indian Campaign that sees Wellesley lead the Brits in two of the Empires most famous battles - one a lightning attack on a walled city, and another a field battle while vastly outnumbered at the village of Assaye. These real-world events helped the young General grow into Lord Wellington, future foe of Napoleon, and in the hands of Cornwell, it's easy to see why they made the young man's reputation.As Cornwell's fans will attest, the man has no equal when it comes to describing a battlefield in understandable, riveting prose. He never loses control of the battlefield, tactics and strategy are clear, the carnage is undeniable, and he even injects a classic British sense of pageantry and honor into the maelstrom. In \\"Sharpe's Triumph,\\" not only do we get to see Sharpe dealing death the way only Sharpe can, we also get treated to extended passages focusing on how the dreaded Scottish infantry marches into, and through, certain death to win the battle. Cornwell never loses control or perspective, yet it is clear that the British army had more than its share of supermen in its anonymous infantry ranks.Clocking in at under 300 pages, \\"Sharpe's Triumph\\" is a concise, lean tome, even by Cornwell's standards. For thrills, for laughs, and for a sense of place and time, you must read the Sharpe Series, and \\"Sharpe's Triumph\\" is a fine entry into that saga."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"This is number two in the series and is typical of Bernard Cornwell with detailed accounts of historical events that support the storyline of his work. Action packed throughout. Easy reading but hard to put down."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Triumph: Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye, September 1803 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #2)","review":"Sharpe's triumph tracks the adventures of Richard Sharpe during the Mahratta campaign, which had its climax at the battle of Assaye.In later years The Iron Duke, Lord Wellington, was to say that this was his favorite battle. And no wonder. In those days he was simply Arthur Wellesley and yet had to make himself a reputation.He began to do so with the siege of Ahmednuggur, where he ordered a rapid esclalade of the walls with ladders instead of a protracted siege of the city. This was to become a trademark move for Wellington. He has often been criticised for the waste of life of his troops at sieges such as Badajoz and Salamanca. But such critics seem to forget that Wellington did not have the luxury of the time needed for protracted sieges during the peninsular campaign. He needed to strike fast and win fast before the French could concentrate against him.He may have learned from Ahmednuggur that a brash opportunist can quickly seize a city through sheer surprise, when the enemy expects a cautious siege.But Ahmednuggur was only the prelude to Assaye, where Wellington faced a combined Mahratta force outnumbering his army many times. With an eye to the lay of the land that was to become another of his trademarks, Wellington realised that he could outflank the Mahratta army if he could cross the river in front of their position. Locals assured him that there was no ford of the river, but Wellesley reasoned that two Indian villages would not be sited just across the river from each other if they could not communicate. He personally led the reconnaissance and found the ford he needed.However, the Mahratta army, well led by European Officers, performed a smart turning manoeuvre and managed to counter Wellingtons master stroke. But in the process they lost any room for their huge cavalry force to operate.In narrow confines the superior fighting qualities of the british infantry proved too much for the Indians, who fell back. Wellington also made brilliant use of his own small cavalry force to smash his enemies, to win a battle that immediately catapulted him to the forefront of the military.Sharpe fans will love how our old friend Richard (now a mere Sergeant) is able to see both sides of the conflict. The senior Mahratta European officer, Anthony Pohlman, offers him a life of wealth and luxury for his services when he visits the enemy camp on a spying mission with Colonel McCandless. But Sharpe resists and finds himself holding spare horses for Wellesley at Assaye.With a vengeful Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswill on his tale Sharpe knows that only a promotion to officer will save his bacon, and the only sure route to promotion is bravery on the field. The rest is history (or at least it seems so at this stage)A great and exciting read and another wonderful Sharpe adventure."},{"Title":"Computer Security Assurance","review":"We all know how bad the security of commercial software can be and now it's time we do something about it. The Common Criteria is a proven method to fixing the woeful state of software security and this book is the key to the front door that leads to the path of provably secure systems. It's useful for students, researchers, practitioners, and software developers who truly want to make a difference in finally bringing trust into an otherwise untrustworthy world."},{"Title":"Computer Security Assurance","review":"This book clearly explains the background and mechanisms of the Common Criteria. Highly recommended for system architects, software developers, software evaluators, managers, and anyone else concerned about security requirements of computer systems and hardware."},{"Title":"Show Me a Hero : A Tale of Murder, Suicide, Race & Redemption","review":"Book grossly fails to lay groundwork that led to period covered which, as a result, fails to offer appropriate and needed perspective to explain the story she tells. Also, many elements of book appear to reflect superficial research relying on sole sources (many with axes to grind or self-serving aims to rewrite city history). The real tragedy is that if this becomes only book to try to capture terror and turmoil suffered in Yonkers for more than a decade and a half (twice the period covered in her book), it will be a serious disservice to all those who lived through it, and will sadly miss the mark in alerting other communities to the numerous missed opportunities and misjudgements that needlessly plunged the city of 200,000 into a truly lost 15 year period of chaos and hell. While there is much blame and fault to go around, author's omissions unfairly causes some to shoulder too much of the blame for what went wrong, glorifies others far beyond their actual contributions, lets others who should significantly share the blame off the hook by either no mention or minimal, and ignores many unsung behind the scene community leaders whose deeds kept the city together. Somewhere. it would seem the author went from pursuing a fact based assessment about a city when confronted with the ultimate test in facing its darkest reaches almost self-destructed to a slick story line fit for a movie script."},{"Title":"Show Me a Hero : A Tale of Murder, Suicide, Race & Redemption","review":"I've never written one of these before, but I just read that reader from New England and I had to respond. I think we read two different books. The one I read captured the chaos and heartbreak of the city I have lived in all my life. I was at a lot of the meetings and clashes that fill this book, and reading Belkin I felt like I was there all over again. More important, I learned so much about the behind the scenes wrangling that I didn't know. One dimensional? No way. She peered into people's souls. Did she streamline? Yes. And as a reader, I thank her. The point was the essence of a city in chaos, and she painted that portrait in gritty and riveting detail. It wasn't her job to make sure everyone in town got their name in her book. As for Hollywood, I don't think they'll have the guts to make this movie. There are no pat happy endings here and no easy answers. Just a story that I couldn't put down."},{"Title":"Show Me a Hero : A Tale of Murder, Suicide, Race & Redemption","review":"This is a well written book that encourages thinking about important social issues. The City of Yonkers was forced by the courts to desegregate housing after years of discriminating against minorities. The decision was made to have small groups of cluster homes scattered throughout white neighborhoods. All hell broke loose in the white communities after the court decision. Whites feared a minority presence and a decline in property values and fought viciously against the homes. Poor families hoped for a safer, better place to live and raise their families. A balanced and complex story, well wrought, with an interesting cast of characters from politicians to single mothers desperate to move their families to safer neighborhoods. All the answers about the future of public housing aren't here, but certainly a clearer concept of the issues involved, from personal to political, can be gathered from this fascinating story."},{"Title":"Show Me a Hero : A Tale of Murder, Suicide, Race & Redemption","review":"Show Me a Hero is a stunningly complicated story about a simple everyday need: shelter. The youngest mayor of a city whose heyday passed long ago struggles to implement a judge's order to build housing for the poor on the city's historically white, middle class east side. Belkin takes the reader inside City Hall, underscoring the petty fights and politics, balancing the ridiculousness with moving tales of those who fight the housing to protect what's theirs, and of the women struggling to provide adequate housing for their children despite poverty, errant men, and poor health. There are surprising twists and turns, with a heartbreaking end that brings tears to the eyes of the most jaded reader."},{"Title":"Show Me a Hero : A Tale of Murder, Suicide, Race & Redemption","review":"One may not think a story of segregation would be that engrossing, but Ms. Belkin had a way of capturing the story from numerous angles. For instance, the author described the political climate and the history of Yonkers so well you could almost feel like you were there and you knew the individuals involved in the conflict. She describes how the youngest mayor ever elected to office in a city as large as Yonkers had an uphill battle from the time he was inaugurated. The struggle between the young mayor, Nick Wasicsko, his city council, and the judge that declared Yonkers to be guilty of deliberately discriminating against minorities, was fascinating. The tension between the warring parties held my attention.Ms. Belkin continues to appeal to the reader by describing individuals living in Yonkers' public housing system. I began to understand their plight and how desperate they were to get out of a bad arrangement. Even though there are many characters introduced in this story, it is easy to keep track of them because Ms. Belkin does a wonderful job of describing them in detail and personalizing their quandary in the housing projects."},{"Title":"Show Me a Hero : A Tale of Murder, Suicide, Race & Redemption","review":"Lisa Belkin takes a subject which is potentially dry, and \\"not in my backyard,\\" and leaves us informed and enlightened. She interweaves the personal stories of those whose futures were directly involved with the building of public housing in a middle-class neighborhood, while informing the reader about city politics in Yonkers, and the enigmatic young politician who tried to navigate them. Definitely recommended reading."},{"Title":"Show Me a Hero : A Tale of Murder, Suicide, Race & Redemption","review":"Belkin's literary eye and keen observational humor made what could have been a sociology lesson into a gripping drama. The forced integration of Yonkers doesn't sound like the stuff of great storytelling - but I was hooked."},{"Title":"Show Me a Hero : A Tale of Murder, Suicide, Race & Redemption","review":"\\"Show Me A Hero\\" is a compelling story of public housing reform that went on in Yonkers, New York from 1988-1998. The author told the story in a very captivating way, giving the insight of several people, not only the political perspective, but also from the perspective of the people that lived in the public housing. The city of Yonkers was handed down a court order that it had to build public housing on the white, middle-class part of town. This became a huge political battle and nearly ripped the town apart, while eventually ruining the career of the then mayor, Nick Wasicsko. As much as the white, middle-class residents didn't want the new public housing complexes in their neighborhoods, the people living in the public housing really would have preferred to be surrounded by their own. They felt uncomfortable and like they were not part of the community. This story closely follows the lives of several families who moved from the run down public housing to the new housing, townhouses, that they hoped would offer them a better life. Many times these people felt more threatened and afraid in their new homes in the middle-class neighborhood, than they did in their old apartments that were surrounded by violence and drugs. It was very interesting to get some understanding of the vicious cycle that poverty can create--children having children, absent fathers, the sick and elderly, all contributing to these lifestyles. Lisa Belkin wrote this story using a combination of documented facts, common knowledge on how people felt, and did so from a journalistic approach. This is the result of six years of work she did observing, researching and following these families. I think Yonkers did a lot of things right, and also has a lot to teach the rest of the country about how to do it better.I found this book to be very entertaining and would recommend it."},{"Title":"Show Me a Hero : A Tale of Murder, Suicide, Race & Redemption","review":"A well done look at the diversifying of America. Lisa Belkin, a NY Times reporter, gives us this look at the city of Yonkers, NY and the ramifications of a Federal Court Justice requiring said city to provide public housing on it's East Side, the good side of the tracks.Belkin has taken the events in a chronological order from many different views: Nicholas Wasiscko, voted in as the youngest mayor of any major U.S. city; Judge Sand, the Federal Court Justice; Mary Dorman, a citizen from the East Side who joined in with the protestors; Alma Febles, a single mother with young children from the West Side; and Norma O'Neal, a health care provider from the West Side who's eyesight was deteriorating at a rapid rate are some of the main characters in this unfolding crisis.The United States Justice Department filed suit against the city of Yonkers and was soon joined by the Yonkers Branch of the N.A.A.C.P. in claiming that the city had systematically kept the Black citizens down by continuing to provide Public Housing on the West Side of the city only. They claimed this created a ghetto environment that led to a lack of advancement of the population. When Judge Sand issued his 163 page opinion, it quickly became a hot topic within the city residents and the upcoming Mayoral and Council race debates.Nicholas Wasiscko, who had wanted to be the mayor of Yonkers since his early teens, saw this as a means of separating his views from his opponents and declared he would not follow the decision if elected. The election was a very close one, but he won. As he began overseeing new city council meetings, large throngs of citizens began appearing and protesting the ruling.Eventually, the City lost all of its fights within the court system and Nicholas decided it was time to do the right thing as mayor and be a leader where necessary. He pushed for acceptance and compliance with the ruling. This led to many confrontations for him within his city council and outside with the citizenry.The plan was for three sets of townhouses to be built on the East Side and a lottery of eligible West Side project residents that would determine who would live in them. The stories of Alma Febles and Norma O'Neal are followed closely for the ten year process from the beginning of this book to the end. Mary Dorman's metamorphoses from protestor to integrator to cheerleader of the West Enders.Belkin does a wonderful job of allowing the reader to make their own decision as to whether or not the decision by the judge was correct or not; whether or not the plan worked. She gets all of the facts in place and does so chronologically. The participants become more well rounded as one goes through the book. It is very cleanly written; she takes a large amount of information and dispenses it clearly. Even with the numerous sides to the story, it doesn't wander into various tales; Belkin keeps the reader on the important track.3.5 stars"},{"Title":"Show Me a Hero : A Tale of Murder, Suicide, Race & Redemption","review":"An engrossing, &quot;I cannot put it down&quot; book. Belkin takes facts and turns them into one of the best stories yet. I would recommend it without qualification. A MUST"},{"Title":"Show Me a Hero : A Tale of Murder, Suicide, Race & Redemption","review":"Lisa Belkin does a wonderful job weaving a narrative about Yonkers's desegregation struggle (or at least part of it). In her effort to achieve more than a dry rendition of the crisis, which paralyzed Yonkers for several years she left a few things out. Among them are the following: the Black and Hispanic communities in Yonkers in whose name the case was brought; the Yonkers school system (yes it did start as an education case); the political structure, including former Mayor (and now Republican leader) Angelo Martinelli; the moderate citizen groups, including Canopy and the Fair Housing Council; the court's monitor Joe Pastore, etc. Reading it, one is left with the impression that the collision (or cataclysm) was inevitable. It wasn't. As in Kosovo, political leaders played on people's ethnic fears and racial divisions for narrow political gain.Yet, the impossiblity of having a true narrative is well documented in Janet Malcolm's recent book, The Crime of Sheila McGough. As in Rashomon, it depends on what you are looking at, and, perhaps, what you are looking for."},{"Title":"365 Ways to Keep Kids Safe: How to Make Your Child's World Safer, Ages Birth to 16","review":"As my wife was first expecting and as we later became the proud parents of a new born son (he is now 7 years old), we had bought and read just about every book there was on the health and safety of children. If there was a new childhood safety device, we usually bought it as well. Quite frankly, most of the books we read were somewhat boring and hard to finish reading all the way through, even though the subject matter of childhood safety is so very important. So, I was blown away when I first opened and started reading through Don Keenan's new book. This book contains a treasure trove of information on how to keep kids safe in the increasingly dangerous world that we live in. Unlike the other books that we have read, this book is chock full of color pictures, diagrams, graphics, and (most helpful) checklists. To me, this book is not just a one time read. It will provide an invaluable future reference for new activities and situations that our children are first engaging in, but we, as parents, often wonder if we really know enough about them in order to protect and safeguard our kids. In the past, I have registered new parents to receive the CPSC notifications on children's product recalls and have done other things that I think will help them to keep their children safe. But from now on my wife and I know (without a doubt) that the best thing we can ever do, whenever we receive a new birth announcement or when my wife gets a baby shower invitation, is to give them a copy of this new book."},{"Title":"365 Ways to Keep Kids Safe: How to Make Your Child's World Safer, Ages Birth to 16","review":"As a child psychologist, I often see children who have experienced trauma including injury and/or loss. 365 Ways to Keep Kids Safe is filled with information about potential hazards in the home, community and school and uses real case studies to illustrate the life altering consequences of ignorance of those hazards, as well as a description of the legal actions taken and outcomes of those case studies. Related laws, regulations and statistics are provided in an easy to read and easy to understand format. Most important are the actions parents can take to protect their children, including checklists, to help parents be sure they are doing everything they can to minimize risk to their children.

In my opinion, the book entitled \\"365 Ways to Keep Kids Safe\\" is the most thorough yet easy to read book on child safety.Prevention is the key to child safety and this book written by Don Keenan, Esq. clearly identifies nearly all hazards that may put your child at harm. Mr. Keenan has been a nationally recognized child advocate and trial attorney for over 30 years. He has represented nearly every form of child injury and believes that all were preventable. He also established a non-profit foundation (Keenan's Kids Foundation) nearly 13 years ago to create safety programs and public awareness. This informative book covers risks associated in the home, neighborhood, recreational activities, schools/daycare, transportation and other arenas. There are many products that are noted and illustrated with photographs. In addition, there are checklists and report cards for each category that are to be used as tools to assure the utmost safety.Finally, there is information on child safeguards that is easy for the general public to understand and follow. Though we have come a long way, the emphasis in our country needs to continue to strive for even greater prevention rather than treatment.As a board certified physiatrist (medical doctor that specializes in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation), who has treated pediatric injuries for 17 years, I also believe that nearly all incidents could have been prevented. This book is an excellent tool to bring our society closer to a safer environment for our children and avoid these heartbreaking injuries that effects so many.

However, before I had even finished it, three of Mr. Keenan's warnings personally touched my life.I do not usually read the obituaries, but on the eve of the burial of my father, I looked at them in his hometown paper. I was shocked to find that a four year old girl would be buried that day in the same cemetery as my dad, having accidentally strangled herself with the cord of the blinds in her bedroom. It was the very thing Mr. Keenan had warned us about in chapter three. My heart ached for those parents as I thought if only those parents had read Mr. Keenan's book last week.The very next week, I learned of a 14 year old girl (family friend) who had suffered a catastrophic stroke after breaking her leg in a four wheeler ATV accident. Just an hour earlier I had come to the chapter in the book where Mr. Keenan discusses the dangers and precautions needed with four wheelers (chapter 23). Unfortunately, some of the precautions he outlines had not been followed. The injury to this active and attractive teen has dramatically altered the course of her life, and that of her family, forever. Again, I reflected, if only they had Mr. Keenan's information.As I approached the end of the book last week, I was awakened in the middle of the night with a knock at our door. \\"Get out of your house! Hurry, your neighbor's house is on fire.\\" Tragically, we watched our neighbor's home burn to the ground. As the fire was extinguished with the rising sun, all that remained standing was the garage. The contents of the home were but mere ashes. The family had barely made it out. We learned that in their panic, the husband, with his wife and two year old son, had escaped through the garage, while their nanny went out the front door. After getting outside, the husband heard the nanny screaming. He thought she was trapped inside and went back in to rescue her. All the hair on his body was singed. It was determined that the fire started with an appliance in the basement. Again, my mind went back to Mr. Keenan's book. If only they had checked the electrical appliances, if only they had had a better smoke alarm in place, and if only they had had an emergency escape plan with a designated meeting place.All three of these tragedies could have been prevented by acting on the anecdotal stories of those who had already suffered similar experiences. This book has humbled me. No longer do I believe that it does not apply to me. It can benefit all who read it. But once read, one must act on the knowledge learned, and pass the book on to others to read. Do not make a spot for it on a bookshelf."},{"Title":"365 Ways to Keep Kids Safe: How to Make Your Child's World Safer, Ages Birth to 16","review":"This book is excellent.

Although I've raised two sons and have one at home, I never realized the hidden dangers in toys, playgrounds, the neighborhood, schools.

I would go so far as to call myself a guru of sorts. I've read plenty of tutorials and bought more than my fair share of books and manuals. So when it came time to review \\"Photoshop CS A to Z\\" I figured I would have a great tool for quick referencing menus and filters and such. Boy was I surprised to actually learn some stuff too!When you first pick up \\"A to Z\\" you'll probably be a little let down. The cover to the book is just horrible looking. It is an ugly green with purple accents and an all around ugliness. The anti-aliasing of the cover lettering is jagged and bad, and just trying to think up something that isn't a slam on the cover art is impossible. The book looks awful. Now open it. ZING!!!!! The layout is great. There isn't a page in the entire book that isn't lit up with pictures and diagrams. You can tell from the first page that this is a great great GREAT reference guide.The book, as implied by the title, is a reference guide to Photoshop CS. It says CS on the cover, but truly this will actually help users of Photoshop CS even down to Version 7. The book doesn't have chapters, but rather is broken into parts by \\"letter.\\" So for the 1st chapter, \\"A\\", the first thing discussed is \\"Actions\\" and goes in depth explaining how actions work, what they do and tips on using them. The tips are awesome, and actually give pointers on how the pro's use actions and point you in the right direction of usage. After \\"Actions\\" is \\"Active Layer\\" then \\"Airbrush\\" and so on. This book touches on every aspect of Photoshop and even delves into resources and elements that are just slightly related to Photoshop (i.e. \\"Artifacts\\" in compression or even plugins related to Photoshop)This guide is for every user of Photoshop. If you need to know what the \\"Posterization\\" is? Well, it is on page 126 and \\"it converts the images into a number of brightness levels between 2 and 255 to produce a graphic effet. 2 is too harsh, 255 too subtle. A good balance is between four and eight.\\" Did you know that there is a \\"Patch tool\\"? I didn't and I use Photoshop every single day. In fact - this gem of a tool is buried under the \\"Healing Brush Tool\\" and I had never used it, but after I found it - wow, does it make my life a little bit easier. And to my astonishment, the \\"Patch tool\\" has been around since version 7 (kicks self in the butt).This book is amazing. It belongs on every designers coffee table, and another copy right next to their computer. Let's face it, Photoshop isn't an easy little proggie that you can learn in a day. Photoshop is a massive program. It is over loaded to the extreme, and it keeps getting more and more loaded. People who use it everyday don't even know all ofits potential. I'm a testament to that. This book is a great resource for anyone serious about learning Photoshop. It really makes an overwhelming program like Photoshop a littlemore usable.If you liked this book, try the new version Photoshop CS2: A to Z, as well.John HarbisonMember, D-MAG.org"},{"Title":"Photoshop CS A-Z: The essential visual reference guide","review":"If you're one of those people who learn things through visuals and pictures, and what Photoshop user isn't?

Wendell Willkie, while possessing much of the intellectual gravity of a Stevenson and the charisma of a Goldwater or LaFollete, differs from them in at least one crucial respect: he was not a professional politician and in fact never held any elected office, only running for the same when he ran for President in 1940 and briefly again in 1944.Willkie's politics also do not fit the mold, as he was far from a traditional party standard bearer, but rather advocated \\"liberal\\" policies at odds with the conservative hidebounds views of the Republicans, particularly during the era preceding the Second World War, that great conflict being what propelled Willkie into his unique place in American history.Willkie came from modest roots in the midwest, his father being a small town lawyer in Elwood, Indiana to where he returned to officially kick off his presidential campaign in 1940 in a scene straight out of Norman Rockwell. Willkie's politics were those of a liberal Woodrow Wilson democrat without the racism of the former, but as a corporate lawyer, first in Akron and then in New York, he took on what he saw as the excesses of the New Deal in regulating business. This activity, particularly his attempts to reign in the Tennesee Valley Authority resulted in his being made president of the utilities giant, Commonwealth & Southern, resulting in his becoming a national public figure.The growing clouds of war caused great concern to Willkie who felt that America must not abandon Europe and Britain to Nazi Germany. It was in that context that he entered the 1940 Republican presidential nomination contest after switching parties the year before in which he remained a distant contender until a few weeks before the convention. The turn around in Willkie's prospects occurred as a result of the Fall of France in June 1940 on the eve of the convention which caused many people to be deeply concerned about the prospect of the nomination and possible election of one of the hidebound isolationists that were leading the pack at the time. As a result and with the help of a large grass roots organization and the support of Henry Luce and his publishing empire, Willkie was able to wrest the nomination from Taft and Dewey after the convention became deadlocked even though he had not run in any primaries.Willkie ran an aggressive and flamboyant campaign emphasizing the need to aid the besieged Allies and expressing concern over the prospect of FDR or any president being elected to a third term. The similarity in views with Roosevelt not only on the war but on much of the New Deal, caused a blurring of the differences between the two candidates to Willkie's detriment, nothwithstanding the impressively spirited nature of his campaign. After the campaign, he was tapped by Roosevelt to go on two factfinding trips, the first to Britain during the Blitz in 1941, the second an around the world trip to visit the war theaters and their leaders. This trip, which resulted in Willkie's famous book, \\"One World\\", showed the world, like Willkie's 1940 campaign previously, that America was united in opposing the Axis and fascism. As noteworthy as all this was, it hurt Willkie in the world of Republican partisan politics and his 1944 campaign was stillborn and he himself died unexpectedly later that year after a brief illness. While Willkie failed to either become President or instill progressive traditions in the Republican party, he left a lasting legacy. More than a mere shill for FDR (a role he played to the hilt), Willkie was an exemplar of the best of American society during one of the greatest periods of crisis it has faced and has in the words of the author like Henry Clay and William Jennings Bryan earned a lasting place in American history"},{"Title":"Dark Horse: A Biography of Wendell Willkie","review":"This is the third book I have read about Wendell Willkie since I read Amity Schlaes' history of the Great Depression,The Forgotten Man: A New History of the Great Depression. She describes the battle between Willkie and Roosevelt as the former tried to defend private enterprise from the New Dealers who were determined to nationalize the electric power industry. I highly recommend her book but it got me reading about Willkie. I remember my father telling me about the 1940 election. Most people who know anything about it, remember that Roosevelt won by a large majority (449 to 82) in the electoral college. What they do not realize is that it was much closer and a change of 600,000 votes could have shifted enough states to Willkie for him to win.The Republican Party of 1940 was not quite a bad as it is shown in a recent novel,The Plot Against America, suggesting that Charles Lindberg could have been the nominee. Still, it was adamantly isolationist. Willkie was a wealthy lawyer and CEO of an electric utility who decided to run for president in spite of never having held public office. This biography describes, not only his run for the presidency, but his life and, tragically, the promise of his future had he lived. After the 1940 election, Roosevelt asked him to embark on several exhaustive and dangerous world tours to gather information. He traveled around the world meeting Stalin, the Shah of Iran, General Montgomery in Egypt and even Chaing Kai Shek. His travels and the sessions he held with these leaders resemble the travels of Herman Wouk's hero of theThe Winds of Warnovels. I wonder now if Wouk might have used Willkie's experiences and his book,One World, as his source.This biography is extremely well done and is part of a study of the history of the United States in The Great Depression and World War II. Willkie was rejected by the isolationists of the Republican Party in 1944 and, incredibly, Roosevelt even considered asking him to run with him as his Vice-Presidential nominee. Willkie declined and, as it happened, he died before the election. Had Willkie lived, there is no limit to what might have followed. Tragically, Willkie died before the 1944 election so the might-have-beens are idle to speculate about. If you are a student of American history and want to know more about the Depression and the Second World War, this book is almost indispensable. Willkie is almost unknown today but was a major figure and could have been a great president."},{"Title":"Dark Horse: A Biography of Wendell Willkie","review":"This was simply one of the finest political biographies I have ever read. 'Dark Horse' stands out for two reasons: 1) it has a fast-paced and lucid narrative that reads almost like a novel and 2) it brings Willkie and his times to vivid life. It is rare for a political biography to be fully engaging throughout. However, 'Dark Horse' is one of those rare biographies.This book is truly a tour de force of political biography. And, it a fitting testament to a true American hero who awakened a nation to the dangers of Hitler at one of history's most perilous hours.Highly recommended for all."},{"Title":"Dark Horse: A Biography of Wendell Willkie","review":"Many years ago, I became fascinated with Wendell Willkie (1892 -- 1944) by reading \\"They Also Ran\\"They Also Ran, Irving Stone's famous account of defeated presidential candidates. Willkie's story inspired me greatly, and I read a substantial amount about him when I was too young to understand. Then, after many years and much change in me in between, I read David Levering Lewis' perceptive account of Willkie in an essay included in a study of various American leaders edited by Walter Isaacson, \\"Profiles in Leadership\\"Profiles in Leadership: Historians on the Elusive Quality of Greatness. Lewis' essay made me want to revist Willkie again. I found Steve Neal's biography, \\"Dark Horse\\", published in 1984 and now unhappily out of print. Neal (1949 -- 2004) was a person of my own generation. He was a political writer and columnist for the Chicago Tribune before his unfortunate death. I was happy to learn something of Neal as well as of Willkie in this moving biography.Willkie was indeed the quintessential \\"Dark Horse\\" presidential candidate. Although he had never held political office and had been a registered Democrat until mid-1939, Willkie captured the 1940 Republican nomination. He mounted an aggressive campaign (in which he toured the United States in a rail car and yelled himself hoarse) against Roosevelt, who was running for an unprecedented third term, and did relatively well in terms of popular vote even though he lost decisively in the electoral college. Willkie ran as a liberal Republican against the Republican Old Guard which in 1940 was strongly isolationist. Although a political amateur, Willkie had powerful backers. His nomination owed a great deal to his support in the news media. In addition, at the time of the Republican convention, France had fallen and many voters were looking for an internationalist approach.Neal's book discusses Willkie's astonishing rise to the Republican nomination. Born in Elwood, Indiana, Willkie had become a successful Wall Street lawyer and the president of Commonwealth and Southern Utility Company. In this capacity, Willkie opposed the New Deal and the Tennessee Valley Authority and came to public attention. Willkie opposed the New Deal vigorously while securing the presidential nomination on the basis of his internationalism. During the pressures of the 1940 campaign, he backed away temporarily and reluctantly from this latter commitment.Neal offers a strong portrayal of Willkie as a presidential candidate. But perhaps Willkie made an even stronger impact on the United States during the final four years of his life following his 1940 defeat. Willkie became famous for his development of the concept of the \\"Loyal Opposition\\", a trait he exemplified for the remainder of his life. He helped unite the country by his support of England, the lend-lease program, and the Selective Service Act. In 1942, President Roosevelt, who admired Willkie, named his former opponent a personal envoy and sent him on a world-wide tour which included England, Russia, and China. Following his mission, Willkie wrote his famous best-selling book, \\"One World\\",One Worldwhich summarized his faith in internationalism and his hope for lasting peace. Willkie returned to the practice of law where he won a famous civil rights case involving a member of the communist party, Schneiderman v. United States, and defended the movie industry before Congress against charges that the industry was pro-communist. Willkie also spoke and wrote eloquently and repeatedly in support of full civil rights for African Americans. His liberal positions antagonized the traditional Republican political base and its political leadership. After a crushing defeat in the presidential primary in Wisconsin, Willkie withdrew from the 1944 campaign, and he died shortly thereafter.Although he has become an obscure figure, Willkie deserves to be remembered for his courage, vision, and ideals. He may well have made an excellent president. But his service in the cause of civil rights and his attempt to bring a sense of unity to American foreign policy were lasting contributions. For a time, he modified the basic ideological conservatism of the Republican party. Late in his life, he and Roosevelt may have attempted a realignment of the American party system on liberal-conservative lines. Overall, Willkie represents a rare example of a person in public life who, with some wavering in the 1940 campaign, stayed true to his convictions and tended to act in a spirit of unity and patriotism rather than narrow partisanship.I was pleased to have the opportunity to revisit the life of a person who inspired me when I was young but who I hadn't thought much about for a long time. The qualities that I saw dimly in Willkie when I first read about him became clearer with the passage of age. I learned from Willkie again through Steve Neal's fine book. I think that there is still much that Americans may learn from Wendell Willkie.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Dark Horse: A Biography of Wendell Willkie","review":"I also read \\"The Forgotten Man,\\" which I believe was slanted although well written. It also got me interested in Wendell Willkie. I bought this book used with a broken spine for $29. It was worth every penny. I'm not sure he would have been a good president, but he was a great statesman.The above reviews are excellent. I agree with most of what they say. My favorite chapter was \\"The Good Fight.\\" Wendell was a great humanitarian. He fought for what he believed in and never wavered. If he had lived, he'd have given McCarthy a good fight, I think. My favorite part of this chapter is where he discovered the resort where he was staying didn't not allow Jews. He informed the management that unless they changed the policy he was leaving. They changed the policy.This book is very well written, concise, well-documented, and fast paced. I believe we need this biography at this time in our country's history and hope the publishers see fit to bring it out again."},{"Title":"Dark Horse: A Biography of Wendell Willkie","review":"This is an excellent political biography of one of the most interesting (if largely forgotten) political figures in the USA in the 20th Century. Wendell Wilkie (1891-1944) was a former teacher, ex-Democrat, and non-politician who experienced a meteoric rise to capture the Republican nomination for President in 1940. Readers learn of Wilkie's early career as a corporate lawyer, and later, President of powerful utility companies - from his combating what he felt were the excesses of FDR's Tennessee Valley Authority. Wilkie's capture of the 1940 GOP nomination should be the subject of books and films - backed by Henry Luce (Time Magazine) and other top national publishers, he triumphed over better-known figures like Senators Arthur Vandenberg, Robert Taft, and future New York Governor Tom Dewey. As candidate Wilkie was progressive-minded, and a secret admirer of his opponent (President Franklin D. Roosevelt), who in turn secretly admired his challenger. The author shows that Wilkie campaigned against both a third term for the President and New Deal corruption (but not against the New Deal), although like FDR he favored military preparedness and aiding a beleaguered Britain then standing alone against Nazi Germany. Not long after his defeat by a respectable 55-45% margin, Wilkie spoke in favor of Lend-Lease to Britain, and was tapped by FDR to make fact-finding missions about the war. Wilkie later wrote a progressive book (One World), and he spoke out in favor of civil rights at home and against imperialism and colonialism abroad - positions that didn't always endear him to the public. Wilkie finished dead last in the GOP primary in Wisconsin in 1944, and died of heart disease a few months later at age 52.Author Steve Neal was a capable political reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times before he passed in 2004. He provides nicely-readable prose, and wrote another solid political book about FDR's nomination in 1932 (Happy Days are Here Again)."},{"Title":"Thriller Theatre","review":"When does the next one come out!?

I prepared a 6-minute presentation. Unfortunately Carol must not have told you of her promise to me and you cut my presentation time and I was unable to make my conclusion.Proving yet again, Dr. Stultzberg's (of PETsMART) contention in her half page rebuke of Carol in the Arizona Republic.The answer to the problem is: Put birth control additives in pet food.It is very difficult to argue a point that is absolutely correct. An example: \\"Put fluoride in the drinking water to prevent cavities.\\" I believe that you will have a difficult time finding many people today that are against this solution to tooth decay. Yet, when this solution was presented, it was fought vigorously by many large groups of people. Why? I have no idea. But many people had either fears or vested interests to contend with.Let's look at the fears and vested interests in the birth control pet food issue. Fears: Giving my pet an additive might hurt it. This is \\"Big Brother\\" getting further into my life. This is stepping on my \\"Rights.\\"Vested interests: MCRAC: Started to protect citizens from the threat of rabies, expanded to protect citizens from roaming dogs, expanded to prevent animal abuse, expanded again to help with pet adoptions. Funded by the county and pet licensing. One avenue to more funding is proving to the county that there are more problems with dogs and cats that can be solved by this agency. Another is proving to the community a valid reason for licensing their pets.Arizona Humane Society: If MCRAC did its job, there would be no need for this agency. In many areas the Humane Society and the County Animal control agencies are combined. Funded by donations and fees. Strong tie to the community with continuing distress calls and public viewing of animal cruelty reports. Sixty cats rescued, fifty-five euthanized the next day. High profile, big budget, \\"cash\\" business, with over 1 million dollars in cash assets.Pet food manufactures: Fewer pets' means lower pet food sales. Investors want more profit, not less profit. How can they approach their Board of Directors with, \\"Hey I've got a great idea, we can introduce birth control additives and reduce the sales of our pet food by 10% a year for the next 10 years?\\"1. Many people will resist birth control additives simply because it is a change.2. 84% of people adopt puppies or kittens and let older dogs and cats die. Caused by the availability of puppies and kittens. Think about it. Bring a child to a Shelter where there are 8 darling little puppies, and 3 older dogs. The child will be attracted to the small helpless puppy, with that \\"smell\\" and nuzzling. The child falls in love with the puppy and the older dogs get left. Remove the never-ending supply of puppies and more \\"older\\" dogs will get adopted. PETsMART has proven this.3. Nobody wants to pay more taxes! Tax non-birth control pet food 25%. This tax will give the manufactures the incentive to produce this product. Manufactures will see that if they introduce a birth control pet food that does not have this 25% tax, they will sell more pet food now and have an advantage over their competition that is not producing birth control pet food. Even though the long-term effect will be lower food sales, the short-term gains will drive them to produce this product. Net effect, little or no tax and over all cost of prevention set at pennies per day.4. Birth control has proven to be safe in the human species. The major concern with birth control has been the possible side effects from long term usage. The human species has shown no long-term effect and the human outlives the dog and cat by a factor of seven.5. Feral cats. It has been reported that the size of the feral cat population is approximately 40% of the domestic cat population and 25% of feral cats get their food from humans providing them with pet food. If the less expensive, birth control pet food was made available, people buying food for feral cats would help control the feral cat population. Agencies wanting to reduce the feral cat population could just simply feed them.6. Breeders. Those who wish to breed pets can go to the MCRAC and buy a breeder's license, this license allows breeders to buy non-birth control pet food. The breeder still has to pay the additional tax as an incentive to go back to birth control pet food.7. Veterinary services. Billions of dollars are spent each year preventing unwanted births and these efforts should continue, but the even this amount of effort is not solving the problem. Everyone agrees that there are too many unwanted births. Birth control pet food is an even more cost-effective method of solving the unwanted birth problem.8. Identifying the problem. Tons of time and effort is spent on quantifying the exact problem, how many dogs, how many cats, how many feral cats, how many unwanted pregnancies and so on.The reality is one unwanted birth is too many.We don't want to kill dogs and cats, so we remove the reproductive system of many of them, let the rest breed and wait a few years and then kill them, excuse me, \\"euthanize\\" them and we call ourselves \\"Humane.\\"Birth control pet food is a humane way of lowering pet overpopulation. It should be our first line of defense. We inject a vaccine into dogs to prevent rabies. We do invasive surgery to sterilize animals to prevent births. If we could find a vaccine to inject to prevent births we would use it. We have an oral vaccine to prevent births it's called birth control pet food.Who can make this happen? Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Why? He's the only one with the power to get past the fears and vested interests of \\"status quo.\\"Thank you for your time,Harold Clements"},{"Title":"Phone home, Persephone!

Unless by \\"adventures\\" you mean a long and loving look at facets of Peltier's life that have NOTHING to do with star-gazing. Not that I mind that. This is, after all, a retrospective. But must there be so much? Must the astronomy and the science play such a minor role?Apparently Peltier felt that it did.All I have to say is if Starlight Nights is considered the bar then the field of astronomy has a LONG way to go before we get something both well-written *and* conveys the majestic sweep of the cosmos -- neither of which are apparent in this effort by Peltier.Here's an example:\\"Then, one night in February 1946 it (T Coronae) stirred, slowly opened its eyes, then quickly threw aside the draperies of its couch and rose!\\"That doesn't make much sense on any level. Unfortunately, there's a lot of that \\"Little House on the Astronomical Prairie\\" kind of writing here. And by a \\"lot\\" I mean the entire book. Peltier makes the amateurish mistake many writers make when writing about his past. He's to close to the source material. He can't see beyond the dripping nostalgia that forms the foundation of his memory. He relies so heavily on flowery imagery and anthropomorphism the main thrust of the book -- the astronomical reminisces of a famous comet hunter -- fall by the wayside and are lost among strawberry patches, geology expeditions, and the shadows of cows hidden among haystacks.In fact there is very little about comet hunting at all, compared to the rest of what Peltier delivers regarding his life. It's too bad, really, that Peltier made the editorial decision to concentrate on sentimentality above science, but that's what you're going to be faced with if you decide to read this book.Sorry. I cannot recommend this book at all. It was a big disappointment, imo."},{"Title":"Starlight Nights: The Adventures of a Star-Gazer","review":"&quot;A hymn to the sky&quot; -Levy. To me, no book more beautifully captures the spirit of amateur astronomy that Peltier's Starlight Nights. I first read this book several years ago and still remember marveling at Peltier's intensely personal autobiography. In writing of his childhood in Delphos, Ohio, he spares few details of life on the early 1900's farm, and we wait spellbound with him as he orders his first telescope after catching the astronomy bug as a young teenager. We breathlessly await the partial eclipse of 1918 (the teenaged Leslie lacked the funds to travel the 500 miles necessary to see totality in the US's first total eclipse of the century), and are swept away again that very night as he was one of the first to note the spectacular Nova Aquila as it rose to a stunning -1.4 mag.Peltier's descriptions of his experiences are as elegant as they are simple. His deep respect and admiration for nature are woven into every page, not only for things astronomical, but terrestrial as well, for he was a naturalist of varied interests.This reissue comes with a new foreword by David Levy, as well as several rare photographs (on the cover and back, as well as a few in the foreword) of Peltier, his early telescopes and homes. If you are familiar with this book, take this opportunity to read it again. If you've never read it before, set aside a long evening - you won't put it down after you start."},{"Title":"Starlight Nights: The Adventures of a Star-Gazer","review":"Remember those movies where an old man tells his story in the form of a flashback? The kind that makes you wish you could go back in time to hang out with them, experience their life? Starlight Nights is one of those stories.Leslie Peltier's book is full of warmth and humor. He takes us back to a 1905 farm and describes what it was like to grow up without electricity, television. The beginning of his story predates the spread of the automobile. We watch as he buys a small telescope, and without the benefit of a college education, becomes the friend and colleague of the eminent astronomers of his day. We experience the thrill of finding comets and novae, and at the same time, the quiet joy of country life a century ago.The book is wonderfully illustrated by Mr. Peltier himself, and the introduction includes family photographs.Absolutely recommended for everyone, not just stargazers."},{"Title":"Starlight Nights: The Adventures of a Star-Gazer","review":"This is a jem. The author would likely fail to recognize the world of 2002, and would certainly be horrified to awake in it.He lived, really lived, in an earlier era when discovery of a new comet by an amateur simply looking through a telescope, without the CCDs and other fancy technology, was celebrated, and civilization grew at a pleasant pace in the midwest where he lived, away from the hustle, rush hours, and UN crisis. His humility in accepting the gifts of slowly increasing aperture telescopes and the way in which alone, he found good ways to use them to their best are balm to the soul.Get a copy of this little book, turn off the TV and computer and regress to Peltier's world of worthwhile ways of spending your time while seeing the universe. Fortunately, you don't really have to wait weeks to get a copy if you'll dial up Sky and Telescope."},{"Title":"Starlight Nights: The Adventures of a Star-Gazer","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. It is the autobiography of Leslie Peltier, a legendary amateur astronomer. It tells the story of him growing up in the midwest and his interest in nature. This eventually led to him becoming an amateur astronomer, discovering several comets (which bear his name), and performing variable star observing and recording for the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO).His writing style shows his early 20th century, midwest upbringing and at times is simply poetic.I've read this book at least 4 times and each time brings a calm and inspiration not common in todays world.I very highly recommend this book to anyone interseted in astronomy, nature or an escape from modern day chaos."},{"Title":"Starlight Nights: The Adventures of a Star-Gazer","review":"Starlight Nights: The Adventures of a Stargazer by Leslie Peltier is a wonderful book, which embodies the heart and soul of stargazing. It was out of print for many years, but has been republished by Sky Publishing, and is available through Amazon and through the Sky & Telescope Store online. I obtained a copy last year and read it. Once started, I couldn't put it down.Peltier begins when, as a child of five, he first saw the Pleiades. As a young teenager he saved up his money and bought his first scope, made his own observing pier in the pasture, and hung out every night learning the night sky. The book covers about 60 years in Peltier's life, including his stargazing honeymoon out west. He observed every night he could, undeterred by cows in the field or snow on the ground.He became an avid variable-star observer and a comet hunter. He tells the story of bicycling into town on a dark November night in 1925 to telegraph his first comet discovery to Harvard College Observatory. One of his early telescopes, a six-inch refractor, had a wooden (mahogany) tube. When he found each comet he neatly carved the date in the tube of the telescope.Over the years he built his own observatories, and obtained castoff FAMOUS telescopes (a twelve-inch refractor made by Alvan Clark), when Miami University of Ohio, 125 miles from his home, wanted to upgrade theirs. He became famous among astronomers, but always lived a simple life, shunning publicity, and not straying far from the family homestead in Delphos, Ohio. Leslie Peltier was a gentle soul, self-effacing and honest, and \\"real\\". He writes as if he were talking to a friend, telling a favorite story.This book captures the romance of amateur astronomy. Peltier embodied the \\"heart and soul\\" of a stargazer. As David Levy says in his foreword, this book explains the \\"why\\" of astronomy, and not just the \\"how\\".It's a book every stargazer should read."},{"Title":"Starlight Nights: The Adventures of a Star-Gazer","review":"A classic wonderful book by Leslie C Peltier and forward by David H Levy. 240 pages and a few nice family pictures. An easy read and can be read in 1 day but DONT. Here is a book to savor and take your time with. There are many astronomy books on how to find stars and explaining them but here is a book on the love a man has and the why he is interested in Astronomy.Peltier was a giant among amateur astronomers with 12 comets, 6 novas and 132,000 variable star observations. Remember these discoveries were in the early 1900s to mid 1900s before CCD cameras,computer, assisted astronomy software, imaging and giant 30 inch plus amateur scopes. His first telescope was a 2 inch refractor.We see him growing up as a small boy on the farm and his love of reading and all forms of nature and the good times he and his family have with little money and much love. There was no electric, running water or indoor plumbing. Typical rural farm early 1900s living.A much simpler time.Eventually he makes his own mount for his scope on the family farm. Also his father and him build Leslie an observatory on the farm for his later 4 inch refractor but he has to send this telescope back to the Variable Star Association he belongs to. However they send him a wide field 6 inch refractor that is good to find comets with. Later he marries Dottie his sweetheart and they go to the southwest. Together they share Dottie's love of Archeology and Leslie continues his love of Astronomy with more discoveries. Later Leslie gets a 12 inch Clark Refractor donated to him. After repairing it he gets spectacular views.Here is a very humble man who loved the simple life, his family and really had no need for the spotlight.I'm an amateur astronomer of over 40 years and have a 20 inch telescope, the best eyepieces, mallincam camera, computer, software etc. Peltier had none of these to assist his discoveries. The great discoveries and shear volume of his discoveries with much simpler equipment is truly remarkable.I'm sorry I never had the opportunity to met him. I too have bought an old farm/ranch where I plan to have an observatory built for my telescopes to explore the heavens. Someday after my passing, Leslie Peltier may we meet in the heavens to explore its wonders. I'll meet you at the HorseHead nebula.Buy the book and slowly read it and savor it. You wont find another book that expresses such love as to why to view the stars and comets."},{"Title":"Starlight Nights: The Adventures of a Star-Gazer","review":"Start reading Peltier's Starlight Nights at your own risk and you'll want to observe on crummy nights as well as good ones. Be prepared to lose a lot of sleep out under the sky night after night! Peltier's enthusiasm for observing the night sky in all conditions this side of hopeless is contagious. After all, he didn't make 132,000 variable-star observations by holding off until a pristine night!This is the classic cloudy-night book, that'll have you going outside every few minutes and sometimes staying out even when the sky is not cooperating, just for what you can eke out. Remember, Peltier did his amazing accomplishments mostly with well-worn equipment, much of which would be considered modest or even sub-par today. It's a tribute to his farm background's make-do & repair skills that the equipment was kept in such usable condition.Ah, for the era Peltier speaks of when we didn't have to deal with a lot of fearful people leaving yard-blaster lights splattering in every direction all night. Even with rural electrification nearly complete by the late 1940s there were good dark skies near & even in cities, with no need of so-called \\"security lights\\" (what a contradiction in terms) trashing the skyscape. As Peltier's era had the challenge of getting serviceable astronomical equipment, the challenge of overcoming light-pollution is ours today."},{"Title":"Starlight Nights: The Adventures of a Star-Gazer","review":"A wonderful introduction to the love of star gazing by the world's foremost amateur astronomer, Leslie Peltier, discoverer of a dozen comets. The reader is treated to not only the night sky, but also the agricultural life and connections to nature of the farmer at the turn of the 20th century, decades before rural electrification. The book is a compelling read with insights and lessons for the 21st century world."},{"Title":"Starlight Nights: The Adventures of a Star-Gazer","review":"Let's just call this book what it is: A rare masterpiece. Starlight Nights was never destined to be a best seller, but it will enjoy permanent cult status among a small audience of sensative people who love the stars, love nature -- and perhaps a certain segment of society who will pine forever for a slice of American rural life that is permanently lost.I hope it is not over-the-top to say that people may find reading Peltier's ode to the stars a religious experience. This book will have a profound effect on those lucky few attuned to a more sensative mode of existence, those who are able to see the incredible beauty is something as small as a wildflower or insect, or as grand as a night sky paved with glittering stars.This is the story of a guy born in 1900 near the small town of Delphos, Ohio, and his life growing up on the farm, where early on he developed a love affair with stars and telescopes. Peltier gets zapped at an early age with the spectacular appearance of a stunnning comet, known only as 1910a because it was the first comet discovered that year. It had to play second fiddle, however, because 1910a was also the year of Halley's Comet famous return.Peltier also describes being transfixed by the Pleiades which he spotted through the window of their rural farm house as a small boy -- this was in the day before every farm had a yardlight, and before the light pollution of surrounding cities began to blot out the beauty of the night sky. It begans a life long journey of amateur astronomy, during which Peltier discovered 12 comets, made thousands of variable star observations, built observatories, and eventually came to be known as \\"the world's greatest amateur astronomer.\\"I purchased Starlight Nights some 40 years ago when I was 12 years old. I found it in a large box of used books that were being sold off in a clothing store. While I waited for my mother to shop, I mined through the book bin and grabbed Starlight Nights -- it was 50 cents. Wow! I still marvel to think about it! I didn't know it yet, but 50 cents and a secondhand book was about to change my life forever!Over the past four decades, I have read Starlight Nights perhaps 20 times. Of the thousands of books I have read across the years, I can't think of one that has affected me more profoundly than has this rare gem."},{"Title":"Starlight Nights: The Adventures of a Star-Gazer","review":"There are many books out there on how to engage in amateur astronomy.

Is that poetry? How did he get published in your book with that? I mean, I'm taking an American Lit class and there are certain guidelines to poetry, right? Maybe if you said that was 'Art' then he could get by with stacking 'stars' and ending with a 'steer', but one wonders how long it took him to come up with that. A second? Did he get paid for that? If so, then I'm sending in some poetic art and should get paid as well. Also, I don't think we should stretch to find meaning in what we see. The examples you gave as to what the poem could mean were 'out there' to say the least.

It has been used in schools, youth programs, churches and prisons throughout Tucson and other locations.

Chapter titles include: Meet Delphi; The Earth Has a Body; Delphi's House; More About Angels; All About Listening; Practicing Being Good; Living Peacefully. The illustrations are imaginative and playful; the book reminds us that when we open our hearts, miracles can occur. Delphi is a golden retriever with a heart as big as the world and a dream to match: she wants to share her message of caring and love with every child on the planet. Six Lessons is the book that can do it!"},{"Title":"Six Lessons With Delphi: How to Live Happily With All Life","review":"Don't be fooled by the age level for this book. Anyone could, and everyone should read it. It tells of the 'real' world, something that is beyond the wars and petty fights we always seem to find ourselves amidst. It tells of angels, and spirits, and most of all... it tells that all life speaks. We can learn to listen to what exactly the dog next door is trying to tell you everytime you walk by, or how to gently tell the spider that you would rather him (or her) not make a home over your bed. For whatever reason you find yourself reading this book- curiosity, or perhaps it speaks to you... its the right book for humanity."},{"Title":"Looking Forward: An Anthology of Science Fiction","review":"Milton Lesser was the pseudonym of Steven Marlowe. He is represented in _Looking Forward_ (1953) with one story, \\"Lion's Mouth,\\" published under his own name. When I was in eighth grade, I read novels by Lesser like _Earthbound_ (1952) and _Stadium Beyond the Stars_ (1960). I thought that Lesser was the greatest thing since sliced bread. Well, I am a bit older, now. My childhood enthusiasm for Lesser is-- shall we say-- more restrained.But when I saw this old anthology in a used book bin, I snapped it up. I wanted to see how well Lesser did with his only science fiction anthology. Of the twenty stories in this volumn, there were only five that struck me as being really outstanding: Jack Williamson's \\"The Man from Outside,\\" Lewis Padgett's \\"We Kill People,\\" Raymond F. Jones's \\"Production Test,\\" Ray Bradbury's \\"In This Sign,\\" and Eric Frank Russell's \\"Ultima Thule\\".The Williamson is about alien agents on Earth in the wake of atomic bomb explosions wrestling with the ethical question: What action (or inaction) should they take with those upstart humans? The Padgett involves one of the damndest forms of Murder, Inc. that I have encountered in fiction. The Jones is an old-fashioned hard sf yarn about problems with new spacesuits, though the basic cause of the problem would probably be avoided by most modern engineers. The Bradbury is a marvolous dramitization of the conflict between the desire to stay on the spiritual mountain and the demand to return to the valley of sinful men. The Russell is a warmly human account of the trials of a spaceman in deep freeze.The other fifteen stories are solid pieces of craftsmanship that are frequently entertaining. There's not an outright clunker in the lot. There are three fairly minor tales-- the Marlowe, Robert Lowndes's \\"Highway,\\" and Don Wilcox's \\"The Voyage that Lasted Six Hundred Years\\". But I can think of a number of good arguments for reprinting these three stories-- especially the Wilcox. I am glad that Lesser included them.The remaining stories are: Chad Oliver's \\"Win the World,\\" Walter M. Miller, Jr.'s \\"The Little Creeps,\\" Edmond Hamilton's \\"Exile,\\" Murray Leinster's \\"The Power,\\" Mack Reynolds's \\"The Man in the Moon,\\" Isaac Asimov's \\"Victory Unintentional,\\" Poul Anderson's \\"The Last Monster,\\" Jack Vance's The King of Thieves\\" (a Magnus Ridolph tale), John Christopher's \\"Man of Destiny,\\" Lester del Rey's \\"Into Thy Hands,\\" and Arthur C. Clarke's \\"Transience\\".The editorial notes contain a few period oddities. Lesser refers to the brand new term for science fiction, _stf_ (as opposed to our equally odious modern term _sci fi_). He mentions that brand new quality movie, _Destination Moon_. And he refers to \\"Mr. Padgett,\\" apparently unaware that this was a pen name of Henry Kuttner and C.L. Moore. But on the balance, I believe that Milton Lesser did pretty well as an editor. Readers who like science fiction with a slightly old-fashioned flavor may enjoy this book. I do, and I did."},{"Title":"Looking Forward: An Anthology of Science Fiction","review":"I loved this book as a kid just discovering sci-fi in the 70s--long out of print, and actually most of the stories are fairly forgettable.

The book covers history of India from Vedic period till 1996. Author's style of writing is very convincing; he is giving logical reasons for his statements. Being a journalist and correspondent for South Asia for French Newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; in India for 30 years, Francois Gautier has observed India very well. Some of his observations are so subtle that even I (being an Indian) had missed them. In the later chapters, he gives an account of contemporary India. In the 14th chapter, he proposes a confederacy of South Asia led by India, which at this point seems distant but not unachievable. He also gives explanations why neighbors of India dislike it although India hasn't been ever an aggressor. Author has also given a good comparison of east and west in Indian context and higlights achievments of east &amp; west. Unlike the British authors ( if you've read Percival Spears' &quot;History of India&quot;, you will notice that British historians write Indian history in such a manner that they'd done a great favour(!) to India by ruling them. Unfortunately, there are many takers for this in India, who love India bashing not understanding the value of India.), tone is never derogatory. On the other hand, he doesn't hesitate to point out lack of collective discipline, illiteracy, etc. The book also points out the arenas such as spiritualism, Yoga ( which is spread all over the world now), which are Indian contributions to the Humanity. In summary, I would say it is the best book I've ever read on Indian History."},{"Title":"Rewriting Indian History","review":"This is a very insightful book about problems which India faces today and why there is a need to rewrite the history of India correctly instead of hiding and distorting facts which is being done now. Although I do not agree with the author on all points, but most of his ideas are sensible and appealing to an educated reader. His suggestion of re-uniting of India and Pakistan makes a lot of sense but seems very impractical in the present situation. I hope this book will see the eyes of many readers."},{"Title":"Rewriting Indian History","review":"It is so unfortunate that the version of history presented by the author is nowhere in the vicinity of being in a history textbook in modern day India.This book gives us a very important point of view of Indian history. As C.J.S.Wallia writes in a review of the book:\\"From my own perspective as a secular humanist, I believe that any whitewashing of historical record is counterproductive. No matter how lofty the ideals of a current cause, any whitewash of history tempts the fates. To forget history will always be fateful; to forgive its horrendous facts can be redemptive. Forgive -- but never forget -- history. A salient example of making sure that the horrors of history are not forgotten is the contemporary German state's law prohibiting any World War II history that whitewashes the holocaust perpetrated by the Nazis on the Jews, Gypsies, and Poles. The Jews rightly insist that the world must never forget what happened to them.

Rabid anti-Islamic generalizations however are accompanied by attacks on Christian missions, cowardly American Military fighting from distance without honor (while applauding new Indian martial spirit).The French, Indianized, author supports Hindu Nationalism, reintegrating Kashmir and Sri Lanka, standing up to the Chinese on Tibet based on a romantic renaissance of classical Indian civilization and industry.

But is she really what she seems?Vanessa is really a compassionate, shape shifting alien who has managed to get through a porthole in time and jump from her planet to planet earth. Her planet has been taken over by one who calls himself The DREADFUL EYE and now she is a wanted alien. Taking on the form of a human woman on Earth she wants the tattoo artist to render her form visible to human eyes so that she becomes almost invisible to alien eyes.But tattooing Vanessa is not going to be an easy task, not while there is continuous battle to be done with the groups of invisible men who arrive on earth to bring her back.Despite his intentions the main character finds himself falling in love while on the run with the alien woman he tattoos, and when she is captured he finds his way to her planet to get her back, and to do battle with The Dreadful Eye who has his sights on conquering planet Earth next.With the help of Aleister Crowley, Sir William Crookes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, George Bernard Shaw, William Butler Yeats and others, the main character just might succeed. Set against the a backdrop of Victorian England and an alien planet, it's a fight to the finish for Vanessa...and for Earth.I really enjoyed this book, it is definitely Science Fiction but the author has a lot of real places woven into the story, places in London England. MacIntyre's writing is smooth and perhaps the biggest surprise was that this book is pretty funny in some places. It's suspense and Sci-Fi mixed with a good dose of bitingly funny English humor. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Woman Between the Worlds","review":"This book is based upon a wonderful premise, but is ultimately spoiled by the author's inaccurate characterizations.While I agree that it *is* tempting to place historical characters in fictional setting, the author needs to do more homework on the characters themselves, particularly the timelines of their lives in the context of the stories therein.This pertains particularly to the members of the Order of the Golden Dawn who appear as characters in this book, Crowley in particular. While I enjoyed the author's characterization of Aleister Crowley in this novel, the Crowley he describes is one at least a decade older than the 1898-1899 Victorian setting of the novel, and some of the incidents, mottos and names recounted by the Crowley character didn't take place for 15-20 years after the novel's setting. As a student of Magick for more than a quarter-century, I must take exception with these incongruities, for they ultimately ruined for me the otherwise exquisite storytelling experience presented by Mr. McIntyre herein.Mr. Crowley has been much better fictionalized elsewhere (not least by some few of his biographers, unfortunately). The other members of the Golden Dawn do not figure as heavily in the book's plot, and are less characterized, and therefore are not as obviously temporally incongruent, but they too seem to have temporal character inconsistancies.

Lansky is deeply involved with the Casino at the Capri Hotel, having made deals with many of the employees, inspectors, and supervisors. Now, during the World Series between the New York Yankees and the Milwaukee Braves, he also expects to rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars in bets on the games. A motley group of locals, working for Elias Naguib, a businessman with ties to New York mob boss Joe Bonanno, has been planning a &quot;fool-proof&quot; robbery of Lansky's take, but ironically, the death of Pope Pius XII and the early closing of the casinos &quot;out of respect&quot; on the last night of the World Series changes the timing of the heist, and a bloody mess results.Tawdry Havana with all its neon tackiness and grubby glamour comes alive here. Corrupt politicians, paid-off police, and mobsters control businesses ranging from prostitution and abortion to the international sugar, jewelry, gaming, and spare auto parts industries. Massive collusion leaves the average citizen powerless to control his own destiny, as Latour recreates the atmosphere which propels Fidel Castro to power a few months after the novel concludes. By alternating Lansky's activities with the play-by-play of each of the six World Series games, the author creates a sense of credibility and realism, and as the bodies pile up, the internecine rivalry among New York mob families adds external complications to the complex internal struggles for influence in Havana.Latour is an extremely precise, controlled writer who has plotted his novel to the last microdetail, leaving no loose ends, and the novel moves along smartly, despite its complexity. Developing drama and suspense through his careful selection of details and his ability to create a milieu by amassing specifics and piling them upon each other, he allows himself no forays into romantic description or heart-tugging literary pictures. What you &quot;see&quot; here of Havana appears to be presented with almost journalistic impartiality. Complex and exciting in its plotting and fully detailed in its depiction of 1958 Havana, this is a fine novel, bold and masculine in its presentation and full of the violence and uncertainty which presaged Castro's arrival into Havana. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Havana World Series","review":"In the early 1950's, Cuban President Fulgencio Batista, in an attempt to bolster Cuban economy and draw American tourists, invited successful crime bosses to upgrade and oversee the gambling operations in Havana. Meyer Lansky was able to oversee construction and development of several major hotel/casinos and had a friendly working relationship with the government. This book takes place in 1958, just as the World Series between the Yankees and the Milwaukee Braves, is beginning. Betting on the outcome is in full swing, and we meet a gang of small-time Cuban ex-cons who are planning a heist of the take from the Capri Casino, one of Lansky's operations.The first part of the book details the careful set-up and execution of the robbery. Of course, a couple of things go wrong, and follow-up plans undergo a huge revision. The rest of the book describes the efforts of the local police, the mob, and the thieves to straighten out the mess and escape with some dignity intact. This is ironic, since there is not a single honest character in the entire story.I found this book to be quite entertaining. Although the book contains some detailed baseball play-by-plays, you don't need to be a baseball fan to follow the action. The real story occurs around this event. It would have been helpful to have a \\"cast of characters\\" list in the book. Many of the men have nicknames, and it was a bit confusing to keep them straight. But the time period and setting seemed authentic, including the rumble of revolution in the background. The reader has an advantage over the characters, because we know what happened in Cuba a short time later. The author uses real mob bosses such as Joe Bonanno and Joseph Profaci, in addition to Lansky to lend authenticity to the story (which is completely fictional). As in most \\"caper\\" novels, the reader tends to root for the crooks, even knowing they are acting outside of the law. I suppose that's what makes them so much fun. This book does not disappoint, and the conclusion seems satisfying for all involved."},{"Title":"Havana World Series","review":"Jose Latour's new novel, &quot;Havana World Series,&quot; tells the story of a gang of Cuban toughs who knock off Meyer Lansky's Casino de Capri. As background for the heist: the 1958 World Series, playing everywhere on radios and tv, while plots are perfected. And in the hills Castro gets closer and closer. This is fascinating stuff, and in many ways serves as a satisfying expansion on the \\"Cuban\\" parts of Godfather II.Latour knows the people, and the times. Dialogue and description blend seamlessly and accurately in prose that is Hemingwayesque in its leaness and precision. Historical figures, such as Lansky and Joe Bonanno, are believably lethal. Fictional characters, such as ringleader Mariano \\"Ox\\" Contreras, are just as believable (and lethal). Cuba was a tough place in 1958, where money and death could be made or found, depending on the breaks and maybe your brains. Honor, deception, sex, violence, baseball, torture, and revolution, it's all here. Good general comparisons (dialogue, description, intricate plotting) could probably be found in George Higgins' \\"The Friends of Eddie Coyle,\\" or his \\"Outlaws.\\" That said, \\"Havana World Series\\" nevertheless stakes out its own impressive turf in the upper reaches of crime fiction, and on its own terms. A classic."},{"Title":"Havana World Series","review":"The Cuban-born Latour writes better in his second language of English than most other writers for whom English is their first and only tongue. This suspenseful, spellbinding novel is set in Havana in the Fall of 1958, when the Yankees-Braves World Series was under way, and centers around the planning and attempted execution of a heist of money from the safe of a casino run by Meyer Lansky. Lansky and other real-life mobsters are characters, as are various hoodlums and police officials. The Revolution is brewing as well, of course. This is an intelligent, flawlessly written work that comes along only too rarely.

While there are clearly many changes to the campus since I was there, many other things remain the same today: the faculty, students, and parents invest a lot into the students' successes; and the high expectation brings out many good and some bad consequences.Hume weaves together stories that follow selected Whitney faculty and students. The book focuses on the more interesting aspect of the Whitney experience by condensing away the quiet mundance daily routines. While this has the effect of making the stories more dramatic than in real life, the description of the highs, lows, and the quirky moments captures the essence that underly the lives of the people that make up this 1100-student school.At times, Hume ties the Whitney story with more general commentary on the state of the education system. Still, the book should be read more as documentary stories than as a study into what consitutes a good academic system."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"I care about education, and this book is a must. It tells the amazing story of an outstanding high school that has been built by a group of people who know that kids can learn and excel. It tells you how it happens, and especially how the teachers function. This ranshackle school makes everything happen, and while a lot of the students are under terrible pressure to succeed, they teach you the lessons we need to know about ambition and its costs. It's a wonderful read, too."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"I attended the \\"School of Dreams\\" and I loved this touching and insightful book. The author got it right. No one is talking about success in public schools these days. And by anyone's definition, Whitney High School, the setting for School of Dreams, is a great success and an example of public education at its best. Sure, the students are stressed and pressured and some of our parents are too ambitious for us. Sometimes we focus too much on grades and test scores instead of real learning. Some of the students are very resentful and negative as a result, but most want to be there. I would never have chosen to attend high school anywhere else. This book really tells the truth about our teachers, the school, and the students, and includes both the positives and the negatives so readers can judge fro themselves if Whitney provides a valid model for improving schools everywhere. Parents of high achieving students especially should read this book so you really know what we go through."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"As a typical concerning parent, how will the kids succeed in classroom and ultimately in the real world are always being debated. There's no right or wrong answer, nor one path that fits all kids. This book, regardless of the attacks by the alums of Whitney High for its details and angles, is a good read for parents who want to know (or get confirmation) that how much pressure it can get for a competitive high school student preparing for college.My only question after reading the book: is it worth trading this crazy life style for lost childhood? That depends on the kid him/herself. Smart kids who hit the books will do really well in above average high schools regardless. There are plenty of examples of college grads from elite schools can't get a job, and high school drop outs make millions. It's not worth the grinding to shave a year off college (and lose that extra college life experience), and definitely wrong for parents pushing kids for the sake of his and her ego.But if my kids like that environment and can past the test, I have no problem sending them to the school."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"i sincerely enjoyed reading about my alma mater. i know that there are many arguments about the content of the book not being enough to completely show the world how whitney high really is, but i just appreciate the fact that i have something that can help me look back on what i went through. i believe that many students go through their six years at whs feeling like no one notices them, especially not their parents. many feel like they're just walking grades, but with the little insight this book gives i think it could help bridge the gap between students and their parents. reading about the teachers made me remember that they are people too and that they are not there to make the kids' lives hell but instead are there dedicating their lives to make the school work. sure, the students are exceptional in the academic department to begin with, but who prepares them for the rigorous work of college and of the real world? its motivators that help people hold enough enthusiasm to move forward.i know about the many flaws of whitney high and i've spent enough time during high school complaining about them, but after reading this book i felt a bit humbled. i was lucky to be in whs and i'm proud to have humes' book in my collection."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"... The novel is well written and provides and in depth look at one of the most intruiging and successful academic institutions in America today. Mr. Humes is not aiming so much to provide a review of Whitney High School but more to allow the American public to see what goes on inside of this school. I found the novel to be both interesting and informative. It is true that it would be difficult to duplicate a school such as Whitney what with the given demographics, yet ideally race should not be the factor that Whitney's success should be attributed to. What makes Whitney special is the motivation and drive that the students have and that is what Humes tried to capture in the novel. I strongly recommend School of Dreams to all."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"I found this book fascinating!

The author includes student essays, sound bites on classroom curiculum, background information on how the school was started, and so much more!This book is a must read for every administrator, teacher, and parent who is concerned about the academic success of their children."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"I can't vouch for the accuracy of this book, but it was certainly an eye-opener. The only drawback was how angry I got that a quality education like the one Whitney offered was available to so few.Hume does a great job of sketching about half a dozen students in depth, and others in slightly less depth. There are stressed students, laid back students, supremely organized students, students in serious trouble, and many who fall in between. We learn of the sacrifices required to keep up in classes; many of these teenagers are carrying a workload that would make a regular working adult blanch. We also meet several memorable teachers, one of whom boldly decides to try working without a net. He allows his students to develop an experiment on their own for the entire semester, then test it before judges. The results are somewhat unexpected.Another section deals with Neil Bush's (George W's brother) visit to the school, and his failure to get the students enthusiastic about his new program. Reading this book, it is hard to tell if the students or parents put the most pressure on the kids, but clearly it's a certain personality style that flourishes at Whitney. The students' informing Bush that subjects should be rigorously pursued to his bafflement is priceless.The only problem came when the author swerved away from describing the students and teachers at the school, and began giving background on how Whitney came to be. That was the weakest section.Luckily, the focus switched back to the students. While it is true that many seemed somewhat stressed, so too are students at less rigorous schools, and when it crosses the line should be decided on a case by case basis. Are teens really happier with a flourishing social life and less academic rigor? I think it depends on the teen."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"This is an important and beautifully-written book about the state of education today -- and I like that it focuses on a school that actually works.

He sat in on classes, talked with students, their teachers and the administrators. He provides a fairly comprehensive and unbiased view from all sides within the school.In Part II, \\"Cow Towns and College Boards,\\" Hume spends about 50 pages on the history of American education, Cerritos (the area near LA where the book is set), the history of the high school and the resistance to its creation. It's an ideal section for current and future administrators to focus on.He discusses reforms that do (requiring parental involvement) and don't work (hiring thousands of new teachers). He also spends a couple of chapters on standardized testing and its evils (which is a little ironic, as the school's reputation was created and cemented by its students' test taking proficiencies). He describes the fraud of Bush's \\"Texas Miracle\\": Texas lowered the passing scores, doubled the amount of special ed cases (they don't have to take the test), more than doubled their drop-out rate (those kids would have presumably failed), and made the test easier.The book also illustrates other school problems, wonderful teachers, great ways to learn and hard-working students. It describes the successes and failures in education with amazing clarity."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"I graduated from WHS in 1998, and I have to admit that this book was laughably inaccurate. This high school is nothing more than a way for the ABC Unified School District to make itself look good. They hand-pick students and put them into this high school, not realizing that they're actually doing students a disservice.First off, students at WHS are nothing like what the author describes. I had a 3.9 GPA in high school and I got a full night's sleep every night, I never drank tons of coffee, and I never injested caffeine pills. Nor did I know anyone who did these things. Students played sports, watched TV, hung out with friends, and did everything that normal adolescents do. One things that was extremely obvious was the way in which everyone hung out with their own little clique and never deviated from their own circle of friends. Everyone knew who the &quot;cool&quot; kids were, and they didn't consort with the &quot;dorky&quot; ones. Also, we didn't consider ourselves failures if we didn't get into Harvard/Yale/MIT. Only three or four WHS students per year go to these kinds of colleges. Most of us end up at Berkeley or UCLA. It wasn't until I talked to my old high school classmates during college that I realized that I wasn't the only one who secretly counted the days until I could leave Whitney. Everyone I spoked with, including our class president, admitted that they hated that school.The only thing that makes Whitney different is that all classes at that school are either Honors or Advanced Placement courses. That's it. Those who take these classes at a &quot;normal&quot; high school are getting the exact same education. There's also nothing particularly special about the faculty. For the most part, they're all normal teachers. Some of them are downright incompetent.Once you leave the city limits of Cerritos, NOBODY cares that you went to Whitney. For all those students that are buying/reading this book hoping that they'll gain some insight on how to get into the school, I say don't waste your time. Your time is better spent watching TV, going to a movie, or hanging out with your friends. No matter what your parents tell you, your life is not over if you don't make it to Whitney. People from the other high schools in the district also do well on the SATs, make it into Ivy League schools, and go on to lead successful and happy lives.. If Whitney doesn't accept you, the only door that will be closed to you in life is the door to Whitney."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"I am disturbed by some of the reviews here. It is clear to me that reading comprehension is a serious problem -- even for some Whitney alumni.If you're looking for definitive answers you won't find them in this book. However, a critical analysis and a little creativity and guts can use the Whitney experience as presented by Humes to improve any school.If you're so blindly a devout republican who cannot stand any criticism of someone named Bush, then you'll miss the important lesson in the Neil Bush episode. Obviously, Hume did not take the reader by the hand to explain it. Perhaps he gives his readers more credit than some deserve.The book is wonderful. If you're interested in improving education in general, or just for your own children, School of Dreams will give you clues and tools to help you help yourself... but no master plan... no step-by-step.Imagine that -- Humes has given us a book that presents the material like a good teacher."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"There are more and more books coming out each year that try and uncover what it means to be a public high school student today. Edward Humes does this beautifully, but he takes a different route. He goes into the heart of one of the nation's top schools, Whitney High, located in Cerritos, California. This is not your typical school. Whites are among the minority, and Asian-Americans make up for over 70 percent of the students. There is an admissions process. Unheard of, at least by me, until I read this book. Every student is expected to not only go to college, but to a top college. Where drop-out rates, drugs, and sex are running high in many of the schools in the country, Whitney doesn't have this problem.The problem is pressure. Not the pressure to keep passing grades. Not to date the right guy. Not to win the state championship in football. But, the pressure to succeed. Parents, teachers, and students are driven by this force. Humes uncovers something that is almost unheard in America: a sound educational system.Not that Whitney doesn't have some of the same problems that face other schools in the country, they just deal with them better. They put education back where it belongs. The top spot on the students' priority lists.Humes also deals with issues that plague the country. Should we take standardized tests as the only way to know how well a school is doing? Shouldn't we be looking at what students learn inside of classrooms? Should schools follow the route of Whitney, forcing students to succeed? All questions that education policy-makers should be asking.Humes reports what life is like in a community where its members are driven to succeed. This is a must-read for anyone interested in making education in America a top priority."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"This is basically sensationalism. Everything that's scandalous about Whitney is exaggerated to the Nth degree, leaving the less eccentric voices unheard and in the dust. As a former Whitney student, I can say that not all Whitney parent are abominable Nazis who encourage their children to cheat in order to get ahead. My own mother told me she'd rather see me get an F than cheat. Yet Mr. Humes makes these broad generalizations that make the reader want to slap these parents upside the head. How can the reader expect to get the total picture when there are so many gaping holes in it?"},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"From a purely literary point of view I didn't find the book to be overly engaging, but it was interesting. It just wasn't a real page-turner; I imagine it wasn't really meant to be one of those types of books. However, I am the father of one of those very bright kids who attends Whitney High School in Cerritos, California. This will be her first year as she is entering as a 7th grader (she took 1 of only 10 spots available to non-ABC School District kids and her best friend took one of the other ones). I can't say whether she will find it very difficult or easy, but from a parental point of view I don't see myself as one of those described in the book who absolutely obsess on her academics. Do I have high expectations of her? Absolutely, as any parent should of their child. Does she meet them? Yes, but she does find it challenging which is what a parent should do: challenge and nurture their child. She has a social life. She's not spoiled. I also encourage her to broaden her horizons and see education for what it is: a tool for opening up doors. However, I tell her to learn for the sake of scholarly pursuits and self-enrichment; everything else falls into place. Believe me...it does. There is no secret to a great education for children. What everybody seems to miss is that if a child does not graduate or cannot read upon graduation, the majority of the blame should go on the parents. Yes, the parents and not so much on the school. If you, as a parent, are so disconnected from your child that you can't see how poorly they're performing academically, then it's the result of extremely bad parenting skills. Ultimately, it is the parents' responsibility to see that a young and impressionable mind is molded into a fine young adult. Too many parents shuffle that off onto the schools, or the politicians, or church. Parents expect their kids to grow up; perhaps if more parents grew up first they wouldn't be shocked when Susie comes home pregnant or Johnny is arrested for home invasion. If there is any secret it's good parenting. The schools can only do so much. Whitney is a great school and it is but one of a great many wonderful schools across the country. However, the greatest school in the world isn't going to be worth much if we as parents and a community don't do the heavy lifting. All else are details."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"\\"Success is ignored while failure is funded,\\" is the astute observation of one of the long-time teachers from Whitney High School in Cerritos, the number one public college-preparatory school in the state. The author of School of Dreams, Edward Humes, spent a year at Whitney as the Instructor of an essay-writing workshop. He was there to help the students skillfully sculpt the influential personal essay that would be the last piece of the college admissions puzzle. During this time he experienced the world of Whitney, with its high achievements, quirky structure, and determination to be a model of a successful school. Within this adventure the author introduces us to a variety of students, with some of the student's writings punctuating the chapters. The information in this book is presented in a narrative style, telling stories about individual students, teachers, administrators, as well as the history of the school itself. Within the chronicling of this academic magnet school, several requisite factors required to make a school successful is challenged. Part of the success of Whitney may be do to the fact that only those students with adequate scores on standardized tests are allowed to enter the school, that these students are motivated by parents with hefty dreams for them, and that this high school contains small classes that begin in the seventh grade. There are other aspects of Whitney that fly in the face of political reform, such as the need for large school budgets, technological advancements in the classroom, and standardized tests to keep teachers accountable. In some ways these reforms, intenting to raise the achievements of failing schools, are not found to be aspects that make Whitney the successful school that it is. I found exciting insight and revealing truths found in the presentation of one of the most successful public schools in the country. There are many aspects that will cause one to ponder and rethink how to approach education in the future because of the successful past of this school."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"School of Dreams. Edward Humes. New York: Harcourt, Inc., 2003. 362 pages.The United States of America was declared its own country on July 4th 1776. Since then America has grown to be the fourth largest country in the world as well as one of the richest - these things combined with our military prowess have molded the United States into a world \\"super\\" power. However, these positive constants may soon vary, and end if a daunting problem with our everyday American lives is not addressed, our public schooling. According to many political \\"informatives\\" our national Grade Point Average and therefore our test scores (SAT, ACT, etc.) are faltering, meaning that the United States will begin \\"producing\\" inferior and ineffective children. Edward Humes, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, has compiled much on this topic: all of which he discusses in his new book School of Dreams.Humes gets to this information in a very round-a-bout way - through his study on America's third best public school, Whitney [located in Cerritos, California; just outside of Los Angeles]. At the beginning of the book Humes starts with no promises, but very good writing, including some that's not his, but written by actual Whitney students which just begins to showcase their talent. Throughout the book Humes describes the constant struggle that the kids who attend Whitney have - a major problem being sleep deprivation and overbearing parents, some of whom have moved from Asian countries in order for their kids to attend Whitney for six years (7-12 grade). This pressure on the kids is amplified by the fact that in order to attend students need to pass a screening test supplied by the state; even with the test there is a long waiting list for kids who want to enter Whitney and can't because the classes are all already full at this rather small school.The main focus of the text seems mostly to inform the readers about a spectacular American school that actually works. However, very rarely does Humes relate Whitney to more ordinary schools, instead he compares it to other over-achieving schools within the United States. This gives me a very fuzzy picture of just how low our schools performance can go because the subject is only briefly touched; as well as no picture at all as to how the United States really compares with other countries in the educational \\"front\\" - which appeared to be one of the major concerns. Humes does paint one interesting picture though. He states that although our government continues to insist our public school system falls well below \\"our old standards\\" that isn't true. For that matter those so-called \\"standards of old\\" stem from a golden age in our countries history that never actually happened. Thus explaining why politicians interfere with schools, saying they're attempting to better them. After their interference those politicians like to gauge how successful they were with bogus tests like the SAT, which the students at Whitney excel at, but find ridiculous.Overall School of Dreams is a very good read with much research put into almost all aspects. I believe that if its main purpose is not accomplished then at least the book does fulfil other purposes; for example if your child was to read this than they would likely complain much less about \\"all the homework\\" they have to do since it pales in comparison to Whitney. The most important message I drew from the book was in one of the quotes:\\"Four is the magic number:Four hours sleep,Four caf&eacute; lattes, and [therefore]4.0 [GPA]\\"Today that's what a good school is all about, and going to school with this as a motto will definitely help you to succeed - however, that's saying nothing about your health. And is that really such a good thing? Edward Humes has several clear-cut thoughts on that in his book, School of Dreams. If you're wandering what they are, I recommend you read this most excellent piece of journalism."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"As soon as the book demonstrated that the students are chosen by an admission test, anyone who knows anything about REAL public education should have thrown this book away. It gives a good account of the stresses of high-achieving students, but to use this school as a model for public education is ludicrous. Any school that admitted only these students would seem successful. That's called a PRIVATE school. If other public schools could choose whom to admit, I guarantee their absenteeism, discipline problems, and low test scores would disappear."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"...but, can a 400-page book cover everything about the life of one high school?

Ed Humes did very well in covering the Whitney life in those 400 pages, and I speak as a 1995 Whitney alum.There were a few great teachers I can note of that the book did not touch, but then again, you cannot cover all of them, and certainly not in 400 pages! I sure hope Ed Humes didn't get limited by the publisher because I am 100% sure he wanted more pages. But then, it wouldn't be a book that is for mass consumption. If you are looking for a more in-depth look about how Whitney came to be where it is now, don't buy this book. You'll be disappointed.Ed gave a fair overview of Whitney...not every high school can match Whitney's philosophy but you can try. I do have a valid question about covering only one academic year because the Whitney life he described was not the same when I was there. I know he can't cover every year...but he would have covered some, if the alumni were available for him to interview.I never drank coffee or spent college student-like all nighters @ Whitney and I'm not one of the high-achievers of Whitneyites who wanted to HYP. Still, I was one of those who felt the extremely driven pace of Whitney education, just like what Ed Humes described.Something Ed shared is parental involvement, which is one of the keys of Whitney's success. My dad gave up some of his computers to Whitney after I went into college before the school was able to get far better equipment a few years later.Broad generalizations may be seen by some readers but I rarely see it here. Kind of surprised that Mr. Smilde was not mentioned but well, I'd guess that is left up to the 2nd edition if there is one. Maybe he'll interview more of those who have gone through the vaunted &quot;false walls&quot; of Whitney in years past."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"As a fan of Jonathon Kozol's early books about the American education system, Death at an Early Age, and the landmark Savage Inequalities, I looked forward to reading this book which showed the flip side of public schools--a high achieving school whose students were &quot;making it.&quot; Anecdotally, the book holds up, with interesting tales of young artists whose parents thwart their talents, a kid tangled in crystal meth, etc. But like another reviewer has stated, an underlying message seems to be wanting.For example, Humes states at one point that the school is very diverse, but with roughly 80% of the student body being Asian, and no black students being mentioned in the stories, it's really hard to get a sense of what that so-called diversity means. And then there's the issue of the introduction of technology into Whitney as a gift from Neil Bush's corporate campaign. Humes could have been explicit in asking why a student body with the highest test scores in the nation is more deserving of computers in the classroom than those kids who could use a leg up, but he doesn't. What would have made this book more powerful is to have seen the other side--those kids who didn't get to go to Whitney, and how their lives were or were not impacted by that decision.Still, it's an interesting look at how teachers have adapted to changing times, and with some worthy lesson plans, makes for a decent read."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"If you're interested in this book, you are, like me, probably an alumnus of WHS. Who else would want to read this book anyhow? It's not like the success of WHS can be easily duplicated in other places. There's not many places where you can have a small public school in a highly Asian demographic community with a restrictive admissions test that almost certainly guarantees a self-selecting and self-motivated student body that will excel academically. And for this reason, it's no surprise that WHS crushes all other public schools as far as standardized testing goes.And for this same reason, it's silly of the author, Edward Humes, to posit that the critics of public schools have it all wrong because WHS is proof of a public school that succeeds. You see, underlying his narrative is his thesis that WHS is proof that an under-funded, under-staffed public school with lousy facilities can nevertheless succeed. His proofs, of course, are the dazzling statistics WHS produces in terms of SAT scores, standardized tests, etc.This is rather simplistic because anyone with common sense would attribute the school's academic prowess to its self-selective and highly unusual demographic composition. I would give Humes more credit if he had the guts to admit the following: that the teachers don't really matter at WHS. Indeed, some of us would even assert that WHS students excel in spite of poor teachers. But this is a harsh thing to say and Humes has neither the insight nor the guts (nor the ability) to present it.As WHS alumni know, the self-motivated kids at WHS exceed not because of standards imposed by their teachers, but because of standards imposed by their peers/predecessors/parents. Of course, there are notable exceptions. But Humes (largely) ignores the most exceptional WHS teachers (and there are only a handful). Instead, he wastes time describing the current principal as being a huge factor of WHS's success. Really? The truth is, any WHS principal has the easiest public school job in America. Just sit back, ride the students' coattails and take credit for their achievements. This is what all the previous principals did, all of whom enjoyed terms where WHS was the #1 school in CA, and none of whom were responsible for it.To Mr. Humes credit, he does devote some attention to Mr. B, the U.S. history teacher, who is indeed one of WHS's few faculty gems. But this kind of treatment is sparse. How could there be no mention of the fabulous Mr. S, another history teacher and one of WHS's noteworthy faculty members?If Mr. Humes were intellectually critical and honest, he would also give us vignettes of some of the really lousy faculty members at WHS. It seemed like as a courtesy he just ignored those facets of the faculty completely.Another weakness of his book is that he focuses on one school year: 2001-02. I understand why he does that in terms of having a coherent narrative, but by focusing on just one year, and skipping over WHS's history (he devotes a few superficial pages to it but nothing substantive), he fails to raise and explore these issues:How has the parental/peer pressure to succeed academically affected alumni later on in their lives?How do WHS students perform in college, where success comes more from creative and original thought as opposed to rote memorization?Have WHS alumni over the past 20 or 30 years done anything remarkable or exceptional? Or have we just churned out a number of doctors, lawyers, and businessmen who have taken a safe, pre-packaged road to success?These are difficult questions, and Humes has no position, no ability, no insight, and no way to answer these. So he eschewed the more complex issues and wrote an easy book filled with easy answers. I don't blame him for this. Neither do I commend him for it.Finally, Humes has this obsession with taking cheap shots at the Bush family that manifests itself throughout the book. It's seriously annoying and his obsessiveness makes him an even less credible author."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"It was a special opportunity to read a book about something so close to my heart. It's been more than a decade since I wandered sleepily through the halls of Whitney High School, but through Hume's honest portrayal it's as though I never left. Memories of feeling \\"never good enough\\" came hurtling back only to be replaced with the gratifying realization that like me, the kids in the book will soon find it's what they learn in the proverbial classroom of life that truly matters. Whitney gets you to college, you get you through life. I urge parents who view Whitney as the Holy Grail to read this book carefully and then read everything in quotation marks again. These are the voices of your children. These were the words in my head that never found a voice...until now."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"Not far into David Hume's acclaimed book about the life inside one of America's most pressure-packed public schools, the author quotes a teacher who sums up high school life succinctly. Schools are like organisms, the teacher said, because you never can identify exactly how and what makes them go. For those who claim to carry the quick fixes to an education system said to have been broken off and on for the last 50 years, take that advice.And just when you think you have all the answers, read Hume's book about Whitney High School.Using a formula of high expectations, partental involvement and a selective admissions process, Whitney has built one of the jewels of the California educational system with about 95 percent of the students college bound and SAT scores to drool over.But before principals nationwide begin to copy the forumla, Hume illustrates the neagative variables to such success. This school has been built on the backs of automatons who begin their quest for the HYP (Harvard, Yale, Princeton) track as early as third grade. Hume characterizes life at Whitney as a six-year experiment in nerves. Like the physics projects illustrated in the book, some students are one Alka-Seltzer short of an emotional explosion. AP classes and numerous extra-curriculars are means to the HYP end, not necessarily instrinsic desires to gain knowledge and life experience.While Hume's portrayal represents a microcosm of Whitney, it reveals the predicament high-stakes plays in the educational accountability movement. Success is not in the subjective and personal nature of knowledge, but the impersonal (hence the faceless student on the cover of Hume's book and pictureless inside) ranking on standardized tests.While Whitney may be at the top, others school continually try to knock it off, using the same twisted reason a Whitney junior spends $1,000 to increase his SAT score to 1560 then decides to retake it again -- \\"You can never have too high a score.\\"I believe in high expectations and no excuses for schools and students, but I am wary of a federal system trying to devise a formula to improve the education of tens of millions of children controlled by tens of millions of variables. When you try to control the beast, the beast ultimately ends of controlling you. Whitney students are perfect examples.However, if Hume's book shows anything, it is that not just parental involvement is key to educational success, but local (not state or federal) control is vital to the success of any school. For whatever negative side effects, Whitney's formula works well for them. It is up to other schools to create their own."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"This is an important, readable and incredibly well-balanced book that really brings us into the lives of students and teachers at Whitney High. You can tell that Humes cares for this school, its earnest and impressive students, and its hardworking teachers. What's most impressive about this book is that it makes an extremely balanced assessment of not just Whitney High but the entire history of and debate about the meaning and possibility of public education in the U.S., while telling an engaging story filled with sensitively drawn characters. Every educator, school administrator and concerned parent should read this book.As for the sensationalism that some readers detect, of course the book won't be representative of every single person who goes to Whitney. But it captures the contradictions inherent in the culture of high achievers, when getting the grades becomes more important than the substance of learning. Anyone who recently attended a top college (especially those who came to that college from a low-achieving public school, as I did) will recognize these students and their uber-competitive culture of studying. These are the kinds of issues that we should all be thinking about and discussing as a country."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"If you read one book about education in the New Year, make it School of Dreams, the story of a school that works, teachers who inspire, and kids who give us hope for the future. Whitney High was a public school with no money and run-down facilities that remade itself at the grass roots level into the top school in California and one of the best in the USA. But Humes gives us more than the story of a public school that works. He writes intimately of the lives of high-achieving students, the pressures they face (and are subjected to by parents) and the sometimes overwhelming temptations to cheat or cut corners they struggle with in a test-obsessed culture more interested in grades and scores than in the best possible learning experiences. A must-read for parents and teachers who wonder where are schools are headed... and where they could be."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"This terrific book about a high performing public high school in California is one you won't be able to put down. It reads like a novel, with nuggets of wisdom and insightful observations on what truly goes into achieving an exceptional public high school. This is not an uncritical look. The pushy parents and students who would rather cheat than risk a grade below \\"A\\" are rampant. But the message of success is clear -- excellent teachers, a supportive environment where all students are known, high expectations planted before puberty kicks in, and focus on an indepth, academmically challenging curriculum, rather than test scores, is the ticket. Most refreshing is the total absence of educational & bureaucratic jargon. School of Dreams is a must-read for anyone who cares about what is going on in public education today. Kudos to Edward Humes for this breakthrough book."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"I'll start with a disclaimer. I'm a Whitney alum, so let's get a few inaccuracies and omissions out of the way. First, the big orange lockers were not part of the original d&eacute;cor; they were installed in the late 1980s, a vast improvement over the old one foot by one foot sorry excuses for lockers. Second, despite not having a gym way back then, Whitney still offered an impressive array of varsity sports, including basketball, tennis, and water polo. And third, unless the food in the Hutch has gone completely downhill over the past decade, it was never *that* bad.That said, as a scholar, I think Hume has written a good ethnography within a solid historical context. I have no doubt that if he'd spent a few more years on the campus, the picture he paints would be even more revealing, simply because he would have been able to share even more insight from a wider variety of people. (Perhaps this volume would then include interviews with my favorite teachers who are still teaching at Whitney, Mrs. Breik, Mrs. Kesinger, and Mrs. El Moussa, and maybe even a few in-depth portraits of students that were more like me!) In all honesty, however, I can't imagine the average reader wanting to read much more than the existing 400 pages.From an educator's point of view, here's what I think this volume has to offer to K-12 teachers and administrators:1) Get parents involved. Parents have a vested interest in their children's achievement. Take advantage of their natural enthusiasm; the next time you run into obstacles with the school board, get your parents to attend a board meeting.2) Believe in your students. It doesn't matter if you enroll your students through an admissions test or they came straight off the streets. If you believe in them, they will succeed.3) Use technology wisely. Computers are not a cure-all. In fact, they can even be a hindrance. Don't let them displace a well-designed traditional curriculum. Use them only where they are relevant.Finally, as a parent, I find Hume's treatise to be a useful cautionary tale. Despite having attended Whitney not too long ago, I'd already forgotten much of what it was like, and this book brought it all back: the students' misguided focus on grades, the pressure cooker atmosphere during comps, etc. One parent's confession was especially poignant - she didn't know what it was like because her daughter never said anything to her. I want to teach my children to try their best but know how to have fun, and it's good to be reminded that what we don't say is just as important as what we do say."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"Humes details the turnaround of Whitney High in Cerritos, California, which went from the brink of extinction, where local schools dumped failing students, to becoming the number one school in California. This is an example of what can happen when schools set high expectations for their students. Although a public jr./sr. high school, students must take an admittance test to be enrolled at the school. Once enrolled, students are told that they must apply to at least 5 colleges, including at least one public and one private. Most of the students aim for Harvard, Yale or Princeton, due to parental pressure.As the parent of a high school student, I found this book to be very interesting."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"Edward Humes aspiring book, School of Dreams is an incredible story of a top achieving public high school. The book is a satisfying read and a page-turner. It gives you a window of what happens behind high school doors. As a student enrolled in a top achieving high school I found the experiences in this book both insightful and misleading. The different types of ways in which students made themselves stay up at night and do tons of homework shows how everyone strives to be on top. Whitney is a school that attracts families from all over the world because of its high reputation. Because of all the high standards, Whitney is considered mostly Asian. Whitney is not a high school that is preparing its students for college or the outside world and realities. It is a school that is all about scoring the highest on the college placement tests. It is a story of \`pushed' students often driven by parents to achieve excellence. School of Dreams is a story for someone who wants to know about a student's life underneath the skin at a top achieving high school. Also, to see what lengths teachers and parents put on their students to get into a top university. And to reveal what hardships parents put on their child psychologically, emotionally, and spiritually to earn that top grade."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"Edward Humes has written an engrossing and balanced book that is useful for anyone concerned with public education in America. The writing style, combining the author's first-hand experiences with those of the students and teachers, is compelling and very readable. I recommend it.But that's saying what the book is; I want to comment on what it is not, and was not supposed to be as far as I can tell. Some other reviewers seem to have missed the point. Some of the Whitney alumni express disappointment that the book does not completely mirror their experiences. I doubt if they were the target market of the book. Other, more detached people wished the book was an academic study that could be broadly applied without interpretation to other environments. That is certainly not true and I don't think the author hides that fact. Whitney is an exclusive school that creme skims the best students from the local area and draws other, would-be students from around the world. No secret there. But it still serves as an example, in the extreme, of the benefits and costs of what a great many educators think are the key features of success. The one example that comes up over and over again as a double-edged sword is involved parents. The kids at Whitney no doubt benefit greatly, in the narrow sense of that word, from parents that stress achievement and place that well above any other objective in their children's (and their own) lives. That this comes at a significant cost comes out clearly in the book. Similarly, the narrowness of students' world view is also laid bare, despite teachers' efforts to the ameliorate the situation.I read this book as a father who wants to encourage his daughters to succeed and to put aside ephemeral pleasures that might stand in the way of that success. At the same time, I have been very conscious of overdoing it, of creating an unbalanced environment for my children. The importance of getting this balancing act right was underscored by my reading of this book. I'm still working on it.That said, it is true that the book could have done a bit better, particularly in trying to relate what the reader can draw from the Whitney experience for the broader world. The authors attempts on this score in the Epilogue and the accompanying endnotes do not satisfy since he cannot control for the effect of those highly motivated Whitney parents. There simply isn't enough of this for my taste. There are remarkably few allusions in the book to what the academic literature has to say about education, and they appear without references. Still, there are lots of other books that one can consult on those topics. For me, this book works nicely at what it seeks to do."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"I found the information in this book disturbing, about students who did nothing but study, who rationalized away craming for tests only to forget mere moments after.

The author does not understand the essence of this high school and presents a highly skewed and flawed viewpoint.I might even go as far as to call it a muckraking book, but one with none of a muckrakers helpfulness.

I also agreed with one other reviewer who thought humes took way to many potshots at the bush family (and i would cut off my thumbs before voting for any of those lunatics).there were two refreshing parts; the example essays (any one of these students could be phenomenal journalists) and the accounts of Mr. Z's physic's experiments.overall, i would have enjoyed fewer students with more in-depth stories. but, i find myself asking, how do i get my kids into a school like this?"},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"I bought and read the book because I live in the area and wanted to get some more insight on one of the best high schools in America.

I have never even heard of some of the stuff that has happend. It starts out shallowly, going from student to student, giving odd glimpses into their world, but not enought grounding for any of it to make any sense. It also begins as, more or less, a biography of the school, and ends as an episode of some soap opera. Rather than asking questions and giving answers to questions that make a difference,he goes into student/ teacher problems, things that can happen in any school. I think that this book should have been more of an observation of the schools success, and how it achieved it,rather than a glimpes into teachers and students lives during the year.Also, I know for a fact that everyone, does drink coffee, and have every kind of music listening system at the school, but it isn't that important, still, half of the school population doesn't drink coffee, and the allowance of cd players and mp3 players makes student and faculty that much closer.But I do believe, although, Dr. Brock looks like he has an easy job, im sure he works, no matter what, he is a riot to talk to.and by the way, i think that the indian population (which is huge) was pretty much unrepresented, and many teachers were passed by dispite there creative ways of teaching."},{"Title":"School of Dreams: Making the Grade at a Top American High School","review":"This book was a chore to get through. There were some spots that were entertaining, but for the most part I found to be boring.And maybe because I went to a public school that was doing this kind of AP type stuff 30 years ago, and managed to do it without excluding anyone or needing entrance exams.. and still found time for those kids who maybe did not wish to go to college (and believe me, they did everything to try to talk you into going to college).. I was just not that impressed. Back then many of my teachers saw alot of this college prep stuff as a memorization game rather than true learning and said so. Anyone blessed with a good memory could play the system. This whole book to me had a pompous tone, and many of the students seem like little elites.

Really, it is just a book. It is based on one journalist's perception of Whitney. It is neither the answer to any of the problems with the education system, nor is it meant to be the step-by-step guide to create a school to crank out more high scoring test takers. It is merely a book.I disagree with many of the anecdotes in the book, like the other alumni. It is a disappointment that the majority of the BEST teachers were not mentioned in the book. Also, the book fails to highlight the extent of the self-motivation that powered most of Whitney's students.I, however, cannot blame Humes for leaving certain details out, for he is only one person, who wrote a skewed book about a skewed high school.

Middle Readers)","review":"No one becomes a children's librarian in the hopes of someday striking it rich. We all do it for our separate, twisted, obscure little reasons that probably have their roots somewhere in our youth. I did it partly because I realized that I wasn't cut out to be an archival librarian (the moment of inspiration came when my husband pointed out that I'd set my coffee cup down on my conservation textbook) and partly for two little words: readers advisory. I love recommending good books to good readers. I love recommending good books to bad readers. I love recommending good books period. And if I were to calculate the most frequently cited question I get on the children's room floor it might be, \\"My child loves the Laura Ingalls Wilder books. What else can you recommend?\\". Now until now my instinct was to grab \\"The Birchbark House\\" by Louise Erdrich and thrust it into the waiting patron's arms. Now, unfortunately, I have a choice to make. \\"The Birchbark House\\" is good, yes. But its sequel, \\"The Game of Silence\\" is even better. How can I go about not recommending the sequel before its predecessor? I can't. Just the same, \\"The Game of Silence\\" does not absolutely require that \\"The Birchbark House\\" be read in order to understand the following story. It stands on its own beautifully and it shouldn't be any wonder to anyone that it garnered itself the 2006 Scott O'Dell Award for historical fiction. It undoubtedly deserved it.Having survived the smallpox plague of 1847, Omakayas still mourns the loss of her little baby brother, but keeps her spirit strong. Good thing too. A band of raggedy homeless people have arrived in the girl's Ojibwe camp and her good tribe takes them in immediately. Amongst the people is a baby, its mother long gone, and the perfect remedy for the hole in Omakayas's family's heart. Word has reached the tribe that the white settlers are forcing all Native Americans to move farther west despite a treaty made years ago. To verify the truth behind this rumor and to see whether it was the whites who broke their word or the Natives, four men are sent from the camp to discover the truth. In the time that it takes the men to get back (the span of one year) we watch Omakayas's adventures and traditions. As time goes one, however, it becomes clear that change is imminent and that Omakayas must allow herself to go into the woods to seek the spirits that have given her so much knowledge in the past. What she sees may make all the difference in how she lives the rest of her life.Though I'd enjoyed \\"The Birchbark House\\" I was reluctant to read its sequel immediately. No matter how well read a children's librarian might be, it's very difficult to voluntarily read books in a genre that you yourself avoided like the plague as a child. In my case, historical fiction. I decided not to read this book simply because I'd read the first one and probably knew exactly what to expect with this sequel. Then it started appearing on all the Best Books of the Year lists. And then Roger Sutton (editor of Horn Book Magazine) started singing its praises to the skies. About the time people started murmuring the words \\"Newbery\\" and \\"Game of Silence\\" in the same breath I knew I had to give in and read it. Thank God for that. Having honed her skills already on everything from picture books to adult novels, Erdrich has sketched out a perfect tale. Characters grow and change and know one another better by the story's end.I've always had a weakness for Erdrich's pencil illustrations, thinking them as essential a complement to her stories as Garth Williams's were to the \\"Little House\\" books. In this story Erdrich uses them to their fullest effect. Pinch, Omakayas's mischievous little sprite of a brother, is rendered here in all his round spiky-haired cheerfulness. Though he annoys those he loves past all endurance, you're just as enamored of the little guy as his doting mother and frustrated (but amused) siblings. There was one picture in the batch that I found a mite bit confusing, of course. In the chapter \\"Fish Soup\\" we see a picture of Twilight (Omakayas's cousin) gutting a fish with her hair in two pigtails above her head. Oddly enough, she seems to be wearing a short-sleeved t-shirt of a particularly modern design. It's a cute little image but if the shirt isn't made of 100% cotton then Erdrich probably should have made that clearer. As it stands it seems like a very odd discrepancy in the midst of otherwise historically accurate pictures.In every novel there's an odd little moment here or a word there that strikes the reader as funny. For me it was the moment when Old Tallow, the warrior woman who hunts with a pack of trained dogs at her side, says that when she fell down a cliff she, \\"pitched ears over butt all the way to the bottom\\". Butt? Interesting word choice there. Still, it gets the message across. And for every little quirk in the tale there are three times as many small instances of writing perfection. As Old Tallow has a rotted finger chopped off and scalded closed (it sounds more violent than it actually plays out) Omakayas sees only a single tear fall from the woman's eye. Later, the girl, \\"wished she'd caught that tear. It was rare. Probably, it was the only tear Old Tallow had ever shed\\". Even better are sections that discuss Pinch's fish catching skills. Though his traps look like beavers' nests and his decoy the oddest shaped fish anyone has ever seen, time and again Pinch catches more fishies than anyone else. \\"The fish that Pinch carved was apparently the most delicious-looking fish in the world\\". In this way Erdrich weaves that ever necessary thread of loving humor into her books. You can be meaningful all day and bore children to tears or you can dot the text with funny and very real moments of childhood and end up with an even better book. Erdritch opts for the latter.Here's what I love about the stories of Omakayas. They're actually interesting to kids. There are great snowball fights, snow houses, contests, and examples of kids playing in realistic ways. At the same time they're historically accurate and though they never downplay the horror of colonization, neither do they wallow in misery and woe. These books show characters proud of their ancestry who are precious to their readers because they seem so very real. People complain all the time about how depressing good books are to kids sometimes (ala \\"The Bridge to Terebithia\\"). Fine. Let's have them all read \\"The Game of Silence\\" in school instead. You'd be hard pressed to find a book half as wise and a quarter as amusing. I could probably go on and on and on about it (which is a relief after reviewing some books that take all my energy to find words to describe) but I'll just leave you with the knowledge that this is undoubtedly one of the best books to come out in years and years. A bloody brilliant piece of work."},{"Title":"The Game of Silence (Ala Notable Children's Books. Middle Readers)","review":"When it comes to stories of the Ojibwe people, it seems to this reader/listener that Louise Erdich writes not only with her pen but also with her heart. A native of North Dakota, Erdrich is of German-American/Chippewa descent, and she is a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Ojibwe. Thus, her novel \\"The Birchbark House,\\" which introduced young Omakayas, glistened with insight and admiration for characters who lived in the 1850s.The same may be said of \\"The Game of Silence,\\" beautifully delivered by voice actress Anna Fields.Now, of course, Omakayas is older and she has learned a great deal as she goes about her days among her people, all following the shifting seasons. There have been changes: a sister has found someone to love, and Omakayas becomes aware that she possesses a unique gift - her dreams foretell the future.As the story opens, days are peaceful on a Lake Superior island. The people live in houses made of birchbark during the summer, then as the days grow cooler they prepare for harvest. When winter falls all will leave their birchbark houses for cedar cabins close to a town, LaPointe.However, the Ojibwe's serenity is interrupted by white men who want them to leave the island, want to push them away from the land they call home.Intended for young listeners, those in grades 5 through 8, \\"The Game of Silence\\" will not only offer them a wealth of historical detail but also a reminder of the beauty and bounty of nature.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Game of Silence (Ala Notable Children's Books. Middle Readers)","review":"Over the years, the focus of Louise Erdrich's writing has been her Indian heritage of the Upper Midwest. Her childhood was shaped by attending a Bureau of Indian Affairs school in North Dakota where her parents taught (mother was of French-Ojibwe descent and father was of German stock). Her early novels (\\"Love Medicine\\" --1984 and \\"Tracks\\" --1988) told stories of the Chippewa tribe in North Dakota before she wrote of her Ojibwe tribe in Minnesota in fiction (\\"The Antelope Wife\\" --1998) and in a travel memoir (\\"Books And Islands in Ojibwe Country -- 2003).Now she is writing a multi-volume children's epic of the history of her people as seen by through the eyes of Omakayas, a pre-teen Ojibwe girl growing up in the pre-Civil War Minnesota. The first book of the series, \\"The Birchbark House\\" (1999) explored the pre-Eden world (i.e. before the arrival of the white settlers) that was still dangerous, especially with the introduction of smallpox. Now the second novel, \\"The Game of Silence\\" continues that history with the coming encroachment of the American government.Not least among its charms is the expose to the Ojibwe ways/culture/mindset of a day long ago. The pencil drawings by the author give a visual image to a world that will not be familiar to most. The writing is simple but clear, driven by the story of an approaching doom that has yet to arrive. Teenagers and adults will enjoy this story and look forward to future installments of the adventures of Omakayas and her people."},{"Title":"The Game of Silence (Ala Notable Children's Books. Middle Readers)","review":"When Louise Erdrich's THE BIRCHBARK HOUSE was published in 1999, it was widely hailed as an alternative to the beloved \\"Little House\\" series, exploring roughly the same time period and same geographical area as that covered by Laura Ingalls Wilder's novels. Much like the \\"Little House\\" books, THE BIRCHBARK HOUSE documented the traditions, celebrations, joys, and sorrows of an ordinary family. In Erdrich's novel, though, this family is part of an Ojibwe community rather than a group of white pioneers.Readers who came to know Omakayas, the heroine of THE BIRCHBARK HOUSE, have been waiting a long time to find out what happens next to this vibrant, likeable character and her family. The good news is that the sequel, THE GAME OF SILENCE, is finally here, and it was definitely worth waiting for.THE GAME OF SILENCE opens with a dramatic scene that sets the theme of much of the rest of the novel. Omakayas's small community is shocked by the arrival of strangers, other native peoples who have been displaced by chimookomanag, or white people. Frightened, half-starved and angry, the survivors become part of Omakayas's life, and their harrowing stories instill fear and anxiety into everyone's hearts. Could they be the next to lose their homes? Erdrich writes, \\"They would all fear to lose something huge, something so important that they never even knew that they had it in the first place. Who questions the earth, the ground beneath your feet? They had always accepted it --- always here, always solid. That something was home.\\"Omakayas worries about her home, too. She loves her family and the land where they live. She thinks, \\"If they ever had to leave, ...her heart might fall right out of her body to lie forever on the ground it loved.\\" As the year wears on, though, Omakayas is troubled more and more by dreams, almost visions, that seem to ask her to do something she's not yet ready for. Can she ignore what seems to be her gift? Before the end of the novel, she must face her fears in order to lead her family on to the next chapter of their lives. Omakayas is still the sensitive, lively, sometimes impulsive girl of THE BIRCHBARK HOUSE, but in this novel she grows up quickly.Although there are some big themes explored in THE GAME OF SILENCE, Erdrich still enriches her novel with the small details of everyday life that also made THE BIRCHBARK HOUSE so compelling. Over the course of a year, the patterns of Omakayas's life play out --- harvesting rice, smoking fish, telling stories, sledding on the snow, preparing for a wedding. These ordinary tasks are described in loving detail, enabling readers to gain a fuller picture of a time, a place, and a way of life. In addition, Erdrich offers a comprehensive glossary of Ojibwe terms and dozens of lovely pencil illustrations of the characters and their natural surroundings.What emerges is a portrait of a family --- and a culture --- on the brink of change. Let's hope we don't have to wait as long again to discover what that change will mean for Omakayas and her people.--- Reviewed by Norah Piehl"},{"Title":"The Game of Silence (Ala Notable Children's Books. Middle Readers)","review":"The Game of Silence by Louise Erdrich (HarperCollins, 2005); Where the Great Hawk Flies by Liza Ketchum (Clarion Books/Houghton-Mifflin, 2005).Considering the depiction of Native Americans in books, so much has changed since I was the age of our twelve-year-old daughter.In several new books for young readers, the narrative vantage point has been very decisively shifted to place native characters in the point-of-view position, in the center of events instead of serving as \\"colorful\\" parts of the scenery. I've recently read aloud to our daughter Lillian two new young adult novels with Native American themes, Louise Erdrich's The Game of Silence (HarperCollins, 2005) and Liza Ketchum's Where the Great Hawk Flies (Clarion/Houghton-Mifflin, 2005).At about Lillian's age I read James Fenimore Cooper's The Last of the Mohicans, and I strongly recall the ache I felt in response to Cooper's elegiac, grandly romantic evocation of the \\"noble\\" Chingachgook, who appeared to be in Cooper's view inseparable from the strange and sublime new American landscape. As an outdoorsy suburban Boy Scout, I couldn't help but see woodsman and trapper Natty Bumppo as an exemplary white ambassador to the Indians.Along with Cooper's portrayal of close companionship between an immigrant frontiersman and aboriginal chieftain, I imbibed from that book a desolate, lump-in-the-throat sense of traditional Indians as an endangered species, remnants of a society too fragile to withstand the onslaught of the Europeans' well-armed civilizing force.In the popular media, depictions of Native Americans continue to wobble or careen between positive (dignified, sensitive, stoic, ecological) and negative (brutal, aloof, lethal, voracious for alcohol), yet in contemporary literature for children and young adults, the native characters (as is also true of African Americans) are now usually portrayed in far more complimentary ways. While in all earnestness, some authors create stories that seem too didactic in seeking to compensate for the stereotypes of the past, these new books of Erdrich and Ketchum offer writing for younger readers that is enjoyable as well as challenging, and historically complex.Erdrich is the author of nine novels for adults, two collections of essays, and three collections of poetry along with two children's books and a previous young adult novel, The Birchbark House (nominated for a National Book Award in 1999), to which the new novel The Game of Silence is a sequel.It's not easy to summarize the differences between the volcanically talented Erdrich's books for adults and those for younger readers. The former are more erotic and more violent, with a fabulous flexibility about conventional definitions of \\"realism,\\" and an intensely metamorphic use of language, with surges of imagery born in dreams and hallucinations. Yet in other respects Erdrich's way of crossing the page is unmistakable, in any genre.As Lillian pointed out when I asked her about what makes a good young adult novel, the most obvious difference is that the narrator -- the active, witnessing consciousness of a story's events -- is usually a child or teenager. The tenor and tempo of the narrator's voice is therefore different, and in a successful young adult novel the voice is convincing, evocative and flushed with personality, not an adult's idea of how younger people sound.Erdrich's young adult books are never simplistic as they explore tremendously difficult experiences, including European-borne epidemics, which decimated native communities throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth century. It's certainly noteworthy that when writing for younger readers Erdrich never resorts to a \\"special\\" tone or style, like certain adults who adopt condescending mannerisms when talking to kids. The Birchbark House and The Game of Silence are as serious in scope and as beautifully written as any reader of Erdrich's adult books would hope.As with its predecessor, the setting of The Game of Silence is a mid-nineteenth-century Ojibwe community on an island in the lake Gitchi-Igaming, eventually known as Lake Superior. In both books, the main character is Omakayas (or Little Frog, \\"because her first step is a hop\\"), who is idiosyncratic and multi-dimensional, like classic literary girls such as Brink's Caddie Woodlawn, Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables, Wilder's Laura and Mary, Dorothy Canfield Fisher's Betsy, and Alcott's March sisters in Little Women.A substantial pleasure in Erdrich's Omakayas books is their portrayal of daily life among the Ojibwe, who are related in language and in their seasonal subsistence-cycle (summertime agriculture, autumn fishing and gathering, wintertime deer hunting, and spring maple-sugaring) to the Abenaki people of \\"Wabaniak\\" or northern New England and Quebec, our own region. While Omakayas and her family are beginning to see the ripple effects of changes in the east, for instance in the arrival of native refugees fleeing colonial seizure of their traditional homelands and the horrific diseases that precede the settlers themselves, readers are given at least a glimpse of the complicated societies that existed prior to the coming of Europeans.Even more so than in The Birchbark House, in The Game of Silence Erdrich incorporates Ojibwe words and phrases, deftly translating them within her English sentences and also including a wonderful glossary that also can be read through for its own delights. As described in another of her recent books, Books and Islands in Ojibwe Country (National Geographic Directions, 2003), Erdrich has been painstakingly learning her ancestral language, and the steady presence of another language in The Game of Silence changes the sound, the texture, and the perspective of the story.Another ingredient in classic literature for younger readers is illustrations, and like The Birchbark House, The Game of Silence features Erdrich's lovely pencil drawings, accompanying her image-rich prose as a visual counterpoint."},{"Title":"The Game of Silence (Ala Notable Children's Books. Middle Readers)","review":"I first learned of Louise Erdrich and THE BIRCHBARK HOUSE from an article in one of my parenting magazines. The book was compared to those of the Little House series, which I LOVE, so I quickly bought the book and read it. Its sequel, THE GAME OF SILENCE, is just as good if not better.The story picks up three years after the small pox winter of 1847 (in THE BIRCHBARK HOUSE). Omakayas's family and the rest of their Ojibwe tribe take in a tribe of friends and family members who have been displaced by the chimookomanag, or white men. This is just one of the many changes that Omakayas and her family will have to endure in this book. Word has reached the tribe that the white settlers are making all Native Americans move west even though a treaty concerning the land was put in place years before. Omakayas has also begun having important dreams and been feeling a strong push to go into the forest with a coal-blackened face for a four-day fast with the hope that the spirits will speak to her and give her guidance...something that she is not looking forward to doing.What I love about THE GAME OF SILENCE and Louise Erdrich's writing is that reading historical fiction can be enjoyable. The reader comes away from the book with a greater understanding of the way of life, hardships, and traditions of this Ojibwe tribe. Plus, you can't help but fall in love with Omakayas and her family, even her bothersome brother, Pinch. I can't wait to start the next book in the series, THE PORCUPINE YEAR."},{"Title":"The Game of Silence (Ala Notable Children's Books. Middle Readers)","review":"Omakakeyens. A young girl's name.

First, Birchbark House where we first read of Omakakeyens, I think about 6 or 7 years old, and her Ojibwa family at the turn of the century. This book follows as she grows up in northern Minnesota, with the just released Porcupine Years as the story continues. They are filled with love and humor; you can put them down but you don't want to.

Like its predecessor, it transpires in the Ojibwe tribe's mid 19th century home on one of the Great Lakes and on the family of Omakayas, the middle child of three \`siblings'. (Siblings is like that because of what happened in Birchbark House.) Also like Birchbark House, this one is a charming blend of historical fiction and clear, lovingly drawn, appealing characters. A young reader will benefit greatly from seeing the westward movement of white people through Native American eyes, and do that within the context of a most enjoyable story with endearing characters and emotionally accessible events, plus they'll get a smattering of Ojibwe language and its culture. Well worth giving to your middle school reader."},{"Title":"The Game of Silence (Ala Notable Children's Books. Middle Readers)","review":"The trick with historical fiction is balancing atmosphere and information with an engaging, moving storyline. Too much story can turn facts to fiction; but too much data can leave the reader overwhelmed and, yes, even bored. Unfortunately for Louise Erdrich, her novel slips a little too much into the latter category. \\"The Game of Silence,\\" sequel to Erdrich's novel \\"The Brichbark House,\\" has a good story, which follows young Omakayas and her family and others in the Ojibwe tribe who live in what will later be called Minnesota. They are peaceful and friendly to the chimookomanug or white people who live near them, but when the Ojibwe learn that many more white men are coming, they realize that their beloved home may be in danger. Omakayas must grow up quickly as all these new happenings begin to alter her life.Omakaya's life is tragic yet hopeful, and always intriguing. But the story is bogged down in too much unfamiliar Ojibwe language, long nearly-unrelated background stories, and an episodic layout that, well, bored me a lot of the time. Pick up this book if you're really interested in the history and culture of Native American tribes in 1850, or if you'd like a different perspective on frontier life than the traditional \\"Little House on the Prarie\\" stories.

His impeccable reputation allows the citizens to believe the silver is actually on the bottom of the sea. Nostromo justifies his actions by concluding that he was duped and used by the silver company - the self-deluded victim. In the last section, considered the weakest by some critics but magnificent all the same, Nostromo falls in love with two sisters (Giselle and Linda) and they with him; he chooses falsely by choosing Giselle: it is Linda at the novel's end who cries her heart out for him after his death. But by now Nostromo, once hero to all, is making very bad decisions.Many consider this Conrad's greatest novel, and in it he paints a very large picture of corruption, revolution, love, and material gain; as in all his novels the writing is suspenseful and dramatic. Nostromo, on his death-bed, confesses to the kindly Mrs. Gould (the mine owner's wife) how he had stolen the silver, but she refuses to let him tell her where he hid it: \\"Isn't there enough treasure without it to make everybody in the world miserable?\\" Indeed. Money is the destructive force here: only Linda's love for the man is worth praising."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"To begin with the title, Nostromo seems terribly inapt to me. It seems rather chosen out of convenience than due to anything thematically overpowering about the character. If there is an overmastering, thematic character here, it is \\"...the San Torm&eacute; mine, which appeared to him hateful and immense, lording it by its vast wealth over the valour, the toil, the fidelity of the poor, over war and peace, over the labours of the town, the sea, and the Campo.\\" And the mine is not important for the superficial reasons that might incite one to write a political tract. It is important as a symbol of all that spurs men to action in the world, whereby they are ineluctably doomed. For action, in Conrad's world, is tainted as soon as it takes its name. The alternative of solitude, on the other hand, drives men insane. In other words, this book, with its splendid psychological prose, offers the reader no way out of seeing the life of man as damned from the start.Charles Gould, founder of said mine, is the quintessential man of action. Describing him, Conrad writes, \\"Action is consolatory. It is the enemy of thought and the friend of flattering illusions. Only in the conduct of our action can we find the sense of mastery over the Fates.\\" It is the cultured Decoud, erstwhile French flneur and the most interesting character in the book, who represents the alternative to the specious self-delusion which action brings. But Decoud finds himself stranded on an island and...\\"Decoud caught himself entertaining a doubt of his own individuality. It had merged into the world of cloud and water, of natural forces and forms of nature. In our activity alone do we find the sustaining illusion of an independent existence as against the whole scheme of things of which we form a helpless part. Decoud lost all belief in the reality of his action past and to come....He beheld the universe as a succession of incomprehensible images.\\"Thus, poor Decoud comes to blow his own head off. Mrs. Gould would seem the most sympathetic and - in her way - successful character in the novel. Indeed, she is still alive at the end and is regarded by the people as a saint of sorts. But her life is empty, as she cogitates at the end, \\"...love was only a short moment of forgetfulness, a short intoxication, whose delight one remembered with a sense of sadness, as if it had been a deep grief lived through. There was something inherent in the necessities of successful action which carried with it the moral degradation of the idea.\\"My point is this review has been to plumb the depths of what I see as essential in this bleak novel, rather than going into issues of colonialism, capitalism, greed upon which the other reviews tend to concentrate. The seabed of existential meaning of the book beneath these shoals is that it presents to the reader a view of the world where the answer as to whether to be or not to be is, decidedly, NOT."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Protagonist Nostromo experiences the life which the author seeks for the reader to envy - or does he or she?Living amid the fictional South American country torn with civil war and military coup's strife, Nostromo works for foreign miners whose ill begotten gain is admonished by the countrypeople and the leaders of the coup. Eventually, even the loyal and most helpful to the English Nostromo must concede that his purpose should be more than aiding the rich to extract his country's riches for their personal financial gain.Conrad is a master of telling great stories in incredible detail. And \\"Nostromo\\" is his only novel set on land - although a great amount involves a boat pulling off shore to an island not far away from the site of the majority of the novel. And, quite candidly, the boat parts of this book are the most gripping in detail and style.Conrad's other great novels have dealt with great characters of the sea: the almost perfection of man with \\"Lord Jim\\" ; or the eery recantations of the life in the third world where people would kill another for nickels and dimes in \\"Heart of Darkness.\\" This novel mixes the greatness of \\"Lord Jim\\" in the character of Nostromo and encircles him in a world of relative anarchy as the warring coups' leaders and the old government involve serious and severe physical harm to all.The major theme of the story is about the cache of silver derived from the foreign man's efforts in the town in which Nostromo lives. Those involved must ask: Let the military leaders come in an take the silver or save it for the old rule or for those who mined it? Not previously involved in the politics of his own country which are grotesquely intertwined and muddied by foreign money or manipulation, Nostromo becomes very much involved in politics with his handling of the hiding of the silver ingots. People are subsequently tortured to death for information about the silver. But, only one man knows what happened to it and where it lies. Is this good? Conrad described Nostromo as \\"The slave of the San Tome silver [who] felt the weight of the chains upon his limbs. . . \\" He was fettered by the knowledge and being involved with the hiding of the silver. Before he became involved, life was good. After the hiding, life remained good - until he suffers an unfortunate disruption with a woman scorned.Like a Greek tragedy, this novel laments the hero for his humanity and human weaknesses. Unlike a Greek tragedy, this is a long and drawn out struggle involving a great amount of reading.Conrad learned English after the age of 21, and when he wrote, he wished to convey to the reader his knowledge of the vocabulary of the English language. In short, Conrad writes in a style that is neither quick paced nor easily absorbed as many uncommon words are shoehorned into certain sentences for what can commonly be proclaimed as affectation or even grandiloquence. Regardless of this truism, this book should be read."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"...of the twentieth century, and it's easy to see why. I was introduced to the book by way of the BBC television production, which I recommend as a good companion piece, since it takes a different perspective than the book. The TV camera, after all, can't get into the minds of the characters and reveal to us just what they're thinking. On the other hand, Conrad chose not to focus on the more visual aspects of the story, the aspects the BBC was able to bring to us in the clearest manner. Combining the two creates a much more thorough-going picture than either could create alone.Joseph Conrad obviously had a problem with endings -- he wanted to tie his stories up entirely too neatly, and in this one he does that by killing of the eponymous character (I'm not giving anything important away by saying that). Still, the focus of the novel is on what happens in the middle, not on the events that bring everything to an end, and for an insight into the minds of ordinary people thrust into the center of events bigger than themselves (though they don't know them to be bigger than themselves) this is an exemplary work."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Forget what the critics say! This is Joseph Conrad's greatest novel. It is also one of the finest political novels ever written. Its grand theme is the involvement of ''material interests\\" with the South American republic of Costaguana. It shows how \\"material interests\\" create governments and inspire revolutions. The novel also deals with the lives of several vividly drawn characters who are caught up in Costaguana's latest revolution.The title character is the Italian captain of the lightermen who work for the British-owned steamship company. As such, he is one of the lowest ranked individuals in Costaguana's European pecking order. His life and loves constitute the ostensible plot of this \\"tale of the seaboard.\\" Nostromo is a victim of the workings of material interests and we witness his decline from super-hero to wealthy but unhappy thief.The real story, however, is the story of Costaguana's inability to achieve salvation through politics. This is a good story as well as the portrait of a society in revolution. Beware of the changes in time sequence, This book is one of the earliest classics of Modernism. There is one jarring note. As a member of the European upper class, Conrad was a man of his times. His anti-semitism, racism and distrust of democracy come through quite clearly.

A novel of huge scope and political intrigue, it is also a novel in which no character actually wins. All must accept the ironies which fate has dealt them. Setting the novel in the imaginary South American country of Costaguana, the story centers around a silver mine in the mountains outside of the capital, Sulaco, vividly depicting its allure and the price each character pays for its success.When Charles Gould, returns from England to claim and reopen the rich silver mine he has inherited from his father, he has good intentions-- to provide jobs for the peasants and contribute to the economy of the town at the same time that he also profits. Soon, however, he becomes obsessed with wealth and power, and as the political climate gets hotter, he must pay off government officials, bandits, the church, and various armed revolutionaries to be able to work. Each of these groups is vividly depicted as working for its own ends and not for the good of the people, and with their goals focused on the real world, these characters have no self-awareness, nor do they develop it during the novel.In contrast to these &quot;unrealized&quot; humans, Conrad presents several characters who develop some self-awareness through their experiences. Nostromo, a local legend, is a man of principle who has always kept his word. Martin Decoud, a newspaper man, is a nihilist who has editorialized against the revolution, though he has yet to test himself. Dr. Monygham, captured during a past revolution, broke under torture, and is now seeking absolution by fighting against this revolution. And the good and long-suffering wife of Charles Gould, Dona Emilia, who has lost her husband to his silver mine, now devotes her life to helping others.When Nostromo agrees to protect a load of silver from revolutionaries by taking it out to sea, he takes Decoud with him, leaving him on an island with the silver when they almost sink. Decoud's reaction to his isolation, and Nostromo's reaction to the treasure that is suddenly &quot;his,&quot; provide a dark commentary on idealism and human nature. In the conclusion, which includes a love story that feels tacked on, Conrad's darkest self is revealed, offering little hope of change and even less hope for man's redemption. Rich in atmosphere, vibrant in description, filled with characters representing all walks of life and philosophy, and set in a country where revolution is a way of life, the novel is full of dark portents and bleak political outcomes. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Conrad is my favorite 20th century author, so I am biased. The reviewer who compared him to Tolstoy was on the money. Both lived lives that gave them fodder for their fiction; Tolstoy as a soldier in the Crimean war, an aristocrat facing the turbulence of the political and social upheavals of fin-de-siecle Russia, and Conrad as a mariner and a Polish transplant who carved out a language and a career for himself in England. Nostromo contains some of the most vividly realized characterization, plot, and sensory detail of any novel ever written in the English language, period. Do not pay any attention to a customer whose review is based on listening to the audio tape version. It doesn't do the book justice and is indeed labored to the extreme. I would also hope that readers do not form their opinions from the BBC film. It is infinitely shallow by comparison to this rich work. While the &quot;eponymous&quot; character remains purposefully enigmatic, the other inhabitants of Costaguena are stereoscopically fleshed out. We are on intimate terms with the Goulds. We know Decoud's innermost thoughts. It's true that Decoud is the central character of this novel. His isolation and mental defragmentation is Conrad's arguement for and refuation of existentialism. We are all islands, yet no man is in island. Take your pick. This is a very large piece of fiction. Do not approch it as you would some best seller. It's not going to entertain you on every page. What it will do is reward you in riches that can never come cheaply. Yet it is not like Finnegan's Wake, where you have to have your Boedekker's guide to see you along your journey. It's also a great adventure story, with a larger than life hero. If I could suggest one book to represent the most finely crafted novel of its era, this would be it."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Joseph Conrad is one of the most effortlessly cosmopolitan writers in the English language, and &quot;Nostromo&quot; finds him in a fictitious South American country called Costaguana whose mountains are a bountiful resource of silver. And Conrad is probably the only writer who can transform his novel's hero from an all-around tough guy to a heroic savior to a sneaky thief to a tragic victim of mistaken identity through plausible twists of fate without ever letting the story fall into disarray.The main action of the novel takes place towards the end of the nineteenth century in a town called Sulaco, which is the base of operations for the San Tome silver mine up in the nearby mountains. The administrator of the mine is an Englishman named Charles Gould, whose primary challenge is to find American and European speculators to invest money to keep the mine in business. The other problem he faces is a civil war between the present government and a faction of rebels led by a general named Montero. Gould's wife Emilia is a prominent figure in town, an elegant matron with a philanthropic attitude towards the downtrodden native mine workers and townspeople.The hero, Nostromo, is an Italian sailor who settled in Costaguana for more lucrative work and is now in charge of keeping the dockworkers -- the &quot;cargadores&quot; -- in line. When Montero's troops invade Sulaco, Nostromo and Martin Decoud, an aristocratic Frenchman who runs Sulaco's newspaper, escape on a boat with the town's silver treasury to protect it from the marauders. Their boat is sideswiped and damaged by a ship commanded by a rebel colonel named Sotillo, and they are forced to moor on a nearby island and bury the treasure there. This island is the future site of a lighthouse to be maintained by the Violas, an Italian family whose patriarch, Giorgio, once supported Garibaldi and still reveres the man like a deity. There is obviously much more to the plot, too much to reveal in this review, and there are many additional important characters, but these are best left for the potential reader to discover.Narratively, Conrad keeps the story moving with plenty of action and suspense combined with the typical excellence of his prose. Structurally, though, is how Conrad's novel intrigues its reader: He frequently shifts viewpoints, in both place and time, to give the effect of different perspectives of both the immediate events and the long-term history of Sulaco. Contemporary reviewers of the novel apparently saw this technique as an artistic flaw; in retrospect, it seems well ahead of its time.Thematically, the novel presents a debate about the benefits and problems of imperialism and colonization, using Costaguano as a model colony and the Gould Concession as model imperialists. When Sotillo accuses foreigners of robbing his country of its wealth, Gould suggests to him that a country's resources (i.e., Costaguana's silver) can be used as an asset only from the cooperation of the native workers and the capital and technical knowledge of the colonists. Such a concept seems relevant to global economic development throughout the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"For the first 150 or so pages of Nostromo, there were several times when I almost quit. The amount of detail about the political and social organization of Conrad's imaginary country was so dry and technical that I felt like I was reading an encyclopedia. But, the strangest thing happened on about page 151. . . I started to get into the book! Then, I couldn't stop. In retrospect, I believe that the exposition at the beginning of the novel could have been dispersed throughout the narrative, rather than shoving it down the reader's mouth at the beginning.Nevertheless, Nostromo is a stunning and extremely pessimistic examination of the &quot;heart of darkness&quot; within all humans. Virtually all the characters are driven by self-interest and greed, and even our &quot;hero&quot; (Nostromo), is at times bestial and self-involved. But, I still loved this book! Joseph Conrad is like the literary equivalent of Paul Verhoeven- an extremely bitter artist whose dark view of the world serves to shed light on the audience. I know it sounds strange, but I mean exactly what I say."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Nostromo is simultaneously a great political novel and a great psychological novel. A large part of Conrad's achievement is his fusion of these 2 elements into one seamless narrative. Nostromo describes the penetration of a Latin American country by European/North American capitalism and the ensuing revolution. All the characters in Nostromo are engaged in the intensely political acts carrying the plot forward. Conrad based his narrative on a considerable amount of research on contemporary Latin America and the articulation of the plot elements is elegantly realistic and gripping. The psychological elements concern characters' motivations for their acts. A recurrent ironic theme is that important characters are driven to act by motivations that have nothing to do with political objectives or economic gain per se. Unlike most of his other novels which offer a psychological portrait primarily of a single character, Nostromo features several characters whose motivations and actions are explored by Conrad. The focus shifts from character to character is a way that consistently advances the plot, a brilliant piece of formal construction. Finally, Nostromo features some of Conrad's best descriptive writing. Because of the complexity of the plot and characterization, Nostromo is not the easiest of Conrad's novels to read. Nostromo is ultimately well worth the effort expended."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"The crisis in Somalia, the genocide in Rwanda, why do so many well-intentioned development assistance efforts fail so miserably? As America has been drawn in yet another asymmetric conflict with a collapsed state and Western governments are already discussing ways to implement democracy in order to prevent the conflict from escalating Conrad's timeless tale of idealism and greed suggests that changing the world is an almost impossible task. Many articulate magazine articles or specialized books have attempted to explain how a series favorable trade, free markets and respect for human rights can result in long term positive change. Yet, despite the abundance of information we're still left wondering; logical arguments and historical accounts have proved insufficient in satisfying the need to understand why the development process is so complicated. Although written in 1904, Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard represents Conrad's ultimate opinion of the world. It's a long book, 465 pages in the Penguin Classic edition, but it's rich in observations on human nature as well as Conrad's typical lively landscape descriptions. In the former regard, Nostromo is superior to Conrad's more famous novel Heart of Darkness as he tells the story of very believable characters that are familiar to most readers."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Nostromo is one of Conrad's best characters, a man with a dangerous singleness of intention and of dashing good looks. Unfortunately, he does not appear regulraly in the story line until the last 120 pages. Much time is given to explaining the politics of Costaguana, a fictional South American country. I understand that revolution and corruption is essential to the plot of this novel, but I think Joseph went a little overboard. He has such a talent for characterization, and he focuses so much in this novel on history and confusing minor figures.That said, when Nostromo does appear in the book, he steals the show. As one character puts it, he has &quot;a particular talent for being on the spot whenever there is something picturesque to be done.&quot; A dying woman says to him, &quot;(You are) always thinking of yourself and taking your pay out in fine words from those who care nothing for you.&quot; Indeed, Nostromo's main purpose in life is to have a reputation as a hero, to be well-thought of and well-known. Other characters shine in this book as well, such as Decoud, a &quot;man with no faith in anything except his own sensations,&quot; and the doctor, with his &quot;misanthropic mistrust of humanity.&quot; Charles Gould is an intriguing figure who confuses his materialism with idealism. His wife is uncorruptible. Outstanding, compelling characters who are engaged in a plan to protect silver from revolutionary thugs.This has all the great ideas Conrad explores in other novels, such as the corruption of ideals, moral ambiguity, intellectual farce, the fleeting nature of purpose and order, and the absurdity of blind faith. He is contemplating the &quot;immense indifference of things,&quot; the imperfection of men's motives. It's worth the effort to get to the heart of this story, especially if you are a Conrad fan. If you're unfamilar with his work, I'd recommend starting out with something else."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Another famous classic by Joseph Conrad, \\"Nostromo\\" was written a century ago and is still interesting today as a comment about Latin America and foreign involvement.Conrad's tale is set in the harbor town of Sulaco in Costaguana, an imagined place in an imagined country somewhere in South America, plagued by revolutions and greed. Alongside the larger group of natives and other people of color or lower class there is a small core group of Europeans, among those the Goulds. In spite of being third generation South American Charles Gould still goes to England to find a wife. Later when he decides to develop the silver mine he inherits from his father he goes to the United States to find a rich investor. The silver mine becomes a huge success, only to become the target of political revolutionaries, and the story really begins when there is an attempted coup and takeover of the silver mine. Much attention is given to inner conflicts and tough moral choices that individuals are forced to.Detailed descriptions of both characters and settings makes this novel quite a dense reading experience, particularly the first section which contains very little dialogue and reads like a documentary. Only the final section of the novel seemed deserving of the title Nostromo, part one is about Costaguana, part two the Revolution and only in part three does the reader finally become fully acquainted with Gian' Battista, or Nostromo as he is named by the upper class of Sulaco."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"I am in the midst of reading, or re-reading, the major seven or eight works of Joseph Conrad. I have not previously reviewed any of them because of a general reticence as regards the \\"canon\\" of Western literature. But I am departing from that practice for NOSTROMO, which I just finished reading for the second time in my life, because I don't believe it is fully appreciated for what it is -- truly, one of the great novels of English, indeed Western, literature (not that my weighing in on the matter is likely to change things).The setting of the novel -- the South American republic of Costaguana -- is a staggering achievement of imagination and research. Conrad's maritime novels were based on years of personal experience, but his experience of South America was limited to only three or four days at two ports in Venezuela. The scope of NOSTROMO is epic; it is a large canvas indeed. An apt comparison in literature might be Tolstoy's \\"War and Peace\\". But NOSTROMO also has characteristics of Dostoevsky, especially the acute psychology and the general existential pessimism. The writing is superb, at times almost poetic, probably Conrad's best sustained effort. (Yet, curiously, Ford Madox Ford contributed one or more passages when Conrad could not keep pace with the demands imposed by serialization, the form by which the novel was first published.)The narrative proceeds through continuous shiftings in perspective, both in time and by character. Although Conrad's handling of these shifts is masterly, it is primarily that feature, I think, that can make reading NOSTROMO somewhat hard going, as many other reviewers have noted. Also contributing to its relative density is that there is no central character (despite the fact that the name in the title, \\"Nostromo\\", is also the popular name of the supposedly \\"incorruptible\\" Italian captain of the stevedores of the port of Sulaco) and no principal one or two themes.Instead, a number of subjects, themes, or ideas are raised and explored, among them: politics, capitalism, colonialism, revolution, fatalism vs. idealism, the relationship of the individual to the world, the problems for one who derives his value in life from material things and the problems for one who instead derives his value in life from his reputation or the esteem and admiration of others, and, finally, the corruptive effect of silver.Contrary to many, I don't believe a single, comprehensive \\"interpretation\\" of NOSTROMO -- or more broadly, for that matter, of Conrad -- is possible. In NOSTROMO and Conrad's other great novels (particularly \\"Lord Jim\\" and \\"Heart of Darkness\\") Conrad struggles to limn an elusive and ultimately illusory truth. Now Conrad knows that truth is elusive and illusory, but he keeps trying to hone in on it, from a number of different angles. Each effort, each investigation, might come close to at least part of the truth (analogous to a Cubist painting?), but cumulatively those efforts and investigations do not coalesce to form a cogent, rational rendering of truth -- even less so than does a Cubist painting; more like the most impressionistic seascape of Turner. As Marlow comments to his audience in \\"Lord Jim\\" about the \\"visions of remote unattainable truth\\": \\"I have that feeling about me now; perhaps it is that feeling which had incited me to tell you the story, to try to hand over to you, as it were, its very existence, its reality--the truth disclosed in a moment of illusion.\\" Further, Conrad knows that even this impressionistic illusory truth is personal; it differs from person to person. From NOSTROMO: \\"In the most skeptical heart there lurks at such moments * * * a desire to leave a correct impression of the feelings, like a light by which the action may be seen when personality is gone, gone where no light of investigation can ever reach the truth which every death takes out of the world.\\"\\"Heart of Darkness\\" is justly admired, a century later, for being so prophetic about the horrors of the Twentieth Century. In many respects, NOSTROMO is equally prophetic of the century. One example can be found in the words of Holroyd, the rich American financier from San Francisco before committing to furnish the capital for the development of the San Tome silver mine: \\"Now, what is Costaguana? It is the bottomless pit of ten-per-cent loans and other fool investments. European capital had been flung into it with both hands for years. Not ours, though. We in this country [the United States] know just about enough to keep indoors when it rains. We can sit and watch. Of course, some day we shall step in. * * * But there's no hurry. Time itself has got to wait on the greatest country in the whole of God's Universe. We shall be giving the word for everything; industry, trade, law, journalism, art, politics, and religion, from Cape Horn clear over to Smith's Sound, and beyond, too, if anything worthy taking hold of turns up at the north Pole. And then we shall have the leisure to take in hand the outlying islands and continents of the earth. We shall run the world's business whether the world likes it or not. The world can't help it -- and neither can we, I guess.\\" That was written in 1904.For me, NOSTROMO is Conrad's greatest novel. And, again, it is one of the true classics in all of literature."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Nostromo reminds me a great deal of \\"War and Peace\\" in its gravity and masterful omnipotence. Tolstoy's great masterpiece is a macrocosm - a sweeping epic of a great nation that seeks nothing less than to explain the meaning of life; whereas Conrad's vision is a microcosm - a penetrating view into man's core motivations against the backdrop of a nascent, minor republic founded on dubious colonialist premises. The eponymous hero of Nostromo is a throwback to ages dead and lamented when vain men of action, uncomplicated by moral scruples, were heralded; when \\"courage was taken for granted\\" and scheming to the beneficent ends of the clan was prized. The setting is a fictional South American country called Costaguana, well over a century ago, when revolutions, occurring on an Olympic timetable, were occasioned on the most whimsical of pretexts - the ruffled vanity of the latest strongman or generalissimo; the cupidity of a foreign colonial power; a pronunciamiento of the latest rabble rouser. The storyline is one of intrigue and adventure, with a stunning plausibility and remarkable efficiency. Everything hinges on the success of a silver mine owned and operated by a native son of Costaguana of English ancestry named Charles Gould. The circumstances of the mine's concession to his family caused the demise and eventual death of his father. Its success thus bears a mystical significance to Gould and into this vortex is swept all other considerations - his wife, wealth, politics, responsibility to the workers of the mine, etc.... The mine and its wealth become the cornerstone of the republic and invite foreign involvement. Conrad develops fully a whole slew of supporting cast members whose interests, hopes, and dreams are tied to the mine and the turbulent republic. Typically, the characters are introduced and developed sequentially much like the way that Heller does in \\"Catch-22\\", yet there is such a timely fluency to these sketches in Nostromo that you don't notice a break in the narrative. Conrad's genius in this novel lies in his astounding ability to portray real characters, place them in momentous situations, and analyze their motivations. I have read nothing else that comes close to rivaling his ability to do this. One aspect that should not go unmentioned is the novel's theme of forgetfulness. Who remembers the stories of the untold millions who suffered in the republicanization of Latin America, or the myriad heroes and villains that brought it about? In Nostromo, a Jefferson-like figure writes down a history of Costaguana titled \\"50 Years of Misrule.\\" The project is ill-fated and never makes it to publication, and the recounting of Costaguana's mass suffering, by the one man who was in any position to tell it, is lost to posterity."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"First, this is not the book I expected from reading the back of the cover--I expected a psychological study of Nostromo, a trusted character who steals a boat load of silver from a mine owner. I thought the novel would be like Conrad's Lord Jim, an explanation of one man's seemingly inexplicable behavior. Conrad included that, but as only a small part of this complex novel.Second, I must admit that I know I have not fully understood all the many levels included here. As with all of Conrad, this book could be read many times with new discoveries in each reading.The story take place in the fictitious South or Central American country of Costaguana, with a revolution spreading from the north of the country. Isolated from the rest of the country by mountains, the region is currently prosperous due to a silver mine. Faced with the prospect of a revolutionary take-over, the owner of the mine is prepared to blow up the entire enterprise, but entrusts the silver already in ingots with a trusted worker from the port.On the psychological level, Conrad gives us an understanding of many characters:*Nostromo, a stranger to the country of Costaguana, who has become the most trusted of employees of the shipping company and subsequently of the ruling families, seemingly incorruptible and able to accomplish the most difficult of tasks;*Charles Gould, the owner of the silver mine, who begins his work with moral goals but who becomes consumed with materialistic goals;*Mrs. Gould, the altruistic wife, who wholeheartedly joins her husband in the mining endeavor, only to find that she has lost him to his new goals;*Doctor Monygham, the brilliant doctor, who has lost faith in himself but is redeemed by his silent love for Mrs. Gould;*Martin Decoud, the eternal skeptic and cynic, who joins a counter-revolution for the love of an idealistic girl;*and many more.On another level, this is a very political novel, with Conrad explicating the conditions leading to civil unrest in Central and South America, and, indeed, applicable to today's North America. It's all about the money, folks.On another level, each character is symbolic of a specific human characteristic, such as materialism, altruism, idealism, skepticism, pragmatism, and so forth.And then there's the plot, which is extraordinarily interesting. And then you have the heartbreaking love stories.I had only one complaint: the very last part of the novel grew rushed, as though Conrad had the plot all lined up but got tired of writing. The way he handled the exposition was very clever, though.I would put this novel in the Top Ten Best of my reading career. I will read this one again, and again.I may even have missed a level on which the novel can be read."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],M={key:0},G={key:1};function R(s,e,n,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",H,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",G,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",M,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const E=u(B,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-d81f85ab"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/41.md","filePath":"guide/41.md"}'),P={name:"guide/41.md"},j=Object.assign(P,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(E)]))}});export{L as __pageData,j as default};
