In this top six of all time I'd cite 'Treasure Island,' by RL Stevenson... 'Around the World in Eighty Days,' by Jules Verne ... Scott's 'Ivanhoe'... 'Little Women' by Louisa M. Alcott, and more recently Pullman's 'Amber Spyglass,' and now Wright's 'Curse of Caldazar.'Why? Because it has ALL the right nuts and bolts of the writing craft, fixed firmly in place. For instance, there's Pullman's imagination, Stevenson's intrigue, Verne's adventure, Scott's grand plots, and Alcott's sensitive handling of strong female protagonist. Or in her case, lots of strong and memorable female characters. Wright's 'Curse of Caldazar' has the classic feel. What exactly is that? It's a feeling of longevity, of reading something that will touch every reader deeply a century from now. I couldn't let go of the book. I even took it to the loo! It was a quick read, granted, in an age when length seems to be seen as 'good' and 'desired.' But the brevity of this book, where every word counted, impressed me. I was locked into Caldazar from the opening line ... 'The High Witch Zundrith clung to the shadows, muttering spells and casting curses into the towering waterfall.'The horror and challenging views on war and children's roles in such horrific conflicts has been tackled strongly. It has seldom been done, and Wright handles it with care. Behind the metaphors Wright's views come into crystal clear focus. Even Jesse's death scene is dealt with in an imaginative and remarkable fashion. I found myself taken with Wright's classic vampire folklore idea - shown in this book in a fresh, exciting new way. I was thrilled by his vibrant prose, where the poetic meets the hard edge of a pacy, up-beat read. And this book is first class - one that will surely join the Cream of the Crop."},{"Title":"Jesse Jameson and the Curse of Caldazar","review":"Absolutely loved Book 3 in the Jesse Jameson series. Curse of Caldazar is the best yet. Spooky, atmospheric, with a slow-burn suspense that ranks alongside Stephen King or Dean Koonz. As an adult reader I was mesmerised by the grip that this book had on me right from page one. He does villians and dark charcters very well. A great children's book, that I thoroughly enjoyed."},{"Title":"Jesse Jameson and the Curse of Caldazar","review":"Jesse Jameson and the Curse of Caldazar is a stunning book that touches on the territory of Lord of the Flies in its use of the apocalypse and exploration of the cruelty and exploitation common humanity is capable of. Its parallels with modern society, especially the Iraq/US conflict are striking. Indeed, I spotted a parallel with the Bogie Beast in Book 2, who hides in the subteranean worlds beneath mountains, and Osama bin Lauden.Jesse's rite of passage is that of all humanity/creation as it totters on the brink - a multi-layered brink with elements of the political and the personal brilliantly exploited by Mr Wright to give a book not only accessible to young people but enjoyable to a more adult readership.At the centre is the character of Zundrith with her cry, &quot;Feed me now!&quot; She is an endemic metaphor for the instant results many young people desire in their lives. She is the spellmaker and cursed who works hidden for most of the book behind the scenes trying to plot Jesse's downfall, in a way worthy of Beckett, the condition of man at the end of a century of world conflict.As a teacher of English in a secondary school I would recommend this to any of my students between 11 and 14 as a thought provoking text which will grip them from the first page. As a human being I am glad I read what is sure to become a classic."},{"Title":"Jesse Jameson and the Curse of Caldazar","review":"Glorious storytelling at its very best. Curse of Caldazar is a magical, frightening book. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and you better believe it when I say: don't turn out the lights! Lock the doors!Sean Wright's book is masterfully told, building suspense, horror, and adventure to a fantastic battle at the end. It's got the lot. Drama, intrigue, and magic. A sure-fire hit with kids and adults. If Stephen King was writing horror books for children, he'd have wished he'd written this one.Although this book has been printed by a small independent publisher, some big names in the publishing world are paying attention to it. Top literary agent, Peter Straus; top Hollywood film producers; and #1 bestselling author, GP Taylor, who's proclaimed the Jesse Jameson books: 'Highly recommended ... very good reads.' It seems that the little people can become giants - almost overnight."},{"Title":"Jesse Jameson and the Curse of Caldazar","review":"Couldn't put it down ... wept with laughter throughout - no, not Jesse Jameson and the Curse of Caldazar, but the review below. It's written by the author himself, in case you hadn't guessed, as are all the other five-star reviews of the Jesse Jameson books. I mean, what sane, real reader would care about whether the book will be read &quot;a century from now&quot;? And is he serious? Yet all the reviews have it, this obsession with the &quot;classic&quot; status of the books. Best laugh I've had in months.Here's the deal: they're awful. The man couldn't write BUM on a wall. However Curse of Caldazar is at least consistent with the other Jesse Jameson (yeah she's a girl but he gives her a boy's name: same with her mother, &quot;Cathal&quot; (!!) - what is *wrong* with this guy?) books. It shares with them the following barrel-scraping 'qualities':Names created from a Scrabble-tile bag (Trondian-Yor, Zarlan-Jagr, Egornion): check.Meaningless accumulations of activity (&quot;Jesse! Look! Your hand is on fire!&quot;) in the place of any forward momentum: check.The incompatible real-world similes (&quot;The entire Outer Sanctum lit up as if floodlights had been turned on&quot;): check.The lazy, tired intervention of never-before-mentioned magical powers just when they're needed (&quot;It's one of Jesse's magic powers, one of her new powers emerging from the Seeing-Stone when it's needed&quot;): check.The plain bad, bad ill thought out writing (&quot;...and turned impossibly as if her head were an owl&quot; or how about this classic: &quot;he fell like a tree. He sank to his knees&quot;): double triple check with a cherry on top.Well, there's the evidence. No gainsaying that. You can see the whole horrible car wreck of prose in context if you visit the author's website, easily enough found if you search for it. Trust me when I say it'll be the most entertaining half hour you'll spend on the internet for ages: but not in the way he would like.His comparison of this stream of waste with those other children's classics is a bad joke - and not even a very good one."},{"Title":"Jesse Jameson and the Curse of Caldazar","review":"Now and again, you read a book that feels right on many levels. Jesse Jameson and the Curse of Caldazar is THE book. Masterfully told by Sean Wright - it tracks the adventures of fairy kid Jesse Jameson, and her battles and scraps with the dark forces of the Unknown Kingdoms.Caldazar is a monster-populated city, filled with danger and intrigue. If you like vampires, magic, witches, and unexpected twists and turns in your reading, then this is the book that has it by the bucket load.Curse of Caldazar is a magical, dark fantasy that rivals Potter and Lyra every step of the way."},{"Title":"Written in Stone: Making Cecil B. DeMille's Epic The Ten Commandments","review":"This is a first rate rendition of how the movie,&quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; was produced from interviews with the actors through the outstanding direction by C.B. DeMille. I especially commend the chapters by Henry Wilcoxen, producer and actor, and actor Clint Walker. Wilcoxen wanted Clint for the role of Joshua and ended up the Captain of the Sardinian Guard when DeMille decided he was too tall and dominated his scenes when compared to the other more famous (at the time) actors. Artist Arnold Friberg had even completed a color sketch of Clint as Joshua. An outstanding piece of work by the author. An interesting list of the actors and actresses considered for the various roles is provided. It would have been interesting to see how the movie would have turned out with William Boyd as Moses, DeMille's first choice. Or Jack Palance as Ramases II. I highly recommend this work to anyone interested in Cecile B. DeMille and Company. Five star rating."},{"Title":"Written in Stone: Making Cecil B. DeMille's Epic The Ten Commandments","review":"Outstanding. Katherine Orrison has made a long-awaited contribution to the memory of a phenomenal motion picture and the &quot;world's greatest showman...ever&quot; with the release of this book. Only two regrets: 1) although the reflections presented by the various participants were in chronological order for the most part, a narrative thread by the author taking us through the entire production process may have improved the impact of the eyewitness accounts, and 2) from Ken Whitmore's commentary, I'd guess we have only seen a fraction of the photo collection. I would love to read more and see more. Finally, I have yet to hear or read an explanation of why the final cut of the film was allowed to show Moses' staff jump magically from one hand to the other during the Exodus. All that aside, this book is wonderful reading for anyone who remembers the first time they saw this picture unfold on a movie screen."},{"Title":"Written in Stone: Making Cecil B. DeMille's Epic The Ten Commandments","review":"I first saw The Ten Commandments during its 1971 theatrical rerelease. I was 8. More than any other, this is the film that changed my world, because it set me on the lifelong avocational path of studying Egyptology. My father was the special effects man who did the final animation for John Fulton's (and DeMille's) concept of the Pillar of Fire for the movie, and, beyond my father's few stories of that project, I had very little knowledge about the film's creation. When I bought the DVD and listened to the commentary by Ms. Orrison, I was overjoyed to find out via that commentary that there was actually a book which would fill-in so much of the story. I am so glad I own this book. It not only gives detailed, enjoyable-to-read information about the movie's creation, but it answers the questions of many critics in the Egyptological community as to why the movie takes conscious liberties with history, despite the tremendous volume of research that was done (several years' worth!) before the cameras began to roll. Ms. Orrison recently lectured about the movie to my local chapter of the American Research Center in Egypt (Northern California), and she is every bit as engaging a speaker as she is an author. I also recommend Ms. Orrison's earlier book, Lionheart in Hollywood, which she co-authored with actor/producer Henry Wilcoxon. More insight into Cecil B. DeMille is available in this volume, as well as additional information on the making and promotion of The Ten Commandments. And finally, both books give a wonderful glimpse into a Hollywood culture that is nearly gone today."},{"Title":"Written in Stone: Making Cecil B. DeMille's Epic The Ten Commandments","review":"This book is a must have if you are a fan of the classic Cecil B. DeMille film, The Ten Commandments.Writer Katherine Orrison, does a great job interviewing and presenting those involved with the creation of this epic, classic film. The book is both informative and engaging.With interviews of the cast and crew, as well as behind the scenes photos, location pictures, and more, you won't find a more complete and enjoyable source for this film.The information from actor, producer, and friend, of Cecil B. DeMille, Henry Wilcoxon, is priceless.I found myself wanting more and more. Which is a good sign when you read a book."},{"Title":"Written in Stone: Making Cecil B. DeMille's Epic The Ten Commandments","review":"This book is really easy to read. Katherine Orrison (the author) interviewed many of the actors and production team and used their own words as the text like a diary entry. Reading each chapter is like listening to the person describe their involvement as if you are sitting right in front of them. The Photographs are beautiful- nearly all of which were taken by the stills photographer on the set. There are also production sketches as well as more intimate photos of the 'fun' behind the camera.This book is not very long but it ties in beautifuly with Katherine Orrisons commentary on the special edition DVD of the Ten Commandments.The Ten Commandments (50th Anniversary Collection)"},{"Title":"Written in Stone: Making Cecil B.

Is this feature for real?"},{"Title":"Written in Stone: Making Cecil B. DeMille's Epic The Ten Commandments","review":"I am not a fan of Cecil Blount DeMille's second filming of &quot;The Ten Commandments,&quot; in my view a Victorian bore peopled with the most ludicrous cast this side of &quot;The Greatest Story Evertold.&quot; Katherine Orrison's behind-the-scenes look at the epic, in contrast, is thoroughly entertaining, well-researched and beautifully illustrated by set photographer Ken Whitmore. Miss Orrison went about interviewing surviving crew and cast members, each of whom offer a different point of view of film-making in the last days of the old Hollywood studio system. The book is filled with surprising and amazing tidbits -- Shirley Booth (Hazel) was actually up for a role later essayed by Yvonne de Carlo! -- but is most importantly a warm and insightful look at the man who had been there from the beginning -- if not during the Exodus then certainly when Hollywood was little more than an orange grove. The book's most surprising revelation (at least to me) is that William Boyd was actually DeMille's first choice to play Moses! I personally agree with old C.B. and would have paid good money to have witnessed Hopalong Cassidy part the Red Sea. Rather him than that blowhard Charlton Heston!"},{"Title":"Unkempt thoughts (Minerva Press)","review":"This invaluable gift from a Polish friend many years ago remains one of my most prized possessions. In these difficult times our minds sometimes need a \\"kick start\\" - if not a \\"kick in the pants;\\" and Lec's book serves both purposes.Lec, a Polish survivor of the Holocaust (He escaped in a German uniform) has brought back to life the art of the aphorism. In this, his first collection: he lets loose a virtual fusillade of cynicisms, biting sarcasm, quick witticisms, and unforgettable aphorisms: packaged as a book in epigrammatic format. It is required \\"health food\\" or the mind.Almost all point to \\"societal forms of tyranny;\\" \\"State or religious hypocrisy;\\" or to how fragile and \\"fleeting\\" freedom actually is. And once read, these one-liners, these bite-sized nuggets of wisdom, these unkempt thoughts are never forgotten: for they leave an indelible imprint on the mind.3. As just a sample of some of my favorites:On Religion:\\"The first condition of immortality is death.\\" (p. 41)\\"Perhaps God choose me to be an atheist?\\"(p. 41)\\"Only the dead can be resurrected. It's more difficult with the living.\\" (p. 34)\\"Do I have no soul as punishment for not believing in the soul?\\" (p. 39)\\"It isn't easy to live after death. It takes a life time.\\" (p. 54)On truth:\\"An error becomes an error when born as a truth.\\" (p. 42)\\"Truth will always be naked, even when turned out in the latest fashion.\\" (p. 35)\\"All is in the hand of men. Therefore wash them often.\\" (p. 39)\\"When myth meets myth, the collision is very real.\\" (p. 41)On Freedom:\\"You cannot pretend freedom.\\" (p. 45)\\"You cannot play the song of freedom on an instrument of oppression.\\" (p. 45)\\"The Constitution of the country cannot violate the constitution of the people.\\" (p. 41)\\"Satirists be careful.

Not so in this case. Clifton Fadiman's introduction is superb. His analysis and musings on aphorisms make one of the best essays I've ever read.I have one small quibble with the translation.

The disorder is baffling because the lay person just cannot see any logic or reason for it. The normal reaction of the lay person is to simply try to browbeat, shame or otherwise impose &quot;common sense&quot; upon the afflicted person. I and her extended family who loved and cared about this beautiful, Christian young woman needed to know how to help her.A compassionate, caring Christian woman, lent me Dr. Raymond Vath's book, &quot;Counseling Those With Eating Disorders&quot; to read. His book pulls back the curtain of illogic and provides the reader with an explanation of the type of personality that seems to be most likely to be subject to the disorder, a discussion of the usual symptoms, and the probable causes for the onset of the disorder. It also suggests the approaches which are most effective in helping recovery to occur.Dr. Vath, who is a Psychiatrist, approaches the counseling of eating disorders from the perspective of a strong, working faith in the principles of Christian teaching. He speaks from a position of having counseled over a hundred patients in their recovery from anorexia.His book also deals in a lesser extent with bulemia, especially as it sometimes may be an adjunct of the recovering anorexic.Dr. Vath's book is very readable and insightful. I would recommend it for any person who has any family member or close acquaintance with the disorder.It is also a fairly short, small book (about 214 pages) and should be useful from both a professional viewpoint as well as for anyone else seeking knowledge of the subject."},{"Title":"Counseling Those With Eating Disorders (Resources for Christian Counseling)","review":"This was a text that was necessary to complete a counseling course I was taking.

Lots of interesting detail and pictures, showing the initial elegance of the women's uniforms early-mid war ( 1940-42 ) and then the gradual economising and earthier look of the mid-late war ( 1943-45 ). In particular a surprise for me was that the German SS uniform ( for women ) did not have a tie ! And although they wore a grey uniform ( white collared shirt buttoned up ) they wore a black side cap ( not a matching grey one ).And yet how many times have we seen a SS woman wearing a black tie, such as in the 2009 cinema movie \\" Female Agents \\" ( starring French actress Sophie Marceau ). Also covered are the women's work uniforms for outdoor duties such as manning search lights.

I was fairly disappointed in the first book because there seemed to have been very little legwork put into it and most of the stories contained no modern witness accounts. I felt that the author had much potential for this kind of book and that the book in question could have been so much better. After having read this book I am happy to report that I was right. This is a much better ghost book than her first effort and with just a little more work she can be as good as any of the other, &quot;ghostly&quot; writers out there.There are unfortunately some stories that don't belong here but not many. &quot;The Hermit of Fort Fisher&quot; is one of the stories that never really involves a ghost at all and even though it is interesting it is out of place. On the other hand, the stories about Aycock Auditorium, the Grove Park Inn, and Thalian Hall are wonderful. I especially appreciated that she took the time to give her readers information about the best places available to view the Brown Mountain lights. The chapter about how to conduct a ghost hunt was also enjoyable and the list of resources was excellent.Overall, this is a very good book and I hope Ms. Zepke will continue to write these hauntingly chilling books. As I travel to the Carolinas more and more these days, her books help give me ideas of things to look for, or look out for as I travel."},{"Title":"The Best Ghost Tales of North Carolina","review":"Book arrived before the deadline and was in great condition.

I today will review the book and the TRANSLATING! I notice many people don't write on how the translator handled it I'm sure if your a fan of Sailormoon you have already seen the stunning scans from mangastyle so, here we go!Cover Art: The Cover is absolutly stunning. The original Japanese Cover was kept intact, and what I REALLY like is how they kept &quot;Sailormoon&quot; in there, with only a bit of French Overhead. I like how it's not &quot;Sailor &quot;crescent moon&quot; Moon. It looks like a mature of beautifaul artbook, almost like the original(and hey! they have &quot;Volume 1&quot; on there, so I hope to see some other's soon!&quot;Back Cover: The back cover is exactly like the Japanese, no text, small barcode*My only complaint about these two things is that they look slightly blurred...When you open it:When you first open this book you'll see two purple pages, then comes the most wonderful idea I have EVER seen:A translucent tissue-like paper is what you see, and the first picture you can see through it. Written on it is:&quot;Le Grand Livre De SailormoonVolume 1Naoko TakuechiGlenat&quot;I think it's marvelous how they handelled this.Pictures: The pictures are as beautiful and vibrant as ever, they are printed on thick paper and with wonderful inking. In the last two pictures the words are translated: But into the original Japanese so it's all good! The two comics after it are kept in their Japanese aswell.The end is the translated comments of Naoko Takeuchi. It's printed in a slightly less translution than the cover, it's nice and not a pain to the eye, they show a small(mirrord) purple version of the picture, followed by the comments translated into french.::OVERALL::Well, I must say it's certainly worth the money I paid for it! And don't be turned off by the fact that it's in French! They'res hardly ANY text, and the stuff that IS there you can get translations for online!BEAUTIFAUL JOB GLENAT!"},{"Title":"Stories of the Invisible: A Guided Tour of Molecules","review":"Almost all of this is about biochemistry where the molecules are large, complex and of overriding importance and interest to human beings. In particular Philip Ball, who is a science journalist and formerly an editor of Nature, one of the most prestigious science journals in the world, wants to show \\"the molecular processes that govern our own bodies are not so different from those that chemists--I would prefer to say molecular scientists--are seeking to create.\\" His further intent in this modest little book is to counter the \\"negative connotations of &lt;chemical&gt; and &lt;synthetic&gt;\\" in the public mind and to help us \\"appreciate what chemistry has to offer.\\" Ball observes that \\"molecules\\" do not yet have negative connotations, and he wants to keep it that way. (pp. vi-vii)Ball demonstrates just how really complex the molecular world is, and how the technology is becoming further removed from our everyday world, while the effect on our world grows enormously. The text does not consist of \\"stories\\" as such, but rather a broad survey of molecular science, including what's happening in exciting new fields such as molecular electronics, and how new uses for molecular knowledge is transforming older fields such as paleontology, computer science, information theory, forensics, etc. Ball provides some material on cellular construction and metabolism, augmented with drawings from his own hand. He gives us a feel for the invisible, tactile reality of molecular interactions, in which surface structure is paramount. He ends the book with a brief look at the prospects for molecular and DNA computers.There is unfortunately a kind of veil-like quality thrown between the molecular world and the reader's perception of that world by the very fact of its invisibility that I don't think Ball's text overcomes. It is curious, but it is not a question of readability so much as a question of how to present these very complex structures and ideas in a way that the reader can absorb in some concrete fashion. Ball begins with some dialogue from a fiction set in a Dublin pub about \\"mollycules\\"; however this does not help. Indeed I could not see the point of the exchange. At any rate Ball abandons it after the first few pages.The exposition following that, about what molecules are and how they differ technically from atoms, was one of the strengths of the book. However much of the rest of the book is like a first year survey course of various topics in molecular science, a very diverse subject, but without any insistence on the mastery of fundamentals. This is good, I suppose, and Ball's intent, but since I know little about chemistry, I was left not really appreciating a lot of the text. I express this as more a failing on my part than a criticism of Ball's efforts, and to warn the reader that some serious interactive and imaginative work will be required! Ball does indeed go to great lengths to make the visible real, not only with his drawings, but with \\"photos\\" from the \\"scanning tunnelling microscope\\" while using other \\"representations\\" to make the technically invisible, \\"visible.\\"One thing that I felt very strongly in reading this book was the sense of frustration that molecular engineers and others in the world of nano technology must feel when dealing with objects so very, very small. I had the sense that somebody was crying out, \\"My world for a pair of molecular tweezers!\\" I suspect when they get those tweezers, our world is going to change enormously."},{"Title":"Stories of the Invisible: A Guided Tour of Molecules","review":"Stories of the Invisible: A Guided Tour of Molecules written by Philip Ball is about chemistry, but to be more specific, a blend of biochemistry, bioelectricity, molecular biology, molecular chemistry.This book trys, as the author stated, to give chemistry a better overall picture, but the boundries are becouming blurred, even more so when you explain molecular organic chemistry. Now, reading this book, doesn't require a degree in any of these disciplines, but a good grasp of scientific principles helps.The narrative is easily read and is not difficult to read as the author relates to the reader what is happening in industry today. As more and more of the interworkings are understood in molecular chemistry, mankind should be reaping the benefits, making our lives easiler, and making better products. What I fould to be the most intriguing is a molecular chemical computer more on the order of the human brain.Life in the next one hundred years will be very different than life was in the last one hundred years and mankind harnessing the molecules of life will be on the forefront. Nanothechnology is another field addressed in the book. As the author makes a good point, if we can find the tools to manipulate this technology, we pretty much can control everything.All of the subjects within this book are invisible, but with tunneling microscopy, electron microscope, and other tool of the trade, making what was once unseen, now visible. Along with the authors hand drawn art illustrates the point quite well at times. I found the book readable with the caveat... you must have some science orientation."},{"Title":"Stories of the Invisible: A Guided Tour of Molecules","review":"Phillip Ball writes well, capably cuts through the complex stuff to get to the heart of the matter, and tells good stories. If you read one science book a year, or you want to give a gift to your Aunt Minnie who always wanted to find out why chemicals aren't all bad, this is the book for you.I downrated this book because it doesn't really do what it says it is going to do. It purports to be about chemistry, and it has blurbs written by four Nobel Prize winners in Chemistry. The book claims it wants to restore chemistry to its rightful position among the natural sciences, having been relegated to a lowly position by New Age environmentalist non-think. However, the book spends most of its time on biochemistry, cell biology, and other biological topics! Phillip Ball does not really address his challenge, because so little of the book is about the chemistry of chemists (molecular engineers?) as opposed to biologists.I wish Ball would write another book--this one really about chemistry. There's a great story to tell."},{"Title":"Stories of the Invisible: A Guided Tour of Molecules","review":"This book is worth the read.

It contains just 185 regular text pages, including 40 illustrations. It touches upon subjects such as biosynergetic engineering, supramolecular chemistry, molecular computing or, more down to earth, such topics as the workings of hormones, drugs and painkillers. In other words it's more about biochemistry than anything else. It may function as a conspectus of the subject of molecules. Yet, I find the concept or message of the book difficult to detect. At times, the choice of topics seemed logical, at other times the entire book felt arbitrary. Don't get me wrong, I don't regret having read the book. However, it gave me little more than an idea of topics I may want to read about elsewhere in-depth."},{"Title":"Stories of the Invisible: A Guided Tour of Molecules","review":"I had a hard time keeping the book down till I finished it.It is written on the same lines as Scientific American,New Scientist, and Nature (from which it draws heavily).Recommended for anyone who wants to find out what protienfolding/nano tech, is all about.

I highly recommned it as a good primer!"},{"Title":"A search for the truth","review":"There is an interesting chronology that is worth discussing here. The mid-sixties was a period later designated as the opening salvo of several waves of spiritual energy that would lead up to a quantum leap of consciousness yet to happen in the beginning of the twenty-first century, the so-called New Earth. A speed-up of time began which got an extra boost every decade.The most visible contenders at the starting gate were Ruth Montgomery, Jane Roberts, Mark Prophet and Helen Schucman (whose ACIM work took about 10 years and was published in 1975)A lesser known trumpet from the UK, Ruth White, was the channel for Gildas Communicates. Each of these authors brought dramatically new and fresh channeled material to public attention.Though Gift of Prophecy was written in 1965, it was primarily a book of reporting that would convince NY publishers of the author's potential to deliver metaphysical content.This rather neglected lesser-known Search for Truth from Ruth in 1967 is an introduction to what later developed into a rather daring and glamorous career as a metaphysical writer and channel. In this work, subtitled \\"A noted reporter discloses her own remarkable experiences in the field of psychic phenomena and finds a new dimension of life--and hope--for all\\" Ruth confides her early skepticism. She had actually written debunking material that she intended to publish, but was told by spirit not to. An interview she conducted with Arthur Fold led her to try her hand, quite successfully, at automatic writing. The rest is history, her guides have been feeding her material ever since.The book is 285pp and was published by William Morrow and Co., NYTable of ContentsA born skepticA doubter's dilemmaThe pencil writesA spirit goes house-huntingMy psychic friendsThe golden doorTrue time existsThe selfishness of griefAn eagle on his shoulderA do-it-yourself lessonThe man in the next roomLove one anotherWalk with GodMystery stories of the nightThe meaning of ChristmasA spirit's nose for newsThe ancient wisdomVoices and visitations\\"Intimations of Immortality\\"This wonderful psychic worldGlossaryAfter this work in 1967 came Here and Hereafter in 1968 followed by more than a dozen other popular titles spanning many metaphysical topics. Ruth had a name-recognition and credibility advantage of being a nationally syndicated columnist and was clearly the leading \\"New Age\\" author to break ground in introducing channeled material to the masses. Her material is still uplifting and of educational value to this day. Without her advance preparation the channels that followed would have had a much harder time gaining the acceptance momentum that she provided."},{"Title":"A search for the truth","review":"This is one of my favorite Ruth Montgomery books. She is an award-winning, entertaining, easy to read, and engrossing author.This book is about her beginning path in the exploration of the metaphysical world. She visited psychics of all kinds with the intention of writing a debunking article for the newspaper she worked for back then. She was well-versed as a journalist in the political arena prior to her exploration of this field and covered the terms of four presidents.Amazingly enough, she became a convert, and from this book forward writes about different aspects of the healing world. Every book she writes is just awesome. My other favorites are Born to Heal (the story of Bill Gray) and A World Beyond (after Bill Gray dies, she channels him through the process of automatic writing. They write a book about what happens on the other side after we die.)If you are a non-believer, this may help you understand the other \\"weird\\" people out there. Ruth does her research and checks out every fact she can when she writes."},{"Title":"A search for the truth","review":"A good book for those who are open minded.

Because of this, I would argue that her GUIDS methodology, far from being a waste of time for anyone, is the only OO methodology I've seen that is presented clearly and directly enough to be immediately useful to any programmer.

The majority of small businesses are incapable of innovation. There is entrpreneurial work and there is managerial work.High tech is living in the nineteenth century. The great role for high tech is creating a climate for entrepreneurs. In Japan ther is still a cult of bigness. Entrepreneurship is not a romantic subject. It is hard work.The two great economists of the twentieth century were Joseph A. Schumpeter and John Maynard Keynes. Both challenged long-standing assumptions. The two saw different economic realities. Schumpeter became one of the fathers of the business cycle theory.Widow-makers, jobs that regularly defeat even good people, appear more often when a company grows or changes fast. The conventional organization of business was modeled after the military. That power follows property is one of the laws of politics. Another is that reponsibility follows power.The Japanese have been Drucker's most avid readers. The purpose of business is to create customers and satisfy customers.

You should definitely place your order carefully, as there are two books out there with the same cover: one has only a handful of the most popular songs, while this one I am reviewing has all 27. Basically you want to see the original price is at least 20 bucks if you are getting the big book. The used versions may be cheaper than this but make sure the page you are reading this on has a price around 20, or you will link to used pages selling the smaller book.No complaints, as this book has every note and every word. The only thing that makes this book a bit more difficult to learn, is that most of the songs are dropped tuning, something unheard of in the Metallica albums of the 80s. But this is certainly not a bash on the book, as it is simply tabbing what was played.Also, just to be clear, this book has both musical notations as well as number tabs for those music dummies (like me) out there. Some of the rhythm sections are not number tabbed, but if they are not, the song has a key at the start that gives you a tab with say a 5-7 on the bottom two strings indicating an A chord, or something like that...if you like this very punk, very hard album and want to learn to play like Metallica, this is an excellent book."},{"Title":"Metallica - Garage Inc.","review":"Containing all 27 covers from Metallica's underrated &quot;Garage Inc.&quot; album, this book is truly a must have for any Metallica fan who plays guitar. Featuring tabliture as well as the vocals for each song, this book takes you completely through all the songs from &quot;Free Speech For the Dumb&quot; all the way to &quot;Too Late Too Late&quot;, and it provides extensive tips as well as bonus color photos of the band (most of which are taken directly out of the album's booklet) which nicely round out the package. All in all, this is worth the price tag, and as I said before, is definitely worth owning if your a Metallica fan and are advanced enough on guitar. A beginner guitar edition of this book is also available for those less skilled and should be available on the band's website."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Dalliance (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"I loved this book. The Colonial Upstart of an earl paired with a lovely art teacher is a brilliant stroke and the writing matches her plot.

David, the American-turned-Earl, was an engaging and warm character. His side-kick, the Ethiopian Asheram, was an unusual character and added a nice flavor. Hannah, the art-teacher heroine, was shy and retiring, but becomes a tigress when protecting those she loves. The idea of the hero and heroine going on secret forays into hidden passages to seek for lost art was intriguing. I only had a couple of nit-picks that kept this from being a 5 star book for me. First, the villainess was pretty much &quot;over the top.&quot; She was so wicked that she almost wasn't believable. And it was incredible how all the smart people in the story took so long to suspect her, even though they knew there was a suspicion that someone had &quot;offed&quot; the previous earl and his heir. Second, it was hard to believe how all the young maidens who came to the house party suddenly got over their snobbish attitudes and came to the aid of the heroine. Would be nice if life was like that, but it just didn't seem that credible. Third, the aspect of art was one of the best parts of the book, but with all the intrigue,it didn't get fully developed, and neither did the love story--both took a back-seat to the villainy. Still, it was an enjoyable book and is going on my keeper shelf."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Dalliance (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"As Hannah Alexander is on the very peak of achieving her dream of launching herself as a portrait artist, her current position as art teacher requires her to postpone her dream one more time.

A well written book that doesn't lecture with no political agenda, but just tells what was found-good and bad--straight from the hip."},{"Title":"Trading With the Enemy: A Yankee Travels Through Castro's Cuba","review":"Miller concentrates on the people he meets and keeps away from politics.The result is an entertaining account of his extended visit to Cuba including the time he spent in Havana and travelling throughout the country.I found the book puts a more humanizing face on the country that is always dominated by coverage of Castro and his policies.For me, this book is a good companion to Buena Vista Social Club in providing a non-political view of Cuba and Cubans."},{"Title":"Trading With the Enemy: A Yankee Travels Through Castro's Cuba","review":"Miller's book is written before the turn to tourism, which has dramatically transformed Cuba and Cubans. Those who read this and then travel there will find a very different country. Nevertheless, the book is useful for understanding a too often misunderstood society, one that remains one of the world's most culturally vibrant, despite hardships, blockades and misguided economic policies."},{"Title":"Trading With the Enemy: A Yankee Travels Through Castro's Cuba","review":"The style of presentation that Tom Miller uses in \\"Trading with the Enemy\\" captures a personal perspective of Cuba. For those who critique this as a travel reader should see this as \\"his\\" travel reader. For me, his book was required reading for a graduate class on Cuban culture, business and economic policy. Usually required reading doesn't engage my full attention; this book did. I appreciated the fact that the subject matters within \\"Trading with the Enemy\\" were handled with objectivity, humor, and humanity. The strength this format provides allows him to be descriptive without pontification. Following the reading of \\"Trading with the Enemy\\" (and other texts), my class included a 10-day trip to Havana (it happened to be the week in which the recent Iraqi War started) and its environs to study our selected research topics. Tom Miller was gracious enough to be an unofficial guide and advisor for this excursion. His insights (both written and interpersonal)proved to be essential for understanding the milieu within which we were trying to operate. This book gives a reader an individual's perspective of \\"cubanidad\\" - with its glory, shortcomings, simplicities, nuanced complexities all included. For those who enjoy readings that \\"speak to you\\" rather than \\"speak at you, this book will be an informative and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Trading With the Enemy: A Yankee Travels Through Castro's Cuba","review":"While Miller's book is not as fascinating as the one related to Cuba that I am currently reading (Che Guevara, A Revolutionary Life--I can't put it down!), I am still shocked by the harsh criticism of some of the other reviewers. I thoroughly enjoyed Miller's objective, humorous, and insightful account of his time in Cuba, which only further fuelled my desire to visit this extraordinary country. My only complaint is that it wasn't more up-to-date. The bulk of the book takes place about 10 years ago...though it is still definitely worth the read if you are interested in Cuba."},{"Title":"Trading With the Enemy: A Yankee Travels Through Castro's Cuba","review":"It's hard to work up much enthusiasm, or for that matter, spite about this simple, short book, the recounting of Miller's eight months living in Cuba, spread out over a couple of years. I suppose that's why it took me so long to finish it. It's no page-turner. Miller drives and busses around Cuba, asks himself the same questions again and again in the different regions, dips superficially into recent and distant history, stands in innumerable lines at the Socialism and Death bakery, follows a lousy baseball team for a week on the road, comes close to sexism in a detailed description of the Cuban man's love for the Cuban woman's buttocks, and makes the obligatory visit to Hemingway's years-untouched home. All of it is interesting enough and none of it is captivating. In the end, Miller's snapshot approach winds up making Cuba sound like not much more than one in a number of Caribbean islands. That of course is part of his point, but the more than that of Cuba -- both good and bad -- is what Miller misses. Two hours spent with Buena Vista Social Club is a considerably better investment of time."},{"Title":"Trading With the Enemy: A Yankee Travels Through Castro's Cuba","review":"Although it was written a number of years ago, it is a must read for anyone planning a trip to Cuba. Because it is the day to day story of the author's time in Cuba, rather than how many sights to cram into seven days, you come away with a real feeling and understanding of the country and its people, along with quite a bit of history."},{"Title":"Trading With the Enemy: A Yankee Travels Through Castro's Cuba","review":"This is by far the most balanced book I've read about Cuba. Basically, Tom traveled through Cuba for around 8 months and told the stories of hundreds of folks he met - with a ton of varying views. He seemed to be a pretty non-biased bystander and effectively portrayed all sides of the debate."},{"Title":"Trading With the Enemy: A Yankee Travels Through Castro's Cuba","review":"Eventhough,19 years old, the book's descriptions still ring true (my visit June 2011) although life seems more relaxed then described in book.

Tom Miller travels awful far to come home with his suitcase full of frat-boy stereotypes and over determined metaphors. Cubans here are sexy, mango eating, Chevy driving caricatures. Having traveled there frequently over the last ten years, I can tell you the only subject illuminated by this book is the inability of Miller's mind to look past his own North American biases. There are excellent books about Cuba written by strangers to that country, see Cardenal's for example. There are also excellent books about Cuba written by Cubans, see for example Franqui. This book however is not worthy of the trees that died for it."},{"Title":"Trading With the Enemy: A Yankee Travels Through Castro's Cuba","review":"If you ever wondered what it's really like on this forbidden island that's been off limits to Americans for over 50 years, this is the book for you. The author, Tom Miller, spent time in Cuba with the approval of both governments. He writes about life for Cubans, not the political situation which is about the only thing we ever hear about this charming society. The people are resilient and sensuous. They love music, dancing, baseball, dominoes, and above all Cuba. If you are going to Cuba as I am on a humanitarian trip, therefore sanctioned, you should read this book."},{"Title":"Trading With the Enemy: A Yankee Travels Through Castro's Cuba","review":"I've been reading a lot of books about Cuba to prepare for an upcoming visit, and I have to say this is one of the more disappointing contemporary books on Cuba on my reading list. The narrative often feels disjointed and rambling--I have a feeling Miller relied heavily on journal entries to stitch together this loose, unfocused account of his travels. Moreover, the author appears to find himself very witty, injecting the prose with jokes that mostly fall flat and disrupt the narrative. You'll have to look hard to uncover insights, as they are buried under the wandering prose and author's ego. I'll have to agree with readers who found this book sadly lacking in momentum and focus. A promising title desperately in need of a tighter structure, intellectual rigor, a more refined prose style, and overall editorial attention. Better books have been written on this fascinating country--you can probably skip this one unless you're looking really interested in 90s-era Cuba."},{"Title":"Trading With the Enemy: A Yankee Travels Through Castro's Cuba","review":"This is about as good as this type of travelogue-book can be. Miller combines solid leg-work with intellect and compassion, and gives an accurate overview of Cuba today. I recently travelled to Cuba and I read Miller's book twice, once before I went and again after I returned, and it was worthwhile on both occassions. P.S. I also read MIller's &quot;The Panama Hat Trail,&quot; which was equally informative and insightful."},{"Title":"Trading With the Enemy: A Yankee Travels Through Castro's Cuba","review":"This book is a complete waste of money and time. The author demonstrates little (if any) literary skill. The book is completely disjointed, with little connection between paragraphs. It contains pointless accounts of virtually every boring encounter the author had. It is painful reading. In my view, the book is not worth the paper it is written on. There is very little that any traveller to Cuba will find useful and it's not worth the effort to find the few things that might be moderately helpful. I'm kicking myself that I spent even a penny on this nonsense. Don't bother!!"},{"Title":"The Ancient Art of Life and Death: The Book of Dim-Mak","review":"First off, let me preface this review and recuse myself to a degree. I am the co-author of this particular book. After much consideration, I decided to post something to Amazon.com, to help give the reader a general idea of the scope and content of this book, since none is currently included with this listing. The Ancient Art of Life and Death: The Book of Dim-Mak, took a considerable amount of time to write. Conservatively, Mr. Walker and I spent almost four years writing the text; roughly equating to 15,000 man-hours of highly specialized research, review, and work. As part of the review process, we submitted large portions of the text to a number of Doctors in the medical community. The intent of this project was to provide the advanced martial arts reader with a host of important facts and information, concerning the effects of martial applications to the acupoint centers of the human body. The major chapter areas of the book include:1. Historical Overview of Traditional Chinese Medicine2. The development of Dim-Mak, Dim Hsueh and Dim Ching3. The Mechanism of Acupoint Strikes4. The Medical Risks Associated with Acupoint Strikes5. The Three Ways of Dim-Mak6. Introduction to the 36-Chamber Training Sequence7. Overview of the Classical Acupoint System8. An Introduction to Herbalism9. Herbal Formula Preparation and PharmacologyThe section covering the classical acupoint system covers all the points on the 12 major meridians, including both medical and martial information, and health and restoration information. This information is derived from Mr. Walker's extensive martial arts training and professional background, under the direct study of Matsuetsu Kushubi. The coverage of the points will hopefully serve to augment / complement the high quality information previously published on this subject: most notably, the extensive catalog of material of Mr. Erle Montaigue, as well as Dr. Michael Kelly. The book also includes general anatomical drawings and TCM charts of the main meridian acupoints.As a notation: the two midline collaterals are NOT covered in this book. There are some specific reasons for this. Most importantly, the physiological processes of striking the midline channels (the Governing Vessel and the Conception Vessel) are different than the triggering mechanisms of the main meridian points. The centerline points will be covered in the follow-up book, which Mr. Walker and I are currently in the process of writing."},{"Title":"The Ancient Art of Life and Death: The Book of Dim-Mak","review":"The book of Walker and Bauer is a welcome futher information besides the works of Erle Montaigue. The authors have deep insights into the art of acupuncture. For this reason it was easier for them to go into the secrets of DIM Mac. Nevertheless without medical knowledge it remains difficult to understand all details of this theme. There are some mistakes in the book, but it not so important. For example the paintings and the text of the bladder meridian use different systems. Therefore some acupuncture points do not correspond between figures and text. A lot of fighting combinations in Dim Mac remain hypotheses, because a scintific analysis is not possible or mandatory. Such combinations may result in damage of individual health, experiments have to be forbidden. Nevertheless this book is an exellent work of ancient chinese martial art.Helmut Kogel M.D. Professor of surgeryregional director IMAF ( international Martial Art Kokusai Budoin)5.DAN Karate Renshi, 5.Dan Kobudo, 2.Dan Nihon Jujutsu, 1.Antas Arnis"},{"Title":"The Ancient Art of Life and Death: The Book of Dim-Mak","review":"I am proud to call Rick Bauer a friend and his prescence in my martial art life has always been positive, informative and influential. His long tireless work to bring this superlative book to fruition, on a deeply intricate and little known art, Dim Mak, is commendable. This collaborative effort with Master Flane Walker has long been needed and I am now able to clearly state that this is the book the internal martial arts community has been missing.The subject matter, contents and layout of this work have been given keen attention which benefits the overall aesthetic. It is both easy on the readers eye and informative without alienating the layman. It does not play down the depth of these arts for those who frequent it's heights but rather strikes a perfect balance which comfortably caters to all; no mean feat!In refering to my University manuals on Chinese Accupuncture Point Locations, I made a comparison with this book which did not leave me wanting. My University manuals were a largely dry affair whichcatered to the medical TCM fraternity while the Book of Dim Mak covers all bases and then some. Among some of the most delightful aspects of the book is the martial applications of the points as an adjunct to the medical; very important in my view.The subject of Dim Mak has been given lavish treatment in a most concise fashion, would it were that all books were so accessable when dealing with obscure subjects such as these. I have already found this to be the number one go-to book when requiring detailed information on Dim Mak, and while Erle Montaigue has had his own excellent works out for some years now, I can safely say that this work is an important addition to the study.I couldn't recommend this work more highly for those with a vested interest in truly understanding the intracies of Dim Mak from tip to toe."},{"Title":"The Ancient Art of Life and Death: The Book of Dim-Mak","review":"The Book delivers almost exactly what it promises ,so I will not mention its good points .One thing I didnt like much was the lack of clear photos for the points ,inside the chambers section of the book .Although you get a rough idea on where each point is ,I had to use my older bibliography in order to pinpoint the exact location of most points .Also I find unacceptable that the authors did not give extensive information on Governing Vessel and Conception Vessel .Although they mention the points at the last section of the book where they present a sum of combinations and points ,there is no analysis of GV and CV .That was a disappointment ."},{"Title":"The Ancient Art of Life and Death: The Book of Dim-Mak","review":"This book is a must have for all Martial Artist or anyone wanting to study and learn more about Traditional Chinese Medicine and the points used for both Acupunture and Presure Point Control or Striking."},{"Title":"The Ancient Art of Life and Death: The Book of Dim-Mak","review":"Wonderful book that delivers more usefull information than any other I've seen.

I am constantly short on time and long on worries, but I can always spare the few minutes it takes for this CD to help me go within and find that place where the concerns just wash away and the world becomes calm again.My advice is to try it!! It has taught me relaxation techniques - and I am that \\"real\\" person dealing with \\"real\\" stress and anxiety that the CD promises to help. It has truly been a gift that I've given to myself, I doubt anyone could say no to 5, 10 or 15 minutes worth of \\"me\\" time! It turns an insomniac into a sleeping mother in no more than 15 minutes, and that is truly worth every penny."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"I really enjoy this CD! I love to listen to it after I put the kids to bed. The speaker's voice is very soothing and reassuring. I especially like the progression of affirmations that repeat and build to incorporate a real sense of peace of mind. I am usually sleepy and deeply relaxed within minutes.The techniques are presented in a natural order, starting with affirmations, then breathing, then visualizing and then muscular relaxation. Working in this order of first relaxing the mind, then body, then spirit made the techniques even more effective...Each track incorporates silence, music and narration for a truly relaxing blend of guidance, instruction and relaxation. This CD is great for de-stressing or meditation. I also recommend the Relaxation Response if you are looking to read medical facts on why to relax and meditate"},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"The man's voice is soothing and that alone puts me to sleep at times. I liked the affirmation. It actually made me feel positive and I felt, \\"okay, I can start to like myself.\\" But what aggravated me was the visualization and musclular relaxation.Visualization: It starts off good. He asks you to envision yourself floating in your private lake and you see a rainbow. The rainbow is coming towards you and every color is penetrating into your body. Not bad. Then he moves on to say that the color \\"red\\" is going to your toes and gradually moving towards your ankle. But what goes wrong is when he starts to explain what each color is supposed to do to what organs--Red is supposed to stimulate your adrenal glands, etc. That totally takes you away from visualizing. It is asking you to be celebrial when visualization is not about that. The idea is good but not practical.Muscular Relaxation: He repeats the same phrases over and over with different parts of the body. \\"Your legs will relax. YOur legs are relaxing, your legs are relaxed.\\" YOU've got to be kidding! After three or four body parts, you are not relaxed, but just so annoyed, you just have to laugh!Again, the concept is good. But more tweaking is definitely needed.If you have Rhapsody, you can hear it without purchasing."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"An awesome CD! I get frequent migraine headaches and found these exercises on this CD to be very healing. In particular, the visualization and muscular relaxation exercises help me reduce the duration and severity of these very painful headaches. The breathing exercises help me clear my mind and fall asleep more easily at night while the affirmation exercises are very uplifting and help me remove all negative thoughts and anxiety. The positive statements are main stream and not out there. I like the fact that they are not presented in a mantra format or overly done. I feel a renewed sense of peace and positive energy throughout my day. I have also introduced my daughter to the Indigo Dreams cds and books created for children by the same author. All are effective in managing stress."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"This has helped me to increase my belly breathing as opposed to chest breathing.

I found this one to be an excellent morning starter, before I even get out of bed I play the affirmations and breathing excercises (and the guided imagery if I have more time). I practice the breathing segment when I get into bed. This has a very nice selection of exercises, and I highly recommend this to anyone trying to develop a more relaxed and healthful state. It's not the best one for my insomnia, however."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"I purchased this CD based on the positive reviews I read and the positive results I have seen with my twin daughters who listen to the Indigo Dreams CD for children. Having a very stressful life as a full time physical therapist and a full time job at home as a mom with a 7yr. old boy and two 5 yr. old twin girls I look to calm down at bedtime swiftly.The muscular relaxation track is well done. I have the experience of attending several stress management classes. The teachers remind us that breaking down the body in sections to relax adequately is the right way it should be handled. I see that in this CD the author follows the same pattern.The breathing exercises are on track. They are definitely welcoming and encouraging. First the narrator instructs you on correct breathing. Next the focus is on breathing exercises. Its great how the instructor guides you through 3 breaths at a time with intervals of rest. It is just enough breathing for me and I can actually feel my heart rate decrease to a nice resting pattern and I know I am relaxing!The visualization track guides me through an exercise of seeing and experiencing different colors. You actually react to the visualization of color! Its great how this author picks up on the whole body internally as well as working on the muscular system.Many nights I like to listen to music to rest. I like the music track I have from this Author. They run 12-15 minutes. The music is really soothing to my nerves. It would be a plus to have another CD of music! Who knows I will pay attention to this group maybe they will do this for their next CD."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"This cd starts with Affirmations, then covers Breathing, Visualization, and finally, Relaxation. It was a good overall cd for meditation and relaxation. The techniques become easier with repeated practice, and are very helpful for decreasing stress."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"The instructions given on the CD for \\"belly\\" or diaphragmatic breathing are exactly the opposite of what they should be. The narrator says that your belly should expand when you breathe out. Not only is this illogical, since you are expelling air, but absolutely incorrect. In this kind of breathing, the belly should expand when you breathe in and contract when you breathe out.Aside from this rather serious flaw, after listening a couple of times to the comparison between how a tortoise and a rat breathe, I wanted to tell the narrator to shut up.I bought this CD because of the preponderance of 5-star ratings, and regret having wasted my money. I can get better relaxation techniques for free over the Internet."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"Everything about this CD makes me feel good. I was worried that I might receive yet another CD that was too difficult for me to stick with. But this was not the case. The deep, soothing, melodic voice on Indigo Dreams put me into a relaxed state within moments.The simple words and instructions were surprisingly powerful and I could feel the relaxation effect immediately. The music manages to calm me and uplift my mood at the same time (not an easy task). The narrator seems to know exactly when to throw in a word or two to encourage me to stick with it. This CD truly took me to a place of no worries. I recommend this to anyone looking for the real thing....a real moment of relaxation."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"November 2008 Update: Have given clients this and other audio instruction for relaxation. As some reviewers note it can be hoaky! But others are not as good. As I wrote before,...I have been practicing as a psychologist for 30 years. I have recently started to explore ways for some clients to have bennifit of what we do provided on a consistant basis, because if we are to change it takes lots and lots of practice to do it different. Many people are anxious. This corresponds to shallow breathing. Many people have overwhelming amounts of negative self talk. I have changed my ways in practice to make it easier to stay focused. It is all behavior habits. Eating, anxiety, and even depression are behavior based. My present counseling style is coaching for skill development. This is definitly a no nonsense, to the point, audio that works. Even for the tough guys!

I have a stressful job and sometimes suffer from trouble falling asleep and insomnia.

I'm a mother of a one year-old working full-time and expecting my second child in December. With my husband traveling for weeks at a time, I realized the stress I was experiencing was unhealthy and bringing down my entire family. I purchased the adult relaxation CD in hopes that it would bring balance again to my life, and it did. Not only does it let me take time during my day to focus on myself, but the guided breathing and visualizing tracks help me relax and unwind, putting my worries into perspective. I especially enjoyed the deep breathing techniques before bedtime, which helps clear my head and helps sleep come more quickly. I find the voice and music soothing in its own right. I definitely recommend this CD to mothers, working or not."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"As a person with a bit of meditation experience, I wish I had come across this CD when I had first started to practice meditation. The slow, concise pace is easy to follow and understand for one who is new to quiet contemplation as well as refreshing to those who need to get back to the basic principles of relaxation techniques. I personally most enjoy the visualization track. It is perhaps the most uncomplicated presentation to working with the body's energy centers that I have thus far experienced. I have been more able to focus clearly on each center and work with it while using the visualizations on this CD than I had been with any other programs I had previously tried. Additionally, this particular track is of an optimum length, and I am able to get through the entire visualization before falling into a truly restful sleep. Overall I must say \\"Kudos on a job well done.\\" This was money exceptionally well spent in my opinion. Thank you for offering a valuable product at an affordable price."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"An invaluable tool. If you want to learn mindfulness, meditation, and relaxation techniques, this is a fantastic way to start. Lori's system guides you, step by step, through each of several approaches, including diaphragmatic breathing, affirmations, visualization, and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR). After each lesson, you'll have ample opportunity to practice your new skills with a reassuring instructor accompanying you every step of the way. I've been teaching PMR and diaphragmatic breathing for years, and I plan to let my clients know about this wonderful resource. It's an enjoyable way to learn powerful, research-backed stress management and relaxation skills that anyone can benefit from."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"Very happy to get this product! I can't already see a difference in my moods. It helps me to get to sleep as well, so relaxing"},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"I bought this CD based on the reviews and was HIGHLY disappointed. I was looking for a Guided Meditation to aide me in relaxing and this does the opposite for me. It starts out with an \\"I Love Myself\\" mantra, aka \\"Affirmations.\\" The rest of the CD actually makes an attempt at guiding you through mediation but it serves, at least for me, only as a distraction. After giving it more chances, I found myself constantly questioning if the writer has ever meditated in her life. There is never silence, offering a chance to collect your own thoughts. Rather than bashing every track (which I could easily do) I will give one example. During the \\"Muscular Relaxation\\" track, the same saying is repeated over and over and over and over again for different parts of your body. There is no visualization and you know EXACTLY what will be said next after listening to the first three lines. In the end, I found that it makes me angrier rather than relaxed. Feel free to buy my copy."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"Love it, love it, love it. My children have been using the Indigo Dreams CDs for years. They have had such a positive impact on my family that I finally decided to try one for myself. The stress managing exercises help me wind down from my daily stressful routine. I used to toss and turn till 1 am unable to shut my mind off. Now, I look forward to getting in bed knowing the CD will help me stop thinking long enough to fall asleep. I love the visualization that is also designed to boost my immune system. All of the techniques are easy to follow and listen to. The speakers voice is soothing and the music is also first rate. This entire series has become a part of my families lives.

I bought it mainly because I was looking for a good relaxation tape to help me get to sleep and it got so many wonderful reviews that I picked it out of about 5 I was considering Every segment of this tape got on my nerves but the worst was the relaxation segment. He repeated the same four idiotic phrases for every part of the body that was supposed to be relaxing. For instance \\"you will relax your feet, you feet will relax, your feet are relaxing, your feet are relaxed\\" This phrase was repeated each and every time you were supposed to be relaxing different parts of your body. This tape got me more aggravated than relax me. The affirmations were also a joke. He repeated the same thing several times. Last but not least the visualization was ridiculous. I had a hard time trying to picture a rainbow entering my body and then changing colors from red to orange to yellow, etc. which was supposed to touch your inner organs and do I don't know what. I guess I've made my point...save your money, don't buy this tape."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"When I first popped this CD in, I absolutely hated it, and turned it off after one minute. Mind you, I have bought two other Indigo Dreams CDs for my young daughter, who loves them. I was so disappointed, I was tempted to return.Fast forward six months. I have a health crisis and am urged to listen to relaxation CDs. I give this one another chance, and just past the point where I first ejected it comes a line \\" you may find you can only listen a few minutes at first...\\" I laughed, and continued.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"As a single mother and a manager in a Technical Support department, I have quite a bit of stress in my life. I used to take it all with me at the end of the day and often ended up continuing to \\"work\\" all through the night. This has been a tremendous help in guiding me to relax at the end of the day and just let go of all the stress and worries. The more I use it, the easier it is to relax - both at the end of the day and when I find myself in stressful moments during the day.

I really like the positive nature this takes in empowering the listener to direct herself."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"This is a great relaxation CD! I have little experience meditating and have found it hard to keep up with it because I'm a person who has a lot of trouble clearing my mind and making time for things like this. This CD is perfect because the exercises are easy to follow and can take as little or as much time as you want them to. The exercises are great in that they really do allow you to clear you mind, as they all give you something to focus on, all the while relaxing you with soothing music. And if one or two of the exercises don't work for you, you can concentrate on whichever ones you are most comfortable with. A great beginner relaxation CD!"},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"This is a great CD for manageing stress and anxiety. It's not a magic cure, but it helps greatly by guiding your mind and body into a relaxed state. I have panic attacks and I have had to many problems with medicine. I was looking for someone to give me the tools to help me relax in tense and anxious moments. I have to say that although I have not put the tools learned from this CD to the test yet, I have faith that they will help me to get through the anxious and stressed out moments of my day and evening. I like that each technique starts out individual, meaning you don't have to listen to the whole CD if you just want to do the Breathing track, you can, and each track has it's own beggining and its own end. I like that it fades out with a couple of minutes of relaxing music at the end of each track, or session, this allows you to calmly transition. One thing I would like to mention is that I was under the impression that Lori would be the voice on this CD, and in fact it is a mans voice, which is not clear in the description of the product. However, the mans voice is very southing and smooth so it wasn't a problem for me. This CD is definatly worth the price and it's perfect for anyone who doesn't know what to do to calm their body and mind down when its reacting to stress and/or anxiety. I wish there were more adult CD's by her, like something for situational anxiety, maybe a CD for handling crowds, or the dentist."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"This CD is great! The first time I used it was after a very stressful day when I was hoping to take a nap but was so wired I couldn't sleep. This CD is so soothing, I was able to completely relax my whole body and fall asleep. The quality of the recording is so crisp and clear and the man's voice is very calming. It is almost hypnotizing. There are a few different sections to the CD. It is great that the body relaxation part (about 15 minutes) is near the end and is then followed by very relaxing music (about 10 minutes), so after I fell asleep my CD player automatically shut off. I highly recommend this CD. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"The quality and content of this CD was no surprise.

This family owns several of the Indigo Dreams products and every one is a wonderful tool. As you can tell, I recommend all Indigo Dreams products highly!"},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"As a film maker, I appreciate the levels of deep relaxation this well crafted CD brings me to. The passive progressive muscle relaxation track is a method I experienced during a 6 week stress management course I attended. It is a method that takes concentration but is extremely effective. (In the course the teacher actually had us relaxing each finger, each toe, etc. at a time.) I am so very grateful that the track on this CD is a scaled down version of that exercise, making it much more enjoyable but just as effective. I always fall asleep during this exercise and find my sleep to be much deeper. I wake feeling rejuvenated.The breathing track not only gets you breathing, but takes the mystery out of it, breaking the mechanics down so that anyone can do it. I had difficulty breathing as slowly as the speaker at first but with practice I found my breathing becoming deeper and slower, matching the narrator's count. I found that the slower my breathing has become, the more relaxed my overall mood for the day is. I am now also able to take a few deep breaths during the day and I feel an immediate effect.The producer of this CD obviously put much thought into offering 4 completely different techniques, making it more interesting for the listener to change up their routine and selection. The guided imagery and the affirmation track are equally relaxing making my stressful life much more manageable. The affirmations have the added impact of lifting my mood and counteracting the negativity I run into in my line of work. Thank you for this."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation-Guided Meditation/Relaxation Techniques decrease anxiety, stress, anger","review":"This is an amazing \\"no frills and fluff,\\" right to the point relaxation CD.

I also sleep more soundly - and have become accustomed to the CPap. (something I thought would be impossible) I now listen to the CD during the day so that I can actively listen to the affirmations.

I found this book very boring. It seemed to drag all the way through. Harriet Klausner reported in her review that this was an Exciting medieval romance, but I found nothing exciting in it at all. I'm wondering if Ms. Klausner has ever read The Baron, The Vow or The Scotsman by Juliana Garnet. Now they were exciting books. The hero and heroine were very well matched and the blossoming romance was quite good, but to tell you the truth I also found them a bit tepid. Also, there must be a trend running through romance publishers, as this was the 3rd of 4th book I have read about the King Arthur Legends in the last couple of months. Though the Arthur Legend is not the main point in this book, I think it could have been left out, it just seemed to pull you in a different direction away from the main quest to find the Grail. I didn't like this book very much, but I will now wait for the next Juliana Garnet book and hope that I will find it a better read."},{"Title":"The Knight","review":"I was really looking forward to reading another novel by the talented author of The Vow and The Baron. Unfortunately, this one is not nearly as heart-tugging and emotional as the former. The constant faith discussions for the first half of the book between the two leads really started to wear me down (Can we talk about something else besides religion?) And if Aislinn is so pious as to worry about breaking a commandment (like lying) - isn't fornication right up there as well - perhaps even more serious? A little contradicting.However, I did like the history info - esp the final chapter included by Garnet about her research.Inspite of this, I look forward to Garnet's next book. I still think she has incredible talent and potential."},{"Title":"The Knight","review":"The Earl of Essex offers Sir Stephen Fitzhugh a deal that even the cautious knight could not refuse. Stephen gains lands and the keep Dinmow in exchange for bringing to the Earl the Holy Grail. Stephen refuses to go on a wild goose chase after the legendary chalice, but finally accepts because he knows the Earl is not one to send anyone in a futile quest. He agrees to go and the Earl says evidence points towards the Last Supper's wine cup to be at Glastonbury Abbey.Stephen arrives at the abbey only to find the abbot dead and his papers given to his niece Aislinn. Stephen tries to get her to give him the journal, but she forces his hand and instead they become partners in seeking the Holy Grail together. While neither one plans to share the chalice with the other if found, love enters the picture changing the dynamics. However, several other people want to either end their quest or steal the chalice if they succeed, leaving Stephen and Aislinn in danger.THE KNIGHT is an exciting medieval romance that provides the audience a deep look at the times through the eyes of the characters. The lead protagonists are a charming pair struggling with love and diametrically opposed positions on the Holy Grail. Known for her fast-paced delightful historical romances, Juliana Garnett comes up with a diamond with her latest novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Knight","review":"I loved this story and the way it was written.

But, Ms. Garnett comes through as she always does. Well worth buying and reading."},{"Title":"The Knight","review":"I have found it difficult to find good romances that take place during this time period, but this one engaged me and kept me interested. While not the best I ever read, it is worth a read by anyone interested in Renaissance-era romance.While it starts a little slow with all the talk of monks and the abbey, it picks up as soon as the pair meet. The obstacle to their love - the fundamental nature of the two people - was an excellent one, because it was realistic and believable, as opposed to being kept apart by some ridiculous misunderstanding or such that is often the case with romance novels.I have never read a book by this author before, but I am going to look for more by her."},{"Title":"The Knight","review":"This was the first book I had read by Garnett (sp in the listing is incorrect) and it led me to her others. She is one of those unusual romance authors who can draw you into the time &amp; place of her story. It's like a little vacation from life to read her books. I gave this 5 stars but have to admit that one or two of her others are even better. However, even though this is not the absolute best of her books, it's much better than most medieval romances. Hope she writes another soon as I've now read all her available books."},{"Title":"The Knight","review":"This was the most boring book I have ever read!

This book was my introduction to entomology, and I still remember how much fun the book was to use 40 years later, and how much I learned from it.Some people have criticized the exclusive use of drawings and paintings rather than color photographs in the guides, but when these were first being printed back in the late 40s and early 50s, color photo reproduction was still quite an expensive printing process, and keeping the guides cheap and affordable was a major consideration.I was led to buy many other Golden Guides, and still have several dozen of these guides in my library over 40 years later as the collection has too much sentimental value for me to throw out. As the series branched out and expanded, the subjects became more specialized, such as Landforms (an intro to structural geology, following up on the success of Rocks and Minerals and Geology),The Heart (actually somewhat technical for a Golden Guide), and Non-Flowering Plants (again, quite a respectable level of technical detail for such a supposedly basic book). And there were at least two more books on insects and arachnids that I know of, which were Insect Pests, and Spiders and their Relatives, which followed up on the popularity of the first Insects book.The series was edited by the late, great Herbert S. Zim, who wrote something like 90 books during his career and edited about as many as he'd written. It's a little gem of nature writing just as with all the other early guides like Birds, Mammals, The Seashore, and so on. These terrific little guides were the first windows into the wonders of our natural world and planet for millions of young readers, and like several of the other reviewers here, it led me into undergrad and grad school in a biological area. I know there are other series out there for young people but I hope these books are still in print so new generations of young readers can enjoy them too."},{"Title":"Insects: A Guide to Familiar American Insects (A Golden Nature Guide)","review":"I really enjoy Golden Guide books from St. Martin Press. They have been around for a long time where I enjoyed their small, colorful illustrative books as a child. It is fairly accurate in illustations and a brief description of the various insects that can be found. For those children who enjoy science and the curiousity of insects, this book is handy and a nice presentation of introducing them to the world of insects."},{"Title":"Insects: A Guide to Familiar American Insects (A Golden Nature Guide)","review":"This title is actually one of the earliest in a very successful list of Golden Guides. It quickly brings the reader up to speed on the subject of insects in general and proceeds to lure him onward with fascinating information about each of the referenced insects in turn. When I arrived in New England, after an early childhood of city dwelling, my forays into woods and field, guidebook in hand, were some of the most educational times of my young life. I still have my original, ragged, copy of &quot;American Insects&quot; and treasure it."},{"Title":"Insects: A Guide to Familiar American Insects (A Golden Nature Guide)","review":"Almost the first book on insects that I ever acquired was a hardbound edition of this little guide in the early 1950s. Indeed, I wore out several copies before I graduated to Lutz's \\"Field Book of Insects\\" and later more up to date guides. While a bit behind in modern systematics, this guide still has enchanting pictures, mostly the same ones I poured over during my childhood. It was here I first caught the insect \\"bug\\" that eventually propelled me into a career in biological sciences. Zim's early \\"Golden Guide to Insects\\" was a magic carpet into the fantastic world of insects and I think that it must still be luring young people to at least appreciate the six-legged crowd. I know that the images in this book are still burned into my brain, especially that of the beautiful buckeye butterfly and the various horned scarab and carrion beetles.I highly recommend this book for children as a first insect book, but I sort of wish they had kept the original yellow cover!"},{"Title":"Insects: A Guide to Familiar American Insects (A Golden Nature Guide)","review":"This book is the best first step into the fascinating world of insects even after all those years. (My copy is from 1956). Written by experts but in a \\"familiarised\\" style that reach everyone. A lot of meaningful information presented in such a simple and lively way. You'll find it hard to stop reading once you'll get into it. Colorful illustrations are superbs. Many insects are illustrated beside their larva stage and typical environment wich is great. It is surprising how much amazement such a small book can generate. Recommended above any other to introduce children(from 4 to 100 years old and above!)to the world of insects. This book is a tiny jewel!"},{"Title":"Insects: A Guide to Familiar American Insects (A Golden Nature Guide)","review":"Even if you didn't read a word of the educational information concerning the orders of insects this book is worth the photos alone. Outstanding as a field guide, the photos are excellent, and often include inset photos of larvae. Handy ID notes right on the photos point out details of the insect to make identification easier. A photo Table of Contents will help you zero right in on the order of the insect in question. This is not the only bug book I have, but by far the most used. Though featuring insects of all of North America, each photo and description tell you the range so you know if the insect you are questioning is even in your area. If you even have a mild interest in insects, this makes a great \\"picture book\\" to peruse, but for those who are seriously interested in ID'ing and learning it is an indispensable tool."},{"Title":"Insects: A Guide to Familiar American Insects (A Golden Nature Guide)","review":"This is the first book I remember owning. Children are fasinated by insects and this book lets them see pictures of real insects which they can find them in their yards. I give a copy of this to anyone I know turning 3 or up. I have yet to have anyone NOT enjoy it. It is also a help to those childen (and moms) who fear bugs. It is a great way to teach respect for all creatures. Get this and an empty jar and you can have tons of fun with your child."},{"Title":"Insects: A Guide to Familiar American Insects (A Golden Nature Guide)","review":"Price and size are what makes this guide so great. It provides a good overview of insects in a very portable format, particularly for my young daughter to put in her pocket before we explore the great outdoors.The small size, however, means that the illustrations are not as large or detailed as we would prefer. It also limits the amount of specific information that can be included. We recently relocated to the Pacific Northwest and have found region-specific books (particularly from Lone Pine Publishers) to be superb.I recommend this as a great resource at a very good price."},{"Title":"Insects: A Guide to Familiar American Insects (A Golden Nature Guide)","review":"The full color illustrations and brief, interesting descriptions make this a great gift for young fish enthusiasts and a wonderful resource for reports."},{"Title":"Insects: A Guide to Familiar American Insects (A Golden Nature Guide)","review":"My six year old son loves this book. He nearly wore out a copy from the local library before we purchased this for him. It's not a complete guide (he wouldn't be able to carry it around in his school bag if it were!) but it more than satisfies his curiosity in fish and different species. He enjoys the pictures, but the descriptions also answer his major questions (how big is it, what does it eat, where does it live, etc). If you're looking for in-depth, textbook descriptions, you'll want something else, but if you would like a basic, \\"what kind of fish is that\\" book for North American fish, this is great."},{"Title":"Insects: A Guide to Familiar American Insects (A Golden Nature Guide)","review":"This compact book is nicely done and the pictures and commentary an easy reference."},{"Title":"Insects: A Guide to Familiar American Insects (A Golden Nature Guide)","review":"This is a great book, gives lot of information. Was not expecting it to be a small book. It is very small compared to other books by the same company."},{"Title":"South;: The story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition","review":"Although there have been a number of new books and reprints recently focusing on the Endurance expedition, this is the one book everyone should read, Sir Ernest Shackleton's own story of the tragedy he turned into a triumph. Shackleton fully covers the expedition from its inception, through the loss of the Endurance, the stranding of the men on desolate Elephant Island, the majestic small-boat journey in search of rescue to South Georgia, the many attempts to evacuate the men from Elephant Island, and the little-known story of the Ross Sea Party of the expedition, who established a base on the opposite side of the Antarctic continent to lay depots for the planned Antarctic crossing and in spite of horrible deprivation caused when their ship was swept out to sea in a storm, managed to complete all their work laying the groundwork for a trip that never happened. After rescuing his men on Elephant Island, Shackleton had to rescue this party as well, something pretty much ignored in most modern books about the expedition. Very much worth reading; also read &quot;Heart of the Antarctic,&quot; Shackleton's book about his earlier expedition."},{"Title":"South;: The story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition","review":"What is even more interesting than the astonishing day to day labor of mere survival in hostile elements, is the way in which these men kept up their morale, how they faced those chanllenges. Fascinating reading, every page describes hardships you can't imagine not being fatal, and yet it's written in humble and straightforward narrative. At one point when clearly they were near death from starvation, thirst, cold and exhaustion, and floundering through unmarked wilderness a last bid to reach civilization or die, he remarks merely, &quot;We were very tired&quot;. Interestingly, at one point when he and three others are crossing a mountain pass in jeopardy of their lives on a 3 day trek trying to find a camp, each of them had the lingering feeling that there was a fourth person with them, but they only realized this when they compared notes after they reached safety. Again Shackleton refuses to sentimentalize the moment, even though he clearly believes God was literally guiding them, saying only that thanks must be given to the appropriate parties. This is dry English manliness of the type you rarely see except in parody anymore. What speaks best of these explorers qualities is that immediately after returning to civilization, after months of being in literal despair for their lives in unimaginable hardship, they rushed to enlist in the war. You'd think they would feel themselves entitled never to rise from a featherbed again. You would at least expect that their struggle for life in the rawest elements would have given them an aloof distance from mere human conflicts, or made them reluctant to kill other men. This book definitely has what The Perfect Storm lacked in excellent, tight, compelling narrative."},{"Title":"South;: The story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition","review":"This is the most astounding tale of survival I can recall. They weren't stranded in the Antarctic for days or weeks, or even months, but years. I'd only say that it is impossible for a reader to fully comprehend the degree of misery and privation these men endured. How do you fully describe the experience of living for 22 months in a single set of clothes, on ice, in rotting reindeer hide sleeping bags? If you liked Jon Krakauer's book, you will love this. I read this account, as well as the version by Caroline Alexander, and would recommend this version. Although this version had some photographs, Alexander's version had more extensive photographs."},{"Title":"South;: The story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition","review":"I was fascinated with this account of shackleton's failed attempt at crossing the antarctic. It gives an accurate portrayal of hardships and danger these expeditions encountered. Often they literally faced death every day when they faced incredible snow storms, temperatures of -70 F. and near starvation. Their ship is crushed by the ice pack before the expedition even really gets underway, and from there on the story is one of just trying to survive by sailing small, open boats to find refuge on an island where there is a whaling station."},{"Title":"South;: The story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition","review":"Fascinating and exciting book. Shackelton writes in the most British of style -- he describes an ice floe splitting beneath his tent in the same plain delivery as the description of a depth sounding. The book is overflowing with the most amazing of events, placing Shackelton's crew in an adventure every bit as great as Lewis and Clark's expedition (read the Ambrose book &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; if you like this one).This is a fine edition, as it includes approx. eighty photographs of the expedition. From the outset of the voyage to the harrowing crossing of St. George Island, this guy would put today's extreme adventure-seekers to shame."},{"Title":"South;: The story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition","review":"I always go first to the actors' account of any history I want to know about, but for many years, I could not find anything from Shackleton himself. This is the best read, he really conveys the atmosphere of his incredible trip. The editorial work is poor though: only a very general map of the Antarctic is provided without any trace of the expedition's path and no mention of many important places. Get a good map elsewhere before reading this book."},{"Title":"South;: The story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition","review":"I dont normally go for historical accounts, but this is basically a thrilling adventure story which just happens to be entirely historically accurate. You will be transported back in time, and feel the desperate struggle of the men to survive as though you were there. You will feel the wonder and horror of the artic environment in ways that you probably cant imagine right now. The account does not feel in any way dated -- you feel as though you understand what it was like to be on an icebreaker heading to the pole during this time period.I have trouble imagining anyone not liking it. I have read hundreds or thousands of adult books and this is one of my very highest recommendations. Certainly anyone that loves: (1) adventure; (2) historical books; (3) books about the natural world will love it -- but honestly, you only need one of the three, and if (2) and (3) dont interest you, you'll likely still love it. It works incredibly well just as an adventure.It does start a little slow, with some modest number of pages on setting up the voyage and the initial \\"smooth sailing\\" portion of the voyage. This was enough to, at least for now, derail my wife, but this portion is not that long, and you can always skim it.Please note that the one negative review on Amazon appears to be talking about the costs-money paperback edition for sale reached from the same page as the free ebook. As such, the complaints that reviewer makes are legitimate and his review should actually not be rated unhelpful as many have done. The review does not, however, relate to the free ebook."},{"Title":"South;: The story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition","review":"Ernest Shackleton's description of his voyage into and subsequent escape from Antartica is amazing. The matter of fact tone with which he describes his adventure seems wildly juxtaposed on the events which he led his men safely through. It's an interesting read which gives some glimpse into the calm and mechanically rational mind of Shackleton, the reason he and his men survived. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"South;: The story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition","review":"Shackleton was an amazing man full of true grit and true leadership. Among the many things that stand out in his story of survival is the importance of keeping a journal. Even after many supplies and equipment were left on the ice, the men were instructed to continue to carry their journals. And what if they had not? Where would be the true story that outshines most fictional adventure stories in the minds and imaginations of many, including myself?If you want to read more about Antarctica, I suggest T.H. Baughman's &quot;Before the Heroes Came.&quot;"},{"Title":"South;: The story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition","review":"I took the book to work with me and found every possible moment to read it and totally absorb it's contents. Twenty-eight men survived the most horrendous situation imaginable by any human being...it makes the normal hardships that we live with seem trivial to say the least. In 1914, there were no cell phones, satelite systems for communication....these men were left with their resourcefulness...of which Sir Shackleton praised highly throughout the book. The leadership qualities of Sir Ernest Shackleton made it possible for them to survive, not months, but YEARS under these extremely trying circumstances. I couldn't help but wonder why a movie has not been made to depict this most amazing part of history."},{"Title":"South;: The story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition","review":"Certainly a must readbook for anybody in leadership...and for any person who thinks she or he...has a problem in life....These people really had an issue...to survive in these inhuman conditions....and they did almos all of them.

At every step along the way Shackleton lays out storage depots and prioritizes material (meaning throws away 'extra' baggage) that may be needed in the future if (really when) they get stranded.The overall feeling is kind of bad. The crew mostly survives the ordeal with some losses, but what was the point? They never really expected to get very far in the first place. I don't understand the mentality involved to undertake the trip with such a dismal expectation of success. Probably a British, Stiff Upper Lip and all that nonsense.Amazing that as many survived as did. Then a number of them jumped into WWI and got killed in action.Would really be interested in a psychogical study of the mentality involved.

His ship is stuck in the ice for 10 months before being crushed, throwing 27 men and 100 dogs on the ice flow that is ever shrinking. Escaping from the roaring crushing ice to the open sea is a death defying feat that only leads to more danger from giant swells and frozen sea spray that soaks cloths and sleeping bags and threatens to sink their tiny boats ...and they are still 800 miles from any civilization.Incredible, absolutely.

Shackleton is a master at managing a limited amount of resources and in practicing the psychology necessary to keep his men alive. He writes in a totally understated narrative yet the reader can actually feel the blowing snow, smell the burning seal blubber and and taste the hoosh. Shackleton is truly an unsung hero!"},{"Title":"South;: The story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition","review":"My case of Shackleton Fever finally ended with this book -- the story of the doomed antarctic expedition as seen through the eyes of Shackleton himself. He emerges from these pages as an intelligent man who is modest about his achievements -- but not so modest as to blunt the excitement of his story. This book also gives many additional details of his attempts to rescue his men, and the often-overlooked story of the not-so-lucky supply expedition that awaited him on the far side of the antarctic ice pack. Perhaps the only fault of the book is that its careful narrative strips some of the mystery away from Shackleton's almost superhuman story. After reading 4 books on the subject, I find I still prefer Lancing's original version (see my review). But true Shackleton buffs won't rest easy until they have seen the original silent movie of the same name, including remarkable cinematography by Frank Hurley -- now available on videotape as a mesmerizing 90 minute movie from the dawn of motion pictures.--Auralgo"},{"Title":"South;: The story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition","review":"This is the most incredible story of survival I've ever read.

I decided to read Shackleton's version of events and it was not even close to being as good a read as \\"Endurance\\". What the captain and crew accomplished is astonishing and a great testament to courage. This book may be good if you are familiar with sailing, as there are lots of latitude and longitude coordinates. It seems almost an entire chapter is filled with the weather observations of a support ship stuck in the ice and drifting for several weeks - not very compelling reading.

The story of Ernest Shackleton and his crew's incredible survival is exciting and inspiring, drawing from the personal journals of Shackleton and his men. There are some genuinely funny moments, particularly when Shackleton describes the penguins they encounter, and many more heartbreaking moments. An appendix gives essays from the scientists aboard the Endurance, covering topics from whales to meteorology to sea ice.This book could greatly benefit from a map showing the paths traveled by Shackleton and his men, as well as some of the amazing photographs taken by the expedition's photographer, Frank Hurley."},{"Title":"South;: The story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition","review":"In \\"South\\", Sir Ernest Shackleton takes us on an exciting adventure to explore the South Pole- one of the most remote and harsh environments on Earth. His expeditionary team was made up of tough, seasoned explorers, climbers and boatsmen- and they met up with disaster more than once with ice storms, blizzards, sub-zero temperatures and \\"white outs\\" where they couldn't even see their feet. It is a stunning achievement that any of these men survived- much less charted new territory. Shackleton did survive- but failed in his ultimate quest to map the entire area around the South Pole and its adjacent ice cap- yet his exploits became legendary among the world's explorers.The Shackleton expedition around the turn of the 20th century set out to explore and map the South Pole- and they knew in advance it would be tough- with sea ice jamming sailing routes and hazardous weather almost certain to slow them down. They made several attempts- and succumbed to the weather and lack of supplies with splitting up the team- and almost met total disaster. However, rowing in an open boat in bone-chilling winds and high seas, they managed to survive and get back to civilization- despite not achieving thei goals. Shackleton tells the story in sharp, crisp language- the \\"stiff upper lip\\" style of late 19th century British gentlemen. His prose is inspiring- one section even mystical, when he describes touching \\"the face of God\\" after one particularly harrowing stretch of mishaps.\\"South\\" is a wonderful adventure book, a history book and a motivational book- all in one. I highly recommend that those who enjoy these genres read this great story- and take from it many lessons which Shackleton wanted to share with the world.-Gene PisasaleAuthor, \\"Lafayette's Gold- The Lost Brandywine Treasure\\" and\\"Vineyard Days\\""},{"Title":"South;: The story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition","review":"i first read this book after national geographic did a story on shackleton years ago. the article itself was an amazing read and prompted me to want to know more.this tale is absolutely incredible! shackleton did everything against the social and known norms in putting together his team, this journey and, quite frankly, his life. shackleton, apparently, was a misfit of a man who was scoffed at in social and science circles because he was half irish and had a brother being investigated for the robbery of some magnitude at the time.with all of our advances in technology today antartica, for the most part, still remains a no man's land. yet, shackleton and his crew (every single one of them) survived with just wool socks, sweaters, pea coats and the like.it is such a compelling story and certainly not one to ever be forgotten. this is a must read not only for the amazing story within, but, if anything, for the reassurance that man alone can survive anything."},{"Title":"South;: The story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition","review":"This is a book which once started is hard to put down!

Seriously are you kidding me? All the while you're on the same ice and knowing the samecould happen to you.

On this day, and for the next two or three also, it was impossible to do anything but get right inside one's frozen sleeping bag to try and get warm. Too cold to read or sew, we had to keep our hands well inside, and pass the time in conversation with each other.\\" He's so matter-of-fact... no fluff here. He just tells it like it is. I love that about this book. The conditions worsen by leaps and bounds as the story continues, but I'll leave that for you to explore on your own. Anyway, the first few chapters are very informative regarding how the expedition was planned, where they were headed, how they got there, etc... for me, it started a little slow, but I understand why the writer wanted to include this information. So, then you get into the \\"meaty\\" survival stuff... and is it ever so fascinating. And for me, it's especially fascinating because it doesn't seem to be sugar-coated, as so many writers are proned to do when telling their story. In fiction, I don't mind so much the way a writer gives you every detail, written ever so eloquently, but when it comes to true stories... especially survival stories, I personally just want to hear the straight talk. A GREAT SURVIVAL STORY AND PERFECTLY WRITTEN for this reader."},{"Title":"South;: The story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition","review":"I think I've been spoilt by reading dramatic non-fiction like Capote's In Cold Blood. This book came across as very dry to me. There was some good writing, but much of it was tedious, as parts were a day-to-day chronicle of Shackleton's expedition in the South. Interesting, from a historical perspective, but it gives the book a strung-together-with-pedantic-filler feeling.The description of the book that I read implied that there would be more discussion as to exactly why the expedition had problems. Although many of those issues are mentioned, it wasn't as in depth as I expected. Perhaps the historical documentation used to fill the book out wasn't as rich as the author originally anticipated. Whatever happened, the result is a book that feels choppy and stilted in too many places.There were some excellent pictures, and parts of the book were briefly exciting, but it was an uninspiring read overall."},{"Title":"South;: The story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition","review":"What an expedition!

Little did they know that they would be facing one of the most daunting challenges to human survival ever chronicled.The Endurance would be caught in early ice floes before she reached her intended port and imprison her crew in what would have been a wintry grave. With temperatures well below freezing, this hardy group of explorers would bravely face survival for a year and half. Amazingly, all twenty-eight would survive in the most incredible example of leadership, courage, and gritty endurance of the 20th century.As the leader of the expedition, Shackleton's account of the journey and rescue is fascinating. Revered by his men, he was simply known as the \\"Boss\\". His leadership kept those men alive and in hope of rescue when all reason and sanity would have given up. I was interested to read of his quiet faith and reliance upon divine \\"Providence\\" for his hope and strength.\\"We had suffered, starved, and triumphed, grovelled down yet grasped at glory, grown bigger in the bigness of the whole. We had seen God in his splendors, heard the text that Nature renders. We had reached the naked soul of man.\\"While not a spell-binding story-teller, Shackleton's account is matter-of-fact and occasionally poignant; an interesting insight into an extraordinary leader."},{"Title":"South;: The story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition","review":"SOUTH: THE LAST ANTARCTIC EXPEDITIONHere is a list of equipment that Sir Ernest Shackleton did NOT have for his memorable Endurance expedition: GPS location finders; radio ; RADAR, SONAR; computerized navigation; professional medical care; thermal clothes; MRE'S (Meals Ready To Eat), double steel hull; air and logistical support, public relations agents; marketing proposals; lawyers.Shacketon's crew navigated with a sextant; traversed the icecap with dog sleds instead of ski-doos, and ate canned herring, tinned meat, pemmican, biscuits and occasional seals.What he did have was an old ship, a strong crew, an incredible work ethic, classic British stoicism and unerring sense of the right thing to do.His book reads like a Robert Louis Stevenson or H.G. Welles story, but it is the unvarnished truth. His matter -of -fact account is brilliantly illustrated by Frank Hurley's dramatic black & white photos of The Endurance encapsulated in ice, its masts and spars dripping frozen water like the maritime apparition in Melville's \\"Benito Cereno.\\"I seriously doubt whether a modern expedition equipped with all the bells and whistles and sponsored with corporate money could duplicate what Shackleton's Endurance accomplished under the most adverse circumstances imaginable.Because the Endurance expedition occurred in 1914-15 at the start of World World War IShackleton's accomplishment was largely overshadowed, and the Antarctic was all but forgotten until the \`fifties and \`sixties when its scientific and strategic value was rediscovered.Now, as the Antarctic ice cap melts from global warming, one wonders at Shackleton's accomplishment."},{"Title":"South;: The story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition","review":"When the Antarctic explorer ship Endurance became trapped by ice in the opening days of World War I, Sir Ernest Shackleton and his companions found themselves stranded for the winter.

There they set up a precarious camp, where most of the group waited while Sir Ernest and a few carefully chosen companions struck out for South Georgia. That South Atlantic island, 800 miles away, was known to have year-round British inhabitants.Those are the bare facts of one of the great true adventures, a story told here by Sir Ernest himself. His dry writing style may take some slogging, at first, for contemporary (especially American) readers; but his wit is equally dry, and his descriptions vivid. I was especially interested to note the differences between the Shackleton party's attitudes and those of today. Not only is this a magnificent survival tale (NOT ONE of Shackleton's men died!); it's also a snapshot of how those quintessential English explorers of another era thought about the world they were discovering.

Glynne MacLean, Wellington NZ."},{"Title":"I Sweep the Sun Off Rooftops","review":"This is a fascinating collection of short stories. Nearly all are very readable without once checking how many pages you have left.The first few stories depend primarily on the plot, and to an extent the element of surprise or shock. Don't read reviews that take you step by step into every story. You as a reader can never really guess where Hanan Al Sheikh is going with her plot, until all of a sudden, wham here it is, a surprise, and sure enough it does flow. I felt these were very clever but generally not may favorite.Several stories were not as dependent on the element of surprise and were truly enjoyable portrayal of people, feelings, scenery and situations. Some of these especially those of a Lebanese Woman in London having fled the Civil war and another of a Lebanese woman from London visiting Egypt were very well done. Hanan Al Sheikh still managed to insert a surprising end, but you could enjoy both stories regardless of the ending.I am unsure if the author insistence on a clever plot for her short stories is part of the Arabic tradition of the plot, or just her own personal style. I personally would have liked it more if she just let her imagination roam, paint a situation without necessarily having to be obsessed with l Arabic Literature tradition of \\"habekah\\"A relatively long story of a Danish missionary worker to Yemen was my least favorite, even though I still enjoyed it. In general I felt the author was a much better and more genuine portraying Arab woman.Hanan Al Sheikh portrayal of life in Egypt, Lebanon, and Yemen and of immigrant life in UK and Africa came across vivid. She dealt with many difficult and up to the last 15 years or so taboo issues.The translation was superb, often when reading translated work, it is hard to appreciate intelligent and sensitive prose. Here that was not the case at all, in fact it is very difficult to conceive of some of the stories as translated work at all.Overall I highly recommend this collection of short stories. If you do like this book, you will definitely enjoy Sana Hassan, Leila Ahmed and Ahdaf Souief, who..., unlike Hanan Al Sheikh, write in English."},{"Title":"I Sweep the Sun Off Rooftops","review":"After having read and taught the book, &quot;Women of Sand and Myrrh,&quot; I expected more from this collection of short stories.

Although it was written for academic purposes, it is one of the best books I've read all year. It is very readable, rich, humorous at times, and devoted to capturing the rural Spanish personality from that bygone era. There are all kinds of wonderful details about village life. It's also very succinct and short - not much extra-padding (a complaint I have of many modern non-fiction books). One of the most interesting things about this book is that the author had to change the name of the village to protect its inhabitants, further enhancing this book's quasi-literary quality. The most interesting \\"character\\" of all in this book is Pitt-Rivers himself. You sense him struggling to keep his neutral perspective as a sociologist while succumbing to the charm of his subject matter.Yet he never resorts to any gushing, corny lines about Spain (a complaint I have of many English language books about Spain).

If you are looking for thoughtful, compelling answers to the questions, you will be very disappointed."},{"Title":"One Minute Answers to Skeptics' Top Forty Questions","review":"If you're looking for convincing answers, you're really looking in the wrong place. If you're looking for ice breaker assertions with openings to conversation that could be potentially convincing or otherwise, then this might be up your alley.

The most helpful objective resources are the citations Campbell makes constant note of. The reason I say this is because nobody will be convinced in just a moment of time. If you do truly want answers, you shouldn't expect another quick fix to life with this book. It's not supposed to be and if you make it the extent of your intellectual development, you are really cheating yourself or your friends that you try to give these answers to.If you buy this book, who ever you are, use it as a study guide and use the citations.

ANd one they should all be very familiar with.Charlie does a wonderful job of quickly summarizing the main points in answering skeptics' questions. The answers are clear, insightful, and polite. The last being key in sharing with skeptics.If you are a Christian and know skeptics that have asked, or are asking questions like, \\"How do we know the Bible hasn't been corrupted?\\", or \\"How can you be sure that Jesus is the only way, aren't there other ways?\\", or if you yourself are a skeptic then this book is for you."},{"Title":"One Minute Answers to Skeptics' Top Forty Questions","review":"This book is AWESOME.

Irrefutable answers to questions like:\\"If God is so loving, why does He allow evil and suffering?\\"\\"Is what the Bible says really true?\\"\\"How do you know God really exists?\\"When I started reading this book I was so captivated by how believable these answers are that I could not put it down. In addition to answering questions to skeptics himself, there are tons of quotes from highly respected scientists, well known apologetic scholars, renown archaeologists, like: Nelson Glueck, Ph.D., Norman Geisler, Ph.D., Charles H. Spurgeon, Martin Luther, C. S. Lewis, and even Charles Darwin, just to name a few.Check out this quote from Charles Darwin.\\"To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree.\\"I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"One Minute Answers to Skeptics' Top Forty Questions","review":"This volume is very short (109 pages), but it is filled with lots of great information.The text covers forty questions that are commonly asked of Christians be seekers and skeptics covering a wide range of areas.

I liked it."},{"Title":"One Minute Answers to Skeptics' Top Forty Questions","review":"Sharing our faith with others is almost always difficult. It is rarely easy to share with another person that he is a sinner and in need of a Savior. The foolishness of the gospel makes us feel like fools. Yet it is our great honor and privilege and responsibility to be fools for Christ and to serve Him by sharing the good news with others. Despite this, we are often unprepared. When friends or acquaintances or even strangers provide us an opportunity to share with them, so often we find ourselves fumbling and stumbling. Some of us turn to \\"fillibuster evangelism,\\" hoping to talk our friends into the kingdom by never giving them a chance to voice their questions or disagreements. Others say little, perhaps finding ourselves intimidated at having been challenged.Charlie Campbell, pastor of Calvary Chapel Vista in southern California, believes that we should be able to provide one-minute answers to the most common questions posed by skeptics. \\"When someone asks me, 'What evidence do you have that the Bible is actually true?' I do not attempt to walk them through a whole pile of evidence ('The eighth reasons is...'). I try to answer their question in under a minute or two. Frankly, that is all the time people often have before their cell phone rings, the baby starts crying, or they have to get back to work. If they want to hear a more in-depth response to their question, I let them know that I would be glad to go on.\\" This book, One Minute Answers To Skeptics' Top Forty Questions seeks to provide just enough information to answer questions thoroughly yet without taking too much time.Here are some of the questions Campbell addresses:* What evidence do you have that there is a God?* Hasn't the Bible undergone corruption as it was translated hundreds of times down through the centuries?* If God is so loving, why does He allow evil and suffering?* How can a loving God send somebody to hell?* Doesn't the Bible have scientific errors in it?* Can God make a rock so big that He cannot move it?* Why aren't dinosaurs mentioned in the Bible?* Isn't being a good person enough to get to heaven?On the whole the author does quite a good job of answering the questions. He continually refers back to Scripture, allowing the Spirit to convict the heart of the person asking the questions. Having said that, there were a couple of answers that I felt were quite poor. In answering, \\"What about those who have never heard of Jesus? Will they be condemned to hell?\\" the answer contains the words, \\"I personally believe...\\" In this case Campbell goes outside of Scripture to suggest that if there is a person alive who would receive Jesus, if only he could hear about Him, God will somehow save that person, perhaps through a missionary, a vision or so on. The answers to \\"How can a loving God send somebody to hell?\\" and a couple of the other questions are, as we might expect, based on an Arminian understanding of Scripture. Still, most questions are answered well.I had a couple of disappointments with the book. First, I am not entirely sure who the audience is. At times the author uses fairly advanced language such as \\"the inspired, infallible Word of God.\\" Yet the book closes with a section outlining steps to peace with God. It seems that the book has something of a dual purpose and it would perhaps have been better to focus on either believers or unbelievers. It is rare that a book can be targetted successfully at both groups. Second, most of the chapters close in a quote or two relevant to the topic that has just been discussed. Several of the quotes were by people who may lead the reader to read books that would not prove conducive to sharpening his faith. I would suggest that the author could have been more selective in choosing quotes.One Minute Answers To Skeptics' Top Forty Questions is an easy read and provides valuable answers. Perhaps its greatest value, though, at least as in so far as it applies to believers, is that it will help convict Christians that they need to be \\"prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you\\" (1 Peter 3:15). Christians should think through the most common questions and objections and be prepared to give an answer that is convicting and biblical, but not necessarily exhaustive."},{"Title":"One Minute Answers to Skeptics' Top Forty Questions","review":"Charlie has done a masterful job at dealing with common \\"hurdles\\" to the Christian faith.

I enjoyed how many of their observations were drawn from their rich backgrounds which allowed them to provide their lessons with unique examples and associations. One of the earlier chapters is called \\"Dancing to your own Drummer\\" and to demonstrate the importance of progression towards conscious responsible decision making and individuality \\"Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs\\" chart is cited, but not as means to measure personal motivations, but rather to demonstrate that individuality is at the apex of the hierarchy. The \\"power of choice\\" continues to be an important theme in the book. The authors make use of an innovative treatment of the word \\"estimable.\\" They use it as an adjective to describe an esteemed choice or decision. They provide some interesting scenarios for the reader to ponder the difficulties in making an estimable decision. The reader is challenged to imagine what he/she would do in such a situation and to also factor into the dynamic the understanding that how he/she makes the decision will have an impact on them individually, on their esteem - their self esteem. Some of the scenarios at first glance don't seem like ones that would or should affect the decision maker's self esteem, but the authors make a strong argument that they do."},{"Title":"Heavenly Ever After: The Ultimate Relationship Guide for Men","review":"With a title like this, I was expected a faith-based study of dating.

It doesn't explain the grammar rules in a simplified manner, and uses a linguistic vocabulary that seemed foreign to me at first.For example (p. 182), \\"Adjectival nouns, like regular adjectives, are in the genitive plural (due to an implicit masculine head noun) or nominative plural (with implicit feminine head noun)\\".And (p. 183), \\"Numbers decline exactly like feminine nouns of the third declension\\"Of course this does make sense, but it certainly isn't suited to a beginner.I gave this book 4 stars because as an outline and reference book it does the job really well. I don't pick it up as often as some of my other Russian books, such as the New Penguin course or Farmer's Teach Yourself Russian, but it's handy as a grammar reference.Organisation of chapters seems pretty logical, and the exercises at the end of each section are directly related to the material that was discussed.A significant amount of the Russian (Cyrillic) text is written in lower-case (italics) ...just so you know! Some people (like me) can read upper-case with ease, but become frustrated with lower-case.As the topic of this review states, it's a great book, just be aware of what you're buying."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Russian Grammar","review":"I have been studying Russian independently for two years now, and this is the best book I have found.

If you don't know how to express dates for instance, you can skip to that section and there are detailed explanations and examples. I wish there were more exercises, but this is really more of a reference book than a drill book. There's no glossary, but you'll find a lot of Russian vocabulary here, so it's also good to have a dictionary when you use this book.

I know I need to eventually learn italics (5 small Russian letters don't look anything like the standard letters) but not now."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Russian Grammar","review":"I started using Schaum's Outline of Russian Grammar after I already knew the basics of Russian grammar and found it very useful. One of the difficulties with Russian grammar is remembering all the rules and applying them correctly. This book is ideal for practice as it contains hundreds of grammar exercises with answers. The author, James S. Levine, begins each section of the book with a clear explanation of the grammar point to be studied. The exercises then test the learner's understanding of this point. The key to using the book successfully is to do all the exercises. This requires a certain amount of discipline, as it has to be said, this is a fairly dull book. There are no stories and no pictures, just grammar and more grammar. It is for this reason that I would not recommend this book for someone who has no knowledge of Russian at all. Moreover, although all aspects of Russian grammar are covered thoroughly including the basics, Levine often assumes the reader already has a reasonable Russian vocabulary and has a fair grasp of Russian sentence structure. A complete beginner would find doing some of the exercises almost impossible.The key to speaking Russian correctly and fluently is for the grammar rules to become automatic. If you constantly have to work out the case of the noun, the aspect of the verb and so on, you'll never get anywhere. With practice even the complexities of Russian grammar become a matter of routine. Any reasonably serious student of Russian will benefit from Levine's book and will also gain a good degree of satisfaction from completing the exercises. This book will definitely improve your Russian."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Russian Grammar","review":"I teach Russian at the high school level.The Schaum's Russian Grammar outline has the clearest explanation of the difficult subject of Russian motion verbs that I have ever seen.The author, Dr. James Levine, divides the Russian subjunctive into The Conditional (260) and The Subjunctive (262). I think this approach is very helpful for students because it is less confusing.The discussion and exercises of the difficult Russian Indefinite Pronouns (134-136) was well-organized and highlighted when the particles \\"to\\" or \\"nibud\\" should be used.The text is careful to use a vocabulary that is remarkably consistent with what students are learning in their main text.The explanations and the exercises in the text can be used as a supplement to a regular text. Many high school and university texts today have video and audio materials, but the grammar analysis is not as developed as it might be. This modestly-priced text is an excellent way to bridge this gap. The grammar explanations are clearer for an English-speaker than the Russian-published texts.The rules for Russian grammar are very carefully and logically explained; the words are accented; and the exercises have an answer key that is helpful for students studying independently.This is the best Russian grammar book on the market."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Russian Grammar","review":"I'd used quite a few of Schaum's other Outline series titles in various math courses, ranging from statistics to calculus and differential equations, but this is the first one I've tried in a non-quanititative area, and I was pleased to see the quality shines through here also.This is a great outline and review of Russian grammar. Russian has some major pitfalls for the English language speaker, such as the complex case system, which has six cases just like Latin; three genders, male, female, and neuter; and a verb classification system that is foreign to us. This is the concept of directed vs. non-directed motion.For example, in Russian there are two words for walking. If you were just strolling aimlessly around, such as walking in a park, you would use one verb. But if you were walking with a specific goal in mind, such as you were heading somewhere and had a specific destination in mind, you'd use the other verb. Many Russian verbs have this dual feature, which means you have to learn two verbs to do what in English you'd do with one verb and an adverb.The other major way the Russian verbal system differs from English and many other Indo-European languages is that it is built primarily on the concept of aspect rather than tense. This means Russian verbs are more concerned with whether the action was complete or is incomplete, rather than whether the action took place at a certain point in time, as in the familar past, present, and future tenses. In grammar this is known as the perfective-imperfective dimension, \\"perfective\\" referring to completed action, and \\"imperfective\\" referring to an action that is still going on or hasn't been completed yet. An example in English of the perfect indicative is \\"I spoke.\\" An example of the imperfect indicative is \\"I was speaking.\\"In this context I'm reminded of the example of Japanese, which doesn't have a very detailed tense system either, and in fact lacks the future tense, and has to use the progressive present to express that, if I remember correctly. However, it has instead a complex system of moods or modal verbs, which express such notions as the probability of an action, doubt, the attitude of the speaker toward the subject or person, and so on. This book discusses these complex features of Russian grammar along with many others, and has some of the clearest explanations on these topics that I've seen.I thought I'd mention one more aspect of Russian grammar, actually phonetics, that I didn't see in the book, since it's very interesting too. This is the phenomenon in Russian of a consonant tending to assimilate the sounds that come before it, as in the sentence, \\"Ya yedu va gorody,\\" where the \\"g\\" sound affects the prononciation of \\"va\\" word in front of it. English has just the opposite tendency, as in word, \\"dogs,\\" where the \\"s\\" sounds like a \\"z\\" instead of the normal \\"s\\" sound because of the affect of the voiced g. Hence, English has forward or anterograde assimilation of consonants, and Russian has the opposite, or regressive assimilation of consonants.Overall this is another outstanding study outline from Schaum that I can recommend especially to first year Russian students, or anyone needing a quick review of this subject."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Russian Grammar","review":"This Schaum isn't for the faint of heart, it's for serious students of the language. As such it's excellent. A very comprehensive grammar trainer it will work your grammar skills to a fairly high level.

I started out with Teach Yourself Russian Grammar by Daphne West, and while it's a great grammar text for the casual self student, Schaum's is better and will take you farther.To get the most from this you'll need to really work at it, but I hope to graduate from this to Terence Wade's grammar text and workbook."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Russian Grammar","review":"This is one of the best grammar books I have used!Having studied Latin, French, Spanish, Hebrew, German, Russian and English, there is no doubt in my mind that Russian grammar is up there in the first or second place in difficulty. This book does an excellent job of presenting complex material in a clear and straightforward manner. Dr. Levine organized the material so you can use the book as a study aid and as a reference book. He introduces each topic with definitions and general rules, and follows with numerous examples with corresponding English translations. He summarizes the topic with appropriate tables and a thorough review, using extensive exercises, with answers in the back of the book.Worth mentioning is the particular sensitivity of Dr. Levine to the English-speaking student. Subtle points which are common pitfalls for English speakers learning Russian are brought up and examples given."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Russian Grammar","review":"I recently bought this book along with the New Penguin Russian Course, and the two complement each other very well. The way the Schaum's Outline of Russian Grammar is set up, you could use it with just about any type of Russian lessons, but I think it would be particularly helpful with conversation heavy systems like Pimsleur or Immersion method. The concepts are presented matter of fact and the exercises are very useful to use as self-drill. The overall layout, from a \\"this is how we'll break down the grammar rules\\" perspective is also very easy to understand, without skimping on the complexity of certain issues like verb aspect, or uses of the conditional mood, or irregular case endings. It even has stress marks (inexplicably omitted from Schaum's Vocabulary Outline) which are certainly the most important thing after learning the alphabet in terms of learning Russian pronunciation and intonation. Also, there are many explanation of shades of meaning implied by slight changes in grammatical usage. This book has been so helpful and useful that I just can't imagine a serious Russian student, particulary a do-it-yourselfer, not having it on hand."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Russian Grammar","review":"I recently went on an Amazon.com shopping spree and purchased about 10 different books designed for learning Russian. It is now almost a month later, and I can honestly say that Schaum's Outline of Russian Grammar is head and shoulders above the rest in terms of how useful it is for an independent, self-studying student like myself.The book is organized into several chapters, each covering a major part of speech (Nouns, Pronouns, Adjectives and Adverbs, Prepositions, etc) and each of these chapters contains MANY practice exercises so you can test yourself on the things you've learned. Each of the 239 practice exercises is made up of between 10 and 20 questions that review the grammatical concepts discussed in each particular section. They vary in format, from fill-in-the-blank, to combining two sentences into one, indetifying the case of underlined words, changing the tense/case/number of words, and more.So in summation, if you are learning Russian then BUY THIS BOOK! For the serious independent student it will give an extremely thorough grounding in Russian grammar with practice and drills exactly like you'd find in a standard Russian course at a school. And for those taking Russian courses at a school, it will prove to be a very valuable reference and practice book to help brush up for exams."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Russian Grammar","review":"I can't rave enough about this book. I've gotten several grammars and do-it-yourself courses, but this book lays it all out on the line in simple, easy to follow language.

Combine that with the vocabulary that can be gleaned from the text, and you have your key to the russian language.

I particularly like the idea of a lady James Bond -- the heroine being a U.S. undercover special agent around whom all the actions evolve. Diana McKenzie posed as the widow of the recently killed (or suspected murdered) Peter Foxe in order to get near his brother Lord Matthew Raleton who was the prime suspect of an international hi-tech smuggling ring. Lord Matthew, an English aristocrat, was rich , handsome and very intelligent and perceptive. He was also very affectionate towards his family. He never believed that Diana was his bother's widow despite the marriage certificate and was suspicious of her intentions. Nevertheless, he was attracted to her and found her more and more desirable. A string of events threw their lives in peril and brought their desire and attraction for each other into the open. Luckily, they were both cool-headed and smart enough to handle the dangers and their own emotions."},{"Title":"The Shadow of Arms (Cornell East Asia Series No 73)","review":"While agreeing that South Korean author Hwang Suk-Young (Hwang) takes a long time laying out his cautionary tale, I found the book well worth the reading. I was exposed to it through a World Lit class at UCLA the summer of 2003 and found it to be a fascinating mixture of Catch 22 and The Quiet American. The three scenes that stood out were the rape scene, the &quot;phoenix hamlet&quot; scene and the description of the transformative power of the American PX in Danang. Hwang is the master of that Asian quiet understatement, the flat laconic narrative descriptive tone. Chalmers Johnson, the retired State Dept. Asian specialist, wrote in his now-prophetic &quot;Blowback&quot; ( just two years before 9/11) that most nationals have no conception of the effect an American base has on overseas peoples. Ironcially it is in South Korea (where an American soldier killed a S Korean in a car accident) that the issue of the American presence looms largest just now.In The Shadow the American PX is the center of the action--it is an endles dispenser of refridgerators, air-conditioning machines and C-rations. The plot revolves around the main character's (South Korean Cpl. Yong Ku) attempts to find out why C-rations are leaking to the Vietcong. This leads him inexorably into the interconnected swamp of corruption that is Hwang's Vietnam. The point is that the problem is not ripping off the PX on the Black Market--everyone does that in fine Catch 22 style--it is that if the Americans find about it the South Korean/Vietnamese part of the game will have to end.Along the way, Hwang paints some disturbing reminisciences of Lt. Calley-like abuses in the field (the rape scene), the quiet disembowelling of Western assumptions revealed in the new hamlet designed by well-meaning outsiders to resettle Vietnamese villagers in model communities with shiny white tiolets. Tiolets that the villagers will never use. Mr. Butler, the State Dept agent, gives a polite speech about &quot;eternal peace&quot; and the complexities of Cold War alliances but it is going over everyone's heads. Not to worry. Major Pham, another black marketeer, is mistranslating the whole effort anyway. On his way out in his Huey Pham estimates it will take a battalion to hold this region--a Billy Joel echo here perhaps--&quot;We held the day/They held the night.&quot;This is the quiet irony without the typical Western guilt that pervades Hwang's narrative throughout--he satirizes the surreality that was Vietnam but lets you draw your own conclusions about the feasibility of East meeting West. Though there are way too many coincidences and side shows in the narrative, this is not a bad text for high school students who want a Third World view of the Western experience in Asia.

Some of the ideas that seem common-sense knowledge were at one time innovations. He describes the researchers who came up with these insights and the processes involved.Particularly interesting is his discussion of the development of Gestalt psychology. The theory's founder, Max Wertheimer and his colleagues, labeled their school \\"Gestalt,\\" a German word that does not lend itself to direct English translation. Loosely, it means \\"form,\\" \\"figure,\\" \\"pattern,\\" or \\"configuration,\\" and has to do with holistically examining things in context. Not only is the whole greater than the sum of its parts, but changing relationships within a system alters the entire organism. Maintaining a system effectively includes relationship management.Of course, I don't agree with all of Sargent's writing, but he provides ideas worthy of our attention. Historically he fulfills his goal of showing what preceded the paradigms used today."},{"Title":"Horse Anatomy: A Coloring Atlas","review":"The coloring atlas of horse anatomy is a wonderful tool for the study and understanding of the horse anatomy.

The atlas is easily approachable by the first time student for its easy and clear graphical and illustrative format. The idea of &quot;do it yourself&quot; it's great.

At the time Carson wrote it, it was one of the few books on the Civil Rights Movement that didn't focus on Martin Luther King and SCLC, and as such provided a welcome addition, even corrective, to the mainstream narrative of the movement. It is also a brilliant analysis of the dynamics of a reform movement and the tensions between leader centered and group centered styles of leadership. The analysis of Bob Moses and his approach to grass roots empowerment is right on target and provides a whole new way for thinking about Freedom Summer and organizing in Mississippi. This book is not for the fainthearted--its academic prose is dense at times and details can be a little confusing for those unfamiliar with SNCC personnel, hence four stars and not five. Nonetheless, it's worth taking time with, and I assign this book regularly for upper level directed studies and recommend it to students for research papers. Whether or not SNCC's achievements were compromised by the antics of former members in the 80s and 90s, Carson's book is a great analysis of its formation, tactics, and dissolution."},{"Title":"In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s","review":"This book is a great account of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee, which was started in 1960 in regard to Segregation on Americas buses and in the Woolworth dining room. This book leaves out no account, and anyone who had anything to do with the movement and SNCC is mentioned in this book. Carson went all out, and I think this book should be required reading in every Civil Rights History course."},{"Title":"In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s","review":"In Struggle recounts the progression of the SNCC from its early days of assimilationism and conventional middle class values, through its radical and militant period, its separatist and provocative period, and then back again into conventionalism and low-level activism. Many SNCC members during its radical period, debated whether the victim should become the executioner. Instead, the victim becomes part of the system, such as Marion Barry's accession to the mayor's office in Washington, D.C. And the idealism of the movement went out the window as well, when in the 1990s much more mundane pursuits took over Barry's life, including crack cocaine and prostitutes. One reason for the winding-down of the SNCC may stem from the conditions that spawned it. Under an oppressive system of the Jim Crow South, the SNCC had a common enemy to fight, and clear goals to achieve. Once the 1964 Civil Rights Act had been passed, and subsequent advances were made at the legislative level, the goals and mission became less clear and less defined. Now that so much had been achieved, the SNCC began to fight amongst itself as each faction attempted to secure ever smaller slices of the revolutionary pie. The cautious liberalism of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations proved fatal to the more ambitious fervor of the SNCC; the legislation acted almost as a safety valve, relieving the pressure that had encouraged the formation of the SNCC. SNCC students were, in their heyday, overcompensating for all the resentment they had from being historically marginalized and held down. SNCC members had discovered their voice and used it passionately, but once people started listening to them, SNCC found itself in the position of not knowing what to say."},{"Title":"Our Culture Is Our Resistance: Repression, Refuge, and Healing in Guatemala","review":"This book shows the true power of photography to capture human emotion in all of it's extreme forms.

I have no idea how salient the book is to other parts of CR.I found the book in dire need of proofreading, containing numerous typographical errors and omissions. The quality of the binding is also poor, though that may be of limited interest to the readers of these reviews. OTOH, the book fell apart by the end of the first week, a large section from the front of the book seperating from the rest. A minor stressor when traveling.The costs listed (including those in US dollars) were very dated and inaccurate. There were many things of interest available to do in CR which are simply not in the book. A trip we took down a rainforest river (best thing we did) and the central market in San Jose spring to mind. Maps are woefully absent as well.On the plus side, we stayed at a hotel in San Jose, which garnered a positive review that was wholly accurate. We stopped at several museums and one shop listed in Pariser's book which we may well have missed without the book. There is a conservation thread which runs throughout the book that parallels our beliefs and priorities.This was the only CR travel guide we looked at, based upon the 4 1/2 star review here at Amazon.

My biggest mistake, however, was to try and read the book from cover to cover like a novel.

It can get very frustrating when you are learning about a particular region and the sentence reads, &quot;...most notably, this region includes. Further down the road...&quot;.

Pariser is of the school that believes that selling the environment as a tourist attraction will contribute to its preservation in a commercial world. Minimum impact is an obvious consideration as he guides visitors gently through the rainforests or along the coral reefs. However, conventional city trippers won't be disappointed by Harry's 21 pages of detailed accommodations listings for San Jose, and it's significant that pricewise he starts at the top and works down. Smaller numbers of upscale visitors will leave fewer footprints than backpacking masses from Lonely Planet. Harry's eco-friendly values are also reflected in his detailed six-page chart of public bus services. Sightseeing from behind the wheel of a polluting vehicle is not his way. The food, festivals, and sports and recreation sections of this book are also very good, and you'll even find a precise guide to the local radio stations and detailed tips on volunteering. This book has an individual flair but it's as professional as they come. It's a welcome change from the stale consumerism of Frommer and Fodor.

I enjoyed it immensely. So, as I opened my copy of 'Costa Rica Complete', I anticipated thorough research and genuine enthusiasm to be displayed in the book. I was not in the least disappointed. It is refreshing to feel the writer's personality shine through the text and he does a thorough job of detailing the information a fellow traveller needs to make his or her trip a fantastic one. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Explore Costa Rica","review":"In \\"Explore Costa Rica\\", Harry Pariser draws upon his considerable experience and expertise as a travel guide writer to compile one of the best and most 'user friendly' guides to what Costa Rica has to offer the business traveler and vacationer. Now in a newly expanded and updated fifth edition, \\"Explore Costa Rica\\" is a 668 information packed compendium that is enhanced with the inclusion of 38 maps, 30 color photos, and 80 black-and-white images. All types and price ranges of accommodations also include some of the best nature lodges to be found anywhere in Central America. Recreational resources and recommendations ranges from whitewater rafting, surfing, horseback riding, snorkeling, and scuba diving, to birdwatching, hiking, whale watching, canopy climbing, and ballooning. Complete and 'visitor friendly' background information is provided for Costa Rican animals, rainforests, history, and culture. In addition to travel basics for neighboring nations, \\"Explore Costa Rica\\" also features volunteer opportunities, language schools, environmental organizations, and covers transportation by car, bus, plane, and ferry. Enhanced with the addition of thousands of thematically appropriate websites, phone and fax numbers, and access to internet updates, \\"Explore Costa Rica\\" is an invaluable and superbly organized resource for planning any sort of trip to or within one of the true gems of Central America."},{"Title":"Explore Costa Rica","review":"I found the organization of this book rather good. Particularly useful is the itinerary list on the publisher's website which helps you to select among the many options available, and there are updates available there as well. There are many good suggestions for choosing a nature tour, and the coverage of national parks is outstanding.I went on a great hike which I found detailed in this guide book. The background information on society, culture, as well as other information on the country of Costa Rica, I found very valuable. It put the country in perspective for me. He obviously cares about environmental issues and this is different from other guide books I have read.I found the photos top notch, and was drawn to the book first by the cover photo of the volcano. In all, I had a great trip, helped by following the author's suggestions for things to do, and places to stay."},{"Title":"Explore Costa Rica","review":"I just went to Costa Rica a few months ago and found this guide above the rest in depth and eco-friendly suggestions. Mr. Praiser is a great travel writer and it is little surprise that he won the &quot;Lowell Thomas&quot; award for best travel book."},{"Title":"Explore Costa Rica","review":"As the President and Founder of the B &amp; B association, I have visited more than 300 of our B &amp; B's . I highly recommend Harry S. Pariser's &quot;Explore Costa Rica&quot;. Mr. Pariser travels frequently to Costa Rica and his book is attractively designed and well written and updated. He also supplies information on more of the out-of-the-way places wich other guides fail to mention."},{"Title":"Explore Costa Rica","review":"Harry Pariser's &quot;Explore Costa Rica&quot; is the best coverage of Costa Rica that I've seen--with much detail on rainforest tours, kayaking, biking and diving excursions, remote lodges, large and small hotels inland and on the Caribbean and Pacific Coasts. Whether you want to trek through the jungle, watch thousands of wading birds, frolic with the monkeys or relax on a gorgeous beach, this book is a valuable planning tool."},{"Title":"Explore Costa Rica","review":"I was deeply disappointed with this travel book. It is merely a list of hotel and restaurant options (with a few activities thrown in) that does little to help you separate and decide what is worthwhile. The overall organization is terrible as is the index.In the section on sports there is nothing on hiking tours and hiking is not in the index.You will do much better with Lonely Planet!"},{"Title":"Explore Costa Rica","review":"I found &quot;Explore Costa Rica&quot; incredibly user friendly in terms of easy to read text, wonderful descriptions of resorts, inns and jungle haunts to stay, maps, color and black and white photos. It covers absolutely everything one needs to navigate the rainforests, beaches, rivers--including the guided tours, wildlife tips, safety, history and complete travel details. It's a gem."},{"Title":"Lord of the Night","review":"Similar to Black Library authors such as Dan Abnett, Graham McNeill and Ben Counter, Simon Spurrier recognizes what the 40K universe is all about. That is to say, he fully appreciates the depth of the nuance and complexity which make the setting the richest tableau this side of Middle Earth. Fortunately for us readers, he also knows how to weave an engrossing tale that takes full advantage of all that Games Workshop's colorful backdrop has to offer.Lord of the Night is the story of the Talonmaster, an ancient Night Lords chaos marine lieutenant desperate to recover a lost chapter heirloom hidden somewhere in the vast depths of an ancient hive city. In the course of his search, the Talonmaster must confront scores of underhive gangers, units of Adeptus Arbites and the persistent attention of a determined junior interrogator and her inscrutable inquisitor mentor. Perhaps more importantly, he must also come to terms with his distant past and the alternating grief, paranoia and rage which have dogged him for centuries.The Talonmaster is more than just a mindless pawn of Chaos, bouncing from one orgy of death and destruction to another. His cruelty is calculated, his violence directed. He is an ally of Chaos but not its servant. The Talonmaster strives at all times to remain true to the teachings of his long dead Primarch whose death a millennia earlier still haunts him. The richest parts of the book are those flashbacks in which the Talonmaster recalls the brief time that he spent fighting and learning at the side of his beloved Primarch, Konrad Kurze. If you enjoyed the White Dwarf article from a few years ago detailing the origins of the mysterious Kurze and the formation his Night Lords legion, you will love Lord of the Night. The insights into the genesis of the Horus Heresy and Kurze's subsequent fall from grace are alone worth the price of the book. I particularly enjoyed Kurze's take on the tragic rift which developed between him and the Emperor even before Horus turned traitor. Kurze's grievances against the Emperor and the Imperium are coherent and compelling and in that sense, Lord of the Night is somewhat reminiscent of Gav Thorpe's, Angels of Darkness.Highly recommended to any fan of either the 40k universe or of great science fiction."},{"Title":"Lord of the Night","review":"It could be a little confusing in the beginning if you do not realize who's perspective the author is describing. Once you get past this, the story develops just fine. It is basically a tale of two diametrically opposed individuals who's paths intersect and through introspective journeys, each one discovers their own place in the 40k universe. It is different from what they believe it to be in the beginning of the novel. This all unfolds against the squalor, violence, intrigue, and corruption of an Imperial Hive. Many subplots are revealed as the story progresses. What initially begins as the story of a rampaging Chaos Marine, develops into an orchestrated series of manipulations that culminate in a conclusion that has little meaning to those swept away in the resulting carnage and cruel revelations. The aftermath alluded to in the novel's epilogue is somewhat anticipated, but is no less poignant. Everybody is entitled to their opinion and if they choose to focus on aspects of this story they disliked, then let us mourn their lost time. For me, this novel was yet another fine example of Simon Spurrier's talent as a storyteller. I look forward to the sequel if it is currently in production. I strongly recommend you read this book and if you enjoy it as much as I have, you should check out 'Fire Warrior', which gives a similar insight into the life of a Tau soldier."},{"Title":"Lord of the Night","review":"An overall entertaining novel by Simon Spurrier, slow start but finished well. The story of lost power, madness and supposed betrayal in the 40K universe (there's alot of that going round). A different perspective view of what happened prior to the Horus Heresy and the Emperor of Mankind's inner circle. A bit of an eye opener !!!Recommend you read it."},{"Title":"Lord of the Night","review":"Spurrier has talent. This is a really nicely written book about the (even) darker side of WH40K (as though it wasn't dark enough already). It's great to see the workings of an evil mind ... There's some great character development here, and I found it engrossing. It's not the best of the bunch (I think Abnett and Goto are better), but Spurrier is getting there. I'm looking forward to whatever he does next."},{"Title":"Lord of the Night","review":"When I first started getting into the immense world of Warhammer 40k I knew I was going to be immediately hooked. There isn't a book in the series I wouldn't pick up. Every book is flawlessly written and you will be suspended so far into the plot that you will be rooting for your \\"favorite\\" army.\\"Lord of the Night,\\" by Simon Spurrier is the exact book that had me sold on my \\"Favorite Army.\\" If you are a fan of Science Fiction/Fantasy, enjoy reading of complex characters, settings, and plots that will leave you moved, and are sick of \\"Jedi\\" being able to do it all then this series is for you! Just pick one up that looks appealing and begin reading, I guarentee you'll be impressed!"},{"Title":"Lord of the Night","review":"Im not sure why this book hasnt gotten more raves than it has. This is and excellant,well written story and is much better than I expected it to be. The development and uniqueness of the Night Lords is very well done, as is the character development of the Inquisitress. The w40k fiction universe is fantastic,but in desperate need of some fresh life and different character behaviors. This book really achieves that, and I would love to see a sequel."},{"Title":"Lord of the Night","review":"I just finished Lord of the Night and really enjoyed this book. It is about Zso Sahaal, a traitor space marine, who is the leader of the Night Lord Legion and must recover a stolen artifact. The book is about instilling fear into your enemy. There is lots of action and gore. The book is very vivid and there is wonderful character development. The book alternates between the two protagonist's points of view but flows well."},{"Title":"Lord of the Night","review":"A great read, was hooked from start to finish. The characters and history are well written and you find yourself being carried along in just the right way.I loved the book and was sorry to finish it.Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Lord of the Night","review":"However I've read better. Alot of the time Simon spent describing the main character, I couldn't tell if he was talkinga about a chaos marine or an insect. It was damn slow getting going, but about a 1/4 of the way into it, it definately got my attention. Apart from the insect like descriptions of the chaos marine, and the slow moving of the first 70 or so pages, it's not a bad book. Not the best offering from the Black Library, but certainly not the worst."},{"Title":"Lord of the Night","review":"I bought this book a month ago, more or less, and when I received it, I found the best backgroung history of 40K books I've ever read.Just buy it."},{"Title":"Lord of the Night","review":"In all truth this was an amazing book in all respects but one. The beginning was a tad slow, but the rest was intensely satisfying. Vivid language, tons of gore, and a dramatic plot line add up to make a wonderful book. I recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Lord of the Night","review":"kill a million men and they will queue to your face. But kill a single man and they will see monsters and devils in every shadow. Kill a dozen men and they shall scream and wail in the night, and they shall feel not hatred, but fear. Lord of the Night is about a traitor space marine by the name of Zso Sahaal the leader of the Night Lord Legion. The story starts of with Zso's mark of his lordship being stolen from him. He goes after the man who had planned this raid and finds out a even bigger plot behind the heist. Zso goes through many experinces and people to reach his treasured prize....."},{"Title":"Lord of the Night","review":"I found LotD to be enthralling and unputdownable. I can't wait to see a sequel to this novel with the Night Lord and the interrogator characters coming back again. Fantastic!!!!"},{"Title":"Lord of the Night","review":"Love the Warhammer 40,000 book series, it reflects how are world seems to going thru the similar problems in our day and age. The characters are well thought out and the storys keep you wanting to read more."},{"Title":"America in Poetry: With Paintings, Drawings, Photographs, and Other Works of Art","review":"Charles Sullivan has given readers a fine book which they will refer to again and again. His selections of poetry and art reveal a keen knowledge of both, all to benefit of readers. Long live this book"},{"Title":"Israel's Air Force: 1948 To Today (Military Power)","review":"More than almost any other nation on earth, Israel relies for its survival on a large, superbly trained and equipped air force ready for instant action. Sam Katz, a veteran profiler of the world's elite counter-terrorist and police forces gives an excellent overview of how this amazing organization operates. The highlight, however, is undoubtedly the chapter on the incredibly demanding selection and training process for Israeli pilots. Katz's trademark &quot;buff&quot; prose grates after awhile, but overall, a fine handbook."},{"Title":"Israel's Air Force: 1948 To Today (Military Power)","review":"Samuel Katz, an IDF veteran of Operation Oeace for Galilee, is also a veteran chronicler of the Israeli Defence Forces and an experienced terrorist profiler. His sabra (native-born Israeli) wife helps give him an edge over non-Hebrew-speaking IDF researchers.Israel's Air Force - The Power Series is a great book to gain information about the Hel Ha'Avir or the Israeli Air Force (IAF). The book is a great complement to other IAF book such as those by Lon Nordeen, Peter Mersky, Salvador Huertas, or others. What it offers that others don't is a chapter-by-chapter overview of the IAF that is easily accessible. Chapters cover such details and information as: A comprehesive introduction, a great IAF history up to 1991 including a rivetting story of the rescue of a downed flier in Lebanon, background on IAF pilots and training, IAF airbases, the helicopter forces (a relatively new branch of the IAF), the IAF Aeromedical Evacuation Units, the air defence forces, as well as a handy aircraft glossary.I highly recommend this book and its' companion: Israel's Army - Landpower #3005. They are the very best introductory and general volumes available on the IDF."},{"Title":"Manager's Toolkit: The 13 Skills Managers Need to Succeed (Harvard Business Essentials)","review":"This is one of the volumes in the new Harvard Business Essentials Series. Each offers authoritative answers to the most important questions concerning its specific subject. The material in this book is drawn from a variety of sources which include the Harvard Business School Press and the Harvard Business Review as well as Harvard ManageMentor, an online service. I strongly recommend the official Harvard Business Essentials Web site (www.elearning.hbsp.org/businesstools) which offers free interactive versions of tools, checklists, and worksheets cited in this book and other books in the Essentials series. Each volume is indeed \\"a highly practical resource for readers with all levels of experience.\\" And each is by intent and in execution solution-oriented. Although I think those who have only recently embarked on a business career will derive the greatest benefit, the material is well-worth a periodic review by senior-level executives.Credit Richard Luecke with pulling together a wealth of information and counsel from various sources. He is also the author of several other books in the Essentials series. In this instance, he was assisted by a subject advisor, Christopher Bartlett, the Thomas D. Casserly, Jr. Professor of Business Administration at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration. Together, they have carefully organized the material as follows. Part I \\"addresses five basic but essential skills needed to build the the foundation of a powerful and high-performing manager\\" (e.g. setting goals that others will pursue). Part II moves on to more challenging skills (e.g. creating and supervising effective team-based initiatives). Then in Part III, Luecke and Bartlett focus on the specific financial tools that every mid- to higher-level manager should understand and learn to apply (e.g. budgeting, the ability to read and interpret financial statements, net present analysis and internal rate of return). I also urge readers to pay close attention to the \\"For Further Reading\\" section which can be found at the end of this book. In it, they are provided with references to recent books and articles -- many of them \\"classics\\" -- which offer additional material and unique insights into the various topics covered in the previous 16 chapters. I especially appreciate the \\"Key Topics Covered in This Chapter\\" and \\"Summing Up\\" sections which precede and follow each of the chapters.Luecke and Bartlett are to be commended for covering such a wide range of subjects and for doing so in depth. For most executives as well as for those now embarked on preparation for a career in business, this may well prove to be the single most valuable volume in the Harvard Business Essentials Series."},{"Title":"Manager's Toolkit: The 13 Skills Managers Need to Succeed (Harvard Business Essentials)","review":"If you are a new manager fresh from being an individual contributor, this is the book for you. It takes you through the key skills you will need to become an effective manager and how to move up the ranks. No, it is not a Machiavellian approach to leadership, it is a practical guide for the real world.The chapters teach you about setting goals for your team with their input. The idea is to get the team moving, but in a way aligned with the enterprise. The next two chapters are on the importance of hiring right (very, very important) and retention. Here the advice in looking for quality rather than quantity rings very true. Also, even though you do want to be careful to retain the right talent, you really do NOT want to keep everyone. Let the slackers go. Encourage them to go!The chapters on learning to delegate and time management are also good for the young manager who is likely to want to do everything him or herself (you know, as they did when they were an individual contributor) and to take on too many task because they don't want to say no. Of course, learning to delegate can really help the overbooking problem.Part II talks about managing teams (and when they are best used), appraisals & coaching, and handling problem employees. The advice on how to terminate employees is very good. That is, get familiar and square will all relevant employment laws, involve HR, and realize that if you miss anything it is likely to blow up in your face.The chapters on developing your career (remember mentor), becoming a leader, and thinking strategically are all important as your career develops. The book's emphasis on knowing yourself and what it is you really want rather than what you think others think you should want is very good advice.The last four chapters form Part III and are about the basic financial skills you will need as a manager. The book takes you through the generic outline of a budgeting process, about understanding the basics of the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. This is a NECESSARY skill. The next chapters on Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Breakeven Analysis, and Operating Leverage are very good introductions. Also, you will need to understand the Time Value of Money. It's on your business calculator. Really.A VERY good and handy guide to basic management.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI"},{"Title":"Manager's Toolkit: The 13 Skills Managers Need to Succeed (Harvard Business Essentials)","review":"The Manager's Toolkit, was an appropriate title for this book. This is not the kind of book that you sit down and read cover to cover over a couple of evenings and pass along to a friend. I conceptualize it more like a file cabinet that sits on my bookshelf containing files on best practices and resources for managers.The file cabinet is organized into three drawers- (1.) Learning the Basics (2.) Reaching the Next Level and (3.) Mastering the Financial Tools. As things come up in my business, I reach into the appropriate file drawer and pull out the applicable files to review on the subject. [...]The book has been useful to me in running my business in several ways over the past couple of months. In the first file drawer, Learning The Basics, I pulled out the file on Characteristics of Effective Goals to help me facilitate groups of stakeholders involved in setting goals for their organizations. I also pulled the file on Defining Job Requirements which had helpful questions to help me write a job description for a new position in my company.In the second file drawer on Reaching the Next Level the file on Managing Teams was helpful for me to better understand how managing a team requires a different management strategies than those needed for more traditional hierarchal forms of management. I also pulled the file on What is Strategy? to help me in coaching a new manager in my organization on how to develop her first strategic plan for her branch of the company.In the third file drawer, Mastering The Financial Tools, I found the Tips for Setting Assumptions on pg. 229 to be helpful in coaching a manager on how to create financial projections.In the future I will probably pull different files depending on what types of management challenges I encounter. The book is laid out in a logical way with descriptive chapter titles making it easy to find what you are looking for. It is nice to know I have all of these resources at my fingertips.Senior managers may want to consider getting a copy of this book for new managers they oversee to give them a quick overview of best practices on a wide variety of topics they are likely to encounter in their new positions. The book is well worth the space it will occupy on your bookshelf in your office."},{"Title":"Manager's Toolkit: The 13 Skills Managers Need to Succeed (Harvard Business Essentials)","review":"Most young managers were outstanding individual performers before promotion to management, and many get the bulk of their basic management training on the job. This concisely written, vastly informative handbook from the Harvard Business Essentials series covers the basic skills all managers need to know. Richard Luecke and Christopher Bartlett divide the book into three sections - learning the basics, reaching the next level and mastering the financial tools a manager needs - with the key topics listed at the beginning of each chapter. We say if you think of this book as the coaching you would receive from a smart, well-connected mentor, you will get an idea of its tone. It contains no esoteric or faddish advice, but solid, practical tips, presented in a way you can use right now."},{"Title":"Manager's Toolkit: The 13 Skills Managers Need to Succeed (Harvard Business Essentials)","review":"The content covered in the book touches on everything a front-line manager will need to be successful. It is not intended to be a textbook or an exhaustive treatment of the subject matter.I especially like the section on career management; most managers consider CM to be something employees do on their own. A more enlightened manager realizes that his/her own success is easily measured by the success of his/her subordinates.If you are familiar with the style & substance of the Harvard Business Review you will be comfortable with this text."},{"Title":"Manager's Toolkit: The 13 Skills Managers Need to Succeed (Harvard Business Essentials)","review":"I am teaching a course on administration and have selected this book as a text.

Over the years, I kept remembering the \\"feel\\" I had when I read this book, but over the years, I had forgotten the title. Recently, PING, it interrupted something I was doing, the title was in my head, and off to Amazon I went. The story was as wonderful as I remember. With a good opening line, a girl is told by her parents about the \\"talking well\\" at a spooky, empty mansion in town. She tells her friends and they form a club to investigate; at the same time, part of the goal of the club is to exclude the snooty new girl in class. The descriptions of the well and the house at night are wonderfully effective for young kids, and the resolutions are great, including the one for the social situation that the girl learns from. What a great book! Highly recommended if you come across this book."},{"Title":"The mystery of the talking well","review":"I heard this story for the first time in the fourth grade. (many years ago) and never forgot how exciting it was. I wanted to read it to my daughter and found it on Amazon. She loved it too."},{"Title":"Uncensored: Views & (Re)views","review":"Why would anyone want to do anything as absurd as reviewing a book of book reviews? Because, unlike the readily available volumes of fiction by Joyce Carol Oates, it is her book reviews and literary essays that allow the reader a conversational intimacy with the author herself. Here, the inner, hungry animal comes out. The sophomoric question posed to Oates more often than she'd care to mention --- What is your favorite book? --- is answered, in a markedly uncomfortable way, in this gripping collection of nearly 40 pieces from the pages of the New York Review of Books, the New York Times Book Review, the Times Literary Supplement, The New Yorker, and, of all things, the Detroit News.With the essay or book review, you get the real Oates, as she, the anti-Hemingway herself, readily admits: \\"...in my nonfiction prose, it is always my 'own' voice that speaks. Often I'm excited by what I've read, and I want to talk about it with others...\\" So, until a tasty memoir comes along, avid readers of Oates --- especially writers wishing to know what makes such a prolific intellectual tick --- are treated to the lyric and objective observations in this collection. While the book contains essays on the personally grotesque and the dreadful of such popular and controversial subjects as Sylvia Plath, Richard Yates, Hemingway, E.L. Doctorow, William Trevor, Robert Lowell, and Don DeLillo, it is impossible not to immediately turn to the end of the book for Oates's powerful contemplation of peace, a relief from the monstrous and the tortured, \\"Pilgrimage to Walden Pond: 1962, 2003.\\"Oates generously shares the moments of revolutionary solitude that made her realize her own important destiny in letters: \\"Reading Henry David Thoreau's WALDEN, that unique and so very American compendium of wit, common sense, a young man's erudition and rhapsodic poetry, when I was fifteen years old in a farming community ... was perhaps the most dramatic reading experience of my life. ...In early adolescence we're primed for life altering experiences, and Henry David Thoreau was mine.\\" She journeys to this magical place outside Concord, Massachusetts, years later to find inspiration and to, remarkably, find the woods and the pond unchanged --- no vicious invasion of Wal-Mart, McDonald's, or Target, thanks to the tireless efforts of preservationists. At this literary and philosophical holy place, Oates writes: \\"...we are provoked to consider what relationship we can have with another person, if we haven't the right relationship with humanity; and what relationship with humanity can we have if we haven't the right relationship with the world that contains humanity. These questions deepen with time.\\" From that peaceful contemplation comes the understanding that just outside those woods, the fiend of America, of humanity, is waiting, one eye open to the dawn.Oates has long been fascinated by the violence of the grotesques in life and literature, those twisted creatures that are the result of broken dreams and broken bodies, the leftovers that the ignorant lusts of life leave after the blind feast of fear, anger, and despair. Poignant then that Oates opens the collection with the suicidal Plath and ends with the silent Salinger. It seems there is no hope from the start in the relationships of artists like Plath to her husband, poet Ted Hughes, as the lovers tear each other apart: \\"...and then he kissed me bang smash on the mouth and ripped my hairband [sic] off ... And when he kissed my neck I bit him long and hard on the cheek ... blood was running down his face...\\"From this brilliant love scene from THE UNABRIDGED JOURNALS OF SYLVIA PLATH, Oates transports us to the memoir TRUTH & BEAUTY by Ann Patchett, in which the author describes her near lesbian, wholly infantile and repulsive relationship to tortured memoirist Lucy Grealy. What would seem drunken passion between two college age roomies --- \\"In a second she was in my arms, leaping into me, her arms locked around my neck, her legs wrapped around my waist...\\" --- becomes horrifying considering Grealy's disfiguring face cancer that makes her resemble a dying boy in a Medieval Bosch.From physical and mental inversions, Oates propels the collection to the worst kind of perversion, the betrayal of writing itself by greed and by censorship when faced with an exposure of love. In \\"Private Writings, Public Betrayals,\\" Oates discusses her initial desire to \\"protest\\" Hawthorne's destruction of his wife's letters.The event, for Oates, leads to a discussion of the sale of Salinger's letters, penned to a young lover. It is here, in the chatty few pages that make up \\"Private Writings, Public Betrayals\\" that Oates reveals herself as the victim of just such a sale by a hostile opportunist, and where she, when set in such a personal situation, appears to advocate censorship of such private writings. And here questions abound. Is it really possible for a well-known author to have private writings? What is writing, if not something that begs to be shared, to reveal, to further the understanding of the writer and the reader, to further the progress of literary civilization? What if a writer destroyed all they had written --- could they still be a writer? Or a destroyer?Confronted with the perceived need for self-censorship, writers from Hawthorne to Cheever, and from Salinger to Oates, have said yes and the courts have agreed. The title of this collection, then, becomes all the more important.Yet, whether physical or metaphysical, these are gnarly badges of honor, these people are living, walking, splattering Pollocks in a mental and physical beauty-obsessed culture --- angry visages screaming \\"Boo\\" in the face of white bread conceit and invasion. In the rich and riveting context of the Oates-as-critic rhythm, the heroic American boxer Muhammad Ali remains mythic as does tough man Hemingway, Fitzgerald fan Richard Yates, and Irish icon James Joyce, living today through the fiction of William Trevor. Each man has a sickness that is dear to the heart, hidden behind the myth, beneath the fishing boat, inside the gin bottle, within the story of the everyday, while each woman beats the grotesque from her breast, wears the monster just beneath her face.--- Reviewed by Brandon M. Stickney"},{"Title":"Uncensored: Views & (Re)views","review":"being a woman, oates must get tossed her share of romances. this volume does include reviews of some stories and novels of romance and loss. trained as a philosopher, oates brings to each book reviewed, her honed skills and deep abiding interests.for the most part, joyce carol oates focuses on british and north american authors influenced by henry james and the james joyce of the dubliners, with a few exceptions. the ghostly is at large in these pages, not merely as suggested apparitions, but imbued as loss of missed opportunities, as chances not taken, of lives shaped by loss and experiences of loss, of lives filled with diversion, distraction, boring jobs, and celibacy; and fantasies provided by authors for their lackluster characters-occasionally violence, psychological and actual, activate memory, which otherwise might never be used, rendering the past forgotten.one example, i'll call it an organization of transcendental quanta, a highly sophisicated arrangement of loss, delineated and described by oates in her review of doctorow's city of god-the genuis of the paranoid's web, paranoid here being the intellectuall, the joycean memory one is stuck with, haunted by the nightmare, as doctorow's protagonist moves through the big city where forms of life, forms of religious life, as belief systems, present themselves to immediacy as protean essences. a variation of the ghostly.in other reviews oates ponders the interior life within exterior existence. there's a theory concerning the physical existence of the soul or life force proven by weighing a human body just after death by which the dead body is said to weigh less than when the body was weighed when living by so many grams, and the difference, the loss, is said to be the vanished soul.the views of the subtitle are viewpoints, points of view, a way of seeing, viewing as direct perception. as oates describes in a concluding essay: the nature world of things and situations and the decisions of others as they effect the writings of authors, and authors themselves, when those writings are in the possession of individuals other than the authors, and used without the permission of the authors (my words, not hers).and (re)viewing is another viewing, not of the thing present, but of the thing as past, of the acts and situations enveloping the thing in the past. the thing, the act, the situation, remembered. and the memory that becomes memoir. of the memory become memoir, oates writes in a garden of earthly delights revisited: (w)e write most avidly to memorialize what is past, what is passing, and will soon vanish from the earth.'in them revisited, she refers to the end of the 20th century (had that essay been written later, oates would had included the beginning of the21st century) as an era of memoir and memoirist fiction.also included are pieces on books about the prizefighters, jack johnson and mohammed ali, and a film memoir.joyce carol oates is a passionate writer and reader of all things literary, and a few things not so literary. she refers to a lots of books as well, which makes this an excellent book to thumb through for something to read."},{"Title":"Crime and Detection","review":"This is a winner. Notice the author's name: E. M. Wrong. Huh. Intro of about 30 pgs, and then the stories are divided into: Crime & Detection, Crime without Detection, and Detection Without Crime. What can I say, this is so cute!! A couple stories by Poe, but other writers are Freeman, Hornung, Pain. 12 classic & unusual stories.Dark green covers, hardback, about size of a paperback, 392 pages. Great deal, recommended."},{"Title":"Have a Cool Yule: Merry Christmas from Will Bullas","review":"This little volume only 61/2&quot; x 7&quot; is a perfect gift for you to give to some harried person you love that has been scurrying around, shopping, baking, cooking, cleaning, wrapping and decorating to make the holidays wonderful. I suggest you put it on a tray with some hot cocoa (with a candy cane in it) and a couple of those Christmas cookies and serve it up with a kiss BEFORE Christmas Eve. It contains 33 colorful and very funny and endearing paintings of charming animals in zany holiday motiff. You'll love them all but my favorite is a big Polar Bear expectantly puckered up beneath the mistletoe, and I know you'll chuckle when you see the walrus in his Santa suit. The only text is a witty caption beneath each picture so there's no &quot;work&quot; to enjoying this book. Maybe throw in a pair of warm slippers when you give this book and stick around to share the smiles."},{"Title":"Early Christian Worship","review":"This book by Oscar Cullman is a brief but scholarly work on the worship of the Church. It has two main sections, the first on the characteristics of worship in the early Church, with the second part exploring numerous passages in the Gospel of John showing the constant themes of worship and the sacraments. Over all, it is a good, helpful book. However, the author's Lutheranism comes out very strongly throughout the book. He seems to relate all of the passages, in some manner, to one or both elements of the Lord's Supper or Baptism, even when the connection is not really obvious and sometimes seems contrived. But still, enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Heart of Empire: Legacy of Luther Arkwright","review":"After devouring \\"The Adventures of Luther Arkwright,\\" I wasn't sure it could get any better than that - but Talbot's follow-up has proven a worthy successor. You can visibly detect the advances in the artwork - bold, bright colors, smooth lines - a pleasure to look at. The story fills in a lot of gaps and answers a lot of the questions I had about the first one (which at times could be confusing, but nonetheless brilliant) and provides a lot of insight into the lives of the characters. I love the undertones of religious and political commentary, but meanwhile staying sexy, imaginative and engaging. Overall, a great read."},{"Title":"Heart of Empire: Legacy of Luther Arkwright","review":"I've read a lot of graphic novels and this is in my all-time top 10 list. Beautiful line artwork, really intense colors, good plot and dialog, and a bawdy sense of humor. I liked this even better than the first Luther Arkwright books, and could be read without reading the first books beforehand."},{"Title":"Heart of Empire: Legacy of Luther Arkwright","review":"When Bryan Talbot was putting Heart of Empire onto paper he may have not realized that he was cementing his position as one of the comic greats. The reason I say this is that Talbot has created a sequel to The Adventures of Luther Arkwright that matches the original. This is a very hard feat to accomplish, often when a writer tries to create a sequel to a seminal work it pales in comparison, just look at Joseph Heller's Closing Time or Frank Miller's The Dark Night Strikes Again. However this does not happen with Heart of Empire. The main reason that this does not occur is that Heart of Empire is not a direct sequel of The Adventures of Luther Arkwright. Heart of Empire instead acts as more of a spiritual sequel with Luther's daughter Victoria as the protagonist. By separating the two books Talbot allows himself to go in a separate direction both thematically and artistically. First off Heart of Empire is a lighter story with constant humor and a little less drama. The art reflects this, with vivid colors and a little less complex line work. All of this combines to make a very different book than The Adventures of Luther Arkwright but one just as fulfilling. So overall I cannot recommend this book enough for it is truly a worthy successor."},{"Title":"Heart of Empire: Legacy of Luther Arkwright","review":"When Bryan Talbot was putting Heart of Empire onto paper he may have not realized that he was cementing his position as one of the comic greats.

I haven't read the book this is supposedly a sequel to, yet, but I certainly intend to now! I should note, I do tend to enjoy Victorian-flavored alternate history in general (like Phil Foglio's Girl Genius series, which is admittedly MUCH sillier than this). Papal assassins. A countdown to disaster. Massive neat-looking airships, and city streetcars that look like dragonflies ..."},{"Title":"Heart of Empire: Legacy of Luther Arkwright","review":"This is simply the most intelligent, intricate graphic novel that I have ever read. It contains the most stark mixing of sacred and profane elements- and yet it works. To put it mildly, it works. It is a continuation of the story of the shaman/savior Luthor Arkwright (I fully recommend the original _The Aventures of Luthor Arkwright_). Every time you pick this book up you find something new in the complex story line or intricate artwork. Only a writer/artist could produce a work like this, for only a person who thinks in images could master the symbolist world view that it mirrors. Here you have alternate universe after alternate universe- yet all connected by underlieing currents and patterns. As above, so below.Oh yes, it also has a healthy amount of English working class bloody mindedness- something that we in America are becoming increasingly familiar with as the corporate &quot;upperclass&quot; tries to turn this society into a rigid caste-based oligarchy...."},{"Title":"Heart of Empire: Legacy of Luther Arkwright","review":"Filled with undercooked characters, luridly painted with bloody entrails and decorated with vomit, the second Arkwright saga displays numbing levels of gross without any of the literary force that makes \\"Adventures\\" still hypnotic more than twenty years later.Rendered in vivid colours, this new tome by master Talbot is overtly concerned with tripes; the very guts of the Empire Luther Arkwright helped ascend. Thorough financial, political and personal corruption is the lot of the royal family and thence visited upon the reader.\\"Adventures\\" of course, was no stranger to the crass realities of being human: police batons textures with protester brains, filth and squallor in Whitechapel, honestly brutal representation of combat and war, scenes of sexual congress that were often quite beautiful. \\"Adventures\\" is, if anything, a celebration of the maddening, heart-breaking, bloody and sublime symphony of humanity.\\"Legacy\\" by contrast is shockingly childish; obsessed with filth, blood and guts like a mildly retarded infant going through their developmental phase, discovering their own bodily functions and reveling in every excretion. Though endearing in one's own lineage, the poo-poo of others is best served in context. The point was to assault the reader with just how corrupt the empire has become in the intervening years. But such an explication would be mere ruse. The book is very thinly storied for all its plot development and the characters, with one exception, sound and act like caricatures. Talbot has either forgotten or put aside any interest as to what once animated Rose Wylde and Queen Anne or, verily, what makes human beings tick.This is a very far cry from the muted insights of \\"Tale of One Bad Rat\\" or the fairly complex relationships in the previous Arkwright tale. Instead the reader gets a stock Vatican assassin who is a sexual predator, scheming weasels who are gay and racism depicted as if the author had never in his life heard such comments from other than stock villains in a Hollywood actioner. Indeed, most of the book reads like a jack-in-the-box: always in your face and never any cleverer than \\"boo!\\"The one exception is the Princess Royal, the only character possessed of any sort of self within her eerily thin, mesmerizing shell. Tall, small-breasted, haughtily beautiful and white-haired like her father, Victoria is the one redeeming value in this frozen dinner sequel to one of the greatest graphic novel banquets ever released. Following her glowing blue eyes from panel to panel is the only way to enjoy this Jack-the-Ripper-and-Judy show. Arkwright himself shows up late in the tale and is bland beyond belief, spouting supermarket-aisle nonsense as a mere prelude to have him dive into bloody action. So much for Eastern philosophy.\\"The Adventures of Luther Arkwright\\" belongs in every comic book lover's library, proudly sitting on a shelf with \\"Watchmen\\", \\"V for Vendetta\\", \\"Cages\\", \\"Signal to Noise\\", \\"Blood of Palomar\\", \\"Elektra Assassin\\", \\"Stray Toasters\\", \\"Metropol\\" and many other pioneers of the art form. Not so this book, which is of interest to completists only. Or adolescent minds confusing maturity and honesty with theatrical displays.The most telling artistic device in \\"Legacy\\" is how Talbot made the choice to punctuate his book with shots of Victoria vomiting in the reader's direction. A better trope could not be found."},{"Title":"Aspects of Semidefinite Programming: Interior Point Algorithms and Selected Applications (Applied Optimization)","review":"Semidefinite Programming (SDP), which the author remarks is linear programming for the 21st century, has lately been one of the most exciting and active areas of research in the mathematical programming community. This tremendous excitement was spurred in part by the development of efficient interior point methods (IPMs) for the solution of SDPs, and important applications of the SDP especially in combinatorial optimization. I believe Etienne De Klerk gives an excellent introduction to these two topics, in this short, but concise monograph published by Kluwer Academic Publishers.Topics covered include theory (duality, degeneracy, complementarity, properties of central path), algorithms (primal and primal dual affine scaling, path following, potential reduction algorithms), and finally applications (approximating the stable set and coloring number of a graph, the satisfiability problem, and quadratic programming).Most of the material presented is based on the personal research of the author with other colloborators, and reflect his personal taste, and various insights on the subject. The monograph is probably the first textbook exclusively devoted to the SDP, and can be used in a graduate course on the subject. Personally, I enjoyed it immensely!."},{"Title":"Heart Song (Logan Family)","review":"This is a really good book. I could not put it down and it is one of my faves."},{"Title":"Heart Song (Logan Family)","review":"It took me about two days to read this book. I couldn't put it down. Even though I'm only 14 I loved it. V.C. Andrews is one of my favourite authors and this book is the best in the Logan Family Series. The way Melody and Cary realted really touched me. They weren't afraid of anyone or anything standing in their way."},{"Title":"Heart Song (Logan Family)","review":"I found this book to be one of the best, under this authors name. I love getting rapped up in a series of V.C Andrews books over the summer. I am sure that other people who have read her works can say the same. The Logan series is very sad, yet it always brings hope. Melody is the girl who is always seeking the truth in this world, even though it is so hard to uncover. However she never gives up and her persistence helps her go far. She has character and that is one trait that most people can never aquire."},{"Title":"Heart Song (Logan Family)","review":"I am a loyal fan of V.C. Andrews and I never miss a copy of her books.

C. Andrews books and like many other people, I patiently wait for the next one. I think the Logan series is the best but I think I rate all of her books the same. It was sad to hear of the passing of V. C. Andrews, but it is nice to know and I think she would be pleased of the work that is being published after her death. I know this was suppose to be a review on the book itself but you have to recognize the people behind the book that make it possible for her books to read by everyone. I do recommend you read her books and don't just read the ones that are mentioned in these reviews but take the time and read all of her books. Trust me, you won't be dissappointed. Thank you for the pleasure of reading her books even though she is no longer with us.

Her books are filled with a depth and emotion that are rarely found in novels now a days. It was obvious from &quot;Melody&quot; that there was a connection between Melody and Cary. I've wondered ever since reading the first Landry novel that is Laura really dead? I don't remember it being said that a body was found. And those things that were found on the beach. It's all quite suspicious. I think perhaps she was fed up with her family, especially her father, and just took off. Left the Cape forever. I would have. I think the ending of the book was great. Melody going off to find out if the woman in the magazine is her mother. I can't wait for &quot;Unfinished Symphony&quot; to find out."},{"Title":"Heart Song (Logan Family)","review":"Im happy to say that the new line of books after Mrs.Andrews death have not disapointed. Melody is an exeptional young woman dealing with tragedy in the best way facing it head on. I really hope that Cary does not turn out to be her brother as i suspect may be the case. In this book youll go through a full range of emotions especially anger at all the stone walling that Melody faces and yet she comes through it all being stronger than when she started. It seems to me that the mystery is just beginning so if you like getting a book and knowing you wont be able to put it down till your done this is the one for you"},{"Title":"Heart Song (Logan Family)","review":"Melody has a good job working for Kenneth over the summer. Kenneth told Melody that he and his dad Nelson tried to help her mom Haille make good choices. Kenneth was disappointed that Haille didn't listen to him. I am sure even Samuel wanted Haille to be successful too. Jacob and Olivia had no right to be blaming Melody for their problems with Haille. I was glad when Melody stood up to Jacob and Olivia. Somebody had to. Jacob and Olivia was stressing everybody around them out. Cary needed every hug Melody gave him. It must have made Cary feel better when he knew he didn't have to face his problems alone. When I read about Melody, her character reminded me of a college buddy I have who is a Scott County sheriff's deputy. I hope if my buddy is reading this, he will consider talking with me about the books of my favorite author VC Andrews. Those books could help him with his work while he's questioning others. I could use more time meeting with people like Melody. People like Melody help people who are in most need of help."},{"Title":"Heart Song (Logan Family)","review":"The thing I liked about this book was it left you still wondering who Melody's father is. Maybe some of you already figured it out but I haven't. In my opinion that's different than what the other series have done. I did get a bad taste in my mouth from the beginning though. It reads:'Cary was happier knowing we weren't as closely blood related as we both originally thought.' ...as though now a true relationship was not forbidden...'WHAT! Whatever. So it's OK to have a romantic relationship with your 2nd, 3rd cousin. Please. This book could've done without that line. Yet I know that that's the way VC Andews books tend to run.I was a little surprised at myself. By the end of the 2nd book in a series I usually end up disgusted with the main character. So far I find her tolerable (despite her and Cary's relationship).I'm glad the book didn't reveal who her father was. It kept my interest into reading into this series quicker."},{"Title":"Heart Song (Logan Family)","review":"Dead mother only memmories of a happy home Dead LOVING father so kind sent to live with her Uncle Jacob and Aunt Sara shes toshed in a whilwind of emotions where she finds people betray you and seek to hurt you in the worst way Cary gives her hope and love at the end of the book I find this book extraordiary with a new spice of writting!"},{"Title":"Heart Song (Logan Family)","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who can't follow a lot of detail, and I would definitely make sure I read &quot;Melody&quot; first if I were you. The book itself I thought was really good. It wasn't quite as predictable as V.C. Andrews' other &quot;second books.&quot; Usually, in the second book, the main character gets thrown into a very rich house with some underlying unpleasantness. In this book, the house she is taken to is just a normal Cape Cod home, it is no mansion. It is very interesting to read as Melody matures and grows up while she tries to find out who she is. There seems to be a new surprise with every page you turn, and her situation changes just as often. In this book, Melody becomes more comfortable with Cary, and she goes to work for Kenneth. Her work with Kenneth is a large part of the book. She even stands up to Grandma Olivia on more than one occasion; that in itself makes the book a must-read if you read the first book. The ending is one that just cannot be missed if you really like surprises. I definitely recommend this book to any V.C. Andrews lovers."},{"Title":"Heart Song (Logan Family)","review":"I read Melody and I couldn't put the book down. Reading it off and on I finished it in two weeks. It is the first novel I ever read and it is probably the best book I've read. Now I am looking forward to reading the rest in the series.

Her use of words and phrases shows that she was born to entertain millions of people with her storytelling. I hit myself everyday for not listening to my friend just because the covers of her books (like Ruby) seems somewhat morbid. She is now one of my favorite authors next to Maeve Binchy. I've got everyone of her books that came out. I just got done with the Logan series. Heart Song was great...a real page-turner. The relationship that sparks between Cary and Melody left me surprised, but dreamy. It was romantic. Grandma Olivia...let's just say when she starts doing what she does best...making people's lives miserable and saving the reputation of the family name, I just want to throw the book at her. She doesn't deserve Grandpa Samuel at all. I also thought that at one point of the book, Melody didn't deserve the undying love of Cary's, but in the end she made up for it. Now...I need to make a review for the rest of the Logan Series."},{"Title":"Heart Song (Logan Family)","review":"I think it was a very good story because it was a romantic story.

In reading Melody it was obvious that Cary and Melody had deep feelings for each other that they could not act on. By this book though they begin to explore their feelings for each other. My one complaint though is that it seems to me that Cary loves and wants Melody more than she does him.

ALso since she and Cary discovered that they weren't really cousins their affection for eachother is starting to grow. As Melody searches for the truth she may find out that some secrets are too painful to dig up. This book was another great book in the Logan series. It was just as good as Melody.

There's nothing really deep or dark here, and the story pretty much plods on. There's some entertaining parts, and of course there is Melody versus Olivia, that is always fun to read about as Melody strives to discover her paternity and the revelations that follow her in her quest to discover this secret - and the surprise twist answer she gets. Overall a fairly entertaining if slow read. It picks up in the next book."},{"Title":"Heart Song (Logan Family)","review":"VC Andrews is amazing. The book is great - all \\"her\\" books are.

Andrews is that I don't think she ever makes clear what time frame she's writing about. I can probably guess, but I know I won't be right. I assume Melody is set during the 70's or early 90's. I can only imagine that Laura is written during the late 50s or early 60s just because of how strict her bible wielding father is. Plus he was always adamant about praying before eating and reading the bible and who Laura could date. I don't think that kind of parenting is common these days, but I could be wrong."},{"Title":"Heart Song (Logan Family)","review":"In the story, Heart Song, Melody Logan, the main character, was living among what seemed strangers to her. Her mother Haille recently died in a car accident so she has to go live with her relatives on Cape Cod, leaving everyone she knows behind in West Virginia. When she gets there, she finds out that they are strange people and have lots of secrets.Melody finds out that her cousin Laura Logan just recently died too in a boat accident. At the Logan's house, her Aunt Sarah thought of her as a replacement of her dead daughter, her uncle Jacob thought of her as the devil's daughter, her cousin May who is deaf always seems lost and confused most of the time, and her cousin Cary, who was the only one that really cared for her.Her cousin Cary finds her a job with a man named Kenneth Childs, he is an artist and her job is to clean his home and studio. Everyone thinks Kenneth Childs is Melody biological father. In the artist's studio, there is a secret room that is always locked. One day, when the artist is gone, Cary comes over and they get suspicious about the room. They open it by screwing the hinges off the door. Melody is very surprised to find pictures of her mom that Kenneth had drew but Melody doesn't say anything about it.One day, her grandma Olivia tells her that she isn't her real grandmother. Her real grandmother Belinda, was put away in a resting home by her sister Olivia because Olivia makes everyone believe that Belinda is crazy. When Melody discovers who her real grandmother is, goes to visit her and the grandmother tells her secrets that no one in her family knows about. Later, Melody also discovers that she and Cary aren't really cousins and after they found out, they reveal their feelings and affections for each other.Suddenly, a surprising accident in the family occurs, her Uncle has a heart attach and decides to tells Melody things about her mother that no one else can know about. Then, one day in a magazine, she finds a model that looks exactly like her mom but cannot be her mom because her mom is dead. So Melody seeks out to find out more about the model that looks like her mom.The story is very interesting because it tells you how a girl has to suddenly grow up when her mom dies and has no body to go to except her relatives that live in a different city and are practically strangers to her and have lots of secrets. It is very exciting to find out how Melody starts to discover the secrets of her family and how she falls in love with her Cary, a guy that she thought it was her cousin."},{"Title":"Heart Song (Logan Family)","review":"This book was rather dull, and it took almost the entire book to let the reader know the identity of Melody's maternal grandfather- we learn nothing else of intrest from the plot. The love scenes between Cary and Melody are a bit much to bear, considering that they are 2nd cousins.But if you consider the fact that no one seems to be upset with the idea that Hallie(Melody's Mom) ran off and married her first cousin we should not be surprised.

It was a quick read, and the timeline of events flowed nicely. However, I didn't realize it was supposed to be a retelling of Beauty & The Beast until I read the author's note at the end. I thought it felt more of like a reverse Pocahontas, with the English settler being a woman, and the Native American being the man. Here and there were some details that were unclear, at times it seemed like Isabella understood why something happened, but I as the reader was never clued in. There was also an immediate acceptance of the magic that the medicine man performed (including little people akin to Brownies or Sprites), that I didn't find believable. As a lady of some fortune, growing up educated as it seemed Isabella had, I don't believe that she would immediately believe in the magical things she was witnessing without some issue. I also thought the ending was rather unbelieveable, and a little unclear.

Both are evenly matched, and both are willing to fight to the death. And yet, one wolf will win. Which wolf is it?The answer is: the one you feed.\\"I'm slowly working through the \\"Once Upon a Time\\" series. The reading of \\"Spirited\\" by Nancy Holder makes the fourth I have read. So far, I have no real complaints about the series. It is shaping up to be about what I expected and more, but allow me to talk about this particular addition.It is early in America's history, May of 1756, during the beginning of the French and Indian War. Isabella Stevens is a young British woman trekking through the forest on her way to her Father's new posting as chief physician at Fort William Henry. They are traveling with Major Samuel Whyte and a troop of soldiers for protection. At the same time nearby their position a young native medicine man tries to heal a troubled heart. Wusamequin lost his wife and child to an attack by the British thirteen months before, and this slaughter left him severely wounded, broken, and incapable of revenge. For thirteen months he lie in wait, his thirst for blood unable to be quenched, until his spirit guide, Great Bear, informs him shows him the way to the British soldiers.His heart lifted Wusamequin runs to tell his people of the presence of the soldiers in the woods. At the same time Isabella hears a strange voice whispering her name and then the word \\"Mahwah\\". She warns the others of this and they take precautions that there are enemies nearby. Soon their suspicions are confirmed as Wusamequin's tribe attacks them. Isabella is overpowered by a man who attempts to rape her but is stopped by the handsome Wusamequin, who was impressed by her fighting spirit. After a number of people are killed Isabella and her father are taken hostage. They manage to escape but Isabella is severely wounded in the flight and must be cared for by Wusamequin, who bargains with the chief to let her live. Suddenly Isabella is tormented, she feels connected to the young medicine man but also feels lost without her own people. Likewise, Wusamequin's heart is troubled because he feels the need to protect the young white skinned woman whom he calls \\"Mahwah\\" but also knows that she is of his people's enemy. This fact becomes muted as the two begin to fall irrevocably in love with one another and it becomes obvious that love transcends all boundaries.There is a definite magical element to this storyline as well. There are the visions and abilities that Wusamequin displays that astound Isabella, for one thing. For another there is the matter of the little people, or Makiawisug, a mythological reference to a belief of the Mohegan people. These make the story take a turn from simple historic fiction to fantasy, but it is not an unwelcome diversion. For the most part a large portion of the story revolves around Wusamequin and Isabella presenting their differences to one another and ultimately accepting each others flaws and strengths as they fall deeper in love with one another. The fairy tale that Holder used as a loose base for the story is \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and the notion that the beast was someone of a different race was something that intrigued me to read this, as I have always been an advocate for equality and multi-cultural unions. This is a beautiful story about courage and overlooking prejudice and presumptions to accept people as who they are."},{"Title":"Spirited (Once Upon a Time)","review":"I had high hopes for this book. It sounded really interesting, like something I'd enjoy a lot. But I ended up hating it. I find the characters and their actions to be really unrealistic, and the ending was just totally out there, I can't understand why the author would end it that way. I'd pass this one up if I were you."},{"Title":"Spirited (Once Upon a Time)","review":"1756, Isabella Stevens is on her way to the British stronghold Fort William Henry with her father.

Only he doesn't treat her like the common slave, he is kind and gentle and very sweet. As Isabella becomes to know her captor she falls in love, as does he with her.

I had very high expectations for it after reading all the other books in the \\"Once Upon A Time\\" series, but they were quickly crushed as the book progressed. I didn't like it at all. She abandoned her people (the English) and lived with the Native Americans on her own free will. I think that is so wrong. Yeah, the guy saved her life about twice, but that is no reason to abandon her religion, suddenly leave her father and her people. She basically does nothing while her people die. Throughout the book, she is torn between the Natives and the English. You can't be loyal to both!!In conclusion, do not read this book. It is not a good book."},{"Title":"Spirited (Once Upon a Time)","review":"i just finished reading the book. it was rather good, the conflicts and overall the hole story. though i dont lik romance, the one portrayed in this novel fit is well and...humbly. the sotry did follow the movie version of beauty and the beast, for isabella dus giv herself as hostage 4 the release of her father (sumthign beauty dus in the disney animated movie) and the little sprites (fairy ppl) were equivalent of the talking pots and pans in the movie. however, the reason this book is given 4 stars is because of the ending. there hav been few bks that hav had worse endings, for it was confusing and downright not fit 4 the rest of the book. it was completely unexpected and didnt resolve any real conflicts. 2 anyone who wishes 2 engage themselves in thsi book, i suggest that u read up 2 the last several pgs of the book. only then, would the book b close 2 deserving 5 stars. u hav been warned!"},{"Title":"Spirited (Once Upon a Time)","review":"It is a pity that Nancy Holder's Spirited is set in 1756, a good thirty years before Jane Austen wrote, \\"Beware of fainting-fits...Though at the time they may be refreshing and agreeable yet believe me they will in the end, if too often repeated and at improper seasons, prove destructive to your Constitution.\\" Isabella Stevens, Holder's less than intrepid heroine, could benefit by such excellent advice. She spends the majority of the novel either screaming or fainting and awaiting rescue from her tall, dark, handsome, and brooding captor.Oh dear.Spirited attempts to be a romantic, historically set, fairy tale retelling. What it is is a tamed bodice ripper with an incongruously tasteful cover. As such, it is unlikely to appeal to anyone who picks it up expecting an insightful exploration of Beauty and the Beast or even a decent historical fantasy.The few parallels that exist between Spirited and the fairy tale it retells are tenuous and oddly distorted. Isabella does offer to remain captive to Wusamequin's tribe in exchange for her father's freedom. However, she actually ends up staying because of a botched escape attempt in which she nearly impales herself upon a branch in the forest. If anything, Spirited uses the basic framework and fantasy of the fairy tale as an excuse for a bad romance with remarkably little awareness of its own absurdity. The fantasy elements are incorporated badly, making suspension of disbelief difficult, particularly in the ending scene, which unfolds with all the cheap flashiness of a B grade horror flick.Spirited works no better as historical fiction, though Nancy Holder has clearly done some research into Native American names and traditions, and Isabella's initial prejudice towards the Native Americans as savages is understandable. However, the fairy tale parallel which makes Wusamequin (the quintessential noble savage) the beast is a disheartening echo of colonial ideology. Holder's portrayal, while sympathetic, is not sensitive. It is both a surprise and a relief that she does restrain from completely vilifying either settlers or Native Americans.Any redeeming value of the novel stems from the fact that Spirited can be genuinely, laugh-out-loud, funny. Holder's overwrought prose and tendency toward melodrama make many of Isabella and Wusamequin's adventures unintentionally hilarious. Isabella and her appropriately tormented lover take themselves so seriously that they almost deserve each other. Still, it's difficult to recommend Spirited when there are so many books that succeed in what it fails, like Robin McKinley's two retellings of Beauty and the Beast and Jackie French Koller's YA colonial romance, The Primrose Way. The Once Upon a Time series is stylishly designed and occasionally charming, but Nancy Holder's Spirited is not amongst its better entries.Ailanna"},{"Title":"Spirited (Once Upon a Time)","review":"Spirited is not the best beauty and the beast retelling I have read by a long shot. I far prefer both of Robin Mckinley's books, and Napoli's beast to a lesser extent. In Spirited, the threads to the fairy tale are recognisable, but few, the fantasy is at a minimum (though I still enjoyed it), and the plot (like most in the once upon a time series) is too rushed. Still, it was far better than the last in the series, Scarlet Moon by Debbie Viguie, which was so inacurate I cringe to think about it. Although I don't know much about early colonial and native american life, I saw nothing blantantly wrong with the information in Spirited.The book does not hesitate to get into the action. It starts with Isabella riding in the woods with her father (a doctor) and some soldier escorts, on their way to bring medicine to another town. A young shaman named Wusamequin learnes of their presence through the help of a spirit guid. English soldiers killed his wife and son, so he does not hesitate to get his village to attack.While the indians attack, Isabella stays to fight. She is a truely brave and loyal girl, who proves herself again and again through the book. Although she acts childish on occasion (she is 16) she usually acts with maturity and practicality, taking in her new station with little complaint. She is attacked, but Wusamequin saves her, although he can not tell why.After the dust of the battle settles, Isabella and her father are taken prisoner. Once at the village they are about to be killed, but Wusamequin again intervenes, claiming they should be randsomed. Isabella offers to stay while her father takes the medicine to the sick. This is one of the few parallels to beauty and the beast. And in this case uneccesary because they make an escape attempt, which the father succeeds in. Unfortunetly, Isabella gets cut while running. Wusamequin finds her, then nurses her back to health.After that, most of the story is about Wusamequin and Isabella's developing relationship. Near the end the plot once again reverts to beauty and the beast (this time with more success). The end seemed a little forced, with prematurely ended plot threads. Both of which could have been fixed with a longer bookAll in all, this was a pretty good read, good for a quick read during the weekend."},{"Title":"Spirited (Once Upon a Time)","review":"I was REALLY looking forward to this book. I enjoyed several others from this series, as well as other books by Nancy Holder, and I love colonial American settings. Boy, was I disappointed. First off, the book claims to be a retelling of Beauty and the Beast, but I could find only the barest hints of that story. Secondly, I found the love story completely unbelievable. I never felt that these two characters loved each other or could be happy together. And the ending came out of nowhere and was just totally bizarre and made very little sense. All in all, I can't find anything to recommend in this book."},{"Title":"Spirited (Once Upon a Time)","review":"Overall I thought this book was exceptionally well written. I very much enjoyed the few words that Natives used to help understand the ways of the First Nations people. I think for sure that this book would have been better if it was longer so it would be possible to sympathize and understand the characters' romance.The only thing I disagreed with in this book was the 'joining of spirits' it's too farfetched. That was not what the Native people did, they did however, have medicine men to help free the spirits. I felt that this book did have quite accurate cultural information, however the ending didn't feel like an end at all. It was like she forgot to write a chapter or something or she didn't want to go into greater detail on what really happened to the main Character Mahwah/Isabella and her lover.I would definitely recommend this book to all young adult readers who like romance books that aren't too cheesy. I like the little bit of culture gave us readers!"},{"Title":"Spirited (Once Upon a Time)","review":"CONTAINS SPOILERS:Right. Well, Holder knows how to set a scene. I bought the book on the strength of the first few pages, when the main character, Isabella, rides with her father through the autumn woods of New England. She's enchanted, and so was I. And when her little escort is attacked, it brings to mind scenes from the 'Last of the Mohicans' movie, which, given the dedication, seems deliberate. And that's alright; good movie, that was.The trouble I had with the story came with the developing relationship between Isabella and Wusamequin, her captor. The story is a retelling of Beauty and the Beast, so I was expecting romance, and it's there. Problem is, it seems contrived, even considering the outlines of the original story. The main thing that Isabella and Wusamequin have in common is their mutual ability to heal people using spirit medicine. And that's a big thing, but they're up against some fairly big factors: the mutual enmity of their people, culture shock, personal violence, and war. Holder tries to get around this using the 'soulmates drawn mysteriously together' thing, along with what looks like a large helping of Stockholm syndrome, but it feels entirely too fast. There's a lot of \\"I like him/her and I don't know why;\\" truth told, I don't know why either. Both characters are likable, in their own ways; both are honorable, and fairly believable (if very heroic) on their own. It's the romance that feels forced. And in a story that is fundamentally romantic, that's wrong, somehow. A little extra time for them to get to know each other would not have gone amiss.Read this book on a rainy day. Read it again a year later. It's not the best book you'll ever read. But you know, it's not the worst either."},{"Title":"Spirited (Once Upon a Time)","review":"Despite the fact that this book has about 272 pages the storyline is very thin, with little to no depth. For Holder to claim her novel is a retelling of Beauty and the Beast is ridiculous! To take just a small, but important fragment of the original story, include it in one's own writing and completely twist it until it makes little sense and the original idea is ruined, is just pitiful. Though I won't refrain from saying that Holder had a good idea going. I just don't like the French and Indian War theme, which she has so ignorantly set her story at. Despite the fact that this book is not a complete success as both the author and I wish it was, the writing is still very good and gripping. Holder has the concept grasped, though she has a problem with execution and expansion of her ideas. For Beauty and the Beast fans like myself, I would recommend Robin Mckinley's novel \\"Beauty\\", it is an excellent retelling of such a classic love story.Beauty: A Retelling of the Story of Beauty and the Beast"},{"Title":"Spirited (Once Upon a Time)","review":"During the height of the French-Indian War, Isabella and her father, who is a doctor with the British army, are making their way to a new fort through the New York wilderness. In the meantime, Wusamequin, a native-American brave who is looking to revenge the death of his wife and child has a vision of soldiers crossing through the lands of his people. In a fit of rage Wusamequin leads a party of warriors against the English.Impressed with the way Isabella fights back, he spares her life and takes her into his home as his slave, though soon both of them begin to realize that they are becoming much more than servant and master.I liked the idea behind the story of Spirited, I love stories where Native American tribes take in settlers and the settlers learn that all they have been taught about \\"Indians\\" is wrong. It's a classic theme I know, but I can't help really liking those kinds of stories anyway. The hitch with Spirited however, is that Nancy Holder decided to insert lots of different kinds of magic and folklore into the plot.For example, Isabella has little fairy beings come to her while she is a prisoner in camp and they help her learn the language and keep her safe from those in the tribe who would do her harm. Now, some little touches of magic in a story are fine with me. I mean, it did take Spirited from the \\"historical fiction\\" category into fantasy, but Holder took it to the next level.Once vortexes started to open and Isabella and Wusamequin started fighting off evil spirits in the dream realm Spirited jumped from \\"interesting\\" and into the ridiculous. I get that this was supposed to be a YA book, but really? It's like I was reading two different books. Spirited started off as a great historical fiction with a little native magic throw in and became a sci/fi fantasy that happened to be set in the 1800s. It reminded me of that episode of \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" where Sheldon is walking around a Renaissance fair dressed as Spock. The two just did not go together.To top it off, in the epilogue Holder says that Spirited was a retelling of Beauty and the Beast. I must be a bigger idiot that I thought, because I totally didn't get that at all. In fact, I was baffled when I read that last part. If I flip through Spirited page by page, yeah OK, I can kind of see the similarities, but a retelling? That's stretching it. A lot.I guess my conclusion is I didn't get Spirited. The plot left me confused and kind of upset at the end, I found the characters to be very one-dimensional even for a YA book, and I put down Spirited feeling very unsatisfied. I have a couple more of these \\"retelling\\" books in my pile, but after this one I might shove them towards the bottom.A very generous 2 stars."},{"Title":"Spirited (Once Upon a Time)","review":"Spirited was generally a well-written story following the life of Isabella Stevens (\\"Mahwah\\") and her accounts of living in the Americas during the French and Indian War. Shortly after the intro, Isabella is captured by Native Americans and taken to their holdings with her father. While she struggles to save her father and herself, she is drawn to the Tribe's Shaman, Wusamequin, whom she owes her life. All the while we learn about Wusamequin and his life, or what was, at least.Although meant to be loosely based on the tale of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", I found this story more original than any retelling. It, too, is mainly about survival and the conflict of \\"forbidden\\" love. But Wusamequin is in no way beastly. He is seemingly handsome, intelligent, and caring, despite his efforts not to be. For this, his character was my favorite.I didn't give the book full points because I feel Mahwah's instinct and common sense was horribly mistaken for courage, when really she would have been helpless without Wusamequin.

The &quot;Inn on the Cove&quot; is located in the suburbs of Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. The cookbook contains about 250 receipes. It includes: &quot;Bountiful Beginnings&quot;- Breakfasts, (just what you would expect from a B&amp;B); &quot;From the Kitchen Stove&quot;- breads, pickles, and condiments; &quot;Teasers&amp; Tempters&quot;- appetizers, soups, and salads; &quot;Main Dishes from Land and Sea&quot;; &quot;The Great Outdoors&quot;- receipes for the barbecue; &quot;Celebrating the Harvest&quot;- vegetable side dishes; &quot;Sweet Finale&quot;- cakes, cookies, and deserts. The receipes are straight forward and practical. Ingredients are readily available, except maybe for dulce, the main ingredient for &quot;Dulce Soup&quot;. This is a seaweed found in the New Brunswick area and very popular for some local dishes. (I think you have to grow up with it or acquire a special taste for it.) Other than that ingredients can be found relatively easy. Neither of the authors have had professional cooking training, but have both grown up with a love for cooking and entertaining guests. So their receipes are not only practical, but tried and true. Unlike some cookbooks originating outside of the United States, the ingredients are given in both metric and the U.S. system of lbs, ounces, tbsp, cups, etc.A local cooking show is video taped at the authors' Inn for broadcast on the Fundy Cable network.

I first read this when it was new, and a few times since then. Although it has been several years, I can still recall the feel and the tone, and I can recommend it to SF and Fantasy fans, and anyone who wants a short visit to a creative and vivid world. The earth is now populated by 4-toed humans with rosewater for blood. These hive-dwellers live beneath the surface, which is dedicated to agriculture. Here and there the dreade 5-toed gene reappears, producing a stronger and more strong-willed specimen. The resulting troublemaker is the star of the story. Choose this one for the language and the off-kilter use of songs and verse. It's an easy read, and you might retain a bit of it for awhile."},{"Title":"Half Past Human","review":"Half Past Human and The Godwhale are the sum total of Thomas J. Bassler's SF output, but even after 20 years, they remain two brilliant points of light, pointing to what should have been a long and brilliant career. I would love to see him come back and take up fiction again- these books rival Cordwainer Smith and Jack Vance in the richness of the world they create. If you read this book years ago, pick it up and read it again. The Nebbishes and their flavored calories are images that will stay with you for a lifetime."},{"Title":"Half Past Human","review":"For all its dark depiction of a future crammed with hundreds of billions of Nebbishes and a few humans, I was moved most by what it said of the here and now. Those of us who can still think find ourselves surrounded by mindless sub-units of the State and wonder how bad it will get. This is one vision of that. It tells a similar story to The Matrix in a completely different way."},{"Title":"Half Past Human","review":"Half Past Human is an intriguing tale of a dark future of overpopulation. The population of the earth stands in the trillions, with most people living underground in gigantic hive cities. The people are genetically engineered to be small, docile and weak, dependant on their cities and immune to the psychological effects of overcrowding. The entire surface of the earth is given over to food production, shortening the food chain to its barest minimum. A few &quot;wild&quot; humans live on the surface, foraging for food in the gardens and hunted as vermin.In the face of all this, the citizens of the hive cities manage to retain some spark of that which makes them human.This is a book well worth the trouble to find."},{"Title":"Half Past Human","review":"T.J. Bass' Half Past Human is a flawed yet occasionally intriguing fix-up novel which was nominated for the 1971 Nebula Award. I found that the atrocious prose overshadowed all the work's positives and made it a chore to read. Bass is a practicing doctor and thus apparently finds it fun to inundate his narrative with medical terminology.Some particularly atrocious examples:\\"Willie froze. Little warning reflexes were activated deep in his basal ganglia -- thoracolumbar autonomics flared\\" (158).\\"Myotonia and vasocongestion of the breasts -- she was well into the excitement phase\\" (153).\\"She had an ovum waiting in her tense follicle and had selected young Moses to fertilize it. Her estrogen flushed body respoded to the presence of Moses -- a sexually mature male. Homologous erectile tissue in her nasal septum swelled... Capillary beads became engorged producing a maculopapular rash over her trunk\\" (123).If this technique was applied in a more limited fashion it *might* have added to the general feel of the work -- however, simply put, it is a frustrating distraction and a failed attempt at originality.Brief Plot SummaryFuture Earth has been transformed for the sole purpose of feeding a massive population. Science has created a four-toed docile/\\"programmable\\"/and communal Nebish (still a \\"human\\" -- or perhaps, a humanoid). Trillions of Nebishes live in gigantic shaft cities with the surrounding farmable countryside (the Garden) operated by programmable mecks. The shaft cities recycle all human waste, the dead humans, etc and are crowded and overpopulated. Depending on the usefulness of various citizens the shaft cities supply the Molecular Reward and calorie allotments. The Nebishes are \\"polarized\\" at various points in their lives when they need to take on a specific gender.Not all humans are Nebishes. The five-toed varieties, called buckeyes, wander the surrounding fields. The buckeyes are not all that superior to the Nebishes for they resort to cannibalism etc and live in primitive huts. Drugged Nebish hunters continuously prey on the buckeyes and take back their bodies as trophies.The novel follows a group of characters both buckeye and Nebish. Tinker, a Nebish, is polarized at the order of the government. After his wife gives birth to an illegal child he escapes with his family to a buckeye village. Moon (a buckeye) and his dog Dan wander the countryside with Toothpick, an unusual mechanical being with a mysterious purpose. Various other characters wander in an out at will. None are particularly easy to emphasize with and when we finally do, Tinker for example, they don't appear again for another hundred pages.There's a mysterious cult of Olga...Unusual pied piper mechanical beings...Final ThoughtsHalf Past Human is plagued with the primary flaws of a fix-up novel -- poor pacing. The plot moves in no particular direction for the first 130 pages and then speeds up exponentially at the point where another novella was stitched in.However, despite the atrocious prose and poor pacing Half Past Human is not completely without merit. I found Bass' unusual approach to mechanical beings particularly intriguing. I also found his refusal to make the external buckeye society a utopian society -- they are squalid and eat the dead Nebish hunters -- an interesting choice.But, my overall impression is a negative one. If you're in the mood for mucking through a biology textbook lexicon in order to get at one of two ideas then go ahead..."},{"Title":"Half Past Human","review":"Wonderfully weird and poetic little novel -- I read it when I was thirteen and never forgot it. Skewed more towards the satirical than hard science, it's a classic dystopian story in the style of George Lucas's THX 1138. I have to agree with the other reviewer who lamented T.J. Bass's disappointingly limited output. I've always wondered what happened to the author after he published his two sci-fi classics."},{"Title":"Half Past Human","review":"This is asolutely, no hesitation, my favorite book of all time. I picked it up by accident in High School and fell in love with it immediately. As I aged and learned more about science and life I got something new from this book every time I read it. I have now read it over thirty times and have worn out three copies (I now own my fourth). Even though I know the outcome I have learned from it every time. I recommend this book highly BUT it is not for the squeamish because the only meat on Earth is, guess what, human."},{"Title":"Half Past Human","review":"I was in high school when I read T J Bass' two brilliant sci-fi novels (Half Past Human and The Godwhale). At the time I was overwhelmed with the futuristic ride, bio-medical buzzwords, and Bass' overall concept of human destiny, and the two books lived on my shelf for decades. This year I re-read Half Past Human and was pleased to find how well he holds up. Bass is not a virtuoso writer, that is true, but he has a clear and consistent style: he sees everything from a perspective of bio-engineering. He was remarkably prescient for 1971. I also love the biblical metaphors that come to dominate the last chapters. The novel finishes as strong as it starts, which can be said for few sci-fi paperbacks."},{"Title":"Half Past Human","review":"I began reading this and quickly gave it up; so fair warning, anything I say below may be unfair, as it's based on 70-odd pages at the beginning and end of the book.This book is written as a protest against the hyper-organization and hyper-regulation of \\"civilization\\"; at the end, one character says fervently that even if it was necessary for survival, civilization would be too high a price to pay. The entire Earth has been turned into an underground Hive-society, run by \\"the Big ES\\", which keeps its three-toed citizens' soft, sun-sensitive bodies sheltered, in return dictating their activities, thoughts, and reproduction; the surface is all gardens, inhabited by robots and by five-toed \\"evolutionary throwbacks\\" (plenty of misunderstood genetics in this story) who live a \\"neolithic\\" life and are bloodily hunted. The one possible originality of this story, which has otherwise been done over and over by science fiction writers of the 50s, 60s, and 70s, is firstly the prominence given to pregnancy and birth (though not well-written), and secondly the fact that it is stated that one way the Big ES keeps Hive people tame is for them to be neuter, and they are not really aware of their surroundings until they are made reproductively active by being \\"polarized\\" with hormones, which makes them more enterprising (at least the males).The book is written in short sentences, with few embellishments except for throwing in 2-dollar words the author doesn't always use correctly. It cuts quickly from scene to scene, switching between characters; but actually there aren't characters so much as what I might call \\"Representative Social Components\\" (which sounds like Hive-speak). This goes double for any females, who are little more than sexual attractants and wombs. All in all, the concept is so-so, the plot is passable, and the writing is pretty ham-handed."},{"Title":"Puritanism and revolution: Studies in interpretation of the English Revolution of the 17th century","review":"Only tenuous connections to the English Revolution unify the subject matter of the essays collected in Puritanism and Revolution, yet the book coherently argues a single thesis: that the English Revolution must be studied in its diversity. Hill proves his thesis by writing essays on a wide variety of subjects: the effects of the dissolution of the monasteries, the use of the idea of the \\"Norman yoke,\\" English ties to internationalism, agrarian legislation, Lord Clarendon, poor relief, political sermons, Hobbes's political theory, Harrington's utopia, an insane vegetarian hatter, a preacher of the end times, a metaphysical poet, and a novel. The wide variety of subject matter itself proves his point. The essays themselves explain only small parts of the English Revolution but convey the larger message.Hill groups his essays into two categories. The first, \\"Movements and Men,\\" looks at general trends over lengthy periods of time. This category largely, though by no means exclusively, deals with economic factors, and its essays are more clearly connected to the English Revolution. The second, \\"Men and Movements,\\" looks at the specific contributions of individuals to the Revolution. It is longer and also more diverse. Though its essays are less clearly connected to the Revolution, its diversity contributes more to Hill's thesis.These essays also are grouped more specifically. The first essay surveys several different scholarly interpretations of the English revolution, criticizing many in their entirety and some in part. Hill then discusses economics, identifying the effects on society of the seizing of the monasteries and nunneries under Henry VIII. In another essay, he classifies the types of agrarian legislation proposed in Parliament, explaining their causes, and defining their effects. Society is discussed in essays about socio-political interpretations of the Norman invasion and rule and about English involvement in the \\"brotherhood of man.\\" Essays about the William Perkins's theories concerning the relief of the poor and about John Preston's political sermons before the king share the theme of the effects of Puritan religion on politics. Political theory is the theme of essays about Thomas Hobbes and John Harrington. Analyses of Andrew Marvell and Samuel Richardson's Clarissa Harlowe deal with the effects of the Revolution on literature. Even the insane gets its share of attention in essays about John Mason's apocalyptic predictions and Roger Crab, \\"The Mad Hatter.\\"Hill's use of the medium of essays to prove his thesis rather than arguing it directly is effective. If not exactly subtle, proving the case inductively rather than deductively still more gradually persuades the reader. The method allows Hill to cover diverse and interesting material and still unify it. By focusing on small areas of the English Revolution at one time, Hill gives the reader his erudition in manageable chunks. For example, only in a book like this could an author justify spending a chapter on Roger Crab, who was interesting but not influential because his interesting diet and habits killed all of his disciples who adopted them.Hill does, however, strain his method. Because the essays in the first section deal with general trends over lengthy periods of time, they by necessity have clear connections to Puritanism and the English Revolution. The essay about \\"The Norman Yoke\\" begins well before and finishes well after any direct connection to Puritanism, but it is the exception. The essays in the second section, because they are about individuals, do not necessarily have so close a connection. The essays on Lord Clarendon, William Perkins, John Preston, Thomas Hobbes, James Harrington, and John Mason are all tied to some aspect of the English Revolution or to Puritanism more specifically. However, Roger Crab is so bizarre that he really has no connection to much of anything, and he is not shown to be an example of a prevalent trend. The two essays about the literary figures Andrew Marvell and the fictitious Clarissa Harlowe both describe products of the Revolution, but why they are products of the Revolution is not made clear. Perhaps uncertainty is to be expected as the outcome of the difficult task of unifying what is intended to be diverse.Hill's work, as might be expected from a Marxist, very often touches on economics. Besides the two essays which are primarily about economics, other essays in the collection are substantially about economics. Trade is discussed in the essay about the brotherhood of man; poor relief is an economic subject; Hill relates the political theories of Hobbes and Harrington to economics. The rest of the essays, even if not about economics, are influenced by Marxist social and literary theories. This overemphasis of economics is regrettable, for in his essay surveying the scholarship of the Revolution, Hill shows more insight into religion than some of his colleagues. He mentions that some historians dismiss Puritan religious beliefs as covers for economic motives but insists that religious beliefs should be studied as genuine. Despite the diversity of his essays, he significantly mentions religion in only a couple of essays and in those the focus is more on politics or society than on religion. The essays primarily about economics are, however, Hill's best in the book.The few problems in Hill's book could possibly be solved by including additional essays. But perhaps a reader's wish for additional essays is additional evidence that Hill has succeeded in proving his thesis, for the reader wishes for more essays because Hill has convinced him that many more such essays could be written about the diversity of the English Revolution."},{"Title":"Puritanism and revolution: Studies in interpretation of the English Revolution of the 17th century","review":"Table of ContentsPrefaceAbbreviations1 Recent Interpretations of the Civil War 32 Social and Economic Consequences of the Henrician Reformation 303 The Norman Yoke 464 The English Revolution and the Brotherhood of Man 1125 The Agrarian Legislation of the Revolution 1396 Lord Clarendon and the Puritan Revolution 1817 William Perkins and the Poor 1958 The Political Sermons of John Preston 2169 Thomas Hobbes and the Revolution in Political Thought 24810 James Harrington and the People 26911 The Mad Hatter 28212 John Mason and the End of the World 29013 Society and Andrew Marvell 30314 Clarissa Harlowe and Her Times 332Index 357"},{"Title":"Puritanism and revolution: Studies in interpretation of the English Revolution of the 17th century","review":"I had to read this book for a grad. course.C. Hill is a great writer, and the book is very easy to follow. However, while his contributions to English history are certainly there, Hill's Marxist view of history certainly has hurt his work. The argument that Henry VIII's rebellion against the papacy created a rebellious spirit in the english people that ultimately led to the English Civil War, is short sighted. It can be argued, as M. Walzer argues, that the nature of Calvinism created a different approach to politics, or a revolutionary one. The way Calvinists percieved the world and their position in it certainly effected the English political culture during the 17thc. However, while this may have some truth, the idea that everything that happened in tyhe 1640s is purely based off Henry's opposition to the papacy needs to be re-worked. And, it has been re-worked by well post-marxists historians or what we would call post-Hillian approahces to English history."},{"Title":"Puritanism and revolution: Studies in interpretation of the English Revolution of the 17th century","review":"This book is now a period piece. It is a collection of entertaining and provocative essays about the events of 1640-1660, which the author habitually presented as \`The English Revolution'. As an interpretation of seventeenth century English history, it can no longer be taken seriously. As a guide to the way that many intellectuals thought about the English Civil War, it was taken very seriously indeed in 1958.Christopher Hill (1912 - 2003) was a brilliant scholar. In 1932 he was awarded a first-class honours degree and in 1934 he won an All Souls Fellowship at Oxford. As an undergraduate he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain and in 1935 he undertook a prolonged trip to the Soviet Union. As A.L. Rowse wrote in \`Historians I have Known' 1995), he \`swallowed the Communist faith hook, line and sinker'. He made his name as a professional historian with \`Economic Problems of the Church' (1956). In 1965 he was elected as Master of Balliol College.I bought \`Puritanism and Revolution' in 1964 when I was studying the seventeenth century at \`A' level. We also had Hill's \`Century of Revolution' (1961) as a text book at school and I was bowled over by both. Christopher Hill seemed to have the explanation for everything - the key to understanding the past and the present; and he wrote in an uncompromising, combative style, as if no-one else had thought of any of this before. He made me feel connected with the hopes of those Puritan revolutionaries for a better future; and that I was engaged in the study of a serious subject. History was not just \`one damned thing after another'. There was a pattern, if only one could see itI learned later that what I was being fed, though in very erudite form, was left-wing propaganda - or to put it in more academic terms, dialectical materialism. Hill had set it all out in \`The English Revolution of 1640' as early as 1940 and, although he refined his ideas, he never changed them fundamentally. The thesis of his many books was always that there had been a social, economic and intellectual revolution between 1640 and 1660 and it was this which caused the political revolution and the Civil War. It had been this violent Revolution of 1640 which, despite the Restoration of 1660, made England the first industrial nation and was the worthy predecessor of the French and Russian Revolutions - not, please note, the peaceful Glorious Revolution of 1688. Hill lent respectability to these underlying ideas by force of repetition - he was a truly prolific writer - but also by dint of his enormous learning. He was the master of seventeenth century literature, particularly of a vast quantity of pamphlets published after the lifting of censorship in 1640, which he found in the Bodleian Library. It is arguable that these only ever represented the more extreme views of a tiny minority of cranks; but this did not trouble him; and his writing was much in vogue in the 1960s when, as Rowse pointed out, \`his nonsense spoke to our nonsense'.Hill's views now seem to belong to another world. The idea that there was an English Revolution in the seventeenth century was long ago exploded by the work of B. H. G. Wormald, Peter Laslett, J. H. Hexter, Hugh Trevor-Roper, Brunton and Pennington, Conrad Russell and many others; and the attraction and plausibility of Marxist historians took something of a knock when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and the state capitalism took over in China - if not before; but, provided one bears all this in mind, there are still some fascinating stories in \`Puritanism and Revolution' . I particularly like \`John Mason and the End of the World', first published in History Today in November 1957.Stephen Cooper"},{"Title":"A Fruitful Vine (Miriam's Journal)","review":"After reading this book, I felt I knew the character and she was an inspiration to me.

He and his publishers have split up his very well received book \`How to Cook Everything' into several separate pieces and is charging for the pieces more than the price of the original book. This volume, \`Quick Cooking' is one of the pieces.The author and the publisher are not trying to hide this fact, although I suspect they will not shed a tear if you buy the book with the impression that this is new material.On the surface, I am sure they will rationalize that they are doing their readers a service by providing parts of this very good book at a lower list price than the whole book. This is pure hokum. The original book is a very good contribution to the genre of \`If you own only one cookbook, this would be it' cookbook. So, why would I want to buy only part of that book? If I want a book on basics, I would do much better to buy Alton Brown's \`I'm Only Here for the Food'. If I want a book on quick cooking, I suspect one of Rachael Ray's books will be better AND cheaper.Speaking of Herr Doktor Brown, he and his Food Network colleague Ina Garten seem to have caught the same case of avarice in that they have had knockoff volumes published with artwork which is based on their best-selling volumes, but which contain cut rate material, or maybe even no material. They are selling pure hype.I have a great amount of respect for all three of these authors. I have even met Alton Brown and find him a truly gracious gentleman who deserves all good fortune and celebrity he can garner. But I do not wish these authors to put out products that some people can easily buy under a false expectation fostered by the product's marketing.Do not buy this book. Buy the complete \`How to Cook Everything' and be done with it."},{"Title":"How to Cook Everything : Quick Cooking","review":"Unlike many readers, I was somewhat uncomfortable with the heft and bulk of Bittman's original master tome, \\"How To Cook Everything\\". Somehow the prospect of having to search through 1000 recipes and several hundred pages for a review of some half-remembered shred of information daunted me, and I couldn't see how the book, as packaged, could hold up to the physical wear and tear of daily cooking. (See some reviewers' remarks about problems with the binding of the Big Book). So I was actually very pleased to see the author and publisher break out these smaller recompilations based around themes like \\"The Basics\\" and \\"Quick Cooking\\". I have both these smaller tomes on my shelves and find them easy to work with and employ.One thing I've noticed about Bittman (I also have \\"The Minimalist Cooks DInner\\", and \\"The Minimalist At Home\\") is that many of these recipes are perhaps more \\"miminalist\\" than they really ought to be. Einstein once said that \\"things should be made as simple as possible but no simpler\\". There is no question that Mark Bittman knows what he is doing in the kitchen, but many of his recipes seem to skew in favor of convenience and simplicity instead of flavor and texture, and if you don't really know what you are doing, his terse directions can sometimes leave you with a 2nd rate (but still edible) dish. Even so, there are enough bits of helpful lore and advice casually sprinkled throughout his books that anyone who pays attention will improve overall in their knowledge and skills as a cook. For instance, in his recipe for a beef stir-fry, Bittman remarks about \\"the holy trinity of beef, onions, and ginger\\"; I read that and said to myself \\"...Yeah. YEAH. That's absolutely right, and I never thought of it quite like that!\\".Many reviewers have remarked on Bittman's \\"calm, encouraging voice\\", and I think this is the true virtue of \\"Quick Cooking\\" as well. Bittman is like an older brother showing you the ropes in the kitchen, casually mentioning ideas and concepts and combinations as he goes along. In that sense, reading Bittman is more like getting a \\"brain dump\\" on his approach to cooking than a structured pedagoical work; it tends to leaves out a lot of contextual detail that might help the less skilled and intuitive kitchen mongers among us climb further up the learning curve.On the other hand, I am never afraid to at least TRY one of his recipes, no matter how imposing it may seem at first glance. And even if I screw up, (you should have seen my first attempt at \\"Bangers and Mash\\"!) there will almost always be enough to enjoy about the results that you will probably decide to give it another shot.Well worth owning if you don't mind the concept of repackaged material and you don't already have the original magnum opus."},{"Title":"How to Cook Everything : Quick Cooking","review":"I have advanced taste but very basic cooking skills, and I use this book more than any other on my shelf -- the recipes are SO EASY, so elemental, and so delicious.

The fish preparations are so good that they eventually led me to Bittman's big book on fish; I also enjoy the steak au poivre and the lamb with red wine and shallots. \\"Broiled Shrimp, My Way\\" is a winning, lightning-quick dish that tastes a lot like the Spanish tapas dish \\"gambas al ajillo.\\"I disagree with the reader who's angry about the breakdown of the larger book into smaller bundles.

Well-developed, it will hold the reader's attention and provides enough detail to give a full scope of Whitney's life and his pioneering transformation of the world's manufacturing process (the 1793 invention of the cotton gin being only a decade long distraction) without being burdensome.

The best thing about this concept was that these were NOT \\"imaginary stories\\", instead, these stories REALLY occured, just in some alternative universe.That being said, the early What If stories are somewhat problematic. Too much time is taken reviewing the events that occured in our reality, taking many valuable pages away from what we really want to know - what happens in the alternate universe.Also, I agree with the reviewer below in that some of the initial entries of the What If? series were weak. The series does get better, and some of the later stories are fascinating, and it's almost a shame that you'll only get to visit these realities for one issue.That being said, this book is a fun read, especially if you like alternate timeline stories and wonder \\"What If.....?\\"This trade paperback includes the following stories:What if Spider-Man Joined the Fantastic Four?What if the Hulk Had Always Had Bruce Banner's Brain?What if the Avengers Had Never Been?What if the Invaders Had Stayed Together After World War Two?What if Captain America and Bucky Had Both Survived World War II?What if the Fantastic Four Had Different Super-Powers?"},{"Title":"What If? Classic Vol. 1 (Marvel Heroes)","review":"WHAT IF? is one of my favorite series from Marvel, the reason being that I loved the concept. It was a great idea from Roy Thomas in which Uatu, the Watcher, would present the events of the Marvel Universe in alternate realities. Even better, these events usually cast a harder or darker aspect on the characters, which, while pretty far-out, always made me happy that we ended up with the Marvel Universe that we did.While I consider many WHAT IF? stories to be classics, the early issues weren't all that well-written, and the artwork was sub-standard, for the most part. Aside from an Avengers issue illustrated by Gil Kane, and a story of Captain America never being frozen in the Arctic, there's not much interesting material here. Many of the ideas Thomas had for these early issues were so whacked-out and pointless, they didn't make for very interesting reading. As such, I feel that the best way for Marvel to reprint this series is the Essentials format: 500 pages in black and white. That way, you'd get quite a few stories that show the evolution of the series, and for a reasonable price. Unfortunately, Marvel instead chose to release a color reprint of only the first 6 issues (~ 215 pages) for the wallet-busting price of $24.95! I also must warn that the recoloring of these issues is absolutely horrible, with characters' costumes changing color schemes from panel to panel, and no attention to detail. So, with a bad reprint of poor-to-average quality stories, newcomers will likely have a hard time understanding why WHAT IF? was so much fun... assuming that the ridiculous price didn't already turn them away.My advice is to skip this book.

This was an entertaining series when it first came out and reading it again almost 3 decades later; I can honestly say that most of the stories have aged well.What If was narrated by The Watcher who posed questions regarding what might have been regarding the fate of our favorite Marvel heroes. Issue one asked \\"What if Spider-Man joined the Fantastic Four?\\" This is a fun story with a surprisingly melancholy ending as we discover that the fates have apparently decided that the famous heroes are destined to be a quartet.Issue 2 asked \\"What if the Hulk had always had Bruce Banners brain?\\" Well, for one thing it clears up a whole lot of misunderstandings. Banner finally earns the respect of Thunderbolt Ross for one thing. But it also has ripple effects that lead to the Avengers never being formed and the disbanding of the Fantastic Four!Issue 3 asked \\"What if the Avengers had never been?\\" This isn't just one of the best \\"What If\\" stories ever written, it's also one of the best stories to come out of the Bronze Age. It also boasts some of the most beautiful Gil Kane art ever.Issue 4 asks \\"What if the Invaders had stayed together after WW2?\\" This was the Roy Thomas story that launched the Invaders series from the 70s. In this story we see a new Cap and Bucky replacing the apparently dead originals, teaming up with Namor, Torch, Toro, Spitfire, Union Jack, Whizzer and Miss America. The story takes us from Hitlers death at the hands of the Human Torch at the end of WW2 up to the Kennedy era.Issue 5 asks \\"What if Captain America and Bucky had both survived WW2?\\" Well, it would be a lot like what we've been reading in the current Marvel universe. Steve Rogers would be director of Shield and Bucky would take over as Captain America. Sound familiar?Issue 6 asks \\"What if the Fantastic Four had different superpowers?\\" This is probably the least entertaining entry out of the 6. In this story, its Sue Storm who gets the power to stretch, Johnny Storm gets powers similar to that of the X-Mens \\"Colossus\\", Reed Richards becomes a disembodied brain and Ben Grimm gets...dragon wings? Oh well, they can't all be winners.Over all, the stories are entertaining, light hearted fare, well written and adequately drawn and reprinted in a colorful, glossy package. Vol 1 includes several of the original Editorial pages from the series and a check list of all What If issues. I had a lot of fun revisiting these stories."},{"Title":"What If? Classic Vol. 1 (Marvel Heroes)","review":"Just recently I started to read comics again and this series was on my to buy/read list. I ordered this book shortly after and it really was a good book. It consists of 6 what if stories that ask what if something different happened in the marvel Universe. This book has:What if Spiderman joined the Fantastic 4?: This based off an old issue of Spiderman where he almost joined the first family of Marvel but in the end he didnt. But what if he did. How much would be different? This story explains that the Fantastic 5 can be more affective the a Fantatic 4. This story has a great ending which I didnt see coming. In fact there is a sequel to this story out there,What if The Hulk had Bruce Banner's Brain?: As you know whenever Dr. Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk he becomes a different man with no control. But what if he did? This take follows what would have happened if The Hulk was smart and tried to be cured. With guest appearances by the Fantastic 4 and Galactus. Good story. Not as good as I thought but still enjoyable.What if The Avengers had never been?: In the early days of the Avengers there was a moment when the Hulk and Namor the Sub Mariner team up and the Avengers almost break up. But what if they did. Sadly this was a good story but in the end it almost had the same result if they stayed together with a couple of exceptions. The Avengers didnt really split up they just did something different as a team.What if Captain America and Bucky Survived World War II?: Ok you know the backstory. During WWII Capt. America and Bucky fell into freezing water. Capt. was frozen while Bucky died. The Avengers stumble apon Capt. and he awakes 20 of so years later. But if Capt. and Bucky didnt fall into the water. What would be differnet. So far this was one of my favorite stories so far because it didnt show a small time period, it went from WWII to the present (well when the comic was released) with what would have happened. Great storyWhat if the Invaders stayed together after WWII?: Ok the Invaders were a Avenger like group during WWII that consisted of Captain America, Bucky, Human Torch (not the Fantastic 4 torch but the first one), Namor and I forgot who else. The group disband after Capts. and Bucky disaperred but what if the group went on without (and in a with) them. The story was confusing since I never heard of the group before and it was hard to tell if the story was at the point of the real moment or in the alternate time line plus it had too many stories in it.What if the Fantastic 4 had different Powers?: Ok as you know Reed Richards had the ability to stretch, Susan Storm could become invisible, Johnny Storm became the new Human Torch and Ben Grim became a rock like monster. But what if they got different powers (I wont say what). The story is very good. It didnt go on with a long plot but just one simple one like an origin story. Very good.This book had mostly good stories in it with a couple of exceptions. If you love marvel comics and/or alternate universes, get this but as cheap as possible."},{"Title":"What If? Classic Vol. 1 (Marvel Heroes)","review":"I agree this should have been an Essentials offering. But it's a fun read never the less and it paved the way for stronger stories in later issues. As far as expectations maybe we are too jaded in this new century to appreciate what Roy Thomas and other's were doing. These stories shake the foundations of Marvel legend and take them to another place. I agree that they don't all work but the ones that do are great to visit again."},{"Title":"Back to Jerusalem: Church Planting Movements in the Holy Land","review":"Excellent book from a seasoned veteran. I know Dr. Ray personally and can atest that for anyone interested in Israel-Palestine and God's work among both Jews and Arabs this book is a great resource. The strongest aspects of the book for me are the various insights offered into the cultural personalities of Palestinians and Israelis. This type of information is only gained by living among the people. Furthermore, these insights are essential for anyone desiring to impact Israelies and Palestinians with the gospel. The Holy Land is an intense place to live and work. Anyone who is interested in praying strategically or coming to the Land needs to understand this and Dr. Ray has done a masterful job in describing and discussing the issues. May God use it for His Glory!"},{"Title":"Henry Goes West","review":"This book was one of four available to my two year old as we waited in the hospital Emergency Room (she needed two stitches.)

A good book for the preschool/young reader group"},{"Title":"Summer Darkness, Winter Light","review":"This is a fine novel with not so perfect characters touching on issues of forgiveness, and redemption. It isn't perfect, some of the characters engage in physical violence which I am never a fan of but overall this is a story about moving past bitterness.Heroine Allegra lost her home in England when she was only a child due to a terrible man who accused her father of treason. Her whole family was shipped as indentured servants to America. They were separated and Allegra, now an adult, is on a mission to kill the man who put them in servitude.The man is Lord Wickham and she waits to ambush him outside her old home. When he alights from his carriage she tries to stab him but is stopped and discovers that the man she wants dead is already deceased and the man she almost killed is the new owner of the manor. She leaves devastated and hungry and when she poaches a rabbit she is brought to justice and saved from punishment by the man she almost killed, Sir Greyston Morgan.Grey makes her his indentured servant for a year, the punishment for poaching, but mostly does so because he is very attracted to her. Grey lost his wife and child years ago and is slowly killing himself with gin. He wants the world to hate him and that includes Allegra, who sees past his hurt to the battered man inside. Often Grey lashes out at Allegra verbally and once physically when he is drunk. Allegra lashes back and rightfully so, but she also knows that alcohol plays a part in his anguish.Allegra loves Grey but is still on a mission to bring justice to her family. Apparently Lord Wickham has a son who is living in England and Allegra plans to kill him. This was a bit foolish as this man was not involved with Allegra's ouster but she can be irrational.Together these two have to learn to forgive others and to forgive themselves. This novel moves smoothly with plenty of good dialogue and heart wrenching scenes."},{"Title":"Summer Darkness, Winter Light","review":"This is my first Halliday book and I loved it! Allegra is a strong heroine whereas, the hero, Grey, is dark and troubled. But Allegra's love changed Grey's life and she instilled love and warmth to his hardened heart."},{"Title":"Summer Darkness, Winter Light","review":"This one was a lucky find in a shelf at a 2nd hand book store. You never know what you are going to get, and sometimes you get nothing special, and sometimes you get lucky. This book was so sweet.This is a story of two tortured people who find salvation in loving each other. The hero, Greyston, is drowning his guilt and sorrow over the death of his wife. He drinks excessive amounts of gin and he is rude to everybody, even his loyal servants and friends. His tortures are more in his mind than anywhere else, but he is stuck in a very dark place.Allegra's tortures are more real. She had a wretched childhood. Her family was betrayed and sold into servitude. All her family members died horrible deaths, and she swore to avenge them. She approaches Grey's manor with that in mind, but finds herself caught for poaching, and again pressed into servitude. She does her work well, and waits for her chance to continue with her quest, meanwhile fighting off Grey's nasty, bad-tempered advances.But Grey is not really as cruel as he wants people to believe he is, and he never really hurts Allegra. With her help, he climbs out of his depression and finds a reason to rejoin the land of the living. She, meanwhile, determines to proceed with her plot to gain her much-delayed revenge. Grey, with his life renewed, tries to stop Allegra from destroying herself with her vengeful plot.It gets a bit exciting after that, with a shipwreck and some smugglers, and a nick-of-time rescue. I don't want to give away any more spoilers, just let you know the story has some action as well as angst.This book was written in 1995 and has apparently faded away into the world of forgotten romances. That's kind of a shame, because it is really good."},{"Title":"Summer Darkness, Winter Light","review":"Ah, 1995... it seems so long ago. Back in the halcyon days of the Clinton administration, when the Oklahoma City bombings were big news, and Alanis Morrisette was taken seriously. That was the year Sylvia Halliday's \\"Summer Darkness, Winter Light\\" was released. At the time, I was already a staunch fan of Ms. Halliday (real name Sylvia Baumgarten, aka Louisa Rawlings and Ena Halliday), but, for whatever reason, I wasn't as crazy about \\"Summer Darkness\\" as much as her previous books. However, now that I've reread it, I can safely say the book is excellent and, if you're a fan of historical romance, definitely worth a read. It's aged pretty well too.\\"Summer Darkness\\" is set in 1724, and it tells the adventures of Allegra Baniard, a poor young noblewoman fresh from her exile in the Colonies. She's come back to England to avenge her family's ruin; she means to kill the new lord of Baniard Hall, who she thinks is John Wickham, who engineered the fall of the Baniards, but it turns out the new lord is Greyston Morgan, the Viscount Ridley, who has his own demons. She tries to assassinate Morgan by mistake, but this backfires, and she finds herself back in indentured servitude to this man who seems to be nothing but a lecherous drunkard. But hark! Her new master is a sexy beast, who alternately tries to seduce her and make her really angry. But our heroine has many surprises and lots of adventures awaiting her before the book is done, and that includes murderous fops, evil smugglers, Indian princes, ferocious bears, and gladiatorial hookers with hearts of gold. It manages to be both ridiculous and awesome at the same time.I think I didn't like this book when I was younger because of all the angst. There is tons of angst here; both Allegra and Ridley are two messed up people. Dear readers, you might have guessed from my previous reviews that I'm not too fond of excessive wangst. However the angst in \\"Summer Darkness\\" did not irritate me too much this time, since it's told in such a wonderfully old-fashioned and operatic sort of way, that it's more endearing than irritating. Some of Ridley's attempts to entice Allegra end up being more silly than sexy (like when he sticks his tongue out at her in the stillroom and she puts bitter salts on it in revenge) but again, while I rolled my eyes, it didn't annoy me. Some of the love scenes do end up being pretty hot too. (Watch for the scene with the whip.)Usually romances, a la Beauty and the Beast, involve a tortured hero, and an innocent heroine who redeems him. Usually this is handled in a ham-fisted way- the hero becomes Anakin Skywalker, and the heroine Mary Sunshine. But Ms. Halliday very interestingly makes Allegra just as messed up in the head as Ridley, so they both have to redeem each other, which creates a nice balance and a far more equal dynamic. Since Allegra is no Pollyanna, and she's been through the wringer, she does what she needs to do; she steals knives, drugs dogs and sleeps with her boss without fainting or carrying on. She does cry a lot, and is capable of irrational decisions, but I can't imagine someone who's had such a hard life would be sensible all the time.I wasn't as entirely convinced by Ridley, but that's possibly because we don't spend as much time in his head as Allegra's. He's a bit of a creep at first, but Allegra is more than a match for him, and indeed calls him out on his crap. There are some familiar tropes in Ridley's background; he has a late wife who was not very nice, and he has a princely Indian servant, but both of these elements were downplayed, and they end up fitting into the plot quite well.Most notably, \\"Summer Darkness\\" pulls off the feat of taking the older style of bodice-rippers, which had more exotic settings and thrilling, picaresque plots, and marries it successfully to the more sensitive, thoughtful kind of romance that came around in the '90s. Yet, while filled with plenty of dark, moody, gothic moments, it's also boisterous and raunchy. The research is excellent; most unusually for a romance, Allegra and Ridley think and act like people from the 1720s. In fact the world-building is so marvelous, that when I read the book I felt as if I had stepped into a Hogarthian engraving, complete with fat burghers, pious vicars, buxom kitchen wenches, and smuggler captains who I imagined sounded just like Robert Newton from \\"Treasure Island.\\"The writing, while occasionally torrid and overwrought, is also quite frequently lyrical and beautiful. Though there are a few problems with pacing early on in book, when Allegra becomes indentured to Ridley, the action picks up about the halfway mark, and it became hard to put down. The character arcs end up being quite satisfying, and the happy ending for Allegra and Ridley felt really deserved. These two needed a happy ending and some peace, especially after dealing with wicked highwaymen and bears.Despite its flaws, this is a beautifully put together book, with gorgeous prose, vivid characters and an early Georgian setting all too rarely seen in historical fiction. I'm happy to inform you that there will, in fact, be a sequel to \\"Summer Darkness,\\" called \\"Gloriana,\\" which Ms. Halliday is working on right now. Let's hope it sells- there needs to be more Sylvia Halliday books out there!"},{"Title":"Trans Fats: the Hidden Killer in our Food","review":"This book is just great - Judith Shaw gives us the real lowdown on trans fats; to find out that there is ZERO recommended intake is just horrifying.

Thank you Judith Shaw for telling the truth!!!!"},{"Title":"Trans Fats: the Hidden Killer in our Food","review":"I just finished reading Judith Shaw's recently published book: &quot; Trans Fats: The hidden killer in our food.&quot; This is an impressive, first rate book. Shaw has managed to make a subject that could be less interesting and exciting, very interesting and exciting. I am impressed by the level of scientific evidence and thoughtful enquiry, and also historical detail. It all weaves together so dynamically and makes for very interesting reading It is almost like a detective novel. One wonders where is it going at first. And then it falls in place with very sharp logic.

I'm buying 120 copies from the publisher to give away to our 75 employees and a few friends, with a few left to sell in our hotel restaurant.The historical perspective was great, but was I left wanting to see a little more technical / scientific data. It is an easy, quick read which I appreciate. I just wanted more scientific information to satisfy my curiosity. This is probably one of the least understood and most important issues facing people today. From all that I have read from this book and others, cutting out trans fats is absolutely crucial for good health.I consider Jean Carper to be a little better nutritional writer because I think she is more direct. On my underlining test, I find myself underlining a lot more in Carper's books. But Judith Shaw is now on my short list of good authors writing about important issues. Occasionally she got a little wordy, but I would not call the book too wordy overall or verbose. It is relatively direct, and the subject matter is of utmost importance.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is still breathing and able to read.

Amazing!) That the FDA could make this approval of deceptive labeling is just unbeliebable!I've cut trans fats completely out of my diet and I've seen a much improved quality of living and health.

This of course was displayed towards the Americans as being 'backward' due to their more advanced military treatment of the enlisted by officers & non-coms.It is also a classic in its writing by a southern officer viewing the whole enlistment, training, shipment overseas and the view point of his class at what he observes. It is very much a time warp and being able to view the whole time through the eyes of one of the privileged, that slowly becomes disillusioned with the bruttleness of war, the waste of human lives, property and beauty that he sees in his journey.How bad was WWI ? They are still discovering bodies from the trench warfare, including, not that many years ago, the son of Robert Louis Stevenson, lost in one of the famous battles at the end of the war. Sadly in retrospect it just was the foundation for WWII and the even more terrible body count that it generated.

Through this diary, the reader becomes intimately familiar with the thoughts, feelings, and actions of soldiers during the time of war.The diary begins, as most do, with trite observations of day-to-day life, seemingly more so because the diary was kept, in part, as part of Sirmon's duty during wartime. However, as the diary progresses, Sirmon writes more candidly about his thoughts and feelings toward other people, himself, and the war in general. Toward the end of the diary, which comes to a close at the end of the war, Sirmon begins to ask philosophical questions about war and life's meaning in general.One cannot talk about character development, plot, or other literary devices, since this is not a literary creation but an untouched diary. However, one can be appreciative that such a record of history, written literally on and about the front-lines of war during a time when record-keeping and observation were not readily available, exists. What makes this a truly remarkable read is the insight that Sirmon brings to the personal life and thoughts of the soldier. We all know that, to put oneself on the front lines of war, there is a level of bravery that many of us could not or would not commit to, for one reason or another. To hear the fears that soldiers like Sirmon, and many others, faced head-on, is remarkable; to read of their willingness and at times excitement to do so, is inspiring.I learned quite a lot about WWI from reading this book - much more than I ever learned in school - and recommend this book to those looking for a true, gritty account of war written from the point of view of the people who actually lived it."},{"Title":"That's war: An authentic diary","review":"That's War by Brannon Sirmon is a fascinating look into the Great War. Mr. Sirmon's great-grandfather, Captain William Arthur Sirmon kept a diary which details his service in World War I in 1918. We travel from Georgia in the United States to the front lines in France. Captain Sirmon shares the monotony of training each day waiting for orders and his experiences at the front, in the trenches. Captain Sirmon gives us a glimpse into daily life in 1918. We see how he passed his free time. We see his respectful yet candid annoyance with his superior officer. We see the friendships made even though neither party understands the language. We see his patriotism and pride in being an American. And we see the terror of the front line with life in the trenches, in the dark of night and in the hospital after injury.If you're interested in history or war, you'll want to read That's War."},{"Title":"Justice and mercy: commentary on the liturgy of the New Year and the Day of Atonement","review":"This commentary reads the texts of the High Holy Days.

If you believe you're ordering a book, you'll be disappointed................ I decided to use Mandrake for Linux, instead of another distribution. And I'm very happy with it. :)Mandrake is an excellent distribution of Linux, and if you're going to run Linux, I highly recommend it. (That's why I give this review 4 stars.) Downers are the poorly written manual, and the fact that a mouse is *REQUIRED* for you to install the software. If you don't have a Linux-compatible mouse BEFORE you begin installation, you're going to be very frustrated about halfway-thru the installation.(I understand Mandrake 7.1 solves this problem.)Mandrake is excellent for newcomers to Linux because it has great graphical user interfaces, to make the 'migration' from Windows easier. It's also easy to set up dual-boot so that you do not need to give up your Windows stuff, and it contains software to re-partition your existing hard drive WITHOUT erasing all your data. Good thinking! :)In summary, Mandrake is a very good Linux distribution and I recommend it. However, you will probably want a good Linux book to go with it, and I highly recommend getting O'Reilly's &quot;Running Linux&quot; as a companion to your new Linux adventures.........................."},{"Title":"Linux Mandrake Operating System 7.0 Complete","review":"Theis is not actually a book. I ordered this item after reading Mr. Anarchy's review, expecting a book. Much to my surprise, it was actually just the Linux Mandrake operating system itself, with a user guide that is available for free in PDF form, at www.linux-mandrake.com. The operating system itself can also be downloaded for free.This package is still a pretty good deal. For about $20, you get the installation CD, the sources CD, which contains a ton of Linux software in RPM format, the printed installation guide, the printed 390 page user guide, a bootable floppy, and a few pieces of paper containing mostly advertisements. The only real compelling item in the box is the &quot;extras&quot; CD, which has 5 books in PDF format. They are: Redhat Linux Unleashed, Teach Yourself KDE 1.1 in 24 Hours, Teach Yourself Gimp In 24 Hours, Teach Yourself Linux In 24 Hours, and Special Edition Using Linux. That's roughly $100 worth of books, but they are in PDF, not actual printed books. The extras CD also contains Sta Office 5.1, but that can be downloaded for free as well.The only actual printed book is the user guide, which is questionable in it's usefulness. While it is geared toward beginners, it doesn't go too in-depth about subjects, instead only covering the basics and sometimes not giving enough information. It also seems to have been written by someone who doesn't speak English as a first language, as there are numerous grammar errors, and I found myself reading sentences numerous times to grasp what the author was saying.I still believe that this item is worth purchasing, considering it's low price. It saves you quite a bit of time downloading the 650 meg Linux Mandrake OS, which must then be burned onto a CDR. For someone starting Linux, there isn't a better distibution than Mandrake. However, for someone looking for printed word on Linux, especially a beginner, I recommend the book Running Linux, which has helped many people get started in Linux."},{"Title":"Linux Mandrake Operating System 7.0 Complete","review":"I thought this book was well thought out.

He was truly the equivalent of a rock star; he altered the very way the game was played. Before he arrived, the game was \\"small ball\\", players worked for simple hits and thought to move one base at a time. However, the home run proved to be so popular with the fans, that in only a few years it became the prime offensive weapon. One of the most incredible sports statistics of all time is the fact that in 1920 Ruth alone hit more home runs than fourteen of the sixteen major league teams. It is difficult for the modern person to realize what baseball was in American society in the first half of the twentieth century. There were virtually no professional sports other than boxing and certainly none where there was action on a daily basis.Berke captures the larger-than-life Ruth and presents him in his greatness as well as most of his vulnerabilities. Berke mentions Ruth's drinking and staying out all night but there is little said of Ruth's involvement with women other than his wife, especially avoiding any mention of prostitutes. Babe Ruth never really grew up, he remained a street kid all his life, which is why he was always so involved with children.No matter how many years pass, as long as baseball is played the legend of Babe Ruth will live on. Berke captures the undying legend as well as the impact Ruth had on baseball and America."},{"Title":"Babe Ruth (Impact Biographies)","review":"Babe RuthThe book I have read is called babe Ruth. This book was written by Art Berke. I have chosen this book because it's about one of my favorite baseball player's Babe Ruth. This book has122 pages. It has 9chapters in it. The book includes. Table of contents, notes, further reading, and the index. Babe Ruth is what the called him that becauseWhen he was around10 to 11 he was an orphan. At the orphanage played baseball.That's when he hit the ball out of the orphanage then they wanted to come up with a name so they called him babe Ruth which stands for baby Ruth.He was also a left handed pitcher."},{"Title":"Babe Ruth (Impact Biographies)","review":"Art Berke's biography of Babe Ruth is an excellent transitional biography between the introductory books written for young readers and the more scholarly biographies written by sports writers and other historians. Berke begins with the argument that Babe Ruth was simply the best there ever was in the history of baseball. Ty Cobb might have been a better overall hitter, Willie Mays and Joe DiMaggio were five-tool stars who could do everything, and Walter Johnson was a better pitcher, but there is only one Babe Ruth. Berke lets Ruth's former teammate Waite Hoyt explain that somebody could come along and hit more than 60 home runs in a single season (as Roger Maris, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds have done) or end up with more than 714 home runs in a career (as Hank Aaron did), but doing those things would not make anybody any Ruth. By the time they finish reading this book young readers will understand why that is the case. But Berke also provides the other side of the story, telling how Ruth had little discipline, an enormous appetite for food and alcohol, caroused off the field, and was a reckless driver. Of course, any youngster who keeps up with the sports page will be well aware of how being a great player does not translate into being a great human being.The story of the Babe also resonates because George Human Ruth came from an underprivileged childhood in Baltimore, Maryland, to become the greatest sports hero the country had ever known in one of the great rags to riches stories. If Ruth could start at St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys and end up in the Baseball Hall of Fame then all sorts of things are possible. Berke covers all of Ruth's milestones, from his remarkable pitching exploits with the Boston Red Sox to his revolutionary home run prowess with the New York Yankees after the infamous sale that altered the balance of power in the American League. There is also the way his deep affection for children and his less than admirable excesses added to his legendary persona.Ruth was the most photographed man on the planet when he was alive and the book is illustrated with almost two dozen black &amp; white photographs and Douglass Corckwell's painting of Ruth's &quot;Called Shot.&quot; In addition to the career batting and pitching statistics in the back of the book Berke has boxes in most of the chapters that have Highlights and Key Statistics for a particular period, putting the numbers into context (e.g., in the 1916 season Ruth we know he was first in E.R.A. and shutouts because those stats are in boldface in the back of the book, but Ruth was tied for second in the number of wins and innings pitched, and was third in winning percentage and strikeouts). But in addition to the numbers are the stories that Berke tells that flesh out the Babe's legend. There are more such stories out there and interested readers can turn to Robert W. Creamer's &quot;Babe: The Legend Comes to Life&quot; or other adult biographies of Ruth to find out even more. This version of the &quot;Babe Ruth&quot; story provides a solid foundation for going to that next level."},{"Title":"Babe Ruth (Impact Biographies)","review":"ANDREW SMITHBABE RUTHBY, ART BURKETHE BIOGRAPHY BABE RUTH IS THE TRIUPHRATE STORY OF A BOY THAT CAME FROM NOTHING THE STRIVED TO BECOME THE BEST BASEBALL PLAYER EVER AND ACHIEVED THAT GOAL.

The first chapter establishes her career, her heart and her strong sense of responsibility to the memory of her brother Joel.The story line held me in its grip: from Cat's determination to discover the truth about her brother's fate (she believes he was murdered while he scouted the bush in Nairobi for the right location to put up an exclusive resort hotel), to the eventual entanglement of emotions when forced to deal with Jock Campbell, owner of Campbell Safaris, to get her to that location. It is implied that Campbell knows the truth about Joel's death. Cat suspects that he does and hires Campbell, much to his own resistance to have anything to do with her. She does so on the pretext of completing her dead brother's dream.She is challenged at every turn trying to find out who Campbell really is and what side, if any, is he on. The relationship that develops between the two creates an exciting roller coaster of events, from meeting Campbell's aristocratic family to a barrage of life-threatening situations the closer they get to the hotel site, which turns out to be a bucolic, exquisite environment untouched by commerce. The sexual attraction is palpable. Being the modern woman, Cat thinks she can be satisfied by Campbell's advances and a few sexual gymnastics, but gradually we see there is more between them than immediate gratification.The other characters play into the intrigue and adventure. The mysterious young woman who enrages Cat because of her feelings for Campbell (which she keeps suppressed); Tom M'Bala, Campbell's business partner, a man of high breeding and intelligence; Father Gaston, an interesting character whom Cat befriends; Reitholder, the obvious villain, is strangle-worthy. Then there are the three Maasai warriors for whom I felt admiration and affection. They served as guides and attended the needs of the safari. They were also formidable fighters when challenged by the opposition.The war that breaks out in the bush between the Campbell/Stanton faction and a &quot;mystery&quot; band of poachers(led by Reitholder and instigated by his partner, a Frenchman named Colonel Francis)held me in thrall. I was astonished that such scenes could be written by a woman, but Ms. Brien proves throughout this story that she has a very broad brush running through her talent. The war made my heart jump, the violence and the description of what was happening to each of its participants kept me turning the pages and hoping that the good guys would win out. I won't say what happens, but I will say that finding that chapter is worth the effort if you want to witness superb writing.Nell Brien goes far beyond the obvious and opens the door to understanding the jungle habitat in ways I never knew before. I am convinced she was on safari herself when she got the idea for this book. I look forward to her next and hope she never stops.Brava!"},{"Title":"Lioness (Mira)","review":"While searching for the right location for a hotel in Kenya, architect Joel Stanton dies in an accident that leaves his partner-sister Cat badly shaken. Not too long after the body bag with her twin's contents inside arrived in Los Angeles, Cat receives an envelop holding Joel's sketches and a strange letter followed the next day with his camera containing no film. Cat feels something is not quite right with her sibling's death and decides to fly to Nairobi to investigate what really happened and to complete the project.In Nairobi, Cat retains Campbell Safari to guide her as she follows the footsteps of her deceased sibling. Cat is attracted to Dan Campbell, but feels he is hiding the truth about her brother from her. Dan also feels the appeal, but has his own demons that will not allow love to properly flow between the two of them.LIONESS is an exciting romantic suspense in which the tension increases with every step taken in Kenya. The story line is crisp and brings the entire African nation and not just Nairobi to life as few books have. The lead couple is charming as they struggle between mistrust and love. However, no question that Nell Brien's novel belongs to Kenya, a place that will fascinate the audience.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Lioness (Mira)","review":"Lioness was so engrossing I couldn't put it down. What a read! This book has everything I look for in a great book - romance, mystery, a mesmerizing story, with a compelling message about the ongoing massacre of wildlife in Africa. Reading this book was not only enjoyable, but also as with Nell Briens other book &quot;Veiled Journey&quot;, it informs the reader of these on-going social and moral wrongs. After reading Vieled Journey I started reading other books on middle eastern womens plight of a total lack of rights and deep social and personal supression. Now after reading Lioness I am compelled to take a strong stand to support the stopping the killing of these beautiful creatures by poachers.Nell Brien is my favorite new author because of her vividly engrossing writing style, where you lose yourself in the world of her characters and their story. I love the feeling of not wanting to put a book down and frankly I haven't read one like that since Veiled Journey.Great applause and thanks to this author who writes not only extremely entertainly, but also informs on important current issues going on in our world today."},{"Title":"Poland 1939: The Birth Of Blitzkrieg (Campaign)","review":"In the heart-breaking days and weeks that the world watched as the Wehrmacht smashed mercilessly into the belly of Poland in September of 1939, the Polish armed forces fought back with largely unrecognized ferocity and courage against overwhelming odds. As author Stephen Zaloga describes so forcefully in this wonderful new book, Polish forces had been chastised and prevented through continuing European pressure into delaying any meaningful army mobilization that might have been considered provocative to the Germans, so they were unable to answer the blitzkrieg tactics with sufficient forces early enough to really stem the tide. Moreover, while it had been widely recognized that based on topography and lack of badly needed fortifications the frontiers were virtually indefensible, the political reality dictated against abandoning the frontiers in favor husbanding their limited forces into a more meaningful defense of the realm closer to centers of population, thus, the Polish forces attempted to defend an area too large, too wide, and too flat to do so effectively.This work continues the excellent exposition begun by the same author in \\"The Polish Campaign 1939\\", extending and completing his controversial account which effectively debunks many common misconceptions regarding the nature of the Polish actions against the Germans in the all-too brief campaign. The author once more contends that many of the commonplaces regarding Polish conduct during the war are inaccurate and slanderous, including the idea that Polish cavalry actually attacked German tanks with swords drawn, or that the entire Polish Air Force was demolished on the first day of the war. According to Zaloga, neither supposition is true. And, while cavalry was used during the campaign, its application was much more clever and much more ingenious than previously believed.This is a quite comprehensive book, with extensive coverage of every element of the campaign as seen from both sides of the conflict. Several fascinating aspects of the war emerge for further consideration, such as the fact that in the Battle of Bzura , the Poles caught the Wehrmacht with its pants down, with the Germans badly over-extended. The capability of the Polish forces to hold their own against their foe was demonstrated with the initial attack, in which the Poles slammed two German divisions backwards into retreat, capturing over 1,500 prisoners in the process. I was also surprised to discover that the Poles had deployed the advanced techniques using tungsten-core anti-tank shells, which they then used on a limited basis in the conflict. The author also shows how the cowardice and malice of the French misled the Poles into believing their allies might intervene, when historians have clearly proven the French actually never had any such action in mind. This is an intriguing book, and a wonderful addition to the growing library covering the German-Polish exchange in the fall of 1939. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Poland 1939: The Birth Of Blitzkrieg (Campaign)","review":"In the Osprey Campaign series volume, Poland 1939: the birth of Blitzkrieg, Stephen Zaloga, a renowned expert on armored vehicles and eastern European military affairs, continues his tireless effort to bring the facts to Western eyes of the opening round of the Second World War. Readers familiar with Zaloga's 1985 full-length book The Polish Campaign 1939 will recognize the antecedents of this volume. Zaloga, an American who has enjoyed extensive access to Polish historical archives, seeks to de-bunk the myths about the Polish campaign of 1939 which were perpetuated by wartime Nazi propaganda and post-war ignorance caused by the Iron Curtain. Myths such as the tales of Polish cavalry charging German tanks with swords and the destruction of the Polish air force on the first day of the war are clearly exposed as falsehoods designed to boost Nazi military prowess to the world. As usual, Zaloga brings his extensive analytic skills and language skills together in concert to produce a valuable piece of research that would otherwise be unavailable to most English readers.Zaloga begins with a short introduction, a section on the origins of the campaign and a campaign chronology. In standard Osprey Campaign series format, Zaloga then has three sections covering opposing commanders, opposing plans and opposing armies, which comprise nearly a quarter of the volume. The campaign narrative itself, covering all major air and ground operations in the Polish theater between 1 September - 6 October 1939, is fifty pages long. Zaloga concludes with a four page aftermath section, notes on the battlefield today and a rather detailed guide to further reading. Ground order of battle information for the Germans, Poles and Soviets is provided, but there is unfortunately no listing of air units. This volume has five 2-D maps (dispositions on 1, 7 and 17 September 1939 and two on the Bzura River counterattack) and three 3-D \\"Bird's Eye View\\" maps (the Polish defense of Westerplatte, the Battle of Mokra and the Battle for Warsaw). There are also three excellent color battle scenes: the cavalry defense at Mokra, a Stuka attack and street fighting in Warsaw. The overall graphic quality of this volume, including the numerous photographs, is excellent.There are many strong points in this short volume, even if much of the research is merely a refinement from his earlier volume. In particular, the defense conducted by a Polish Cavalry brigade at Mokra against the 4th Panzer Division on 1 September demonstrates that the initial German use of armored units in combat could be clumsy and costly at times. Zaloga makes a good point that initially the German Luftwaffe was doctrinally un-prepared for close air support missions for the army and instead could only employ pre-planned strikes determined by the air staff; after two weeks of war the Germans slow introduced the close air support techniques that would be successful in 1940-1941 (does this initial inability to conduct CAS sound familiar to modern soldiers?). Zaloga also makes a good point that the Poles did have some counterattack capabilities - they were not just punch dummies - and the Battle of the Bzura on 9-14 September 1939 caught the Germans over-extended. In the initial attack, the Poles were able to force two German divisions to retreat and actually captured 1,500 prisoners! Other interesting points include the fact that the Poles were the first to deploy tungsten-core anti-tank projectiles but the ammunition was developed as a \\"secret weapon\\" and not distributed until after the invasion began, thereby limiting its use. Odd episodes, like the single Polish cavalry raid into East Prussia, a tank-versus-tank battle and a cavalry-versus-cavalry battle are also detailed.Although Zaloga concedes that the outcome of the campaign was a foregone conclusion, particularly given Anglo-French passivity and Soviet aggression, he provides a valuable discussion on the two opposing Polish concepts of defense. The defense that made the most sense - concede the border areas and concentrate behind the Vistula River - was politically unacceptable, whereas the most politically palatable strategy - frontier defense - was militarily unsound. The Poles reluctantly adopted the latter strategy out of the necessity to avoid German \\"nibbling tactics\\" against the disputed Danzig corridor; readers should note that this was the same strategic dilemma faced by NATO planners on the Central Front in the Cold War.There are only two weaknesses in this otherwise superb account. First, Zaloga is deficient in the opposing leaders section, as he usually is in these Osprey titles. Zaloga spends three pages discussing the German leaders, but spends three-quarters of that space discussing the German High Command: Hitler, Keitel, Jodl, Brauchitsch and Halder. The two German army group commanders in Poland - von Rundstedt and von Bock - receive only two short paragraphs. General Blaskowitz is the only German army commander who receives more than cursory mention - the other four receive no mention. Even Guderian - the pre-imminent panzer leader in Poland - receives almost no mention. This section was poorly crafted, with too much emphasis on the strategic rather than operational leaders. The other weakness in the book is that Zaloga appears to have accepted the misleading hypothesis that a major French attack might have saved Poland by causing a German collapse; this fallacious hypothesis was advanced by Ernest May in his book, Strange Victory. As I noted in my review of May's book, this hypothesis is unsupportable and deeply flawed. Even Zaloga should have noted that by the time that Gamelin promised to begin an offensive against German - two weeks after war began - the Germans had already overrun most of Poland and Soviet invasion was imminent. The Poles might have been impressed by French military prowess but they were also aware that French doctrine for \\"methodical battle\\" called for slow, carefully prepared offensives. Thus even if the French had been able and willing to honor their promise of military aid, it would have been too late to save the Polish army."},{"Title":"Poland 1939: The Birth Of Blitzkrieg (Campaign)","review":"I have collected a number of books on the Polish Campaign, but I have to say that this is the best, despite its short length. It not only gives an excellent overview of the campaign, but disproves a number of widely held myths (Polish cavalry charging tanks, Polish air force being destroyed on the ground on the first day) and covers a number of small unit combats in detail. I particularly enjoyed the description of a polish cavalry brigade stopping a panzer division on the first day. Talk about standing that myth on its head!The book also gives a good (if brief) description of the opposing forces. If there is a shortcoming, it is this last. I would have liked this section to be longer but, given the format, that would be unreasonable. There are plenty of sources on the German army; if you want to know more about the Polish forces, you can buy \\"The Polish Campaign 1939\\" by Zaloga and Madej (used) for 3 or 4 times as much. Otherwise, buy this book."},{"Title":"Poland 1939: The Birth Of Blitzkrieg (Campaign)","review":"&quot;Poland 1939: The Birth of Blitzkrieg&quot; is written by Steven J. Zaloga and illustrated by Howard Gerrard. In this 96 page volume, the author concisely outlines the German invasion of Poland, which began WWII. This includes: opposing commanders, opposing plans, opposing armies, the campaign, and the battlefield today. Throughout the entire book, there are many black-and-white photographs and several color maps.This is an excellent resource for those interested in the events and related issues of the German invasion of Poland in September 1939."},{"Title":"Poland 1939: The Birth Of Blitzkrieg (Campaign)","review":"I was very pleased with Osprey's Essential History number 107, Poland 1939, Birth of the Blitzkrieg. Finally, an easy to read, concise, inexpensive book on the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, and the beginning of World War II.I was impressed by the amount of detail that is crammed into this small book, and by the quality of the information as well.The author puts to rest some of the \\"romantic myths\\" about the Blitzkrieg in Poland: namely the idea that the German Luftwaffe destroyed all of the Polish airforce while they were still on the ground, and that the Polish cavalry, armed with lances, would routinely take on German Panzer tanks! While many of the Polish planes were destroyed while on the ground, many survived and dogged the German planes throughout the month long conflict (even if they were outclassed by the more modern German planes). The Polish cavalry, an elite force, trained with lances, but the author rightly discusses the tactics used by them, that is that they fought dismounted as rifled infantry.I was also impressed with the beautiful illusrations in the book as well, especially the one of the Polish artillery train blasting some Panzers!The only information lacking in the book was that of the Polish brigade, who retreated on foot and escaped from the German and Russian armies, and retreated to Tehran and lived to fight again."},{"Title":"Poland 1939: The Birth Of Blitzkrieg (Campaign)","review":"There are several excellent reviews of this book in existence, and I focus my review mostly on details not covered by them. This review is based on the 2004 hardback edition.Industrial capacity is the key to modern warfare, and the extreme asymmetry (using modern parlance, and not Zaloga's) favoring the Germans began at that stage. Up to WWII, Germany had manufactured 1.4 million motor vehicles against Poland's 33,000 (p. 32). Germany was in a position to outspend Poland, in military matters, at 30:1 (p. 22), despite Herculean efforts by the latter.Nominal static asymmetry in such things as airplanes, tanks, and artillery favored the Germans at approximately between 4:1 to 8:1 (p. 23, 31). But, since German weapons were more modern, the effective static asymmetry was easily 10:1 or more. Since only 65% of Polish forces had been fully mobilized (p. 39: as a result of western pressure for Poles not to \\"provoke\\" Hitler), the effective static asymmetry became even greater. Finally, owing to the fact that the German forces enjoyed greater mobility and modern communication (e. g., p. 32, 67, 70), they could use their arms more effectively than the Poles could whatever little they had. Owing to these tactical advantages, the dynamic asymmetry favoring the Germans became much greater than the effective static asymmetry already in their favor.Zaloga discusses the failure of the British and French to live up to their treaty obligations towards Poland in 1939: \\"Hitler had hoped that Britain and France would abandon Poland altogether. Their timid response left the Poles to their fate. France threw away one of its great strategic opportunities, as German forces in the west were too thin to repulse any full-scale assault. German officers interviewed about the campaign after the war expressed their firm belief that if France had struck with force in September 1939, its army would have reached the Rhine in a couple of weeks, and possibly won the war. France would have faced a far different army in 1939 than the one it confronted a year later.\\" (p. 65)Ironic to the \\"Polish lancers charging German tanks\\" canard, the Polish cavalry had actually discontinued the use of lancers well before WWII (p. 7, 30)! Zaloga traces the origins of the German-propaganda tale (pp. 42-43), which unfortunately has proved to be so enduringly believed. (Myths survive when they meet needs. This one fulfilled the need of Poles to remember their struggle against a vastly technologically superior foe. It also met the needs of Polonophobes, as it ostensibly supported their prejudicial views of Poles as impetuous and stupid.)"},{"Title":"Poland 1939: The Birth Of Blitzkrieg (Campaign)","review":"'Poland 1939: The Birth of Blitzkrieg' is an excellent example of the Campaign series of books from Osprey Publishing. Written by the consistently good Steven Zaloga (an expert on this campaign) the narrative is interesting, informative and flows nicely along. He comprehensively dismisses the myths of Polish lancers charging panzers and the destruction of the Polish Air Force before breakfast on the 1st of September.The maps are very good, the detail on the 3D views is excellent, and the photographs are judiciously chosen. The colour plates are also good, although I would rather that the accompanying captions spoke more about the action shown rather than summarizing the information available elsewhere in the book."},{"Title":"Poland 1939: The Birth Of Blitzkrieg (Campaign)","review":"In the Osprey Campaign series volume, Poland 1939: the birth of Blitzkrieg, Stephen Zaloga, a renowned expert on armored vehicles and eastern European military affairs, continues his tireless effort to bring the facts to Western eyes of the opening round of the Second World War. Readers familiar with Zaloga's 1985 full-length book The Polish Campaign 1939 will recognize the antecedents of this volume. Zaloga, an American who has enjoyed extensive access to Polish historical archives, seeks to de-bunk the myths about the Polish campaign of 1939 which were perpetuated by wartime Nazi propaganda and post-war ignorance caused by the Iron Curtain. Myths such as the tales of Polish cavalry charging German tanks with swords and the destruction of the Polish air force on the first day of the war are clearly exposed as falsehoods designed to boost Nazi military prowess to the world. As usual, Zaloga brings his extensive analytic skills and language skills together in concert to produce a valuable piece of research that would otherwise be unavailable to most English readers.Zaloga begins with a short introduction, a section on the origins of the campaign and a campaign chronology. In standard Osprey Campaign series format, Zaloga then has three sections covering opposing commanders, opposing plans and opposing armies, which comprise nearly a quarter of the volume. The campaign narrative itself, covering all major air and ground operations in the Polish theater between 1 September - 6 October 1939, is fifty pages long. Zaloga concludes with a four page aftermath section, notes on the battlefield today and a rather detailed guide to further reading. Ground order of battle information for the Germans, Poles and Soviets is provided, but there is unfortunately no listing of air units. This volume has five 2-D maps (dispositions on 1, 7 and 17 September 1939 and two on the Bzura River counterattack) and three 3-D \\"Bird's Eye View\\" maps (the Polish defense of Westerplatte, the Battle of Mokra and the Battle for Warsaw). There are also three excellent color battle scenes: the cavalry defense at Mokra, a Stuka attack and street fighting in Warsaw. The overall graphic quality of this volume, including the numerous photographs, is excellent.There are many strong points in this short volume, even if much of the research is merely a refinement from his earlier volume. In particular, the defense conducted by a Polish Cavalry brigade at Mokra against the 4th Panzer Division on 1 September demonstrates that the initial German use of armored units in combat could be clumsy and costly at times. Zaloga makes a good point that initially the German Luftwaffe was doctrinally un-prepared for close air support missions for the army and instead could only employ pre-planned strikes determined by the air staff; after two weeks of war the Germans slow introduced the close air support techniques that would be successful in 1940-1941 (does this initial inability to conduct CAS sound familiar to modern soldiers?). Zaloga also makes a good point that the Poles did have some counterattack capabilities - they were not just punch dummies - and the Battle of the Bzura on 9-14 September 1939 caught the Germans over-extended. In the initial attack, the Poles were able to force two German divisions to retreat and actually captured 1,500 prisoners! Other interesting points include the fact that the Poles were the first to deploy tungsten-core anti-tank projectiles but the ammunition was developed as a \\"secret weapon\\" and not distributed until after the invasion began, thereby limiting its use. Odd episodes, like the single Polish cavalry raid into East Prussia, a tank-versus-tank battle and a cavalry-versus-cavalry battle are also detailed.Although Zaloga concedes that the outcome of the campaign was a foregone conclusion, particularly given Anglo-French passivity and Soviet aggression, he provides a valuable discussion on the two opposing Polish concepts of defense. The defense that made the most sense - concede the border areas and concentrate behind the Vistula River - was politically unacceptable, whereas the most politically palatable strategy - frontier defense - was militarily unsound. The Poles reluctantly adopted the latter strategy out of the necessity to avoid German \\"nibbling tactics\\" against the disputed Danzig corridor; readers should note that this was the same strategic dilemma faced by NATO planners on the Central Front in the Cold War.There are only two weaknesses in this otherwise superb account. First, Zaloga is deficient in the opposing leaders section, as he usually is in these Osprey titles. Zaloga spends three pages discussing the German leaders, but spends three-quarters of that space discussing the German High Command: Hitler, Keitel, Jodl, Brauchitsch and Halder. The two German army group commanders in Poland - von Rundstedt and von Bock - receive only two short paragraphs. General Blaskowitz is the only German army commander who receives more than cursory mention - the other four receive no mention. Even Guderian - the pre-imminent panzer leader in Poland - receives almost no mention. This section was poorly crafted, with too much emphasis on the strategic rather than operational leaders. The other weakness in the book is that Zaloga appears to have accepted the misleading hypothesis that a major French attack might have saved Poland by causing a German collapse; this fallacious hypothesis was advanced by Ernest May in his book, Strange Victory. As I noted in my review of May's book, this hypothesis is unsupportable and deeply flawed. Even Zaloga should have noted that by the time that Gamelin promised to begin an offensive against German - two weeks after war began - the Germans had already overrun most of Poland and Soviet invasion was imminent. The Poles might have been impressed by French military prowess but they were also aware that French doctrine for \\"methodical battle\\" called for slow, carefully prepared offensives. Thus even if the French had been able and willing to honor their promise of military aid, it would have been too late to save the Polish army."},{"Title":"Poland 1939: The Birth Of Blitzkrieg (Campaign)","review":"There are few English histories on Poland 1939. The various explanations for this are unconvincing and irritating to those of us who want to study an important campaign. The collapse of the Soviet Union has seen a plethora of books on the Eastern Front descend on the market much to the delight of eager lay historians. There has been but a trickle on Poland. What is even more surprising is that there are few German source histories on this important campaign.One has to view this book in the light of the above. I personally will read and welcome anything as long as it will give me more insight into the Polish 1939 campaign. The major fault of this book is its concise nature. I wish it were ten time longer. One only has to compare books on the fall of France where that campaign was over quicker than Poland. The book breaks new ground in suggesting that the Poles where not so unprepared and where not such a pushover as modern myth would have us believe. Its just too lightweight to be a heavyweight read. Having said this it is very readable and the illustrations are enjoyable. Buy it before it goes out of print due to the general lethargy surrounding this campaign."},{"Title":"Poland 1939: The Birth Of Blitzkrieg (Campaign)","review":"A good book in the series and it gives a good overview of the invasion in Poland and its place in the events of World War 2.It adresses a few myths and explains in a satisfactory manner how this was the testing ground of the Wehrmacht - that the German Army did make mistakes, plenty of them, but learned its lessons very well. Zaloga brings the highlights to life and brings the rest of the invasion into light. He disbands the myth of the cavalry charging into panzers - a long lived nazi propaganda lie and shows that the Germans had not perfected their tactics. He also shows that part played by the French and British and the Soviet Invasion of East Poland is well covered.All in all this is quite impressive and complete. And that within the framework of the Osprey series."},{"Title":"Poland 1939: The Birth Of Blitzkrieg (Campaign)","review":"There is not so many books in English about the invasion of Poland and this one fills a little bit this void. Steven Zaloga described this story very well and with considerable detail, from the first shots of WWII fired at 4.55AM the 1 September 1939 by an old German battleship \\"Schleswig Holstein\\" against Polish fortified coastal post of Westerplatte near Gdansk, to the destruction of the last division sized Polish force (Battle Group \\"Polesie\\" of general Franciszek Kleeberg) at battle of Kock the 5 October 1939.This book is well written, VERY well illustrated, with good maps. There is also a quite good description of Soviet invasion the 17 September 1939, which sealed the fate of Poland. The major Polish counter offensive at the battle of Bzura (9-21 September), which was the first bleeding nose Germans got in the WWII, is also well treated.Colour plates are very well done by Howard Gerrard - although once again there is in this point an error on amazon.co.uk page, crediting a certain Ramiro Bujeiro with the artwork.. The plate showing Polish cavalry (fighting on foot) supported by armoured train \\"Smialy\\" resisting a German Panzer attack at the battle of Mokra (1.IX.1939) is particularly impressive. An air fight between a Polish PZL-11 fighter and two Stukas is also a great military artwork.This book once again precise two important points about this campaign:a) there was NEVER a Polish cavalry charge against German tanks - this is a Nazi propaganda MYTH! The closest Polish cavalrymen went to charge against tanks was the fight at Krojanty, on the first day of war, when two squadrons of Polish 18th Cavalry Regiment charged a German company from 76 Infantry Regiment, engaging ennemy with carbine and pistol fire, grenades but also swords in close combat. In the short but violent fight Germans lost 11 and Poles 19 men killed, but then Polish cavalry had to retreat hastily when a pair of German armoured reconnaissance cars surged from cover to join the fight and opened fire with their 20 mm guns. Fleeing from this unexpected menace, some cavalrymen passed between the German armored cars to reach the closest cover - during this retreat phase at least six more Polish troopers were killed. That was the only instance of mounted Polish cavalrymen meeting up close and personal with German armor.There were many other fights between Polish cavalry and German tanks and armored cars, but then Poles fought dismounted and having taken cover, engaging ennemy with grenades, Molotov cocktails, anti-tank rifles and guns and frequently also field artillery support. An important fact to remember is that Polish cavalry was in this time in fact a mounted infantry, travelling on horses but fighting on foot and well equipped with light and heavy Browning machine guns, Maroszek anti-tank rifles, 81 mm Stockes-Brandt mortars, 37 mm anti-tank Bofors guns, 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns, 75 mm field guns and even tankettes TK-3 and armoured cars Model 34 for scouting!An interesting episode during this campaign took place much later, on 23 September, when Polish and German cavalry clashed at Krasnobrod - and this time swords were actually drawn on both sides...b) Polish air force was NOT destroyed on the airfields the first day (this is another Nazi propaganda myth). To the contrary, mostly only old and auxilliary aircrafts (sometimes used as decoys) were hit - the bulk of Polish fighters (PZL P-7 and PZL P-11) and bombers (PZL P-23 Karas and PZL P-37 Los) survived the first day raids. Assisted to the best of their abilities by light reconnaissance, observation and liaison planes (RWD-14 Czapla, Lublin R-XIII and RWD-8, used sometimes for light bombing and/or strafing) they fought a very busy war during the next three weeks, biting back the best they could - and drawing some blood from the agressors...This book describes well the most important and dramatic fights (like Mokra and Wizna), and mentions also such little known (in the West) topics like Polish armor, including the quite succesful 7TP tanks and modernized TKS tankettes, but also 10 quite powerful armored trains. Other interesting topics are surprisingly tenacious river flotillas (6 monitors, 3 heavy and 1 light gunboats, 3 armed river steamers, numerous smaller armed fast motorboats) and tougher than expected fortifications (Modlin, Hel, Wizna).The lonely fight of the little Polish Navy (destroyers ORP \\"Wicher\\", ORP \\"Burza\\", ORP \\"Blyskawica\\", ORP \\"Grom\\", submarines ORP \\"Wilk\\", ORP \\"Rys\\", ORP \\"Zbik\\", ORP \\"Orzel\\", ORP \\"Sep\\", big heavily armed minelayer ORP \\"Gryf\\", gunboats ORP \\"General Haller\\", ORP \\"Komendant Pilsudski\\", ORP \\"Mazur\\", 6 minesweepers, 1 fast patrol ship, 1 armed troop transport, 2 large and 6 small armed tugs, 2 other armed auxilliaries, 1 school sailship, 13 seaplanes) which lasted even after 5 October, as some ships escaped to United Kingdom, is not omitted.It is here useful to precise, that even after 5 October 1939 some units (mostly reduced to no more than company size) kept fighting, until in November orders were given by the governement in exile to hide weapons, provisionally disband regular uniformed troops and form an underground armed resistance movement awaiting further orders. Not everybody obeyed - some groups kept their weapons and uniforms, stayed in the forests and wilderness and became the first guerillas. The most famous of those first guerillas was major Henryk Dobrzanski, killed in action on 30 April 1940.To conclude, this is a great book about a little known campaign. I recommand it warmly."},{"Title":"Poland 1939: The Birth Of Blitzkrieg (Campaign)","review":"This is an outstanding work on the Nazi and Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939. Except for its lack of personal narratives, this book is everything you need to understand the campaign.I did find a few errors in the names listed in this book, which makes me worry about any errors I didn't catch. Overall, though, it seems that the author has done an exhaustive amount of research on the subject and has condensed the information quite nicely. Thoroughly enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Poland 1939: The Birth Of Blitzkrieg (Campaign)","review":"Being familiar with other books written by Steve Zaloga, I knew this would be a good and informative book.I thought I knew allot about the WWII European campaigns, having read numerous books on the Eastern front, the invasions of Norway, the low countries, France, North Africa etc., but when I saw this book here on Amazon, it dawned on me that in all the years of reading about WWII, I had never come across anything about the invasion and subsequent German campaign in Poland. Like many people this is about all I knew:1. Gleiwitz incident, where the Nazis staged a false attack on a German radio station as a reasonfor declaring war on Poland.2. WWI veteran battleship Schleswig-Holstein opens fire on the Polish garrison in Danzig. Thefirst shots of the war.3. German army groups attach from the SW, W, and out of East Prussia. Integrated use of armor,artillery, and air support. Blitzkrieg.4. Polish mounted cavalry units decimated when they attack German panzers.5. Warsaw bombed and shelled.6. Under the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet Union attacks Poland fromthe east.7. Poland surrenders.That's about it.In a short concise review (typical of the Osprey Campaign Series) the author covers all the salient facts of the battle. German and Polish order of battle, army commanders (while I knew of the German commanding general, I had no idea who commanded on the Polish side), weapons, strategies, politics involved in the Polish strategies, debunking of some cherished myths, the list goes on.Other reviewers have covered this book far better than I can, and there's no reason to repeat them. I just wanted to reiterate the fact that if , like most of us, you have little knowledge concerning this important (but sadly neglected) WWII battle, you will get an excellent overview in this book.Paul"},{"Title":"The House of Rothschild: Money's Prophets 1798-1848","review":"Ferguson has written a rare work: a family chronicle which is both a compelling read, and is good history. The text is richly detailed, while the very complete footnotes provide the reader with a clear sense of the broad scholarship that has gone into the book. One caveat: while Ferguson points out in his introduction that the work is not a financial history, he unfortunately doesn't paint as rich a picture of the financial markets of the early 19th century as the book requires. While the house's trading history makes for a fascinating read, it takes place without any contextual comparison of how other market makers behaved and traded (other than an occasional comparison of profits and losses). Still, though, it's a minor criticism of a great book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The House of Rothschild: Money's Prophets 1798-1848","review":"The House of Rothschild 1798-1848 covers a pivotal time in history. The Napoleonic Wars, rise of capitalism, the rise of multinational businesses, development of the railroad and the French Revolution. The Rothschild's had a front row seat to all of this and were the focus of some of it. From humble beginnings in the Frankfurt Jewish Ghetto, the rise of this family is chronicled through three generations. Many myths about the Rothschilds are laid to rest by Ferguson's groundbreaking research, much of it original scholarship. One of the main threads running through the book is that finance had a profound role in the ability of the rulers of Europe to do what they wanted. By 1825 the Rothschild had a significant role in sovereign finance. Many things were wished for by the various despots that ruled Europe at that time, but if the Rothschilds did not perceive that those wishes would lead to stabilization and peace it typically was not supported thereby making it difficult to realize. They did not support the despots with out reserve, but they knew that peace protected their interests. That perspective makes this book unique.The Rothschild family business was a partnership that was constructed as the 2nd generation left Frankfurt for London, Paris, Vienna, and Naples. That the partnership should survive was the 1st generation's greatest desire and was respected (most of the time) by his descendants. The exchanges between the 5 houses make for fascinating reading and are reference extensively in the book.The book details how the Rothschilds pushed for Jewish emancipation and equality and were resisted at every turn. That did not prevent them from receiving commendations from the various governments that the worked with. It did not prevent them from gaining entry to the most prestigious universities for their children. It did not prevent Lionel from gaining entry into the British Parliament without having to swear a Christian Oath. The Rothschilds achieved a great deal for themselves and for Judaism.Intrigue, betrayal, revolution, and vignettes of famous people make this a very entertaining book, not merely a historic rendering of dates and places. From the beginning of the Rothschild climb to prominence with the Elector of Hesse-Kassel to the French Revolution in 1848, this book will engage the reader."},{"Title":"The House of Rothschild: Money's Prophets 1798-1848","review":"Ferguson's book is really stunning, especially when viewed against the family's mythology. In Frederic Morton's The Rothschilds, for instance, we read that Nathan Rothschild, founder of the London branch, made his fortune by selling down British consols and then scooping then up at fire-sale prices. This was reportedly initiated when Nathan learned of Napoleon's final defeat at Waterloo. But in The House of Rothschild, we learn that Waterloo posed more difficulties than opportunities for the family.

While this question may be considered as blasphemous by Christian believers, it is a pity that this schism should leave Jesus hidden behind theological curtains.In the troubled land of Israel under Roman rule, many a sect flourished. The Priesthood was corrupt, the Edomite kings of the Herod dynasty were cruel, and people seeked redemption in many different forms. Josephus and Philo of Alexandria both tell us of sects that flourished in this era, as do the findings in such archaeological sites as Qumran.Joseph Klausner took upon himslef the ungrateful task of describing in vivid lines and with great sympathy the character of Jesus of Nazareth. Ungrateful, since most Christians would reject the depiction of Jesus as (a perhaps extraordinary) flesh-and-bones. Ungrateful, since most religious Jews would detest the positive lines in which Klausner paints his \\"Reb Jesus\\", in whose name they were persecuted for almost two millenia.Jesus, in Klausner's pen, is a religious reformist, a man of great moral integrity, acting within the framework of the Jewish people. He is a man of simple (should I say simplistic?) and vivid visions, who is intimately acquainted with the agricultural lifestyle and nature, from which he draws many of his allegories.Despite the impossibility of the task, Klausner achieves a decent result. The book's main weakness is due to Klausner's weakness for a good story and for Romanticism. This is evident in the opening of the book, where Klausner describes in vivid colours the contemporary view of the Nazareth area and conjectures as to the character expected from someone who grew up in such a place. It is evident also in the conjectures he intertwines with the more historically-based facts.It makes for a good, interesting reading, although many Christians may find his point of departure disagreeable."},{"Title":"Jesus of Nazareth: His life, times, and teaching","review":"Joseph Klausner (1874-1958) was a Jewish historian and professor of Hebrew Literature at Hebrew University. In 1922, he wrote (in the newly-revived language of Hebrew) this famous study of the life of Jesus.Rejecting the gospel attributed to John (\\"The Fourth Gospel is not a religio-historical but a religio-philosophical book\\"), he argues, \\"Jesus was born, lived and died in Israel and was a Jew in every respect.\\" He explains, \\"throughout the gospels there is not one item of ethical teaching which can not be paralleled either in the Old Testament, the Apocrypha, or in the Talmudic and Midrashic literature of the period near to the time of Jesus.\\"He rejects Jesus' reported involvement with the Essenes: \\"Jesus' object was not to form a community of solitaries, nor, as we shall see later, did he consistently practice monasticism and asceticism.\\" Concerning Jesus' reported healings, he says, \\"it is clear that many nervous cases and hysterical women were completely cured through Jesus' amazing, hypnotic personal influence.\\"Why did Jesus die? \\"Obsessed by his idea that he was the Messiah, Jesus meditated on the three methods by which, according to the current view, the Messiah would declare himself.... But there is but one way to reach such an end: rebellion against the Romans.\\" Thus, \\"He was delivered up to Pilate as a false Messiah, and as such he was crucified by Pilate.\\"And after Jesus' death? \\"There can be no question but that some of the ardent Galileans saw their lord and Messiah in a vision. That the vision was spiritual and not material is evident from the way Paul compares his own vision with those seen by Peter and James and the other apostles.\\"This book is absolutely essential reading for anyone intersted in the historical Jesus, Jewish-Christian dialogue, or similar subjects."},{"Title":"Jesus of Nazareth: His life, times, and teaching","review":"This is a real research work, with the list of references, attacks at the opponents etc. It is difficult to read, but still very interesting. I haven't managed to read the whole thing, but the first half, which is mostly the discussion of the existing historical sources, is fascinating."},{"Title":"Jesus of Nazareth: His life, times, and teaching","review":"Joseph Klausner's _Jesus of Nazareth_ is still the study to read. A previous reviewer notes that Christians may not appreciate a flesh and bones view of Jesus. That does not matter in the least and a confessional study of the Christian Jesus, the mythological Jesus, is practically worthless and the majority of the well-known authors' works fall into that category. We would know next to nothing about Jesus under Christian circumstances.The most important section of the book is Klausner's treatment of rabbinic sources that are misused and often misunderstood regarding subjects like Ben Pantere, Miriam Maggad'la the hairdresser and illegitimate birth, Bilaam, boiling in filth, and others regarding Jesus in the literature of Tannaim, Amoraim, and later. Klausner sorts through all these claims and shows where Jesus is truly referred to and where he is not. It is a much better argued and balanced than the recent _Jesus in the Talmud_ by Schafer whose goal is not what it should be.Some books are seen as dated and _Jesus of Nazareth_ certainly is not new. I am not new either, but not as old as the book. Perhaps you have noticed what one of my professors spoke of as the \\"dumbing down\\" that has taken place in education over recent decades. You may also recognize the sensationalism and marketing that seems to drive book sales too often. This is not such a book and comes from a time of careful scholarship for the sake of scholarship. Old school? Absolutely.Before reading current work on the historical Jesus, I invite you check two older studies in the order listed then Klausner before the new stuff. You'll often read dedications and introductions which mention the giants whose shoulders the author stands.

I could write the stories but didn't know what to do after that. She writes from an editor's point of view and that is good information to have.

I only wish she would write a book about how to get it done in year 2000 and beyond."},{"Title":"Writing and Publishing Books for Children in the 1990s: The Inside Story from the Editor's Desk","review":"This is a really good general overview of writing and publishing for children, complete with a brief history of the childrens,' JA, and YA publishing history, how censors operate and how to combat them, what to do after you've been published, and how to write a picture book. I think, though, that the advice Ms. Litowinsky gave on sending an unsolicited manuscript was out of date even when this book was written. That is one way to gt published, particularly if you follow her advice of getting to know the editor to whom you're sending it, but chances are you'll get nowhere if you don't have an agent (which she doesn't endorse that heartily), and even if you do do all of your homework in getting to know who's who in the publishing house, books similar to yours which that editor in particular worked on, even saying that you heard the editor speaking at a conference you attended or that a well-known friend of yours recommended him or her, your manuscript will still probably sit unnnoticed in the slush pile because no matter what it's still an unsolicited manuscript. Nowadays the best way to go is to get an agent first, or if you want to do it the old-fashioned way, sent a query letter and synopsis first, with sample chapters if the publishing house requires it. You'll get a reply faster, and you won't have spent unneeded postage money on a gamble that, if it does pay off, probably won't pay off for quite a long time.I write historical fiction, and Ms. Litowinsky focuses by and large on writing books set in contemporary settings. She adds that most children aren't interested in reading books about history outside of school, and only recommends writing in this genre if it really really interests you. She also says that a book about something pivotal often only sells well or gets published if it's an anniversary year, like 1995 having been the fiftieth anniversary of the end of WWII, and only if it's interesting and written well will it still be read after that year. If you're really interested in those events, why not write about them regardless of whether their anniversary is coming up or not? She also recommends naming your characters after your friends' children, or to look in birth announcements to find them. I know that many of my fellow writers are very interested in names by virtue of being writers...why would you want your character to have an ordinary name like Tyler or Ashley when you can have an unforgettable character with a more unusual and memorable moniker like Ammiel or Eulalia?Still, this is only a general overview, and there are a lot of good books and magazines referenced in the back pages. It's not meant to be the end-all and be-all of childrens' writing and publishing; a good writer goes with his or her heart, even if that means writing in a genre that isn't as popular among young people as something like fiction set in contemporary times."},{"Title":"Betrayal of the Child: A Father's Guide to Family Courts, Divorce, Custody and Children's Rights (2nd Revised Edition)","review":"In short, if you don't know the material in this book, you don't know human rights, (including children's rights, men's or father's rights, and women's rights) as it applies in contemporary western society. If you have yet to emancipate yourself from the radical feminist induced mental slavery, you may not be ready for this book.I've read several highly regarded father and children's rights books, and find this one by far the best. This book makes it apparent why the most staggering human rights violations in the history of the world are being perpetrated by the state and federal governments of the United States and the United Kingdom, in particular, against their own laws and ratified treaties with the United Nations. It is concerned with no less than government coerced self-implosion, using our precious children as fodder by dysfunctional, deviant, and self-appointed misandrists.Now I finally understand why my children's lives are being ruined and I, as their father, can do nothing to prevent it. My question as to why those sworn to uphold the law in the state of Iowa would intentionally break the law, knowingly ensuring that my children will then be subjected to neglect, and physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, has finally been answered. This book makes it clear why any attempt to protect my children is met with hostility towards me, and additional abuse being forced upon them. And the detrimental lifelong consequences to my children, and to their own descendants, are becoming quite clear.This book is for anyone truly concerned with children, men, women, our society, our descendants, or our future. Unless you find widespread, state sponsored torture and deprivation to humans desirable, I suggest you purchase and read this great work immediately, and then seriously consider taking action to prevent the downfall of western civilization.Thank you Stewart, for your great and noble work for children."},{"Title":"Betrayal of the Child: A Father's Guide to Family Courts, Divorce, Custody and Children's Rights (2nd Revised Edition)","review":"Mr. Rein's book is refreshing and disturbing.

Not only describing in a very truthful and non-euphemistic manner the current issues and trends but also how we got here.One in every two men will face these issues at some point in their lives. However, most are clueless and those that are not clueless, don't seem to care. Even parents (yes, both Moms and Dads) with children who are boys, don't seem to understand just what kind of a position these boys can be in as grown men. How we got here is a sad story of misunderstandings, misbelieves, poor science, poor deduction, and clouded views, but the fact that we are still here despite significant and continually mounting evidence, is truly a shame and one of the biggest, yet \\"secret\\" failures, of our society.If you do not read this book for yourself then read it for your son or any boy that you know will some day be a father."},{"Title":"Betrayal of the Child: A Father's Guide to Family Courts, Divorce, Custody and Children's Rights (2nd Revised Edition)","review":"There is nothing like developing an understanding when faced with issues in life that only serve to confuse and bewilder.

IM Michael Basman has won a number of Master games with it, so regardless of Raymond Keene's opinion on this being a horrible opening, The Grob is not without logic. If you're looking for something different, this is definately it, as 1.g4 or as Black 1.e4 g5 (1.d4 h6, 2.e4 g5) can be a great 'shock value' opening for the intermediate and club player. I have won with this opening many times, but i will admit, i can't see it being a major part of my opening repertoire. It would be nice if Basman wrote a follow-up to this book for more current treaments, as well as the Gambit line of 1.g4 d5, 2.Bg7 Bxg4 which is not addressed here. This book will not appeal to all, but i am the type of player that loves to throw 'odd' lines at my opponent. There's also a small section of 3 games touching on the 'Global Opening' which deals with 1.h3 and 1.a3 or 1.h6 and 1.a6 for Black. I would like to see Basman write a book with more detailed analysis of this as well. In closing, i have to give this book 5 stars, partially because it's not as bad (at least at the intermediate level) as most people think, and it's extremely entertaining. Many people i have faced comment on how much they hate facing the Grob quite simply because they are unsure how to play against it. Most people are not 'serious' chess players, so why not go for a little gusto now and then?"},{"Title":"The Killer Grob (Pergamon Chess Series)","review":"Basman's Grob book is a fun read, with real-life wins so bizarre they seem to come from a fantasy chess game. One leaves this book convinced that one should add the Grob to one's blitz repertoire. Although Basman spends a fair bit of time trying to explain the theory, the &quot;ideas behind the opening&quot; sections of the book just don't hold up as well--but is this Basman's fault, the reader's lack of subtlety (I'm only a B player), or the simple that fact that the Grob, while immense fun, does not really line up as a good old fashioned linear opening? I'm not sure.I love unorthodox openings, and I cannot deny the fun this book injects into chess with the Grob. But I think I'll stick to the Lengfellner System, and leave the Grobmaniacs to their party!"},{"Title":"The Killer Grob (Pergamon Chess Series)","review":"None other than three-times world champ Botvinnik had a high opinion of the young Basman in the 60s, saying that he reminded him of Simagin.Now Basman is achieved notoriety by advocating the antipositional Grob. A cynic might claim that this gives him a win-win situation -- if he wins, the game is heralded, while if he loses it's put down to his choice of opening (I think a GM has made this point but I can't recall who).Indeed, Basman is an International Master so is a strong player, so is bound to have netted some scalps.In the 1992 New Zealand Championship, the defending champion played the Grob (or reversed Grob) in every game. He was clearly strong enough to extricate himself sometimes from a number of the messes he got himself into. But still he scored only 50% although he would clearly have been one of the favorites, and this was flattering for the opening.In a review of the opening in Spectator some years ago, Grandmaster Raymond Keene claimed that the Grob had to about the worst first move on the board, except maybe h4. It does nothing for development or the center, commits more time to be lost by h3 in Basman's line, and weakens the K-side. And Keene backed up his judgement by a severe thrashing of Basman, which he noted was unlikely to appear in pro-Grob books ...I couldn't give a book only one star, when it has such entertainment value, and might even help a few club players net some points. But be warned: the novelty will wear off, and it will be necessary to learn a proper opening.When I see the opening used in 2600+ events, then I might revise my opinion. I really doubt that I'll need to change my mind."},{"Title":"The Killer Grob (Pergamon Chess Series)","review":"In this book Basman shows that the Grob opening is actually a dangerous weapon in the hands of an experienced practitioner.

There is a section of games for you to try and discover your own Grob potential, with the use of the &quot;Grobometer&quot;.

HOWEVER, I am personally of the opinion, that if you as a mediocre 12-1400 player look at these openings and think that they're all that, and play 'em, you will learn your lesson ! The Grob Opening is probably the WORST opening on the board, except for the EVANS BLASTOFF (1. h4), seeing they both severely weaken the kingside. IM Michael Basman may play these openings - and win!- but it is not thanks to some strange opening that he wins, he is a strong middlegame and endgame player, and that pays off. Finally there's the so called \\"psychological effect\\" which one might aim at, like one might aim at catching a meteor with one's tongue. My advice is play solid and safe ! If you are going to play agressive play 1. e4, but of course 1. d4 can also be very aggressive. Do this, seeing they are just as aggressive, instead of playing silly, weird and unsound openings."},{"Title":"Grant's Atlas of Anatomy, 11th Edition","review":"This is re: 10th edition.Grant's atlas serves well to orient a student for performing disection. The drawings are very well suited to the actual condition of flesh after embalming. I found the text to be superior to other atlases (except Rohan) for understanding the spatial dimensions of a disection proceedure. Unfortunately, however, there are some major limitations to the Grant atlas. 1) Only a minority of possible structures are labeled on each drawing, ie, you may see CN 12 in the drawing, but it won't be labeled 2) Many of Netter's drawings are simplifications to make underlying patterns or details more understandable - this understanding of anatomy is lost in Grant's in preferrence for factual reporting. For most students, the intuition within Netter's drawings is far more valuable 3) Grant's atlas focuses on disection. Most students will never disect the dead again. An atlas like Netter focuses on surgical representations, which, of course, is more appropriate for long term understanding."},{"Title":"Grant's Atlas of Anatomy, 11th Edition","review":"This is the review I posted regarding the Netter atlas. I cite here, because it compared the Netter atlas with Grant's. It reflects the view of somebody that really experimented on the dissecting table various atlases. In the end, our group ended up with Grant's. It really delivered for us. My review assumes you will have a thorough anatomy exam, including cadaver, x-rays, CT, and physical examination of the live human. It might be that you school will only require a written examination, in which case our experience might not be the same. However, I feel this atlas develops fundamental skills.\\"Netter's genius shines in the CIBA books, not on this atlas. It lacks fundamental correlations with what today's student must acquaint themselves with: MRI, CT, x-rays, and not to forget physical examination.I guess the rave is all about only knowing this atlas, and also because of older teachers only know this atlas. I am not saying this [Netter's] is a bad atlas at all. All I am saying is that there are other choices that integrate information in a more meaningful way for today's medical student.Our anatomy dissection group had Netter, Sobbotta, Grant's, Yokoshi's, and McMinn's atlases. We found Netter and Sobbotta to have \\"pretty pictures\\". Yokoshi had cadaver sections only, but they were executed by anatomy experts. If you followed it, you would get in trouble and section something you shouldn't (we became so appreciative of the human body's simmetry because of that). Same with McMinn's (and we also found some dissections not very inteligible, I might add). Students that displayed avoidance behavior towards dissection, and were more of the \\"exam cram\\" types favored Netter (that might also have been because of a lack of curiosity regarding other atlases). But we were not so, we stayed until late in the dissection room, only leaving when the night shift guard *made* us leave.The atlas that truly delivered a nice view of anatomical *relations* between parts, and had dissections we could follow on the table, and that contained clear correlations with clinical and imaging information (part of our anatomy exam involved not only cadaver but x-rays, CT, and clinical topography) was Grant's Atlas of Anatomy. That was what we discovered through trial and error. It costs a lot less than some other atlases, and it is underrated, but it delivers much more. But YMMV.\\""},{"Title":"Grant's Atlas of Anatomy, 11th Edition","review":"This review is from the perspective of a first year medical student in Gross Anatomy.[...]Grant's Atlas shines when it is in the dissection room with you. The drawings are more realistic, and more often than not muscles are reflected out of view rather than being omitted completely (Netter). While this is indeed more realistic and allows you to see more muscle relationships, it slows down studying because of the more complicated mess you see before you. Therefore, it's best used in the lab when that complicated mess is EXACTLY what you are seeing. In all fairness, there are little schematic drawings that simplify important muscle relationships. It also comes with a CD with the images from the book allows you to turn off the labels and quiz yourself. There are also about 100 USMLE style anatomy questions.Netter's atlas shines for at home study away from your cadaver. It is more high-yield than Grant's atlas and makes for easier and faster learning. Grant, because of its thoroughness and more realistic perspective, can be a little bit of a chore to get through when cramming for a test. Netter said himself that he tried to find the balance between simplification and realism, and I personally think he did an outstanding job. I can study any of his diagrams and quickly see the most important relationships between muscles, arteries, veins, nerves, and bones. Ultimately, I would learn more using Grant's Atlas, but Netter is best when you are pushed for time. One thing I didn't like at first was that, unlike Grant's Atlas, Netter's doesn't have any text or tables. Then I found out that they were all on www.netteranatomy.com, which a pretty nice website that in my opinion give Netter's Atlas more value.So, in short, Grant's atlas and Netter's atlas are both excellent. Each can stand on its own, but they really do compliment each other a lot for being direct competitors; Grant's is the best while dissecting, and Netter's is best for studying for exams and the USMLE.[...]"},{"Title":"Grant's Atlas of Anatomy, 11th Edition","review":"I bought this for a Grad level A&P; course. It's one strength was showing a more precise presentation of how structures look in the human body/cadaver, but it had some downfalls. While I could often find specific structures in the pictures, they weren't labeled which left me (and others) frustrated. Also, the book is divided into sections that make no real logical sense, and I always felt like I had to hunt for what I was looking for. While there are some useful aspects of this book, I'd use this as a second resource or backup.After using a variety of sources (and watching other students to see what they use), I'd recommend Frank Netter's Anatomy as my first choice recommendation, and the best value for a student on a budget. Netter's drawings were more artistic, but the labeling, color, and multiple angle representation of structures were far superior to this book. By the end of the semester, most students didn't even bother bringing their Grant's Atlas to class, and lab stock of 'netters' were hard to come by because everyone found them so much more helpful and easier to use."},{"Title":"Grant's Atlas of Anatomy, 11th Edition","review":"A very colorful well drawn anatomy atlas.

THough it did not go into detail about many of the historical facts and figures of the Troubles, it centered on the emotional turmoil that people experience when facing death. It was also interesting because it was written from the perspective of a Ulster Protestant, showing that people on both sides of the conflict are affected deeply by the death and destruction cause by the fighting. The book is very violent, with violent images and harsh words, but those characteristics add a very human dimension to the book, bringing it down to a level at which people can relate to. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in the Northern Ireland conflict. It is a quick read because you don't want to put it down."},{"Title":"The Ethiopian intelligentsia and the Italo-Ethiopian was 1935-1941 (Discussion papers in the African humanities)","review":"Re-reading this novel about a decade after it appeared, it holds up well. My earlier impression after my initial reading was one of grisliness, but on re-examining McNamee's debut (hard to believe, that), I realise that what truly makes the narrative so powerful is the withholding of such gory details from the reader. The omniscient voice does shadow in and out of various characters (to more or less similar effect--this the novel's main drawback in its monotone, if also its noirish strength), but since the characters keep the horror at a distance, so then do we, as spectators.This detachment differentiates McNamee's take on Belfast from the farce of Colin Bateman, the humanity of Glenn Patterson, or the tragi-comedy of Robert MacLiam Wilson, to name his peers. Atmospheric in a manner that conjures up a sodden city as grim as Dickensian London, this fits a period that now has been obliterated under new skylines, regentrified waterside developments, and tenuous ceasefires. Based on Lenny Murphy and his Shankill Butchers, the crimes they commit are not so much the focus as the aura they create, and live haunted within, as the Ulster rhetoric they pay lip service to is, as the perpetrators know, no cover for the deeper violence to which they pledge their true allegiance, even if they cannot fully articulate it.The subplot of the journalist Ryan, his estranged wife Margaret, his contact Coppinger, and the \\"moll\\" Heather gets a bit murky, as if McNamee did not want to fully explore the supporting characters circling about Victor Kelly. It's a little disappointing, and feels incomplete. The lack of range of registers in many of the indirect narratives of the main characters makes for a sameness in tone that works well in smaller doses, but over a couple hundred pages gets a bit wearying. This may be McNamee's intent, as the style--suffused with homiletic cadences and half-remembered biblical starkness--recalls both Joyce's Dubliners (\\"scrupulous meanness\\") and Beckett's street denizens in its carefully modulated detachment.[P.S.The author has published (only in Britain as of now) a novel based on Robert Nairac, an undercover James Bondish figure, Oxford student, Sandhurst grad, and SAS recruit who submerged himself inot the Provo stronghold of South Armagh--\\"The Ultras.\\" It'll be interesting to see if McNamee's historical re-visiting of the Troubles through another enigmatic --if more romanticised and articulate--figure will play out this time.]"},{"Title":"The Ethiopian intelligentsia and the Italo-Ethiopian was 1935-1941 (Discussion papers in the African humanities)","review":"One reviewer here called this book \`poetic' and I wonder why. There is certainly nothing very poetic about this book: the prose is very stark and detached. Obviously McNamee is trying to capture the dark passages of a land torn by civil unrest and ridden in human bondage. I must admit, however, that the novel is certainly well written, almost brutal in its gripping descriptions of the murderous minds and violent manifestations that pervade the novel.

While I have never been to Belfast, and do not have intimate knowledge of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, this book gave me a vivid sense of both, while capturing my attention and anticipation until the very last page.

Since it was written in the 1800s, it was fun thinking about the history that had not happened. Moody was a man who had the opportunity to travel to foreign countries. To my amazement, his comments about political unrest in those countries sounded as if they could have been made today. The insight he shares is very applicable to all of us no matter what our belief system is. I definitely recommend Sowing and Reaping to all. The books available are old so you have to be careful with them. The content is well worth the purchase though."},{"Title":"I Was Carlos Castaneda: The Afterlife Dialogues","review":"I love Carlos Castaneda and enjoy Martin Goodman's writing so I was fascinated by the entire premise of this book.Even with a story to tell that would be considered totally unbelievable by most, I believe that Goodman is being deeply sincere about his experience as he recalls experiencing it.Anyone that has read another one of his books knows that Goodman has long been a serious spiritual seeker.His search for truth has taken him far, to the Amazon, to India, to Mexico so looking at it in that light, its not out of the question that he would be chosen by Carlos to be a partner in this experience.Most feedback from Castaneda fans on the book has been negative saying they see none of the Carlos they love and admire in this book but I can't say I agree.I see him there but its worth remembering that this event took place after Carlos had passed through death.That has to produce change in a person .There is one thing that does puzzle me greatly.It's been verified that Carlo's remains were cremated after his death.How it would be possible to reconstitute a body that had been reduced to ashes as Carlo's says he has done is beyond me.I can't even begin to imagine how that could be achieved but then again I'm not a shaman like Carlos either. I imagine that he had access to knowledge that I'd never been able to comprehend.All in all a worthwhile read no matter what conclusion you come to about what you believe regarding Goodman's story at the end."},{"Title":"I Was Carlos Castaneda: The Afterlife Dialogues","review":"While this book has some interesting stories and biographical meanderings it has absolutely nothing to do with Don Carlos. Instead it uses his character as a timing device to move from one point to another in Goodman's series of short mystical bio pieces.These pieces are not bad, and this is a pretty enjoyable read. What this book is not - at all - is Toltec material. It only touches on shamanisim in the most superficial way (Goodman has a bad experience in the jungle as part of a New Age let's-take-a-new-drug \\"medicine tour.\\") Goodman is convinced of the existance of worlds beyond our visible world - and this book explains why. This is a valuable beginner's message to bring to the populace, and I like that.If you are just starting out on your exploration of alternate ways of percieving the world you will probably enjoy this book for what it is, and not care about what it is not (Castanada).I was a little irked at being roped in with Castanada's name."},{"Title":"I Was Carlos Castaneda: The Afterlife Dialogues","review":"Bought it, read some, put it down &amp; forgot about it, had no urge to pick it up again.

The writer Francis Huxley does that in his blurb in the book, saying the old (OK back from the dead) guy is in better form than ever.I found this a thrilling read. It's masterful the way so much is managed so simply. I loved the journey into the Amazon and really woke to the writer's take on shamanism. I can see how some people might be against this book, especially as the writer nearly died in the middle of a shamanic war. People will do anything to defend their own patch.If you like other spiritual adventure books (I'd compare this one to Paul Coelho's books for example, though I have enjoyed Castaneda's too) I'd say give this one a good try. It's changed my take on life and death a bit, made me feel a bit braver.

I fell into his Meticulously woven words like nothing. His words hypnotising me with every hypocritical statement. After realising that the biggest myth about this alleged Brujo is his \\"Death\\". It never sat right with me how his death was covered up for 3 month's. and how his Cohorts disappeared, so i made it my business to investigate the matter.When reading this book one thing must come to mind. THIS IS NOT A CARLOS CASTANEDA BOOK! This is an autobiographical detail of Goodman's venture into the Pyrenees of france. Not many people know Castaneda. and how his mind works. but after capturing several interviews and my work with Sustained Action. I've realised the 3 Personalities that is Carlos Castaneda. Which this literary work describes accurately.Yes Castaneda told Many truths. But he also told many lies...After reading several reviews of this book, I was not really interested in reading it already writing it off as metafiction. It was until a colleague of mine suggested it for my research on the alleged sorcerer Castaneda did i even consider to buy it. This is a very good book! But this is not for sceptics or for Devout Castanedians. The Description of Castaneda is quite uncanny. Goodman has no knowledge of Castaneda's previous books. and it shows in this literary work, But Castaneda's dialogue Gives hints of previous works.He describes Castaneda as an Agile, Well Endowed Male who is untrustworthy(much like Castaneda's Predecessor Don Juan) and is out to get Goodman with his trickery.Note; Castaneda Is not playing teacher, He's not discussing The Tonal The NagualThe art of stalking(as a matter of fact if goodman mention those subjects i would of wrote it off as fake right away, any good castaneda fan knows about that),Because goodman is blind to these aspects. Its basically Dialogues from man to man.Instead of the Famed Mescalito. We have Mother Ayuhasca weaving the spiritual ties of Amazonian shamanism. Ironically Castaneda Was born in the jungles of south america.which might explain his knowledge on the spiritual being which inhabits.Castaneda's Trademark \\"Seeing\\" can be interpreted since he reads Goodman like an afternoon paper. Castaneda was a theology scholar yet he detested World religions.Martin describes it quite accurately.Now is this book For real? or is Goodman Laughing all the way to the bank...It might be a mixture of both...But this Book was not very successful and still Goodman swears by it.Castaneda was an enigma...who delighted and fooled the world.Perhaps he pursued out a man, to tell the truth and knew...no one would believe him...We will never know...Castaneda if your out there, i would like a signed copy of Active Side OF The infinity please"},{"Title":"I Was Carlos Castaneda: The Afterlife Dialogues","review":"I chanced on this book - liked the green guy on the cover! - and all I knew about Carlos Castaneda is what I found in the introduction.

I have read many of Castaneda's works and it pains me that someone would even believe he would do this. The book is all based on the author's experiences and has nothing to do with Castaneda. Though the writer is very detailed, the book has no relevance to the life that Castaneda lived. The author is very philisophical and that is not what Castaneda wrote about. The author seems to even beleive that Castaneda never even lived the life that he wrote numerous book about! I feel that it is very wrong to use the name of an amazing man to try and sell a book not even worth reading. And then to try and change everything that he learned in the life that he wrote of. I personally do not believe that Castaneda would come back to teach this man anything. I believe that Castaneda is existing only as he knows how. I would not advise anyone to read this book if one respects Castaneda's writings and the life he experienced.

It fascinated me and colored my own dreams. While it deals with shamanism and drugs (called 'plant medicines' here) it does try to offer some balanced perspective. The teachings gained from these sources may well be valid, but I certainly am not inclined to follow the same routes myself. However the teachings of the Carlos Castaneda character on resurrection, both his own and that of Jesus Christ, were informative leads for my meditations to follow. I am intrigued by the notion that we have fixated on death rather than the resurrection, that an empty tomb would be a more fitting symbol of Christianity than a crucifix. Ultimately I don't agree ... we need the symbol of Christ's ultimate sacrifice kept before us at all times. But this book gave me pause for thought which most book I come across these days fail to do.

It was first puzzling, and ultimately satisfying, to find myself in a region where England was wholly unknown. It gave me great freedom to be myself without any expectations. Ultimately this time apart from my fellow countrymen and countrywomen helped me to feel less apart, more akin.

They always bring back to me the realization of the magical in Life.As I was reading this book, it reminded me of watching a bad movie. The kind where you keep thinking that it's got to get better soon, but it never does, and when it's over you finally realize that you've completely wasted your time. If you have not read Castaneda, and are not expecting to find him here, you may enjoy this book more than I, but of course I can't say.I don't find Castaneda in this book - neither in person, nor in writing style. I personally found it to be particularly badly written compared to Castaneda's writing, and hard to follow at times. Castaneda's actions in the book also do not ring true to me. It's kind of like his character is a mix between a weak Don Juan and a selfish Castaneda, and a Rodney Dangerfield who doesn't *deserve* any respect.Of course, I can't really say whether Martin Goodman actually experienced the presence of Castaneda (or maybe his inept double). All that I can say is that it didn't feel like it to me. I came away wondering whether Martin just made the whole thing up just to make money. After all, he admits in the book that when he was given a wish, he unashamedly chooses money.

I don't question the possibility of a person communicating after death. I recently lost a good friend, and am gifted with his remaining presence in wonderful magical ways. Goodman may well have had similar experiences with Castaneda, or he may not have. After several months of trying to cull anything meaningful from this book, I get no feeling of connection with don Carlos or the wonder that he shared with us. It may be that Goodman is just another new age hack, but I don't think so. More likely, the problem is Goodman's laborious and contrived writing.Goodman's writing is so unfocussed that at times it reads like a badly translated instruction manual for a Korean VCR. &quot;I look to the thin channel of water running as the center of the path to pass by my side, understanding now that the light is no reflection, and I see that the quality of the stream has changed.&quot;At other times he tries to put so many ideas into a single sentence that it interrupts any rhythm Goodman may have discovered. &quot;Until recently two dogs, one with the looks and injured ferocity of a jackal, would bark and snarl greetings at this juncture of the walk while the washing of a single woman's vast brood, the eldest a soldier back from the Balkans and the youngest tiny golden-tressed twins, spanned the garden on a long clothesline.&quot;It would have been nice if Goodman's editor (and high school composition teacher) had done his or her job.

The description is accurate and really sends the mind shooting back to my time there.I think that anyone who can accept this book on its own terms and accept the journey recounted regardless of any cynicism they may hold as to its reality will enjoy the book.Attacking the book as a marketing ploy is very crude and unhealthy.

This is a cheap way to sell books.The stories are only mildly interesting and Goodman draws hackneyed, tired, Christian conclusions from them.

Perhaps if Goodman had actually known Casta&ntilde;eda he might have created a more convincing character. But it is quite obvious that the did not, and so, sadly, the Carlos he does create in this tale is a disappointment.

Ideally I'd have given it a 4.5 or even only 4 stars due to 2 faults with those initial Schott editions - except Mr. Dillon has already beaten me to it (yet his review is warmer...)! Consequently, I'll raise my mark to counter-balance given the low price. [Getting the current Schott Complete-Wagner Works Edition, which does follow proper conventions, surely would cost a king's ransom...]The faults are: 1) Inconsistency about ordering of instruments and/or voices per system; 2) Slightly less than ideal clarity in printing due to the styles/fonts of engraving then used.Regarding the first point: it was a period of transition from an initial time where other instruments and voices would be inserted between the upper strings (violins, violas) and the low ones (which still were notated &agrave; la \\"Continuo\\" function long after that style of composition had died) versus today's systematisation where everything is grouped by order of class of instruments and/or voices (woodwinds, brass, percussion, harps, keyboards, solo-voices, choral-voices, strings - going from top to bottom in a system). That full-transition hadn't quite finished yet (it so did around 1910 with Peters' editions of the Wagner operas - \\"Tristan und Isolde\\" used the old order Wagner used, whereas \\"Die Walk&uuml;re\\" and \\"Parsifal\\" were in the new order - other composers like Richard Strauss were already established however with the new order...).Also, as an extra challenge, tenor voices (in this case: Siegfried, Mime) are notated using the tenor clef - not that I mind; however, others might.Anyway, those are minor quibbles - in compensation one knows that he's dealing with very reliable scores proofed (if I recall correctly) by Wagner himself, with few mistakes if any - all of which can be corrected by listening to appropriate recordings. Definitely recommended!"},{"Title":"Siegfried in Full Score (Dover Vocal Scores)","review":"Siegfried is the third opera in Wagner's tetrology, the Ring of the Nibeling. It tells the story of Siegfried, the young hero who bursts through a ring of fire to saves Brunnhilde, his aunt and eventual lover, from a fate of eternal sleep. This opera contains remarkable music, such as Brunnhilde and Siegfrieds' love duets, and the prophetic twittering of the forest bird. As with Das Rheingold, Dover republished the B. Schott's Sohne edition, which means that what we see on the page was approved by Wagner himself. Again, Dover editions are reasonably priced, easy to read, and capable of enduring all reasonable, and some unreasonable wear and tear. Dover's Siegfried is large enough to conduct from, which isn't always true with Dover's Wagner scores. In any case, a copy of this score belongs in the home of all self respecting Opera lovers."},{"Title":"Deep Truth: The Lives of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein","review":"A very personal book on the lives of the Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein who broke the story of the slush fund and the ultimate resignation of President Richard Nixon. This book contains much more information about Bob Woodward's \\"secret informer\\" also known as \\"Deep Throat\\" (This has nothing to do with that \\"adult\\" film of the same name. They just borrowed the name). Many things were not filmed forAll the President's Men (Two-Disc Special Edition)(1976). This book discusses the accuracy of the film, and the follow-up book \\"The Final Days. Patricia Nixon had a stroke two months after the release of \\"The Final Days\\" book and Richard Nixon wanted to sue. Woodward and Bernstein would not reveal their sources for the book, just like they will not reveal who \\"the secret informer, \\"Deep Throat\\" is until after the secret informer dies. The author believes he knows who or what people were \\"the secret informer\\" was. If you enjoyed the film,All the President's Men(1976) and the tv-movie,Final Days [VHS] (1989-TV), you will like the juicy information in this book.They can not really reveal who the \\"secret informer\\" is until that person has died. With respect, they must protect their source. Some time after the interment, perhaps, Woodward will announce who the \\"informer\\" was.We don't know how this will be announced, no doubt with high security for Woodward and Bernstein and concern for family survivors. Surely, The Washington Post Newspaper and all news channels will break the announcement.Bob Woodward is an occasional guest on Larry King Live (CNN) and in 2004, Bob Woodward and carl bernstein appeared on Larry King Live (CNN) and in part discussed that time in 1974. Bernstein even made a joke about putting the flower pot outside again. Carl Bernstein has recently been a frequent guest on MSNBC with his insight about \\"His Holiness\\" ( also the name of Carl Bernstein's book).Is the \\"secret informer someone who is high-profile: John Dean, Alexander Haig, Henry Kissinger, George McGovern, Gerald Ford, Patrick Buchanan, Robert Dole? Or is it someone who is lesser known or forgotten?Could it be a woman, perhaps, Presidential Journalist Helen Thomas (Well, now I am being silly guessing)?What is certain, this important secret is the best kept secret in over 30 years. The wonder will finally be revealed.Please see the film, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN (1976) and keep your eyes on The Washington Post and CNN-Cable News Network and the NBC Networks.Update: February 8, 2005--Donald Segrette reportedly said, it is not a former President and the person is not currently sick.Update: W. Mark Felt, now the age of 91 and in declining health, is claiming in an article in Vanity Fair Magazine on this day that he was the secret informer, \\"Deep Throat\\". He was second-in-command at the FBI in the 1970's.Later that night after W. Mark Felt appeared before the cameras, Bob Woodward did confirm that W. Mark Felt was the secret informer (the source) that he had secretly met with in the parking garage (played by Hal Halbrook in the film, All The President's Men [1976]).The Washington Post also confirmed.The 33-year secret has finally been revealed.Tom Brokaw shared on NBC's The Today Show, June 1, 2005 that the \\"first clue\\" was Bob Woodward mentioned the secret informer as \\"My Friend\\" (attention to the initials: M.F.). The Washington Post Managing Editor thought it best to change that to another name \\"Deep Throat\\". However, nobody thought of Mark Felt being possibly the \\"secret informer\\" until just six years ago in 1999.Another secret revealed was Bob Woodward has been keeping in touch with W. Mark Felt and had lunch with him in 1999.Bob Woodward wrote a new book on his meetings with the \\"secret informer\\", W. Mark Felt,The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat, was published July 6, 2005."},{"Title":"The Last Best Place - A Montana Anthology","review":"The Last Best Place is an anthology with incredible breadth and scope. It was put together over a three year period by a group of dedicated editors and researchers headed up by Annick Smith and William Kittredge. The goal was to identify and preserve Montanna's rich literary heritage ranging from the earliest Native American inhabitants and explorers to contemporary authors such as Rick Newby and Bill Hoagland.The size of the anthology is proof that it was a daunting if rewarding task. Over 1,000 pages long, it cannot be considered &quot;light&quot; reading, and yet the writing shines. There are sections from Lewis and Clark, Osborne Russell and James Audubon, (all early visitors to Montana), side by side with Native American stories and myths by the like of Jerome Fourstar, James White Calf and Pete Beaverhead( don't miss &quot;Chickadees&quot; as told to Frank Linderman by Pretty-shield, Medicine Woman). Here too you will find cowboys, settlers and wild west characters such as Mary MacLane who declared from a very early age, &quot;I want Fame...Let me but make a beginning, let me but strike the world in a vulnerable spot, and I can take it by storm.&quot; There are essays, legends, journals, tall tales and poetry; tales of stunning beauty, adventure, disaster, brutality and vision. This is a book that belongs on the shelf of anyone who understands the importance of place and is fascinated by the literature that has evolved out of it."},{"Title":"The Last Best Place - A Montana Anthology","review":"kittredge's collection evades perfection only through inclusion of a number of less than outstanding tales and essays. these are pretty much identifiable by their first or second paragraphs though; it takes no great effort to just page forward to the next outstanding offering. the dream of montana is well woven here. the reality of montana, remarkably enough, is even better than the dream. my only real reservation about this book is that it is apt to draw a crowd: i would wish montana to remain as it is."},{"Title":"The Last Best Place - A Montana Anthology","review":"If you like raw honest real, this book will break your heart. Kitteridge is constantly eloquent and sweet in his love for Montana, for nature in general and for a vision that will keep the hope alive that it may stay as beautiful as we remember it."},{"Title":"Meaning, Use, and Truth; Introducing the Philosophy of Language.","review":"A spectacular introduction to the philosophy of language.

All the know-how you need to pass your exam -- plus plenty of easy cases that makes it easy to integrate and examplify as needed. Highly recommended. NOT to be missed! Awesome!"},{"Title":"The Lonely Way","review":"This is a very creepy play. There is a doctor attending a dying patient at the beginning of the play, but the doctor is a minor character. Most of the plot is about young people discovering what happened 23 years earlier, when an actress, a painter, and a poet started to live their lives as single people instead of forming couples, except that the plot reveals who had been the most significant couples in the days before being single was realized to be the kind of freedom most likely to produce youthful artistic accomplishments. One of the creepy aspects of the play is how artistic skill is tied to youthful self-confidence, the pride in one's work that is difficult for an actress to maintain if she has been Marilyn Monroe for too long, for example. Even the actress is a minor character in this play. A professor of art who is functioning mainly as the head of some institution is a symbol of the societal need for fatherhood, but he is even a minor character compared to a picture that was painted 23 years before and a poetic image that might drive someone insane if the actuality of the image breaks into reality. The picture becomes the life and love of this play, but most of the characters treat poetry like it is death itself. Such comprehension might be more wrenching than creepy for people who are experts at this kind of thing, but what matters is that it is well done."},{"Title":"Eight Men","review":"Richard Wright is well known as the author of classic American books like \\"Native Son\\", but this was my first sample of his short story work. Eight Men is a collection of short stories about Black men in very different and unusual situations, but all of the stories involve their struggles in life.\\"The Man Who Lived Underground\\" was the story that struck me the most. The elements of this story took a considerable amount of time to analyze back when I was a freshman in college. It is the story of Fred Daniels, a black man, wrongly accused of murder, who escapes to the sewer and there realizes the harsh realities of his existence. More happens in that sewer than you probably imagine. It is the longest of all of the stories.\\"The Man of All Work\\" is the story that had the most humor in it. \\"Eight Men\\" is a collection of fairly sad stories that detail the oppressive conditions of Black men in the 1930's, and this short story joined with \\"The Big Black Good Man\\" as the only ones with noticeable humor to them. The resourcefulness of a Black man in a town where there were no jobs for Black men is the basis of this story.Our book club found \\"Eight Men\\" to be very interesting on a number of levels. The discussion was lively, and everyone had contributions. The meeting ran past the scheduled time, and that is the highest praise that we can give to a book."},{"Title":"Eight Men","review":"Though this does not contain Mr. Wright's best short story, \\"Bright and Morning Star\\", it does reveal his brilliance in telling a tale and connecting to the Black experience. From his use of the vernacular to his adept reaching of the Black man's perception of the white worlds attitude's toward him, Mr. Wright's work brings a certain comfort in knowing that some one else has gone through what the reader has."},{"Title":"Eight Men","review":"Been looking or a story in this book since 1987, didn't know this book existed until not, perfect. The story is \\"the man who live under ground.\\""},{"Title":"Eight Men","review":"This was my first sample of Wright's stories. If he's a black icon and a black hero, I don't know why, judging from these stories. Yes, he bemoans the black man's situation, as advertised, but you would expect his message, based on his stature, to be one of pride, dignity, taking responsiblity for one's actions, and fighting adversity to try to improve your race's lot in life. I didn't see that at all. What I saw was the typical victim's mentality, namely, I'm a victim, I'm not responsible for my actions, it's always somebody's else's fault, and you should feel sorry for me and give me handouts. I thought this mentality was invented in the 90's but evidently it goes back at least 50 yrs before that. As an example, a black man stabs and murders a white woman, hides her body, and uses her panties to wipe blood off the floor before throwing the panties onto the dead body. Yet the story says that he was only \\"reacting to the emotions\\" stirred up in him by the white man's unfairness toward blacks. In other words, it's not my fault that I commit crimes, so I shouldn't be punished. What kind of lesson is that, and how does it improve life for anyone?"},{"Title":"Eight Men","review":"I needed a particular story by the great Richard Wright but unfortunately, although I specifically said this was the work I needed, the selection sent did not have it within!

This book displayed the expertise that Wright displays in all his works."},{"Title":"River Home: An Angler's Explorations","review":"Perhaps it has to do with living in the Midwest or on Lake Michigan, but 'The River Home' hit home in more than one way. Jerry Dennis brings out all the humor, irony and mishaps that anglers experience. I just didn't know these things happened to others until I read about them! He breaks down the pleasures of life and fishing to the simplest forms. Can't wait to break out the fly rod in spring!"},{"Title":"River Home: An Angler's Explorations","review":"&quot;Big trout are greedy,&quot; writes Jerry Dennis in one of the nineteen essays and five short stories that make up this splendid collection.And as a writer, Dennis is as greedy as a big trout. He feeds voraciously on the facts, observations, insights and conclusions which tell him that as a writer he is alive.Both long-time fans of Dennis's work and newcomers alike will find &quot;The River Home&quot; to be a special treat. Those familiar with his early book of fishing essays, &quot;A Place on the Water&quot; as well as his two books of natural history, &quot;It's Raining Frogs and Fishes&quot; and &quot;A Bird in the Waterfall&quot; will be able to trace his growth as a writer. Those who aren't will be amazed at the style at which Dennis has arrived at this point in his career.I'll leave the official pronouncement of &quot;a classic form&quot; to wiser and more experienced reviewers. But in this book, Jerry Dennis has elevated the typical &quot;outdoor&quot; essay, usually a mere recollection of adventures while hunting, fishing, camping, canoeing, or pursuing other outdoor activities. He has transcended the typical by blending in elements of &quot;nature&quot; writing: observation, research, speculation about the world in which the sportsman places himself. And for Dennis, this world is not merely part of the background; it is part of the fabric of the experience in which he wraps himself.For example, in the initial essay, &quot;Home Again,&quot; as easily as he'd don a favorite pair of worn blue jeans, he slips into a discussion of the geological impact of glaciers on the part of Michigan where he lives. And in &quot;Big Troug in Condor Country&quot; he takes time out from taking you trout fishing to explain the topography of the Rio Puelo Valley and the lives of the people there.If you want comparisons, I'll offer: Dennis is like John McPhee in that he speaks with authority based on exhaustive research and experience; the facts have become his own. He is like Walt Whitman who! wrote, &quot;What I shall assume you shall assume.&quot; In places Dennis speaks of &quot;we&quot; and you quickly learn to trust his conclusions.Whitman also wrote: &quot;Do I contradict myslf? Very well then I contradict myself (I am large, I contain multitudes)Contradictions didn't bother Whitman and they don't bother Dennis. In one essay, with a simple pejorative, he dismisses Thoreau's advice that a person be content to explore a few acres in a lifetime. But in another, whose title itself is a quote from ol' Henry David, &quot;Simplify, Simplify&quot; he paraphrases: &quot;I am determined to live life deliberately. I refuse to fritter my life away on details ...&quot;Then again, perhaps he's not contradicting himself. Perhaps he is just being picky.In addition to being greedy, big trout can also be selective."},{"Title":"River Home: An Angler's Explorations","review":"What I liked most about this book is that the majority of the essays are based in Michigan. I gave it an extra star just for that reason. I think if you're from Michigan and you flyfish, then you'll probably enjoy this book as much as I did. His writing style in my opinion is somewhere between Gierach and Lyons. In his essays, Jerry Dennis talks about his favorite fishing partners just like Gierach does. And, the pen and ink illustrations throughout the book are done in the same style as Gierach's books. Dennis writes realistically about fitting his love of fly fishing into an average every day life of a father, just like Lyons does. As far as writing about nature and fly fishing in Michigan I think this book deserves 5 stars. But, I didnt like the few fictional stories toward the end of the book. They were a little odd and had strange endings."},{"Title":"Underground Clinical Vignettes: Behavioral Science: Classical Clinical Cases for USMLE Step 1 Review","review":"Excellent book.

The individual myths are set down in a logical order so that the reader can understand the religious belief system of the ancient Norse people. I do not recommend this book to any adult who would enjoy a more in depth read on the subject; however, it would be a good read for an adult who just wants a quick and enjoyable overview of the subject.I wish more children of European ancestry would embrace their heritage and read up on the myths of their folk. We can all learn a lot about who we are by studying the beliefs that are actually native to our respective peoples."},{"Title":"Myths of the Norsemen,: Retold from the old Norse poems and tales (Puffin books, 464)","review":"Edith Hamilton commented in her book Mythology that unfortunately, no-one had ever woven together the Norse myths into a single epic, similar to the Iliad or the Odyssey. Roger Lancelyn Green has certainly do the best job of it so far. Many people have put together a book that selects among the variant myths, but no one else has ever put them together into such a readable and moving story. It is a great piece of literature in its own right, in addition to being a relatively simple telling of the myths.Anyone wanting a more scholarly approach may want to find another book, such asThe Mythology of All Races.

The book has a part II whih lists and question &amp; answers. Some sample of Q &amp; A will reveal the nature of book. Q. Which tooth paste do you recommend as best for teeth? What mouthwash is best? Hair tonic? Ans: I do not recommend any toothpaste. All that should be necessary is to brush with a good toothbrush and the gums by pinching them between thumb and index finger to improve the circulation...The selling mouthwashes is another example of how the public is fleeced of millions of dollars...The hair is nourished by the bloodstream and it does not need any tonics to keep it healthy. Q: what is your opinion of raw unpasteurized cow's milk? Ans:..In short I consoder milk drinking unhealthful, unnecessary, unfair, unkind, unnatural and a waste of time and money. The first part deals with the concept of health and how to revitalize it. Chapter one points out how health is natural. Next chapter deals with fasting and it can be used to elliminate toxins from body. Chpater 3 discusses postively about nudism. Cloth complicates the health management. He points how in uncivilized societies, there are no mental hangups or sex crimes. Chapter three criticizes flesh eating. Chapter 5 disusses the relevance of exercise. Chpater 6 deals with sex and health. The author is totally against modern attitude to sex. He find all modern methods as dangerous and complicates both physial and mental health. From health point of view, he promotes themperance. Self-indulguence demands high price in the final analysis. One full chapter deal with the concept of food as medicine. He gives menus.

Needless to say, I didn't exactly understand them at the time, but I enjoyed them none the less. By second grade, we were close to finishing the Mallorean, and I had fallen in love. With the characters, with the books, with David Eddings, with fantasy, with reading itself. Exposure to these books has been the single best thing to ever happen to me. I'd always had an average interest in reading, but my attempts at reading the Belgariad myself made me force my own reading skills farther, faster than I could have ever predicted. By middle school, I'd finished the Belgariad and was beginning on the Mallorean, and my reading level was about as high as it could go.Don't get me started on the characters. (The varied, snappish, witty, flawed, perfectly human characters.) You really want me to tell you about them? Alright. Have you got a spare week?David Eddings' words have nurtured me the way nothing else has. They, almost single handedly, built my mindset, my ideals. Garion, Belgarath, Polgara, Silk, Ce'Nedra...they're all my best friends. These books are written in a way that makes you want to read them and reread them until the covers fall off. Some might say they're not appropriate for children. I say, if I ever have kids of my own, they are hearing the &quot;David Eddings books&quot; the same way I heard them. My own voice, every night after dinner.

S. Lewis to an American woman during the last 13 years of his life. I found it pretty dull reading at first. The book only contains Lewis' half of the conversation and most of the letters are pretty short or deal with trivial matters. But, for those who are interested in a more of a personal glimpse of Lewis there are some interesting insights offered: Like what he thought about what journalists have written about him in papers and magazines, his correspondence during the years of his marriage to Joy Davidman (and after her death), the heaviness of the load of correspondence he carried on with many people. Lewis appears to have seen letter writing as more of a duty than a pleasure. He often complained that the load of personal mail made his life miserable, especially at Christmastime. Yet he seems to have faithfully read and answered all those letters.Toward the end of the book the letters get more lengthy and and interesting. I was particularly struck by Lewis' attitude toward dying. He was able to look forward to his eventual death with a genuine hope and longing for the better world beyond these \\"shadowlands\\" and he was able to encourage this lady along those lines through the problems they both had with aging and poor health. I hope such a mature attitude of faith will be mine also when my time comes. It is the hallmark of a life lived for the glory and love of God."},{"Title":"Letters to an American lady","review":"Of course CS Lewis has proven to be the most popular Christian author of the 20th century. And for good reason. He's articulate, well-reasoned, and he certainly has a way with words. This book gives an inside look at Lewis as he corresponds with an American woman whom he apparently never met. The letters were written between 1950 until he died in 1963. If you like reading other peoples' mail (what is it, esp. we Americans have, with such things?), then this can make for interesting reading. Much of what he says here, though, is pretty trivial and doesn't get very deep. But if you want a personal glimpse of Lewis, its probably worth the read."},{"Title":"Letters to an American lady","review":"This is a lovely short book. Lewis' correspondent has her share of health problems, money worries, and family and work troubles. He shows himself a kind and generous man, spiritually encouraging this woman whom he was never to meet, as well as helping her financially. He has a kind and tactful way of expressing himself when they disagree. This book shows a very human side of Lewis. I found his advice very pertinent."},{"Title":"Letters to an American lady","review":"Letters to an American Lady is a compilation of letters C.S. Lewis wrote to a woman in the US named Mary, whom he never met face-to-face, over the last 13 years of his life (1950-1963).

We learn of his day-to-day routine, his various health maladies, his thoughts on cats and dogs (turns out he's more of a \\"cat person\\"), and his genuine humility and desire to encourage others. The reader also learns how Lewis dealt with the sickness and death of his wife, and, just three years after that, his own impending demise. And although these letters are \\"mere\\" personal correspondences not originally meant for publication, one may still glean a good bit of wisdom from them, as well. Lewis (\\"Jack\\" to his friends) has much to say to Mary about dependence upon God and others, the need for one to live in the present, the Christian's appropriate attitude toward death, and much more. For anyone who wants to get to know C.S. Lewis as a person--and receive some wise counsel while so doing--this is a great little book."},{"Title":"Letters to an American lady","review":"I read this book when I was just a teenager and I still refer to it for its profound yet gentle encouragement and open-hearted sincerity. Beautiful book by a beautiful Christian man who lived and practiced his faith. His humility and sweet nature are very evident in the pages of this little book."},{"Title":"Letters to an American lady","review":"Purchased as a gift for someone who loved the book, but I was disappointed in the quality. Type-print and paper not highest quality, or at least not what I expected. The front cover was rough, like it had gotten very hot and the protective plastic had wrinkled."},{"Title":"Letters to an American lady","review":"The book consists of more than 100 letters written by Lewis to an American lady over a 13 year period. A writer of articles and reviews, 4 years his senior, this lady had fallen to hard times. Lewis eventually provided her with a small stipend of support, and after his death, she consented to have Wheaton College publish the collection provided her name was kept secret.What comes together in the collection is charming. One year into their correspondence, they began using their first names. Jack and Mary have small misunderstandings (largely due to Lewis's bad hand), we have Jack mildly rebuking Mary (Why on earth didn't you write one day later when you would have the results?), and we have Jack long-sufferingly reminding her each holiday period not to write him at such times. He suffered from osteoporosis and rheumatism making his letter-writing all the more remarkable. Virtually every letter ends with some variation of \\"let us by all means pray for one another.\\" He was likely to follow exhortation with some mild comment on the weather or his own activities. This American lady was not his only correspondent whose volume ran above 100 letters. Even though he said, the pen has become to me what the oar is to a galley slave, (p. 35) he kept writing . These letters are sympathetic, often straight to the point, rarely one catches a glimmer of annoyance, but sincerely faithful always."},{"Title":"Letters to an American lady","review":"I found this book as enjoyable--and helpful--as anything I've read by Lewis. He gives concise, wise, friendly advice and encouragement to an unnamed correspondent, and, in the process, reveals much about his own Christian walk.

That preference, believe it or not, has very little to do with the fact that I really, really like I Want to be a Pilot. The best part about this book is that it's a great book for beginning readers without rhyming or featuring cartoon-ish animals.Mike and Joe are brothers. Both brothers go to school. While Joe attends grammar school, Mike is learning to fly a plane. After finishing the class and flying 1000 hours of flight time, Mike applies to an airline. There, he has to pass a physical and take some extra training before he can become a co-pilot and, finally, a pilot. Joe would like to follow in his brother's footsteps and gets some good advice from him. At the end of the book, Joe is on the plane when Captain Mike flies to New York!The \\"I Want to Be\\" series of books are for beginning readers. In this one, there are just 131 words and 116 of them are from The First Thousand Words for Children's Reading. Author Carla Greene keeps the sentences short and easy for beginners to read. The font is large and printed on plain white portions of the pages, not obscured by the illustrations. The illustrations, by Richard Gates, are pure 1950s - Joe's pant cuffs are so high they're floods; Mike's physical is modestly performed with his shirt on; the cockpit images are almost quaint compared to modern planes. The cover illustration is the only full color image. Inside, the drawings are basic black and white illustrations with a single color, a blue that is used as a highlight or a background. The later editions of this book might, possibly, be slicker and prettier, but nothing beats the 1957 edition.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Undercover Cat","review":"'The decision came through from the top. Darn Cat henceforth would be listed in the card index and all reports as Informant X-14. Under the anonymous cloak of X-14, his identity would be held secret for all time, and no one, except those actually working the case, would know that he was of a species other than human...'-Passage from &quot;Undercover Cat&quot;, also published as &quot;That Darn Cat&quot;-Two bank robbers Dan and Sammy while on a bank job take Helen Jenkins, a middle-aged bank teller. The FBI are stumped and have no leads to catching the crooks. But fortunately, after so long they finally have a lead. But not the kind of lead they, or for that matter, anyone would ever expect. The Randall children, 23-year-old model Patti, 16-year-old Ingrid, and 12-year-old Mike are left alone for the summer while their parents are on vacation. Their cat, Darn Cat (or D.C. as he is called), comes home one night wearing a watch. After a close look, they realize that it is the watch which Ms. Jenkins had been wearing when she had been kidnapped! Informing the FBI, the Bureau sends in Zeke Kelso, to use the cat to lead them to the bank robbers. But nothing goes exactly the way Zeke expects it, too. Snoopy neighbors, D.C.'s mood changes, and a short tempered neighbor stand in the way but everyone knows that time is running out for them...A totally funny yet suspenseful book, the Gordons certainly have written a book which kept my interest. Not only does the story is read through the people's eyes, we also get to go through the story through the eyes of D.C.! The Gordons imagine what cats think so well that you can almost believe that they had help from a cat to write the book! I love all of the characters, mostly of Patti, Zeke, and Ingrid. I mostly recommend this book to for teenagers and adults, not so much for kids younger than 12 or so.This book was also afterwards again published under another title, &quot;That Darn Cat&quot;. There's also a must read sequel, &quot;Undercover Cat Prowls Again&quot;, which I recommend. There is also the terrific Disney movie version of &quot;Undercover Cat&quot; called &quot;That Darn Cat&quot; with an impressive cast of Hayley Mills, Dean Jones, Frank Gorshin, Elsa Lanchester, Roddy McDowall, and Ed Wynn. It's very different from the book, changed to make it more a family film. It's hilariously funny and in my opinion my favorite Hayley Mills movie besides &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;."},{"Title":"THIRTY STRANGE STORIES","review":"THIS HUGE BOOK HAS ALMOST ALL OF H.G.WELLS BEST WRITINGS.

She tells about catching babies in a time when birth was not considered a medical crisis. As one of the last granny midwives, Margaret has much to tell us about how African-American midwifery was stamped out in particular, and how hospital birth gradually became the norm in this country.

I have been with my father to deliver babies in little houses that had no floors, no electricity, no plumbing.

She is a courageous person and devoted her life to helping mothers; most of them so poor, that they couldn't have afforded to give birth in a hospital. But given the choice, surely they would've chosen her,anyway, as she cared so lovingly for the mothers and their babies, in a way hardly possible in a hospital.

There is also a lot that can be learned from it about the history of midwivery in the U.S."},{"Title":"LISTEN TO ME GOOD: THE STORY OF AN ALABAMA MIDWIFE (WOMEN & HEALTH C&S; PERSPECTIVE)","review":"I know Granny's life. I am her great-grandaughter and grew up with her wisdom. In hindsight I can say she was remarkable, but growing up learning the traditions passed down from the generations seemed natural and just written into our bloodline. I am glad the book was able to capture some of the nuances of her complex life, but nothing can beat the oral traditions that have been handed down to me and my mother. No doubt her life was unimaginably hard, and I am grateful that she paved the way for women like me to be able to get an education and lead a life that she herself would have liked. I don't practice midwifery, but I am glad to have her knowledge. Also, I am certain she would be glad to see the resurgence in the field of midwifery. It is truly honorable and magnificent to be able to help bring life into the world. Enjoy this book not just as history, but as a living and breathing testimony to the dignity of the human spirit.

Thank you."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"&quot;Tales of the Alhambra&quot; was penned by American author Washington Irving (&quot;Rip Van Winkle,&quot; &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;) during a stay at the legendary Alhambra in Granada, Spain. I bought this book after my visit to the Alhambra, and found it to be a fantastic companion to what I had seen and experienced.The Alhambra (and Generalife) is a combination fort/palace/gardens dating from the 13th century, filled with fantastic Arabic architecture (ornate plasterwork, ceramic tiles, sculpted marble fountains and archways), and lots of room for imagining the days of its former greatness, which Irving brings to life most memorably. The book is illustrated with charming and detailed watercolour engravings dating from the same period when the book was written.Irving seamlessly winds legend, history, and a Spanish travelogue of sorts together, and even though the book is over 170 years old, it seems as if it was written yesterday. There are tales of princes, genies, lost and found loves, enchanted treasures, battles, hellish headless horses (does the inspiration seem familiar?), and commentary on the Spanish landscape and nature of the Spaniards that he lives with. Full of bewitching music, the smell of roses and exotic perfumes, firey sunsets, and the ghosts of the past, the book is a sensory treat as well. If you plan on visiting the Alhambra, read this first--it will definitely enhance your experience. If you've already visited, this makes a priceless souvenir, bringing to life once more the stately halls and fragrant gardens."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"I visited Spain in Nov 2002 and was absolutely enchanted by the Nasrid Alhambra palace in Granada. Built in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, it casts a watchful eye over the inhabitants of the city below.From the exterior, palace is surrounded by an imposing fort structure built of reddish brown stone - clearly meant to give the vision of martial strength to the outsiders. At night from the Albaycin (Old Arab Quarter), the palace is hauntingly beautiful-floodlights on the fort giving it a ghostly appearance. Upon entering the deceptively unassuming palace, a world of breathtakingly beautiful art and architecture slowly overwhelms you.I simply couldn't get enough of this palace and often found myself trying to absorb as much of it's ambiance as possible. I was introduced to Washington Irving's work when I had bought an audioguide at the entrance of the palace. This guide was essentially oral excerpts from his book detailing the history and legends of each room as I walked through them.Upon completing the tour, I then was compelled to buy the book. Reading it, I could see the Alhambra in front of my eyes again. In addition to that, I could imagine its former royal inhabitants as the legends of chivalry, romance and ghosts were told.Washington Irving had the opportunity to live for several months in the Alhambra palace. Back then it was a forgotten Moorish fort in a terrible state of disrepair. His style is very soft and dreamlike, thus one is drawn into his writing as he discovers the legends from the 'guardians' who have taken residence in the palace.This book was truly a delight to read, I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn about the Alhambra or as a memoir of one's own visit to the palace."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"Washington Irving is credited with bringing the glorious history and unbelievable beauty of the Alhambra, in the city of Granada, (the last stronghold of the Moors in the South of Spain) to Western conciousness.After spending a day at the Alhambra last Summer, and passing by the closed apartments that he occupied, I decided to listen to his book while driving one hour each way to work. (any short trips won't work because all of the 'tales' are lengthy)My title says it all. If you are a student of dry history this book is not for you. Only about 20-30 minutes will satisfy your curiosity for the facts. If you enjoy legend and lore this book is it. The bulk of the book tells numerous stories of princes and princeses, kings and soldiers, common laborers such as mule drivers and water carriers, loves found and loves lost, and especially the perrenial human lust for long lost and buried treasure, etc., all told with a wonderous style and feel for southern Spain of the 13-th to 15-th centuries.The factual account of how Columbus finally came to agreement with Isabella and Ferdinand to sign the contract for the three ships, almost by chance in 1492, while the two sovereigns were outside Granada laying the final siege of the Alhambra fortress, is mind blowing. History came 'that close' to having Columbus sail three French ships instead of the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria.If you want just the facts, look elsewhere. But if you are planning a trip to Granada and the Alhambra, definitely pick up this book, along with a second, more fact based, and give a read or listen. I wish I had done that before my trip. It would have given much more life and enjoyment to the place as I walked through the various rooms and towers and gardens that Irving so lovingly describes."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"Washington Irving's \\"Tales of the Alhambra\\" is really two books in one. The first section chronicles Irvings 1829 visit to the crumbling Alhambra Palace in Granada, Spain. Irving was permitted to reside within the palace grounds. His beautifully detailled descriptions of the deteriorating palace and its inhabitants fit well within the romantic vision that was beginning to sweep Europe. One can only imagine Irving's influence in shaping the Orientalist craze that played out in the Nineteenth Century European art.As a young man, Washington Iriving was inspired to learn Spanish after having read Miguel Cervantes' \\"Don Quixote\\". In that work, Cervantes interjected long romantic tales into the middle of the narrative. The second half of \\"Tales of the Alhambra\\" is a collection of romantic tales inspired by the Alhambra's Moorish and Spanish past. They are charming tales clearly inspired by Miguel Cervantes.\\"Tales of the Alhambra\\" was published in 1832 and has been in continous print. This book survives because of Irving's ability to recreate a beautiful and romantic past for the ever elegant Alhambra Palace."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"On returning from Spain this spring with fresh memories of The Alhambra of Grenada, I downloaded Washington Irving's work. I wish I had read it before visiting The Alhambra. In these not so dusty pages one views the political and social background of The Alhambra, and hence, all of Spain. The halls, terraces, fountains are richly discussed in this work, mixed in with the Ghostly visions and stories there associated that Irving relates. The stories alone are as fresh as modern television, rich fodder for the imagination.He also describes Spain as it was in the early 19th century, allowing the traveler to compares his own sojourn there.Well worth the reading."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"Many Americans know Washington Irving as the author of \\"the Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" and \\"Rip Van Winkle\\". Few realize that he was also a world traveler, scholarly fluent in Arabic and Spanish and something of an Hispanophile, to the say least.Irving's book is largely responsible for the widespread romantic image of Spain. It is a collection of observation, history, fairy tale, written in Irving's unique blend of romanticism and healthy skepticism. It is roughly framed by his journey to the Alhambra and his departure from it, an in between we are given a tour of the grounds and hear a few tales (including tales of Moorish ghosts on headless horses) which are roughly intertwined as in the Arabian Nights. Indeed, this little book is the 'Arabian Nights' of the west.Before visit the Alhambra read this book. If you are not planning on going, read it and you'll probably change your mind."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"This wonderful book written by a well-loved American author details his travels in Spain, and more specifically in the Castle Alhambra. These tales are delightful, and seemlessly weave from fact to fiction to history to folklore. It is a true travel log, done oh so many years ago, and done with Irving's whimcical and enchanting style. The sketches give a good description of Spain and travel in the early 1800's. Older children and adolescents would probably enjoy these sketches."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"Most likely you know the famous Washington Irving books. But this is left out of most school's must read lists. The Alhambra is a great gift of the Moors to Spain - they ruled there for almost 900 years. Irving, along with Russia's ambassador visited and stayed on. So the tales come from being there. Unusual for a gringo."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"This book is out of print, our local stores couldn't get it for us. An antique dealer on Amazon shipped it to us and within the week we where lost in Granada, Spain, with Washington Irving. We will visit the Alhambra shortly and will think fondly of this book, which gave us quite an insight to its history. There is a good progression to the short stories that make up the book, all of which revolve around the Alhambra. I truly enjoyed reading this one."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"We returned from a visit to the Alhambra in March. The audioguide there consists largely of excerpts from Irving's book, read in a soft soothing voice. This book - and its illustrations - perfectly capture the Alhambra in Irving's time: both its tranquility in this space elevated above the city and its romantic and glorious past. The book reflects the aura of the place and Irving's captivation with its history; it is just right in size, font, and white space, a total publishing success."},{"Title":"Comparative Grammar of the Uralic Languages (A Handbook of the Uralic Languages, Part 3)","review":"Bjorn Collinder's COMPARATIVE GRAMMAR OF THE URALIC LANGUAGES was published by Almqvist & Wiksell of Stockholm in 1960. It is Part 3 of Collinder's \\"A Handbook of the Uralic Languages\\", preceded by FENNO-UGRIC VOCABULARY (Uppsala, 1955) and SURVEY OF THE URALIC LANGUAGES (Uppsala, 1957). It is a great work of synthesis, tying together the disparate views of numerous scholars to create a general picture of the field by the late 1950s.The COMPARATIVE GRAMMAR OF THE URALIC LANGUAGES is divided into three parts, \\"Etymological Phonology\\", \\"Structure\\", (suprasegmentals, general typological observations), and \\"Etymological Morphology\\". Remarks on inflection are very general and place side by side the synchronic systems of various languages, without reaching too much for any Proto-Uralic or even Proto-Baltic-Finnish reconstructions. The book has five maps, though these have certainly been superseded by the wall map of Riho Grunthal and Tapani Salminen, published by the Finno-Ugrian society in the earl 1990s.Collinder's work is widely present on the used market and can make for the most cheaply available introduction to the historical-comparative study of the Uralic languages. It certainly goes for less thanThe Uralic Languages: Description, History and Foreign Influences ed. Denis Sinor (Brill, 1987), the current best introduction, and its authorship by a single person puts a sheen of consistency on it. However, it's important to know that much of the work here is outdated. Collinder's optimism that a genetic relationship between Uralic and Yukaghir would soon be established has proven erroneous. A great deal of the etymologies here are now rejected. In the second half of the 20th century, the number of securely reconstructable Proto-Uralic lexical items has been trimmed drastically after the over-enthusiasm of earlier generations. Nonetheless, many of the most general remarks here continue to be valid, and if you are interested in the subject and come across the book, I would recommend getting it."},{"Title":"St. Clair Shores: Village on the Lake (MI) (Images of America)","review":"This book is nice for anyone who wants to see what some areas of St. Clair Shores, Michigan looked like and to know a little background.

This book will get any novice on his or her feet within the time it takes to read the book. The book is comprehensive in breadth and is quite detailed without getting too cut-and-dried (or maybe I just find the subject matter too interesting =-P). Clearly, the author knows what to cover and to what extent -- there's something to be said for a man who, as the head of the Princeton Outdoor Action, must get a lot of contact with people new to backpacking. Even somewhat experienced backpackers will be able to gain much useful information from this book, particularly from such unusual topics as reading and predicting the weather. Additionally, Curtis' almost die-hard approach to true leave-no-trace backpacking is quite appealing to me -- it only takes a few careless or reckless people before a previously pristine location is ruined for weeks or even months. All in all, this is *the* must-get guide to backpacking. It's comprehensive, adequately detailed (1/4 to 1/3 of the book is dedicated to first aid!) and, best of all, reasonably cheap! =-)"},{"Title":"The Backpacker's Field Manual: A Comprehensive Guide to Mastering Backcountry Skills","review":"This is an excellent general book.

Yet Mr. Curtis' unconventional and sometimes bizarre brand of rules quickly begin to irritate even the most patient reader. Most troubling are his one-sided views of camping and how it is supposed to be done. quickly, the book becomes a turn-off to backpacking.I bought this book to better hone my backpacking skills. I wanted to get a book that would help me learn more about the great outdoors. Considering the reviews other readers gave this book, it was a sure bet. Upon reading the book, I quickly learned that I don't follow Mr. Curtis' brand of Politicall Correctness. His understandable Enviromental concerns quickly begin taking a zealous fervour. His &quot;rules&quot; range from always peeing 200 feet from the trail to prevent defolienting plants(?) to not bathing in rivers because body salts many endanger its fragile ecosystem(?). Thinking about using dead wood for a fire? That too is a no-no in Mr. Curtis' book. It quickly becomes apparent the author's camping experineces are never without an expensive gas stove and an overpriced tent at a minimum. While the book does have some interesting information(Chapters #6,7, &amp; 8), the rest of the book is too &quot;Ecocentric.&quot; I don't consider this book a wise choice for novice backpackers. I wouldn't recommend this book to those interested in backpacking.

I found that because Curtis assumes that the reader has no knowledge of such simple things as how a camp stove works, that I learned things that I never knew about my own campstove, that were not even covered in the manual.Another thing that makes this book especially good for all levels of backpackers is Curtis' coverage of Leave No Trace techniques. Curtis does a very good job of explaining the LNT guidelines and giving practical examples and suggestions for making the minimum impact on the ecosystems while we are backpacking and camping. The manual offers some food for thought by pointing out how many backpackers do simple things that have very significant impact on plant and animal life (e.g. Going swimming in streams and ponds without first washing off toxic chemicals like insect repellant and sun screen).I think this book would be especially useful for leaders who are looking for an organized way to teach backpacking skills to students."},{"Title":"The Backpacker's Field Manual: A Comprehensive Guide to Mastering Backcountry Skills","review":"After I read this book, I felt the wilderness could never be fun again. I was completely wrong, but that's the tone this book has. The entire book tells you what not to do and what could go wrong. That's very important to know, but what is almost as important (and a lot more interesting) are things to do: suggestions about how to make things easier, how to have fun, how to bring the love of the outdoors to other members of your group.The good: There were a couple good ideas in among the mind-numbing numbers of admonitions (damp socks in sleeping bag: genius). Also, the packing lists at the end of the book can be good reminders.As far as I can tell, it's good for a very small class of people: complete beginners who will find all the rules to be new, but are so excited about backpacking that they won't be turned off by the boring, pessimistic book. Personally, I learned just as much from the much shorter section of tips in the beginning of Backpacking California, even though I had not backpacked a whole bunch before reading either."},{"Title":"The Backpacker's Field Manual: A Comprehensive Guide to Mastering Backcountry Skills","review":"If you are new to backpacking and the backcountry, then this is probably the book for you as it has a little information on just about every backpacking subject imaginable. If you have moderate to extensive experience backpacking then you will probably find the information in this book very basic. I have moderate experience and I plowed through about half the book before I permanently set it down out of boredom."},{"Title":"The Backpacker's Field Manual: A Comprehensive Guide to Mastering Backcountry Skills","review":"I really liked the thorough coverage of this book, but some of the environmental talk is a bit overdone. Talking of the environmental impact of swimming in a stream is silly. The real environmental problems that I've seen in the forests are the result of people who have no respect for nature's beauty."},{"Title":"The Backpacker's Field Manual: A Comprehensive Guide to Mastering Backcountry Skills","review":"This book covers everything that a general backpacker needs to know about hiking and camping. The few things the author doesn't cover (great detail about hiking specific specialized terrain, for example), he lists additional resources for. This book is well-written and clearly organized, and includes wilderness first aid, cooking and menu-planning, navigation, how to pack a backpack comfortably, how to select gear, and where to go for more information. There is much more included in the book, including stories from the author's own experience, and some information about ultralight backpacking. Especially valuable is the detailed information about leading a group into the wilderness, how to send out a search party, how to signal for help in all environments, and how to ensure that everyone in a group is comfortable.I've seen many other similar books, and none provide the excellent level of detail that this book provides. I recommend it most highly."},{"Title":"The Backpacker's Field Manual: A Comprehensive Guide to Mastering Backcountry Skills","review":"This is absolutely the most thought out, realistic, pertinent, and easiest to read book reagrding wilderness adventure I have seen yet. The book not only covers things like what food to bring, but increases in nutritional needs for the rigors of backpacking, and how to maintain optimal health. The order which material is presented is cohesive and sound, with tips and strategies to help your every need. I could not reccomend this book enough. It offers a wealth of pictures and diagrams, from the basic types of packs, diagrams of stoves and their parts, to weather systems, and examples for tying food up in trees or making survival shelters. If you need a lot of visual guidance and don't want to read a boring manual about something you are trying to maintain excitment about then this book is it!

It covers everything you need to know to hike or backpack safely and with basic equipment. I particularly enjoyed the information and about maintaining your equipment (I'm a klutz). I also liked the fact that it went into detail as to how to keep clean on the trail and how to maintain cleanliness and leave no impact on the campsite/environment.

All those thoughts and beliefs we are trying to change are part of the odyssey of our soul. They are signaling unlearned soul lessons in the past that are negatively impacting the present by blocking the ability of the body to heal and the power of the mind to manifest our goals.How do we find the messages behind these signals? There is a part of us that has all our answers. It's called the Higher Self. It is the higher part of our mind, free of the emotional baggage we carry and thus our best guide through life. It can direct us to the moments when those thoughts and beliefs were formed so we can change them at the level of consciousness where they were created. How do we get there? Our subconscious mind: It holds all our memories.I highly recommend this book for everyone who has tried everything to create the life they want only to be met with resistance over and over.Ann Muller, author ofSignals from the Soul: How Our Soul Tells Us What We Need to Know"},{"Title":"Odyssey of the Soul, A Trilogy: Book I, Apocatastasis","review":"This book is so mind blowing.

It is wonderful story of spiritual growth and transformation as well as an excellent introduction to the incredibly powerful tools of deep hypnotherapy and spirit releasement techniques. Very different from the distorted view of hypnosis, which has been fostered by Hollywood and stage hypnotists.I speak from experience, since my wife is one of the growing minority of hypnotherapists who do this kind of work. To actually experience this kind of healing work is like tasting an orange for the first time after friends have tried to describe it's taste to you for years. Once you taste it, you finally know what its all about!"},{"Title":"Odyssey of the Soul, A Trilogy: Book I, Apocatastasis","review":"This is the most important book you will ever read because if you, like me, are on a spiritual journey and have finally asked what can I do to help the Earth and humanity at this time of turmoil, you most DEFINITELY have to read this book. This book needs to get into as many hands as possible.Read the book from the very beginning - don't skip around. It will make a bigger impact if you read it this way. You learn about Dr. Harmon and Pamela Chilton and their work in hypnotherapy and when they first receive communication from \\"Master of Light\\". I was in awe through the whole book.

It's that important!"},{"Title":"Odyssey of the Soul, A Trilogy: Book I, Apocatastasis","review":"It is difficult to give a description of this book that does it justice because it covers so much material from hypnotherapy to psychic ability. If you are fascinated by Sylvia Brown, John Edwards, 'Conversations with God' or any other metaphyical books, you will probably find yourself enjoying this book.I love this book because I am a hypnotherapist and in reading this book it helped me to become a much better hypnotherapist through understanding past lives and spirit attachments. I use the muscle testing techniques everyday in my practice. They are invaluable. The light meditation and the information on light is extremely powerful. I have used it for myself and my clients on a regular basis. In sending light, I find that I'm manifesting my dreams much more quickly - sometimes in a matter of minutes.Even if you aren't a Hypnoherapist, you will find that by reading the book it opens you up to discovering your own spirit.I recommend to anyone who is open to learning about the nature of spirit."},{"Title":"Odyssey of the Soul, A Trilogy: Book I, Apocatastasis","review":"This book is a wonderful for self-discovery. I enjoyed the light meditation in chapter 8 so much that I decided to record it on cd with the authors' blessing. (See Light Meditation by Sheri Menelli under the music cd category.)

In forever pursuit of greater understanding of oneself and mankind, this book gently weaves us through spiritual enlightenment. It is not a religious book per se, but harnesses that spirituality housed in all beliefs. While it introduces us to the paths travelled by Hugh Harmon and Pamela Chilton, it gives relevance to the paths in life travelled by all. Everyone has a story! &quot;Odyssey of the Soul&quot; brings plausibility to cases of mind over matter and opens an avenue available to all to get in touch with ones Higher Self. Whilst my, at this stage in life, simple mind could not fathom conversing with &quot;Mike Todd&quot;, I tried to keep an open mind by reasoning that just because I was incapable of such feats, did not mean that others could not and did not have this ability. It is obvious that the tangible is easier to grasp. I especially enjoyed this book because I was able to grow with it and realize although there is still a long path ahead, I am on track..............Master of Light. It was definitely soul inspiring!

The book ends with a fascinating message from &quot;Master of Light,&quot; a channeled being who asks the people of the world to remember to enjoy life with pure delight and joy. He also reminds us to meditate for peace and harmony as we move toward an upcoming age of great enlightenment. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Odyssey of the Soul, A Trilogy: Book I, Apocatastasis","review":"It is written for the layperson and does not have an academic approach with a lot of qualifers on each statement or references to other academics. Thus it is easy to read and is very entertaining. The first two chapters discuss the backgrounds and histories of the authors and thus help the reader make a connection with who is doing the therapy. I never would have found this book in a conventional book store and I was happy to come upon it shortly after publication. I have lent it to several people and bought if for several others. Everyone said they couldn't put it down and they couldn't stop thinking about what was said in the book. One person is now very interested in exploring her past through regression therapy. The book does give some good advice about finding and choosing a hypnotherapist."},{"Title":"Odyssey of the Soul, A Trilogy: Book I, Apocatastasis","review":"In this most outstanding book, I found the back ground on the authors both fascinating and remarkably bold. Opening to the reader a very intimate aspect of themselves that most of us would hide in the secrecy of our own minds. Following the authors history, the book began to take on a life of its own. Clearly this book was written from the stand point of experience not just theoretical jargon. While guiding me on a journey through the different levels of mind and its relationship to Spirit, the authors have convinced me of the great value of this book. The tools, the perceptions, and the graceful explanation of them in this book, have already made quite a difference in my life. The real life cases and the written dialog are brilliant. I highly recommend this book, especially to those who are interested in doing any kind of spiritual work, either with themselves or with others. I sure found the chapter from Master of Light both compelling and enlightening. I excitedly am waiting for the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Bannockburn 1314: Robert Bruce's great victory (Campaign)","review":"Pete Armstrong, a British artist and model-builder, has written an excellent campaign summary of Scotland's greatest military victory, the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Although some of the exact details of this famous battle remain open to debate, Armstrong does a fair job in presenting a balanced campaign narrative that incorporates different viewpoints. Bannockburn is also enhanced by excellent artwork and maps, which help to bring the battle into sharp focus. All in all, this is one of the better Osprey Campaign series titles.In accordance with standard Osprey Campaign series format, Bannockburn 1314 begins with short sections on the origins of the campaign (8 pages), a campaign chronology, opposing commanders, opposing armies and opposing plans. The section on armies details the infantry and cavalry formations of both sides and the author stresses that while the English had superior cavalry, their failure to employ combined arms tactics utilizing both infantry and cavalry was a fundamental flaw in their numerically superior army. Certainly combined arms tactics are sound advice in any period, but while the author points out the English failure in this regard, he fails to point out how the Scottish were any different. If the English were overly reliant on their cavalry, the Scots were certainly overly reliant on spear-armed infantry. The Scots had no answer to the English superior quality and quantity in archers, and this had led to the defeat at Falkirk 16 years before. The section on plans notes that the English King Edward II was well provided with intelligence about the enemy as well as supplies, but had no real plan of campaign other than to relieve the siege of Stirling Castle. Edward's lack of combat experience and his assumption that the Scots would disperse in the face of a major English invasion are cited as primary causes of his negligent planning. Again, while the author's assessment of deficient English planning appears correct, it is hard to see that the Scottish King Robert the Bruce had any serious plan of campaign either. Until the second day of battle, the Scots kept their options open to fight or flee and their victory was the result of opportunity, rather than planning.The campaign narrative itself is 38 pages long and is enhanced by five 2-D maps (Scotland in 1314, Edward II's invasion, the flight of the English army, Scottish raids in northern England, Bannockburn then and now) and three 3-D &quot;Birds Eye View&quot; maps (the fighting on 23 June 1314, the Scottish attack and the collapse of the English army). There are also three excellent battle scenes: the encounter between Robert the Bruce and Henry de Bohun, the attack of the Earl of Gloucester's cavalry on a Scottish schiltron and Edward II's flight). A somewhat longer than usual 20-page section on the battle's aftermath covers casualties, reasons for the English defeat, results of the battle, the continuation of the English-Scot war and changes in military tactics because of the battle. Indeed, the author should be applauded for finding space for some analysis of the battle. Essentially, the author blames most of the defeat upon Edward II's atrocious lack of leadership and faulty decisions, which was certainly a key ingredient in the disaster. Coupled to Edward's poor leadership, Robert the Bruce's ability to boldly seize opportunity presented by English indecision and confusion resulted in a successful Scottish counterattack on the second day. Rather than merely blaming one individual, I think it might be fairer to say that English arrogance was to blame for the defeat, since this same kind of arrogance figured in other battles where professional English armies opposed irregulars (e.g. the American Revolution, the Zulus, the Boers). Inexperienced as he was, Edward II probably would have entered battle more cautiously if opposing a professional continental foe like the French or Spanish. The author does conclude that the English eventually learned at great cost to deal with Scottish tactics and that they put this to good use against the French in the Hundred Years War."},{"Title":"Bannockburn 1314: Robert Bruce's great victory (Campaign)","review":"I thought this book on the Battle of Bannockburn was very good. It was concise and had an excellent intoduction to the battle itself. The pictures, graphics, and illustrations were excellent. One fault I found was not enough time was spent on The Good Sir James of Douglas and his pursuit of a defeated enemy. This pursuit with an inferior force was one of the greatest I feel in military history and not enough was written about it."},{"Title":"Bannockburn 1314: Robert Bruce's great victory (Campaign)","review":"Part of the Osprey campaign series,this one focuses on one of the conflicts in the longrunning conflict between England and Scotland,a north versus south territorial/political dispute that extends over a period of centuries.Not until the 20th century and a ton of social legislation which makes it worthwhile for the Scots to put down the sword,does this on/off again sporadic conflict end.Bannockburn 1314, is one of the more memorable flare-ups between the \\"English and the \\"Scots\\".Edward II,the English king appears to lack the leadership qualities necessary to win this campaign against Scotland in 1314.This is how I interpreted the authors' writing.On the other hand,King Robert I(known as Robert the Bruce)knows all the tricks including how to immobilize the English army by trapping pieces of Edwards grand army in the marshy bogs and soaking wet terrain.According to Armstrong,Edward II was never able to bring but a fragment of his troops into battle.It seemed the English strategy was to show more personal courage and hope this factor to overcome the Scots.Unfortunately for the English,the Scots were just as brave and had alot more \\"tools\\" to use,if not the manpower. The result was a disaster for Edward II and he was almost personally captured twice during this campaign and a follow-up one.There are lots of color plates illustrating the uniforms and equipment of both sides.The portraits are made in context to dramatic points in the conflict so the reader gets to see both the equipment used and great displays of Action.As always maps galore and timetable overviews as well as marches to and from Bannockburn.In the case of Edwards' army a speedy march from Bannockburn. This book doesn't however give alot of politics,the last minute,\\"side-changers\\",Scots who welcome the English, or English not at all saddened by Edward losing his skin."},{"Title":"Bannockburn 1314: Robert Bruce's great victory (Campaign)","review":"Peter Armstrong has done an incredible job researching his account of Scotland's greatest victory at Bannockburn, in 1314.

Thanks, guys!"},{"Title":"Of Plymouth Plantation, 1620-1647 (The American past)","review":"I came across this book quite by accident and didn't think it would be much of a read. Generally speaking I don't read histories and one from the early 1600's was a pretty daunting task - or so I thought. In fact, it was a great tale of adventure and faith and an extremely insightful and thought provoking book about how this country was started and what it must have looked like to those who arrived here some 350 years ago.I really did love this book.Bradford is an engaging writer whose prose isn't hard to understand. In places his understatement about the death and hardship faced almost constantly is even amusing. Nothing of the kind of challenges that the Leyden pilgrims faced in Massachusetts will seem familiar to a modern reader. Just the same, the fact that it all happened is fascinating. One can almost imagine being there, looking over the decks of the Mayflower and facing all that December gray and wilderness and wondering what you were doing coming here. Told in first person it reads like an adventure as much as a history.The pilgrims here are also quite human and not at all the diorama characters of a first graders Thanksgiving craft project. They face social challenges and the horrors of death and disease. Attacks by natives actually occured on occasion. The dream of a sort of providence is one that proves difficult in the real world. Bradford mourns the loss of these ideals and the people who imported them. There's something a little sad in his later passages, whether it be age or a truly lost paradise one never really knows. But what Bradford imagined as a sort of religious nirvana clearly doesn't pan out in the end. Nevertheless it is well worth the journey. I highly recommend a read of this American classic."},{"Title":"Of Plymouth Plantation, 1620-1647 (The American past)","review":"William Bradford spends the entire first chapter of his book describing the Separatist religious movement--he was NOT a Puritan, contrary to the previous review.Bradford's writing style, while sometimes introspective and monotone, is in many instances the most eloquent of all early American authors, using very thoughtful and beautiful metaphors. To describe the success of the Plymouth Colony after about 20 years, he wrote &quot;Thus out of small beginnings greather things have been produced by His hand that made all things of nothing, and gives being to all things that are; and, as one small candle may light a thousand, so the light here kindled hath shone unto many, yea in some sort to our whole nation&quot;.Bradford describes those small beginnings in his book, from the Pilgrims troubles in England to their departure and life in Holland. After twelve years in Holland, the Pilgrims made a teary departure from their friends to come on the Mayflower to America. As they are about to board the ship that will take them to England and on to America, Bradford in a sentimental outpouring writes &quot;they went aboard and their friends with them, where truely doleful was the sight of that sad and mournful parting, to see what sighs and sobs and prayers did sound . . . But the tide, which stays for no man, calling them away that were thus loath to depart, their reverend pastor falling down on his knees with watery cheeks commended them . . . And then with mutual embrases and many tears they took their leave one of another, which proved to be the last leave to many of them.&quot;It was a &quot;last leave to many&quot;, because after Bradford writes the only existing first-hand account of the Mayflower's voyage, and describes briefly some of the explorations made by the Pilgrims, he then describes the horrible first winter which killed half the Pilgrims: &quot;it pleased God to visit us daily with death, and with so general a disease that the living were scarce able to bury the dead, and the well not in any measure suffiient to tend to the sick&quot;.Written in an English that is easier to read than Shakespeare, yet old enough to remind the reader of the books historical value and place in American history. It's plain style should remind us that Bradford was not an English elitist governor like those that would come later such as Winthrop, Sewell, Winslow, and Cotton, but was in fact a simple subsistence farmer by trade.If you want a fluffy, inaccurate, and childish portrayal of Pilgrim life, read a high school history book. If you want the real thing, read &quot;Of Plymouth Plantation&quot; by William Bradford. It's the first American classic"},{"Title":"Of Plymouth Plantation, 1620-1647 (The American past)","review":"Contrary to a previous review, Bradford can in all accuracy be labelled a Puritan, though he himself would not have appreciated the title, it being a word used as a jibe by their opponents. Nowadays, the word has come to refer to a theological standpoint, independent of political positioning. Hence an Anglican might be a Puritan (see Master Alden who came over on the Mayflower), and a Separatist would be even more likely to be one. Puritans might also be called &quot;the hotter sort&quot; of Protestants, for their strictness in matters scriptural, and Puritan theology is entirely in keeping with Bradford's position and beliefs, both political and religious, as a Separatist.Previous reviewers seem to have approached the book with differring expectations. If you want to read about John and Priscilla, go to Longfellow, and if you want to read about Constance of the Mayflower, then you won't find her here (except in the records for the 1623 land division, maybe) - and indeed few of the myths of the Pilgrim Story can be found in Bradford's history. This might dissappoint some people who like to paint their history with honest toil and romance, Plymouth Rocks and Thanksgivings, but to a more attentive reader, Bradford has delights enough to keep anybody satisfied. His style is at times cumbersome, and the language of the 1640s(ish) can often obscure the already confusing legal language of some of the letters and contracts in the book. The language and style, though, are part of the book's character. Bradford's reticence in always referring to himself as either &quot;The Governor&quot; or &quot;Governor Bradford&quot; is not only quaint but also instructive, and to dismiss is as tedious is not to give it its due attention.Overall, Bradford still keeps a sense of adventure and dedication: adventure that the reader may share when confronted with sudden unfamiliar truths of the divisions which separated the Pilgrims, or the decidedly economic flavour to some of the reasons for their departure from Holland. Even to witness on a page before you the first time in any known source that the word &quot;Pilgrims&quot; was used to describe the settlers at Plymouth, is enough to make the reader feel privileged.Morison's notes now look somewhat dated - his anachrinistic mention of Communism sticking particularly in the throat, but the reader might share some of his admiration which obviously emerges for the governor and his people. The Pilgrims at Plymouth can in many ways be regarded as adventurers and even (rather more dubiously) pioneers. Maybe if more people were exposed to Bradford's work they would see that although they weren't quite what popular culture would have us think of them, they were all the same resolute and brave people in most untoward circumstances."},{"Title":"Of Plymouth Plantation, 1620-1647 (The American past)","review":"Although this account of the pilgrams of Plymoth Plantation's first few years in the new world may not be entertaining to the student who is unfamiliar with first hand accounts from original source documents; for those of you who cherish these treasure troves, you have found a gold mine!I especially loved the carefull choice of words with which Bradford as well as other pilgrams from this era were known for. It would do our society well if we were to employ thier thoughtful and skillful use of words.I mention the above because it is so foreign to us, but it in no way eclipses the raw content of the book with respect to the first hand accounts of our fledgling country's history.This book will dispell many of the myths which in recent years have surfaced about the pilgrams motives for coming to America.This book is not only well worth the money, but it is also worth the time to read it!"},{"Title":"Of Plymouth Plantation, 1620-1647 (The American past)","review":"Excellent book!

We were able to move beyond our stereotyped ideas of the Pilgrims to see an account of them from the perspective of their leader. We were struck with the through-and-through integrity of these people who were willing to suffer so many ways for the cause of their Lord. So many times they gave the other guy the advantage and did not press their rights, while we moderns were becoming frustrated at their passivity. But in the end we saw the aggregate worth of their \\"long obedience in the same direction,\\" as mocking sailors and the Indians and many others saw that they truly lived out the faith they claimed.The detailed account of anyone's life, personal or corporate, will have tedium and unnecessary (to our thinking) minutiae, and Bradford's account does have a lot of material I might have edited out.

In the midst of suffering and privation and anxiety the pious hand of William Bradford here set down in ample detail the history of the enterprise from its inception to the year 1647. From him we may learn 'that all great and honourable actions are accompanied with great difficulties, and must be both enterprised and overcome with answerable courages.'\\" (Roger Wolcott, Governor of Mass., 1897)What American isn't familiar with the story of the Pilgrims? Well, I think MANY Americans don't know the whole story, and some people nowadays talk as if it's nothing but a legend or exaggeration of what really happened. Of Plimoth Plantation is an account that should be required reading in every American high school, as well as one that every American Christian should be familiar with.There are only two primary sources which give firsthand accounts of the landing of the Pilgrims and the first Thanksgiving: Bradford's History (written in 1647) and Mourt's Relation, written by Edward Winslow (published in 1622). Mourt's Relation (named after the publisher) describes only the events of the first year, from the landing at Cape Cod in November 1620 until the following November. Compare the two accounts we have of the first Thanksgiving at Plymouth.William Bradford became the governor of Plymouth Colony after the first governor, John Carver, died during the first winter, and he was the governor for 30 of his remaining 37 years at Plymouth. Bradford's narrative is much more extensive than Winslow's, taking us back to when the band of Non-conformist English believers first decide to take the journey across the Atlantic (and no, it wasn't for a vacation - I hear that's actually what some people believe!). Bradford was about 17 years old when he moved to Holland with the group of Separatists in 1607. In his narrative, Bradford describes the persecution and loss they suffered for their beliefs in England, their decision and plans to leave England, the problems they encountered while trying to get to Holland. Since it was illegal to attend any church except the \\"king's church,\\" this small group of Separatists held secret worship meetings at different times and locations. They experienced loss of property and imprisonment because of their refusal to compromise their beliefs. On one occasion when they had arranged for transportation to Holland, they were betrayed and arrested. Another time, while preparing to leave England, the captain of the ship took off with the men on board who were loading their possessions, leaving their women and children behind on shore. Next Bradford tells of the challenges they faced for the 12 years that they lived in Holland, which led to their decision to come to America. He then describes the voyage to and arrival in Massachusetts, the establishment of their colony, their relationship with the local Wampanoag people and the peace treaty they formed, and their struggles to survive in the new land, covering the first 26 years of the Pilgrims in Plymouth.The key idea that comes through in the reading of Bradford's account is the Pilgrim's belief in the Providence of God - that is His \\"most holy, wise and powerful preserving and governing all of His creatures and all their actions\\" (from The Westminster Catechism). (I discovered the word providence is used almost 50 times.) Whenever things looked grim and discouraging for the Pilgrims, Bradford notes that their hope and trust was always in God. When they decided to move to Holland, they knew there were many difficulties they would face in a foreign land where they would need to learn a new language and lifestyle and find new occupations. Bradford comments,\\"Being thus constrained to leave their native soil and country, their lands and livings, and all their friends and familiar acquaintance, it was much, and thought marvelous by many... But these things did not dismay them (though they did sometimes trouble them) for their desires were set on the ways of God, and to enjoy His ordinances; but they rested on His providence, and knew whom they had believed.\\"Again, in the discussion about moving to America, many fears and objections were raised, but they truly believed they were doing what God was calling them to do and that His blessing would be with them.\\"It was granted the dangers were great, but not desperate; the difficulties were many, but not invincible. For though there were many of them likely, yet they were not certain; it might be sundry of the things feared might never befall; others by provident care and the use of good means, might in a great measure be prevented; and all of them, through the help of God, by fortitude and patience, might either be borne or overcome. True it was that such attempts were not to be made and undertaken without good ground and reason; not rashly or lightly as many have done for curiosity or hope of gain, etc. But their condition was not ordinary; their ends were good and honourable; their calling lawful and urgent; and therefore they might expect the blessing of God in their proceeding. Yea, though they should lose their lives in this action, yet might they have comfort in the same, and their endeavors would be honourable.\\"Towards the end of his narrative, Bradford writes some words of remembrance regarding the death of their pastor, William Brewster, in 1643. He then goes on to observe the amazing fact that many of the Pilgrims enjoyed a long life, in spite of all the trials, difficulties and hardships they endured.On many occasions, this group of believers could have abandoned their plans or given up hope of success. But God's hand of protection, provision and direction can be seen as they continued to trust Him. William Bradford believed that by telling their story, many would see the working of God and would trust Him to work in their life as well.If you've never read the original Pilgrim's story written by William Bradford, I recommend you at least read the first half which would get you to about the year 1625."},{"Title":"Of Plymouth Plantation, 1620-1647 (The American past)","review":"I was pleased to find this book about a relative of mine. Hard to believe that it was actually in print"},{"Title":"Of Plymouth Plantation, 1620-1647 (The American past)","review":"William Bradford's Of Plymouth Plantation is perhaps the most boring and vexatious book I have ever read. The plain style employed by Bradford is, undoubtably, because of his Puritan backgroud, but that is still no excuse for the tedious and often archaic redition of events. I should think that a high-school text book would give a more lively presentation of life in the &quot;New Jerusalem&quot;, as Bradford calls it.

He told tales about his neighbors and friends and described how the pilgrims constantly bickered with traders and their benefactors over money. My whole fantasy about what I thought the Pilgrims were like has completely changed. Now I consider them petty, self-righteous gossip mongers. The book was good for general information about preparation for their trip and what they actually did when they got here, but as far as historical fact goes, I was unimpressed. Bradford discusses people who stray from the flock, &quot;outsiders&quot; who get girls pregnant, drunkards, and preachers who were not to his liking.

I love to work hard and sweat and tone but I also like a a spiritual, peacefull aspect to my practice and although he does make some good points, to me he sounds like he is lecturing and even though he is reminding us to leave our ego behind to me he sounds full of ego which may be because of his tone. Baptiste talks a lot but I feel inspired and encouraged and he seems so warm and genuine. Shiva is calm and graceful with a very soothing voice. I know Kest is very popular and successful and probably a real fun guy (at times I cracked up during the routine) and the first time I did it I enjoyed it.

I almost feel as if I am stuck inside the mind of someone with attention deficit disorder. Towards the end, our hero is named Minister of Public Information and we finally get on to a storyline. We learn of the sordid deals the Colombian government makes with wealthy, private citizens, as well as with the U.S. government.The characters are interesting and you begin to \\"hate\\" the atagonists as the latter part of the book begins to take shape.

From the start, when a young protagonist becomes horrifyingly entrapped within the pixilated universe of a computer game, it moves boundlessly forward through a series of nifty plot turns that produce more than just a few surprises. What's special is that one is also confronted with ideas that make one wonder and issues that make one think.Related in a vernacular that is sure to appeal to young men, it also taps into their energy and singular resourcefullness, always treating them seriously. As a father of two energetic teenagers, it's clear where Yager's inspiration comes from.

Fittingly, Goethe's numerous interests and telents, including law, geology, science and literature, come to life in Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship the precursor to Wilhelm Meister's Journeyman Years.I caution all those who pick up this book to do so with grit and determination for it is not light reading. The density and complexity of the piece can be discouraging and the sometimes fantastical character encounters can leave you with a sense of shallowness and predictability. These opinions, however, are ones that fade away as the overall impact of the novel begins to set in and alter you perceptions of the world.Goethe's romantic voice can be heard throughout, and, while many readers prefer the more adventurous and extravegant side of love, the romances here are shockingly harsh and true-to-life, which only add to the benefits of the work. To be sure adveture and extravegance are not spared.Goethe was also the quitesential statesman of his time, and this meant ties to Freemasonry. What can be interpreted as Masonic overtones and undertones add a veil of mystery and adventure to the book, while philosophical exchanges leave the reader with points to consider, even in today's world.My appreciation for this book stems from its uncanny insight into my present life and the lingering ideas it presented to me. Had I not read this novel I would surely be missing something extraordinary today."},{"Title":"Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship","review":"Whenever I read Goethe's poems, plays or prose, I'm reminded of his genius. But I have a particularly warm spot in my heart for Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, Goethe's philosophical novel. The story is gripping, the characters majestic and the ideas compelling.The novel's cornerstone is its chapter entitled \\"Confessions of a Beautiful Soul.\\" That chapter provides the thread that ties together the book's plot and characters to its philosophy. In that chapter and what follows -- no less than in his Faust -- Goethe provides a glimpse of lives that he views to be truly worth living.My advice is to read the Sorrows of Young Werther, in which Goethe shows what it means to be an immature, impetuous post-adolescent, and then read Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, and learn what it means to evolve into a wise, contended adult. On the surface, Werther was Goethe's great tragedy, but if you ask me, the real tragedy is that Meister is rarely read in modern America. Hopefully, the book will soon have a renaissance. Lord knows it deserves one."},{"Title":"Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship","review":"No, this isn't the latest da Vinci code. But it isn't half as bad as some of the reviews make it out to be. Yes, this is a very philosophical novel. It was written a couple of centuries ago and thus reflects the conditions of the time. Yet it capture in universal terms the uncertainties faced by an adolescent as he takes his place in society. This is the reason it was taken as a template for such novels over a period of a hundred years in Germany. For contemporary literature treating the same topic there are obviously better alternative, but for an understanding of how individuality shaped the modern world, this is an excellent place to being your investigations."},{"Title":"Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship","review":"German phrase, meaning \\"novel that raises (characteres)\\", very common type of a novel in 18th century best describes this book.Wilhelm Meister alter ego of Goethe himself advances through stages of life consistenting from theatre to salesman to \\"one that shall be married with someone of higher class than he\\".In the mouth of his characters, that are not entirely fictional, Goethe develops problems which he sees as an important factor in a world that he had lived.Ranging from his views of national theatre, national literature (as presented by von Herder or the whole cultural situation in the wolrd in those days) to the morale, marriage, love and succesfullnes of any type.Though presented in typically romantic manner this book is read very easy, you'll just need to accomodate yourself to the language and way of thinking of 18th century, which can be looked upon as somewhat naive....especially considering some recent works that have been written around same theme.Insightfull view to the German romantic novel which you may like or you may not (as it is with any other book)...wouldn't recomend to someone who just started to discover the brilliant world of literature, this book searches for highly tuned reader who has much interest (and much knowledge) of the 18th century world..."},{"Title":"Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship","review":"I'd consider ordering this book, but the reviews seem confusing.

Hence my neutral three-star rating."},{"Title":"Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship","review":"I have read Thomas Carlyle's description of Mignon and it was so beautiful that I felt that I must read the book. Plus, I recognise Goethe's genius from other books I have read, and his songs which have been put to music by Schubert. But translation is important to me and I wondered what were the most highly recommendable versions (ie. translations) of this great book? It appears here that this translation is by Thomas Caryle, and having read some of his commentary about the book, I have a positive view of his ability to translate and to understand Goethe's intent. But are there other translations I should consider, and if so, how to they compare with this one (which is apparantly the original translation by Caryle)?"},{"Title":"Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship","review":"I've never seen a book printed like this before. It's not good! Spacing often random, words misspelled (or with random symbols instead of letters), punctuation strange. Looks like a job done by a flawed computer program and never reviewed by a human being.The translation is also strange. Done by Thomas Carlye, apparently in the 1820's, so one might expect the English to be a little old-fashioned, but this is extreme to the point of absurdity. Translation is a challenge, it's not surprising that translators such as Constance Garnett are criticized. But she at least produced English that didn't jar with every sentence. Was Goethe's German so stilted, formal, archaic? I can't say, but this book is impossible to read.This book is reputed to be the original bildungsroman. I was looking forward to meeting Goethe in prose. Perhaps there's another option."},{"Title":"Father Damien (Pocket series)","review":"If a rival in your chosen field of endeavor - one with whom you disagreed vehemently and fundamentally - hand garnered world-wide recognition, would you be able to restrain your envy? What if this same rival were by all accounts unkempt, stubborn, and pig-headed and the very idea of him rubbed you the wrong way; could you shield your animosity from view? And finally, what if this same rival laid down his own life, nay, not for his friends, but for complete strangers who were suffering, because he saw Christ in them; could you cast your human pettiness aside? Could you recognize a saint in your midst?Congregationalist minister Dr. Charles McEwen Hyde could not. He penned a letter to another minister, the Rev Gage, that sought to stain the memory of his deceased rival, repeating every nasty rumor about the man. This letter that McEwen wrote to Gage became public. Another Congregationalist read McEwen's letter, and could not keep silent. The result is this very short book, \\"Father Damien: an Open Letter to the Reverend Dr. Hyde of Honolulu\\" by Robert Louis Stevenson, author of, among many great works, Treasure Island.If you don't know the story of Fr. Damien of Molokai, it is one of the most extraordinary tales of courage, humility, and sacrifice in imitation of Christ that you may ever hear. A Catholic priest from Belgium and a religious of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, he ministered to the lepers quarantined on the island of Molokai, Hawaii for sixteen years before succumbing to the disease himself in 1889. He was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI in 2009.Stevenson dispenses no niceties in reproving Rev McEwen, in what amounts to a 30-page well-deserved verbal pummeling - not so much to hurt McEwen (he certainly strips him of his sinful pride), but to defend Fr. Damien, who Stevenson knows will one day be a saint. He gives the rational for his open letter in the very first paragraph:\\"You know enough, doubtless, of the process of canonisation to be aware that, a hundred years after the death of Damien, there will appear a man charged with the painful office of the devil's advocate. After that noble brother of mine, and of all frail clay, shall have lain a century at rest, one shall accuse, one defend him. The circumstance is unusual that the devil's advocate should be a volunteer, should be a member of a sect immediately rival, and should make haste to take upon himself his ugly office ere the bones are cold; unusual, and of a taste which I shall leave my readers free to qualify; unusual, and to me inspiring. If I have at all learned the trade of using words to convey truth and to arouse emotion, you have at last furnished me with a subject. For it is in the interest of all mankind, and the cause of public decency in every quarter of the world, not only that Damien should be righted, but that you and your letter should be displayed at length, in their true colours, to the public eye.\\"Further down, Stevenson, in perhaps one of the most moving tributes ever written describes in stark, horrible detail the essence of St. Damien's life and death:\\"[Molokai is] the most distressful country that ever yet was seen. And observe: that which I saw and suffered from was a settlement purged, bettered, beautified; the new village built, the hospital and the Bishop-Home excellently arranged; the sisters, the doctor, and the missionaries, all indefatigable in their noble tasks. It was a different place when Damien came there and made this great renunciation, and slept that first night under a tree amidst his rotting brethren: alone with pestilence; and looking forward (with what courage, with what pitiful sinkings of dread, God only knows) to a lifetime of dressing sores and stumps.You will say, perhaps, I am too sensitive, that sights as painful abound in cancer hospitals and are confronted daily by doctors and nurses. I have long learned to admire and envy the doctors and the nurses. But there is no cancer hospital so large and populous as Kalawao and Kalaupapa; and in such a matter every fresh case, like every inch of length in the pipe of an organ, deepens the note of the impression; for what daunts the onlooker is that monstrous sum of human suffering by which he stands surrounded. Lastly, no doctor or nurse is called upon to enter once for all the doors of that gehenna; they do not say farewell, they need not abandon hope, on its sad threshold; they but go for a time to their high calling, and can look forward as they go to relief, to recreation, and to rest. But Damien shut-to with his own hand the doors of his own sepulchre.\\"Amen. St. Damien, pray for us, that we find the courage to help our suffering fellows here on earth. And God bless Robert Louis Stevenson for coming to the defense of a humble, peasant priest.This book is public domain and available in several electronic formats at gutenberg dot org - search \\"Father Damien\\"."},{"Title":"Temptation's Trail (Lovegram historical romances)","review":"Miss Amanda Duncan has traveled all the way from New York to Texas to meet up with the famous and heroic Harmon Bass. Amandas brother has gone missing and it is said that there is no better tracker in the West than Mr. Bass. Upon meeting, Harmon is not exactly what Amanda expected. She expected tall, breathtakingly handsome...a man that wore a gun low on his lean hips and helped others out of honor rather than for payment....She is utterly disappointed when she and Harmon first come face to face, but seeing that she really has no other choice, she decides to trust him to find her brother. Along the way, Amanda finds that Harmon is a good man, but a troubled one...eventually they fall in love. I ADORED Amanda. She has got to be one of my favorite heroines that I have ever read. I wanted to give this book a full 5 star rating, but I felt that it could have had some of its length shaved off. I did not always agree with the characters and their actions, but I felt like they were very well developed and that their faults just made them more realistic. This was a great book. It has most definitely earned a spot on my keepers shelf."},{"Title":"Temptation's Trail (Lovegram historical romances)","review":"Worried and desperate, rich Amanda Duncan travels from her priveleged life in a fancy boarding school in New York to the arid frontier of Texas. Convinced of her ability of finding her missing brother with the help of one legendary Harmon Bass, she sets out on the Camanche Trail only to have her rugged half-breed tracker lead her to much more than the fortune in missing jewels that had dissappeared with her brother, but to a love that was waiting at the end of the trail."},{"Title":"Temptation's Trail (Lovegram historical romances)","review":"This is a super fun book; the first of a great series. The most important thing in any book is the characters, not the genre. Well, the couple in this one take the cake. They have a real rocky start, but their romance, continued through five books, is one of my all-time favorites. The author's idea of making one couple's story the foundation of a series of novels, really works for me. Each book (other than Temptation's Trail), has another couple in the forefront, but Harmon and Amanda Bass are as important to each story as the others. You will rarely come across as interesting a character as Harmon Bass, and Amanda is the only one who can drive him crazy. The plot in this book(and the other four) is complex and involving, especially since the characters become like old friends. I wish Dana Ransom (a pseudonym), would write five more books about these two. Don't miss this treat."},{"Title":"Temptation's Trail (Lovegram historical romances)","review":"The heroine in this novel would definitely fall into the 'too dumb to live' category. Again and again throughout the novel she defies the hero and gets them both into trouble. After the third act of defiance and resulting trouble, I began to skim the book. It was either that or pull my hair out. This book was more about violence and rape rather than romance. The author never showed me the characters falling into love, rather they just did with no apparent reason. The action in the book was much more the focus rather than the relationship."},{"Title":"Temptation's Trail (Lovegram historical romances)","review":"This is the beginning book of the Texas series and it is definitely the best one.

Several things stand out in this book. First is the approach which involves following a ficionalized pair of adult sisters who are caring for and coping with an ailing mother. Jacobs writes this account with great depth and creativity and is able to capture the kinds of feelings and describe the kinds of patterns that are often missing in other 'self help' books. Second, Jacobs also utilizes his own expereince, personal and professional, including advice columns he has written over the years. Third, the book covers evrerything from how to decide how much care you can provide to how to consider spiritual and other issues. Fourth, along the way are plenty of very valuable \\"how to\\" suggestions that will be of great benefit to any reader. If you are looking for even one caregiving book for your bookshelf, choose this one. Excellent read. Excellent resource."},{"Title":"The Emotional Survival Guide for Caregivers: Looking After Yourself and Your Family While Helping an Aging Parent","review":"Author Barry Jacobs has done his homework well and speaks of his subject matter with both expertise and the human touch of one who knows this territory first hand from having lived it both personally and professionally. As a practicing clinician, I have recommended it to many patients who are struggling with issues around the aging and declining health of their parents. Jacobs provides a prospective that steers a middle course between acknowledging the guilt that adult children feel around the need to take care of themselves while taking care of their parent, and the real physical and emotional demands of caretaking. Besides all that, he is a good writer and tells us about the central lessons of caretaking through the story of two sisters facing the serious illness of their mother.

It sets up a situation in which two sisters have to care for their aging mother. The book is written in a clear and especially intelligent and helpful way. Throughout there are little summary boxes providing advice as to what should be done at various stages of the process. In the first of these Dr. Jacobs warns against the deleterious effects of 'Shame' on the part of the caregivers. In a second he explains how Caregiving is a work which in certain ways contradicts the American ethic that celebrates Independence, Earning Money in a good way. Caregiving is an activity that requires coordination with others one which is little rewarded financially. Dr. Jacobs also explains how changes in the Medical Care situation mean that people are today released from the Hospital in less well states than they once were. Many stay alive with impairments which would have cost their lives in the past. Caregiving in certain cases goes on for many years and proves truly debilitating to the caregiver. Dr. Jacobs major aim is to help caregivers go through the experience in the best way possible, maintaining their own sanity and health, insofar as possible.I believe this work can be of real help to those who find themselves in a caregiving situation.It is truly an outstanding book written with very great sympathy and understanding."},{"Title":"The Emotional Survival Guide for Caregivers: Looking After Yourself and Your Family While Helping an Aging Parent","review":"I have been in a caregiving situation for twelve years.

More specifically, I'm a fan of films from Monogram Pictures.For those not familiar with Monogram Pictures and those who do know the company and roll their eyebrows and the mention of the Hollywood Studio, Monogram Pictures is a known for producing and releasing low budget films between 1931-1953.Considered a leader among the smaller studios at the time (which have received the distinction of being called \\"Poverty Row\\"), Monogram Pictures was created in 1931 by the merger of two companies, Sono Art-World Wide Pictures and Ray Johnston's Rayart company.And while the Hollywood Studio will be known for its Charlie Chan films or films featuring the Bowery Boys, as MGM and other companies are releasing Monogram Pictures films they acquired through their made-on-demand DVD services or for those who have discovered Monogram Pictures films from those huge Mill Creek classic DVD sets or released by other public domain companies, after watching a few of these films, some that are fun and a sign of the times to films that are just so terribly written that you can't help but laugh at the production quality or horrid writing.Fortunately, I have seen more of these rare gems rather than craptastic low-budget cinema that I have begun to enjoy them.From the fun and crazy adaptation of \\"The Shadow\\" in the second Monogram Pictures \\"Shadow\\" 1946 film titled \\"Behind the Mask\\", the silly murder in a department store in the 1945 film \\"Role Model\\", the Private Investigator who will take the job for the right price in the 1942 film \\"The Living Ghost\\" to one of my favorite music-driven romantic comedies in the 1943 film \\"Campus Rhythm\\".Suffice to say, I have seen probably on two dozen Monogram Pictures film and I have been wanting to watch more and some that I do during my non-reviewing days, where I just want to sit back and laugh.But I want to watch more and with so many collections being released by Mill Creek, DVD's via the major companies through Made-on-Demand services, I just need to make sure what I'm getting is actually Monogram films or find out which are Monogram films.And similar to silent films which I tend to look for indexes and review collections as reference, it's not easy to find information on Poverty Row films because frankly, a lot of these films are just inaccessible and because they weren't big blockbuster films, you just feel lucky if you ever find any DVD releases.But for Monogram Pictures, while there is no review book for these films, there is an index book titled \\"The Monogram Checklist: The Films of Monogram Pictures Corporation, 1931-1952\\" courtesy of Ted Okuda published back in 1997 through McFarland Classics.\\"The Monogram Checklist: The Films of Monogram Pictures Corporation, 1931-1952\\" is a book that lists every Monogram Pictures films by date of release from 1931-1952 and features information on who directed, who wrote, who starred in the film with a brief synopsis, duration and release date. Also, included are the short subjects released by Monogram Pictures.Also, included in the book are some photographs and posters of the films, which is a nice addition as most cinema indexes that I own are just straight text and no images.JUDGMENT CALL:For any Monogram Pictures fans, Ted Okuda's \\"The Monogram Checklist: The Films of Monogram Pictures Corporation, 1931-1952\\" is a wonderful reference guide to all films released by Monogram Pictures.While it would have been nice to have a book with reviews of these films, as mentioned, accessibility to these films are difficult. But as more and more are being released via DVD collections or made-on-demand services, hopefully by using this book as a reference can possibly help in looking for these films and obtaining them on video.If anything, Okuda's book is well-researched and while I'm not an erudite to know if every films released by Monogram Pictures are in this book, I wouldn't be surprise if most of them are. Okuda did a thorough job in featuring these films in the index.Once again, this is an index, not a review book. It's a straight-up reference book and something that I have been looking for as I become more and more interested in obtaining Monogram Pictures films. And while index books for silent films to classic Hollywood films are typically never cheap, with this book being published over 15-years ago, you may be able to find it used. But still, it's worth the investment if you are wanting to watch and obtain Monogram Pictures films.If you are looking for a valuable reference book on Monogram Pictures, \\"The Monogram Checklist: The Films of Monogram Pictures Corporation, 1931-1952\\" by Ted Okuda is highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Mahamudra, Vol I","review":"This book, p. xxi: \\"represents the advanced doctrine and practice as understood and realized by the Kagyupa Order of Tibetan Buddhism.\\" It is a translation of the 16th century \\"Moonlight: An Excellent Elucidation of the Meditational Stages of the Ultimate Great Seal\\" abbreviated as Moonlight of Mahamudra (source text for Thrangu Rinpoche's commentary, \\"Essentials of Mahamudra\\"). \\"This extraordinary treatise provides not only a wealth of knowledge but also methods for realizing enlightenment.\\" The translator provides an extensive Introduction including a brief synopsis of the book.

Darling allows the reader to understand each act in this tragedy from a literal, gramatical and historical perspective. While acknowledging what &quot;experts&quot; say TODAY about the events leading to the battle, Darling takes a fresh approach. &quot;Where was Custer when he made decisions, what, precisely, did he base those decisions on and about what and to whom did he transmit those decisions&quot;? This is no 'Monday morning quarterbacking' from an historical perspective; no 20/20 hindsight vision. Darling emphasizes that neither Washington, General Terry, Colonel Gibbon, nor Custer, himself, had the vaguest notion of understanding Indian warfare and allowed their bigotry to hinder any understanding. Darling reveals the Sioux Campaign of 1876 for what is was, a blundering about on the Plains by ill-equipped, ill-trained and ill-informed offiers and men of the US Army - pitted against what every soldier already knew of the Sioux and Northern Cheyenne; the finest force of fighting cavalry in the world. Did Terry and Custer have a clue about the hostiles' location? Was Washington aware the estimates of Indian strength were erroneous by 300%? And was Marcus Reno the most surprised man on earth when he discovered that the small band of Indians he pursued at Custer's orders led him directly against the largest concentration of Indians ever seen on the North American continent? Historical hindsight allows Terry, Custer, et.al. reasonable intelligence about the force they sought to corral and bring to battle. Roger Darling's well researched and in-depth writing reveals a series of blunders beginning in Washington in the Fall of 1875 and culminating in disaster on a Montana hillside on June 25, 1876. Get the book, devour it, think on it. Not only is it great historical reading, it finally makes sense of what happened and why."},{"Title":"A Sad and Terrible Blunder: Generals Terry and Custer at the Little Big Horn-New Discoveries","review":"Darling has obviously done extensive research and throws new light on the attempt to make Custer the sole scapegoat for the disaster that befell the Seventh Cavalry at the Little Big Horn. As one who has extensively read in Custeriana, I share Darling's views for the most part. I am not sure what Gen. Terry meant when he referred to a Sad and Terrible Blunder, but I think the blunder applies end to end, starting in Washington D.C. and carrying down to Custer and his subordinates. There has been extensive discussion for years of whether or not Custer disobeyed the surviving order that Terry provided to him. Assuming he did, and I don't think so based on my own military experience (e.g. I'd have felt comfortable with a set of discretionary orders like those in marching to Washington D.C.) one wonders what would have happened to Terry if Custer had literally followed those orders as Terry later implied he should have. Perhaps we need a book called CUSTER BLINDLY OBEYS, TERRY DIES. READ THE BOOK AND SEE WHAT I MEAN."},{"Title":"A Sad and Terrible Blunder: Generals Terry and Custer at the Little Big Horn-New Discoveries","review":"A true revelation on what General Terry actually planned in his two point attack of pinching the &quot;hostiles&quot; between two columns and how the plan was poorly executed. The book provides an excellent overview of the campiagn along with Custer's trials and tribulations. But more importantly the roles of Gibbon and the Terry are discussed in detail. From Gibbon's failure to report the location of large villages that could have saved weeks of useless campaigning/scouting for the hostiles for Terry to Terry's incompetent ability to direct the blocking Montana column into position. This book provides a totally new perspective on the LBH battle. It also reveals the failure of Terry from the drawing of his plan to his hands on field decisions. Routes taken by Terry are covered in detail with excepts from diaries, areial photography and wonderful terrain maps. Darling presents well that Terry carefully planted total blame on Custer through indirect statements that leads one to believe that Custer failed entirely and &quot;paid the price&quot;. Terry never mentions how he took a long detour through rough country without obtaining information from his true scouts, his engineering officer who knew the land or the crow scouts that lived there. How he marched only four miles in one day, lead the column to a dead end, and lost his gatling guns in a night march. However, he states in his report that Custer turned down gattling guns as if Custer could expect them to keep up with them while they failed to keep up with Terry's infantry. Some of Darlings critque on Custer's decision making from the divide to the LBH could be challenged but they make the book more interesting. Whatever mistakes Custer made, he received his punishment not just from his own but from many others starting with the command. It appears the campaign for Terry was not just a battle against the Indians but one of a war hero's battle with character."},{"Title":"A Sad and Terrible Blunder: Generals Terry and Custer at the Little Big Horn-New Discoveries","review":"I just want to add to the other reviewr's here and they all have excellent reviews.

Sort of Inspector Clousseau and the nearsighted character that gets himself in and out of situations with out realizing - Mr. McGoo? This was cleverly done, though, and the hero stayed sympathetic throughout. He is actually pretty resourceful and talented, just clueless as to what is going on.

After I read this book, I became a huge fan...both of Oh the ballplayer and Oh the man.If you're a baseball fan, you'll find what you like. He was, after all a ballplayer, and a great one who deserves to be in Cooperstown. His is a great story, and there's a single chapter devoted to the unique batting style that changed him from disappointment to superstar. I've monkeyed around using his flamingo-style batting stance, and I can tell you it added 25-50 feet to my own hits...and I'm no ballplayer. It works.More important, though, is that this book shows what a truly class act Oh-san is. Although he became the greatest home run hitter in world baseball history, he remained very humble and gave credit to hard work and the guidance of others for his success. There is no Barry Bonds in this man. He is truly worthy of being called a \\"hero,\\" and that's a word I almost never use.Get this book!!!

His writing style is simple, yet beautiful. You don't have to like baseball to like this book.

I figured he would enjoy exploring the activities among the last two pages in Hear Your Heart like How to Measure Your Heart Rate and How to Make a Stethoscope.There are several kids, adults and babies illustrated among the thirty-three pages of Hear Your Heart in various settings as well as illustrations of the heart in pink, red and black colors. The areas are identified to which is a vein and artery with other illustrations showing arrows in how the heart actually beats.Hear Your Heart begins with a girl at the Doctor's office showing a real stethoscope that is cold and making the girl shiver. She much prefers her homemade stethoscope made out of a cardboard tube. There are a few pages showing the girl and her sister listening to each other's heart and then other kids doing the same thing.Hear Your Heart is easy to follow written in a way that kids can understand and comprehend based on the detailed illustrations. The style Hear Your Heart is written in offers all the answers that my child has along the way. This encourages my son to watch the second hand while he counts how many times his heart beats in one minute. There are times we learn like when exercising that the pace will be faster. Also noted is the ninety times a minute for an eight-year old. This is now a figure my son is striving to reach. A man's will be in the area of seventy-two while an infant is around one hundred twenty times a minute.My son is much more aware of his heart and pulse rate and wants to check everyone that he comes in contact with, including his teddy bear.

It is highly intellectual, extensively documented (and I do mean extensively), and a top work of scholarship. As I will discuss below, it is an improveable effort in at least two ways, but from the standpoint of scholarship and depth, this book pretty much blows away most everything that's passing for spiritual theology and spiritual discipline development in Christian bookstores these days.For those interested in Chan's theological perspective, I would classify him, for lack of better terminology, as being in the left wing of Reformed theology. Chan does seem to be in the Calvinistic camp on the question of man's condition and status before God, and it is this Reformed perspective that tends to lay the groundwork for much of the book. Having said this, the book is quite ecumenical, and it is really amazing the sheer volume of Christians, both past and present, that Chan interacts with in this book. If there's one thing that's beyond debate, in my view, it's that the scholarship exhibited by Chan here is breathtaking and will be much appreciated by those looking for a very in-depth and substantive read.The book attempts to lay out a systematic approach to spiritual development, and urges readers to develop and adopt a rule of life that integrates individual and corporate spiritual development with an eye towards connecting the global Christian community more closely. Chan spends a good deal of time not only developing many familiar (though some unfamiliar) spiritual disciplines, but also interacting with far more than the Western spiritual experience. In a book like this, Chan's extensive interaction with Eastern and Asian forms of Christian spirituality is very informative and most helpful.Chan is clearly and rightly concerned about the lack of spiritual development that seems to be dominating much of Protestantism today. In our zeal to adopt individualistic spiritualities that spurn the institutional church and particularly ecclesiastical heirarchy, Chan believes that Protestants have lost a very important aspect of spiritual development - community and global development of a distinctively Christian spirituality. He's right. This book is clearly aimed at getting mainly evangelical Protestants to take another look at the spiritual disciplines not as things to check off on a purely personal 'to do' list, but as the truly life transforming disciplines they are, and to see such spiritual development not purely as individualistic or personal, but as corporate and communally interactive. This mentality is mostly welcome, and it is something evangelicals need to reexamine. The medieval church in particular knew a lot more about spiritual development than many of us today, and Chan very properly has no hang-ups about interacting and incorporating their views and practices into a contemporary rule of life for spiritual development, and neither should we - though this is an area where theological discernment is called for, as Chan himself argues. His remark that 'if Christians today were to learn discernment in large numbers, most television evangelists would go out of business' is spot on, in my view.I will mention 2 regrets that compel me to the 4 star rating. First, Chan's dogmatic and historical scholarship are impeccable, but his interaction with Scripture is not. The reader will find that Chan seems to quote from just about everything and everybody - with the exception of Scripture. His interaction with Scripture is sparse and surface level. Thus, this book deals much more with how the church has pursued spiritual development then with what Scripture actually says about such things. Big weakness. Secondly, it surprised me that in a book on spiritual development via the spiritual disciplines, little to no mention was made of fasting. This strikes me as a rather glaring omission, particularly since fasting is the one spiritual discipline that has been most abandoned within evangelicalism and is the least understood in terms of its purposes and goals.With these critiques in mind, I nonetheless recommend the book as a very substantive and needed survey and development of spiritual theology. This is not a book for the beginner, or for someone looking for fluff and a light read. This book 'definitely ain't that'. But it rewards careful study and contemplation."},{"Title":"Spiritual Theology: A Systematic Study of the Christian Life","review":"This is an excelent, scholarly treatment of Christian Spiritual Theology from an ecumenical protestant perspective. (Although Roman and Orthodox sources are not ignored.) It might not serve as the best introduction to the subject due to its depth but for anyone familiar with the discipline it serves as a solid, weighty corrective to the wispy fluff usually given as &quot;christian spirituality.&quot;Spiritual Theology is a synthetic discipline and this book is firmly rooted in dogmatic theology (Part 1.) It then proceeds to study the Christian disciplines and aids to the Christian life (part 2.) The second section is not a laundry list of disciplines with a how-to explanation, but rather a study of the logic, rationale and relationship of the elements of a life of prayer. Although the book is for any context, many comments are from an Asan perspective.I would recommend this to any one who if moderately familiar with Spiritual Theology, I especially commend the author's broad ecumenical scope as well as his use of contemporary theologians as well as traditional &quot;giants.&quot;"},{"Title":"Spiritual Theology: A Systematic Study of the Christian Life","review":"Simon Chan presents a systematic overview of the Christian spiritual life. Although this book has promise and potential to be a great work, I don't think that it delivered on all levels. At times, Chan's work is insightful and inspiring as to the current state-of-affairs regarding the Christian church. He gives some great parameters in which to do this sort of work.Although Chan does set up some strong criteria and parameters for this study (at any time)--historical, evangelical, global--the book fails to keep to the direct task at hand at all times. As another reviewer stated, this book can be a laborious read and Chan's thought pattern can be somewhat difficult to follow at times. This leads to rabbit trails and a reader that is, at times, behind the point the author is currently making.On a personal note: I wish that Chan would have been more careful in selecting quotations from various Christian writings for two reasons: 1) at times, there are too many quotes -- making it hard to follow. 2) at times, the quotations come from either very mystical Christians (Teresa of Avila) or questionable ones. [Again, this to personal taste]Overall, this book is a need-to-read for those doing theology. I have been a bit hard on the writing style, but Chan does have strong points regarding Christian theology and the life of faith. (Another reviewer did not like Chan's theological position, but that needs to be beside the point in order to catch the thrust of his message) Chan makes points that our churches need to hear and heed as well as our theologians."},{"Title":"Spiritual Theology: A Systematic Study of the Christian Life","review":"Theology is \\"the doctrine of living unto God,\\" wrote the Puritan theologian William Ames. As such, true theological reflections ought to arise from personal encounter with God in Jesus Christ and lead to a deeper spiritual life. However, since the Enlightenment period, theology becomes increasingly fragmented into specialized, merely \\"academic\\" branches (dogmatic, biblical, philosophical and so on) that are often disconnected from its goal of guiding us to godliness. As a result, the church is impoverished if her devotional books are doctrinally thin and her theological works are spiritually vacuous. In his book Spiritual Theology: A Systematic Study of the Christian Life, Dr Simon Chan seeks to address this modern weakness by placing Christian spirituality on solid theological foundations while exploring the practical implications of various Christian doctrines.Any good spiritual theology, he argues, should have a framework comprehensive enough to account for various experiences without losing balance. It should also be internally consistent where each doctrine meaningfully relates to others without explaining away all mysteries of the faith. Finally, it should evoke a sense of the spiritual realities beyond such formulations by integrating prayer and reflections. But what makes for a distinctly Christian spiritual theology? In order to be faithful to both the Christian storyline as well as our own Asian context, Chan calls for three interconnected criteria: the global-contextual (sensitivity to complex historical conditions that shape our thoughts), the evangelical (a personal relationship with Christ mediated by the gospel that entails a countercultural ecclesiology) and the charismatic (an openness to the surprising work of the Holy Spirit). We should be able to review and evaluate Chan's spiritual theology using these tests of adequacy he has provided.In the first part of the book, \\"The Theological Principles of Spiritual Theology,\\" he argues that our knowledge of who God is determines the shape of our spirituality. In spite of the Trinitarian language that pervades the church's liturgy and creeds, our practice is often inconsistently focused on only one Person of the Godhead. For example, a Christological spirituality that focuses on forgiveness of sins and personal relationship with Jesus engenders a warm piety over against impersonal religiosity (page 47). But it may also lead to insular tendencies that see church as mainly opposed to the world if uncoupled from a spirituality of the Father that also affirms our common humanity and creation care. In contrast, a Trinitarian spirituality is modelled after the inner life of the Godhead. It is characterized by a personal intimacy with God through Christ (the Son) and openness to the powerful works of the Spirit that finds its inter-penetrating unity in a basic ascetical structure of life (the Father).Chan proceeds to draw out the spiritual implications from principal doctrines of humanity, salvation and the church. The depth and variety of sins in fallen human nature find their sources in the flesh, the world and the devil. A proper understanding of sin as radical and relational turning away from God is needed to avoid superficial fixes of mere moral improvement. In order to progress spiritually, we need to accept personal accountability instead of blaming it all on genes or circumstances. According to Chan, the cure for worldliness is found in neither externalizing it into a list of places to avoid nor internalizing it into mere attitudes regardless of outward actions. It lies in seeing the world as ultimately transitory in light of the brevity of life and eternity of the life to come (1 Corinthians 7:29-31). To combat sin, we need resources from the gospel of salvation.Although most Protestant Christians understand that we are declared righteous by grace through faith in Christ, it is unclear how it is related to our actual progress in godliness. Sanctification is a result of justification, but in practice, imputed righteousness does not automatically lead to a transformed life. According to Chan, spiritual theology could only be sustained by understanding grace as both \\"God's unmerited favor to undeserving sinners\\" and \\"an empowering gift\\" infused by God that enables human response (page 83). Otherwise, development of character can be reduced to works righteousness or the importance of spiritual disciplines as means of grace is largely ignored. He contends that the pilgrim's progress in conformity to the image of Christ requires repeated actions of growing intensity so that good habits can replace bad ones. The goal of all ascetical disciplines is perfect union with God in love (page 101).However, sanctification does not occur in a vacuum apart from the body of Christ. Spiritual formation is not designed to develop individualistic qualities but to enable responsible and virtuous living within the ecclesial community. Contemporary Christians need to understand that they have been baptized into one Body (1 Cor 12:13). The universal church across space and time bears the visible marks of preaching, baptism and the Lord's Supper and as a sacramental community, points forward to the new creation through her suffering, celebration and solitude.In the second part of the book called \\"The Practice of the Spiritual life,\\" Chan clarifies that his purpose is not to offer tips on how to carry out spiritual disciplines but to focus on the theology that undergirds these practices. While spirituality is a work of divine grace, actual progress comes through effort by practising means of grace like prayer, meditation on the Word, spiritual friendships and so on. He advises a rule of life that is embraced and ordered to enable us to achieve ascetical proficiency. A pattern or rhytmn of life helps us to be more regular in reinforcing desirble habits. We tend to agree that acquiring a certain competency at work or sports require some form of discipline and practice. What makes us think that proficiency at being a Christian is attained by aimless drifting or ad hoc effort?Chan is aware of how incessant demands of modern living weigh down urban Christians today so he proposes \\"an ascetism of small steps\\" (page 11). Borrowing an analogy from mountain climbers, beginners are shown a pathway of simple steps starting from prayer as the first principle of spiritual theology (Chapter 6). Thereafter the winding stairs ascend gradually to the practice of God's presence in daily activities (Chapter 7), meditative Scripture reading and memorization (Chapter 8) and the cultivation of spiritual friendships, meditation on God's creation and social justice (Chapter 9). The author also warns of pitfalls and dangers that may hinder our progress.Therefore discernment becomes necessary to overcome common setbacks like seasons of distraction or dryness, over-scrupulosity that results in rigidity and self-delusion (Chapter 10). Chan also draws plenty of insights from the reflections of revivalist-theologian Jonathan Edwards on how to separate true religious affections and extraordinary phenomena from spurious ones. Finally, the book draws to a close with a discussion on the art of spiritual direction. According to Chan, there are no self-taught saints because even the most mature pilgrim needs help from time to time (page 225). The spiritual director could help to ask hard questions and discern the workings of grace in the life of the directee.An EvaluationFor pastors, seminary students and informed laity, Spiritual Theology is a rewarding book that presupposes some knowledge in classical and contemporary theological discussions. It is not a \`how-to' book for beginners. Personally, I find that it is a valuable resource that integrates systematic theology with its goal of \\"living unto God\\". It admirably passes its own tests of adequacy by drawing resources from various spiritual traditions (desert fathers, Catholic, Orthodox and so on). Being ecumenical in outlook, Chan is also evangelical in his conviction that a personal encounter with Christ as necessary for salvation while remaining conversant with the Asian cultures in which he is situated. For example, his discussions of sin and salvation engage meaningfully with Confucian and Buddhist spiritualities by tracing lines of convergence and divergence (page 66, 77). It also evokes an inner hunger to pursue spiritual disciplines more intentionally for myself. I felt convicted that my own spiritual life could be significantly improved by finding a rule of life between the polarities of contemplative and active.From his Pentecostal perspective, Chan also engaged robustly with both Catholic and Reformed views of grace with a \\"spirituality of the Spirit\\" as an expectant openness to God's surprising work beyond what we can predict or control. I find his proposal on rethinking grace as a helpful corrective to integrate intentional effort in the process of spiritual formation. At the same time, he demonstrates a confident ability to be critical of his own tradition by pointing out its weakness in trying to \`routinize the extraordinary' and a rather undiscerning attitude towards supernatural phenomenon such as \`holy laughter' (page 48, 214). Although some arguments are difficult to follow at times, there are valuable insights to be gained from virtually every page.There are some proposals for improvement: the time-honored discipline of fasting seems to be omitted even though it could serve to intensify our hunger for God and perhaps a Kuyperian model of cultural-political engagement could complement the \`alternative polis' model in contexts like Singapore and Korea where a sizeable Christian population exists (page 36). But the holistic spirituality that emerges is essentially Trinitarian, deeply personal and centered on prayer coupled with meditation on God's word. Its devotion opens up in fellowship with a community of faith, service to others in social justice and appreciation of creation. If such spirituality characterizes the Asian church, it would breathe new life into our mission and church life. As Asian Christians, we are deeply indebted to Chan's insightful and challenging contributions to spiritual theology."},{"Title":"Spiritual Theology: A Systematic Study of the Christian Life","review":"Rev. Dr. Simon Chan is a professor of systematic theology at Trinity Theological College in Singapore; he has over 40 published works in his field. Chan's book is not necessarily the teaching of Christian doctrine, but the association of these doctrines with living the Christian life. It is noted that the academic theology of today would be foreign to theologians of yesteryear, and that \\"spiritual reality is lived reality\\" (p. 16). It is the purpose of this book that Chan calls on church leadership to recognize spiritual theology, bridging intellectual theology and lived spirituality.The book is well written and divided into two parts. Part one describes the principles of spiritual theology, and lists the disciplines of its practice, the types of spirituality, the criterion of spiritual measurement, and nomenclature within this study. Chan further builds on the preeminence of God's word as the foundation of all Christian spirituality, noting the vital relationship between the Trinitarian God, the church, and each other. The chapter on sin and the human nature is a stunning work, noting in general the three sources of sin of the flesh, the world, and the demonic. Convincingly he argues well that the worst of all enemies is the flesh, for without its consent the other two are nearly powerless. In terms of living the Christian life, chapter four emphasizes virtues which should begin at salvation and form one's character. Finally the book shifts to the last chapter of part one, the church as the community of the saints. Christian formation, says Chan, is for responsible living in the community into which we are baptized.It is worthwhile to note that Chan provides a refreshing and sometimes challenging perspective to the western thinker. With his eastern background, the western reader encounters foreign concepts that merit contemplation. For example, the concept of contemplative prayer is often entirely alien to westerners, even uncomfortable. Yet after consideration and practice, one finds its value in regards to listening to God, and enjoying God in the present. Likewise Chan notes that the concepts of justice for the individual forge the culture of western society; its fingerprints are also prevalent throughout the church, from the egalitarian culture to civilizations more hierarchically based.Whilst part one of Chan's book focuses on theological principles, part two focuses on theological practices of the spiritual life. In the chapter on prayer and its practice, Chan illustrates that prayer is the core of spiritual theology. He comments how contemplative prayer is not prevalent in the west which is prone to be active, not passive. Active thought demands answers, and employs the mind to search for the truth. Eastern thought ponders the present, while western thought ponders the past and the future. In the chapter that focuses on God and self, Chan teaches how God's will for our lives is often mistaken; he teaches the biblical idea of knowing God's will. Also as a practice, Chan teaches the exercise of reading and meditating on God's word. Spiritual reading provides a foundation for systematic meditation, and Chan teaches why it's relevant today to practice scripture memorization even in a modern world.Bringing these practices together, the chapter on the rule of life helps the reader view doctrines from a holistic and disciplined viewpoint. The book nears conclusion with a section about discernment, noting John Cassian's warning that in our great study and strenuous endeavors, do not miss what God truly seeks: charity and humility. Finally, in a charge to the shepherds of the flock, Chan calls to action the responsibility of the charge of Christ to the pastors, to individuals, to the church, and to the community.This book is both challenging and provoking, for it compels the reader to evaluate theology in the light of spiritual practice (one's life) against the backdrop of modern living today. It well illustrates how spiritual theology is the amalgamation of lived spirituality and theological doctrine. Every serious learner and leader of the church would do well to make this book a foundational instrument of careful study."},{"Title":"Spiritual Theology: A Systematic Study of the Christian Life","review":"Simon Chan's book is a very edifying read. A unique book of a kind that marries theology and spirituality almost seamlessly. He sets a good theological basis for our understanding of God, church, salvation and sin before drawing out an 'ascetical'(spiritual disciplines) program, that is accessible even to novices. His discussion on sin is very well distilled. The radical nature of sin is well expounded, which helps one see the genius of such doctrines as 'justification by faith'. He then helps us see how that can be lived out in a way that is both congruent and effective, thus healing what Lovelace calls 'the sanctification gap'(between being declared holy and becoming holy).His writing is peppered with various quotations, making it easy for me to know where he is coming from and pointing to sources for further reading. In so doing, he does not go over grounds which other writers have trodden and yet stands on the shoulders of such giants of the Church. He focuses his insightful comments on specific issues that confront the church today,especially in the context of Asian churches that are swept by such forces as individualism and globalization. His analysis of differences between Western and Eastern thinking helps one to do theology with greater discernment and sensitivity to the pecularities of one's culture. Much more can be said about the book but it certainly serves as a wonderful resource for anyone committed to 'living unto God'."},{"Title":"Spiritual Theology: A Systematic Study of the Christian Life","review":"I read Chan's book and tried to find more reviewers, but it was difficult to find. I enjoyed the read, although it was a slow and fairly uneventful read. His view on spiritual warfare was below acceptable...refer to chapter 3, especially where he said that demon possession rare. Positives were -that he believed in generational sin (pg. 60) -that as a community of saints we can only change in smal steps...not confrontational (pg.104) -that we as Christians need to focus on Christ as he is all we have (pg.110+) - that one cannot reproduce the prayers of the saints (pg.132) -that in spiritual friendship one must be willing to open up to others (pg. 178+) -that with the rule of life God does not work in a box (ch. 10) I wish he would have been more open to the giftings of the Holy spirit like prophecy, healing and the like I wish he would have also included more about fasting, meditation, worship and other disciplines as Richard Foster did in The Celebration of Discipline.

I think the cover, and size of book, makes it appear a little too technical but I actually it is Project Managers, Producers, Marketing Managers, Editorial and Content teams, Analysts and the like who will benefit most.It's certainly not a dummies guide and it's not the strategic musings of the latest e-guru: it is practical, applicable, sensible, informative, authoritative, realistic and, despite the 900+ pages, eminently readable. A great balance of process and practice. And, as you would expect, well organised and cross-referenced.Content management is a BIG topic and if you haven't come up against it yet, you will. Without it, all those buzz words like \`eCRM', \`community' and \`personalisation' just aren't possible. Content management addresses big, and growing, problems as well as opening up exciting new opportunities for multi-platform, personalised publishing. This big book is the best thing I've yet read to help you on your way.Ashley FriedleinCEO, e-consultancyAuthor, \\"Web Project Management: Delivering Successful Commercial Web Sites\\""},{"Title":"Content Management Bible","review":"As a Project Manager with a mandate to come up with a Content Management System for my organization, over the course of the past three months I've found the CMS Bible by Boiko simply essential, as most of the other 'bible' tech books I've read have been. He provides a very robust framework that you can follow in your project, if you have the time to read through its almost 1000 pages.First, he delves into a very thorough discussion about the more 'phylosophical' topics of content (what it is, what is data, what is metadata, etc.) and content management at large. If you haven't gotten your feet wet with a CMS project before, the first 10 chapters (175 pages) will get you soaked with the type of dilemmas you are bound to face when you work on a CMS.Then, he provides what could be considered a &quot;recipe&quot; to put together a CMS successfully (though no two CMS projects are ever alike, but a lot of them have similar characteristics). There are a number of chapters and sections specifically devoted to the steps required to ensure a successful outsourcing of the project, but the framework he provides is not limited to it: you can perfectly apply it to an in-house implementation. Also, he tends to paint the largest possible picture (with all staff possible, etc.) but you can very easily scale it down to the size and shape of your organization.In general, his framework goes back once and again to the concept of the &quot;Wheel of Content Management&quot; where he connects the spikes that allow the 'wheel' to move: goals and requirements, audiences, publications, authors, acquisition sources, workflow and staff and access structures, all revolving around the central content component classes with metadata as the outside of the wheel, serving as a container for it all.He doesn't wrap up the book without devoting enough space to XML and its close cousin, the DTD. He even provides a small VB app to convert Word content to XML, and that's still &quot;only&quot; on page 788. If you haven't noticed by now, this book is MASSIVE, and if there's any issue with it, that would be it: the fact that you will need to devote a long time to processing it. But all in all, the book with its companion web site is an invaluable tool for all Project Managers who have in their hands the responsibility of giving birth to a CMS for their organizations."},{"Title":"Content Management Bible","review":"Content management is a major task in my job - we integrate 2 ERP systems, web servers, 2 document management systems.... and there are plenty of places we could improve.This book was a godsend. Almost every page has something that's relevant. Almost every page, I find myself thinking &quot;I know exactly what you mean&quot;, or &quot;Hey, we could really use that idea&quot;.But despite all the useful information, it remains very generalised and extremely readable. Unlike many books of this kind, it doesn't dwell on specific products (or even programming languages) that will likely be out of date in twelve months. The focus is very much on concepts and best practices that will stand the reader in good stead for a long time.I would go so far as to say this is the most helpful IT book I have bought in the past 12 months. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Content Management Bible","review":"While this book certainly offers valuable information it's repetitive to the point of being laughable.A diligent editor with a pair of scissors could have improved the book vastly.The constant cross referring is also pretty annoying - with a good index who needs it.The illustrations are not just cheesy as stated by another reviewer - they are plain silly.I'm easily bored - thus I hate books that spend page and page again on telling me what I will learn reading the coming pages - get to the point for crying out loud.It seems that the book is written solely for web project managers in very, very, very large companies. In fact I doubt that any company would be able to afford a process so painstakingly slow as proposed in the book when choosing or developing a cms. If anyone would be foolish enough to do it they would find out that when they finally after 3 years of hard labour implement the system it's been surpassed a thousand times by new products.Why then give generous 3 stars?

I consider it a plus if I don't count my time in pots of coffee per chapter, just to keep my attention focused.Considering the tedious nature of most writing in the information technology field, having such minimal expectations met is enough for me to rate a book highly. When the rare gem of a book such as Boiko's \\"Content Management Bible\\" comes along I no longer have enough stars to offer. On a scale of one to five, this book is at least an eight. The writing is not only competent but actually a pleasure to read. Boiko doesn't just convey information in a straight forward, easily comprehended manner, he makes the field of content management interesting.This is not a cookbook of recipies or technology specific fixes but an incredible overview of the field, its problems, pitfalls and gotchas as well as its wisdom and growing edges. It is a high level treatment that empowers the mind set to start thinking of specific solutions. I got this book thinking it was just another dry set of instructions but found it inspires me to think more deeply and creativily in my work.Boike makes excellent use of (cheesy but effective) illustrations and flow charts as well as offering an excellent and logical progression of information.

File system directories and informal sharing across publications are sufficient for small sites. But as the size and level of activities grow, informal content management begins to cost too much and take too long. At that point, a Content Management System may become necessary to help organize and automate the process. The decision to automate is normally based on 4 criteria: content size, change frequency, number and diversity of contributors and, the number of publications (channels). A Web Publishing project where content is distributed over more than 1000 pages will likely requires an automated Content Management System (CMS). The process of implementing a CMS is a major project in itself. So, depending on your work environment you may not need to concern yourself with a CMS at this point. Should the need exist, then this book will provide all the required information and more. It is meant for people tasked with designing and implementing CMS, and some filtering will need to be done by the reader interested in only specific aspects of Content Management.

Suddenly desperate to pay off the authorities and maintain his standard of living, he is forced into bed (yes, literally and figuratively) with Russian mafia/bizness concern, all of which leads to some silly tie-in with oil pipelines and British and American intelligence. What is much more interesting than all this, however, is the internal musing on the nature and uses of sex in the the protagonists' life. While there are some good bits here and there, I found it to be a rather annoying book in the end.

Clear, direct, and occasionally funny, Lactate Lift-Off covers a lot of ground for a slim volume of only 138 pages.Anderson begins by offering the standard definition of LT and its relationship to running speed. He correctly reports that LT is the point at which lactate begins to accumulate in the blood in an amount greater than resting levels. This happens at a running speed that corresponds approximately to 15km pace. In other words, all running speeds slower than 15km pace are below LT. As your speed increases above 15km pace oxygen becomes increasing scarce, lactic acid is produced in your muscles and is removed to the bloodstream as lactate. (Note: Lactic acid and lactate are very similar, but not the same. However, in most scientific literature regarding LT, the two are considered synonymous.)But what exactly is lactate? Anderson answers the question by first telling us what lactate is not: \\"Lactic acid doesn't produce burning sensations, it does not induce soreness, and it's not a form of metabolic garbage....\\" He further explains that \\"...lactic acid is produced by your body all the time, around the clock, even when you're at rest....\\" Then we're told what the compound really is: \\"During exercise, lactate is also an irreplaceable source of immediate energy for muscles and other tissues, so much so that enhancing your ability to process lactate can improve you race times rather dramatically.\\" In other words, lactate is produced in the muscles, removed to the blood, and reused by other tissues in the body or returned to working muscles. This process of creation, removal, and reuse is known as the lactate shuttle. Hence, raising LT isn't just a matter of delaying lactate production, it's also a matter of clearing lactate from the blood when it appears.It's an ironclad law of physiology that the further above LT you go, the sooner your exercise session will end. The obvious question, of course, is how do you improve LT. Anderson provides us with a bevy of workouts verified by recent research from exercise physiology labs around the world. Too numerous to list here (you'll have to read the book), most involve running at, above, or well above LT. This will be unwelcome news the junk-mileage crowd, who steadfastly cling to the notion that plodding endless miles will somehow make them faster. For the rest of us, the avalanche of scientific research produced since the late 1980s is clear and convincing. Intensity trumps volume. Speed matters at all distances. Maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) is nearly impossible to improve in experienced endurance athletes. LT, on the other hand, can be improved in almost everyone, sometimes dramatically. These are the sound scientific principles that animate the pen of Anderson and make Lactate Lift-Off truly valuable resource."},{"Title":"The Cable Guy","review":"The cable guy by Harriet Grey was just like the movie, it was exactly the same.

Whoever its source may be, the relevance to the contemporary business world is compelling. More about that later. In his Introduction, Levine notes that the \\"broken windows\\" theory was first put forth by criminologists James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling (in 1982) when explaining what a \\"broken window\\" is in criminal justice terms: a \\"signal\\" that if petty crimes such as graffiti and purse snatching are not dealt with in a resolute and timely manner, far more serious crimes will also be tolerated.According to Wilson and Kelling, \\"social psychologists and police officers tend to agree that if a window in a building is broken and left unrepaired, all the rest of the windows will soon be broken.\\" Why? Levine: \\"Because the message being sent out by [something seemingly as insignificant as a] broken window -- the perception it invites -- is that the owner of this building and the people of the community around it don't care if the window is broken. They have given up and anarchy reigns here. Do as you will, because nobody cares.\\"Throughout his riveting narrative, Levine cites hundreds of workplace situations which send \\"signals that no one is watching.\\" At least not consciously, perhaps, but many of them are absorbed and retained in the subconscious mind.As I was well into reading this book, I thought about the only local car wash which my wife and I patronize. The pricing is competitive. What differentiates it from its competition? Those who work there are friendly, the interior and exterior waiting areas are impeccably clean as well as well-lit, and most important of all, each of our cars is always thoroughly cleaned inside and out. One final point, just before the attendant waves her or his towel, the side windows are rolled down an inch or two so that no water line is left. An insignificant detail? Not to us. We also patronize the same local dry cleaner. Friendly people, competitive prices, pleasant public area, etc. What's the difference? No wrinkles (ever) on shirts and blouses pressed. Seams on pressed pants and trousers are also pressed to perfection. Always. Broken buttons replaced. Every one of them. No need to point out stains. They see them and remove them. Always. These are two personal examples, I realize. Hardly definitive or even representative of their respective industries. That's the point.All organizations have \\"broken windows\\" in one form or another. They are inevitable. Levine's key point is that organizations whose culture demands perfection in all operations and cordiality in all relationships will (a) minimize the number of their \\"broken windows\\" and (b) immediately repair those few which occur. No litter on the grounds. No dead plants in the lobby. No dimly-lit rooms. Most important of all, no toxic or incompetent people on the payroll.Almost everything Levine recommends should require little (if any) expenditure of hours or dollars. All else being equal or comparable (quality of product, pricing, convenience, etc.), everything depends on being constantly alert for the aforementioned \\"signals\\" and then responding to them in a timely manner. Ignore them or delay the response to them and they will send messages which demoralize workers, offend customers, and discourage those who might otherwise provide new business. Stated enough way, tolerance of \\"broken windows\\" will add a substantial total cost which is avoidable. I strongly urge those who read this brief commentary of mine to read Levine's book. Absorb and digest his brilliant analysis of an obvious but generally neglected area of opportunity. Then with your associates, seek out and immediately repair every \\"broken window\\" throughout your organization. You can be certain that countless others have already noticed them.If that fact does not seem important, indifference may well be the largest \\"broken window\\" in need of repair."},{"Title":"Broken Windows, Broken Business: How the Smallest Remedies Reap the Biggest Rewards","review":"This book reinforces some solid business concepts which you probably have read or heard about previously. The basic logic is that little things count and is best summed up in an old rhyme or proverbFor want of a nail the shoe was lost.For want of a shoe the horse was lost.For want of a horse the rider was lost.For want of a rider the battle was lost.For want of a battle the kingdom was lost.And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.The title and the logic is borrowed from an article published by criminologists George L. Kelling and James Q. Wilson in the Atlantic Journal, March 1982 (http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/198203/broken-windows). Malcolm Gladwell addressed this concept very cogently and interestingly in his best seller - The Tipping Point. (Now that IS a five star book).Levine references a large number of corporations to illustrate the impact or fixing / not fixing broken windows. Although the publication date suggests November 2005, this book must have gone to press a long time prior to that. He castigates McDonald's for failure to implement the basics and states if Ray Kroc were to return today, he would die of embarrassment. That might have been accurate three years ago but not today. Indeed, the hamburger giant is now a poster child for the author's argument. It has made a dramatic effort to fix its broken windows including better food quality (quality is relative folks), much cleaner, fresher restaurants and a determined effort to make customers more welcome. It is because McDonald's has fixed many of its broken windows that it can now present consistent and substantial same store sales growth for the past three years. So McDonald's truly does prove his point, but this change was pretty obvious for at least two years prior to publication date.The best chapter in the book is probably the one on Obsession and Compulsion. The author's view is that successful CEO's display an almost obsessive compulsive disorder in ensuring that basics are implemented, that staff is trained well and service is the \\"absolute center of broken windows for business\\". He cites Starbucks' Howard Schultz and George Steinbrenner of the New York Yankees as obsessive, compulsive examples in their business dealings.Behavior change does not happen overnight. It is a long slow process which requires constant reinforcement, which is why this book may be worth reading. If you and your colleagues are avid students of customer service and getting it right first time, (in other words have read a lot of good books on the topic) this book will add one more impression to help you believe that the basics do count and that broken windows do lead to broken business."},{"Title":"Broken Windows, Broken Business: How the Smallest Remedies Reap the Biggest Rewards","review":"This book is about perception--and how perception is reality. If you think something is dirty, it is. If you think service is slow, it is. The book is built on original research among police departments. When police paid attention to taking care of the little things, e.g., graffiti and subway jumpers in New York City, citizens started to feel differently--that is, have a different perception about the city and more specifically the neighborhoods that they lived in. These small changes led to big changes in perception, which then leveraged greater changes.Levine's point is that what cities did about crime, businesses can and are doing with respect to their customers and the perceptions their customers have of them. What is the difference between Wendy's, Burger King, and McDonalds? Perception--and often the perceptions, positive or negative are shaped by little things, and little things can make a big difference.Is Krispy Kreme better than Dunkin Donuts? Yes--and no. Depending on who you ask, what they want, and sometimes what part of the country you are in.The real point is whether you are business-to-business or business-to-consumer, business perceptions are critically important. And fixing the broken windows that shape your particular customer's view of you, will go a long way to helping you have the position, sales, and profits that you want in your industry.Armchair Interviews says: The point of the book is not rocket science. It is simple truth that can create enormous leverage and results if it is energetically and consistently applied."},{"Title":"Broken Windows, Broken Business: How the Smallest Remedies Reap the Biggest Rewards","review":"Michael Levine delivers an important message to business owners large and small. He applies to the business world the crime control \\"broken windows\\" theory that correcting small problems prevents larger ones . Broken windows in business - peeling paint, poor customer service, difficult-to-navigate web sites - will inevitably result in negative impressions, degrading word-of-mouth stories and, worst of all, a loss of customers. According to Levine, business owner and managers will need to develope an obsessive-compulsive disorder to adequately prevent and address broken windows, by constantly thinking about and acting on this issue. In addition, Levine strongly recommends that business leaders ocassionaly join the front lines to experience actual customer interactions as well as fund mystery shopper efforts to get an honest appraisal of the customer service experience. Levine is on the mark as we can all probably recall \\"little things\\" that kept us from returning to a place of business - a rude receptionist, a dirty bathroom, for example -and how we come back to places that get it right."},{"Title":"Broken Windows, Broken Business: How the Smallest Remedies Reap the Biggest Rewards","review":"The author has an important insight that customers judge businesses by the small details that sometimes go awry and that negative impressions can overwhelm positives.

The author could get across every point in the entire book in a five page summary. He starts by telling us about the broken window theory put forth in 1982 and illustrated a few examples of how it lead to lower crime. He references both the original Atlantic Monthly article, as well as \\"The Tipping Point\\" (which I highly recommend), and some other texts and speeches that are written much better than his book and that actually contain original and interesting information.The author explains in very simple language how this theory can be applied to business. Essentially the entire book says that \\"broken windows\\" in business are the little things that go wrong, and how a business can't afford to let this happen. He spends almost half of the book talking about how \\"people can be the ultimate broken window\\" and how customer service is one of the most important aspects of your business. These concepts are so simple, that they are basically just reiterations of common business sense.This book does not probe deeply, nor does it even come close to actually delivering any insight or analysis beyond the most superficial. While his case studies are potentially interesting, he doesn't spend more than two pages on any given one.This book is only worth reading if you want some simple concepts and rules that you already know listed in a convenient format. Personally, I found that buying and reading this book was a waste of time. There are plenty of other books about business that contain information and insights that you don't already know."},{"Title":"Broken Windows, Broken Business: How the Smallest Remedies Reap the Biggest Rewards","review":"Traditional wisdom focuses on the 80/20 rule.

EVERYTHING MATTERS!Too many managers are trained, like dogs, to robotically look at spreadsheets, and number crunch, at a quantitative level... which, of course, numbers do matter.Levine's emphasis is to get beyond just the numbers, open your eyes, and LOOK, really NOTICE the details, because it doesn't matter what your current numbers show, if you are missing the big picture called CUSTOMER PERCEPTION!Quality doesn't show up in the spreadsheets, but, instead, it is reflected by what your customers are TRYING to tell you.

Don't miss this book.Get it today."},{"Title":"Broken Windows, Broken Business: How the Smallest Remedies Reap the Biggest Rewards","review":"Michael Levine stated that, \\"small things make all the difference in business.\\" Levine notes that the Broken Windows theory was first thought of by criminologists James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling when explaining what a Broken Windows is in criminal justice terms. It states that a signal that if petty crimes such as graffiti and purse snatching are not dealt with in a resolute and timely manner, far more serious crimes will also be tolerated. The Broken Windows metaphor is used constantly throughout the book. This metaphor lets people imagine a Broken Window as a sign of a weak company or poor management style. Levine chooses this metaphor because he wants to point out that even small problems will increase a company's possibility of going out of business. Levine emphasizes that inevitably every business has flaws but when a consumer notices the flaws, the company is at risk of losing a customer. Management needs to take care of the small problems such as peeling wallpaper or a Broken Window immediately so consumers will stay loyal to the company. The metaphor Broken Windows is used frequently throughout the book. Every business is part of a very competitive market that leaves no room for error. Many companies fall short of their competition resulting in failed businesses and lost consumers. This book teaches business owners how to find the small problems so improvements can occur. Levine stresses the importance of customer feedback such as surveys, because some problems go unnoticed by solely employees or management. One of the most important parts of this theory, which was constantly mentioned by Levine, is that the worst Broken Windows are people. Employees can make or break a company since they play a major role in the customer service process. Most business owners are not available to greet every customer that walks in their business and, therefore they rely heavily on their employees to constantly make a good impression on every customer. Management needs to hire people based on this idea and needs to always be evaluating their staff. Consumers judge a business not only on its appearance but mainly on the employees' attitude and helpfulness. People become very irritated and sometimes one bad experience will result in someone never returning to that business again. This book also covered other types of organizations that do not always have visible Broken Windows, because they have no physical location. For example, websites can be full of Broken Windows. When something goes wrong with a company's Web Site such as not being well organized, the public will find the problem immediately and become increasingly annoyed with the company, and most businesses do not notice there is a problem until it is much too late. This book is full of important aspects of business that are easily over looked and can truly help the success of a business. All organization has Broken Windows in one form or another and they are inevitable. Levine's point is that organizations who demands perfection in all operations will a minimize the number of their Broken Windows and immediately repair those few which occur .Almost everything Levine recommends should require little expenditure of hours or dollars. All else being equal or comparable, everything depends on being constantly alert for the abovementioned \\"signals\\" and then responding to them in a timely manner. Ignore them or delay the response to them and they will send messages which demoralize workers, offend customers, and discourage those who might otherwise provide new business. Stated enough way, tolerance of Broken Windows will add a substantial total cost which is avoidable."},{"Title":"Broken Windows, Broken Business: How the Smallest Remedies Reap the Biggest Rewards","review":"Author borrowed an established theory, stated it in short order, and then proceeded to rehash original comments to extend it into a book rather than the pamphlet it was intended to fill."},{"Title":"Broken Windows, Broken Business: How the Smallest Remedies Reap the Biggest Rewards","review":"A simple idea can go a long way, but this is a little bit of a stretch. The simple idea here is that small things matter. That's the concept behind repairing the \\"broken windows\\" in blighted neighborhoods. Conceptually, when criminals see a neglected building with busted windows, it signals them that here is a place where more serious crimes will be tolerated. The insight is clear: pay attention to details and fix flaws quickly. When this idea is applied to commerce, most businesspeople can catch on quickly, particularly given a few good case histories. Author Michael Levine deserves credit for squeezing the last drop of juice out of this ripe fruit, although impatient readers may lack tolerance for his repetitious counsel. Unfortunately, some examples seem oversimplified, such as ascribing Kmart's decline to bad customer service. Certainly, the overall advice is valid. Business owners must keep their physical plants attractive and train their employees well so their companies can thrive. We recommend sharing this book with a new employee or a beginner at customer service.

It is an entirely just criticism, as this is possibly the most downbeat book on achieving business success that I've ever read. While the premise is intriguing, the actual substance of the book is pretty thin. Yes, we know that details are important and that the little things do matter. Yet, the author's idea of good business practice seems to be to obsessively micromanage every aspect of your business and of your employees' behavior.

If the window doesn't get fixed, the owner doesn't care or isn't paying attention. In that case, perhaps more serious infractions such as theft or violent crime might be tolerated here as well.

Wilson and George L. Kelling entitled \\"Broken Windows\\" in the Atlantic Monthly magazine. The articles explains that by rigorously addressing seemingly insignificant crimes (fair jumping, graffiti, jay walking, and vandalism) that there could be an actually decrease the level of serious crimes. This thinking was rather famously applied in New York City's Mayor Rudolf Giuliani. It cut the number of murders in New York by 1/2. Levin comments that the original paper pointed out the if broken windows were replaced and graffiti removed the overall feeling was people cared and if minor crimes were not tolerated the overall feeling of that strong law enforcement existed. The paper also pointed out if pane of glass was broken it was not long until the entire windows (all the panes) were broken. Levin applies this thinking to business (thus the title). If a pane in a window is broken (bad customer experience is tolerated) that additional panes will be broken (more bad customer service) until the entire window is broken and quite possible the entire business ceases operation. Levine explores the concept of broken windows in business from multiple angles, while looking at example of several business in multiple industries."},{"Title":"Broken Windows, Broken Business: How the Smallest Remedies Reap the Biggest Rewards","review":"This book is about the small yet impactful things every business should pay attention to to avoid slow failure.

A very popular early effort in the historical novel genre (first issued in 1803 and still in print), it is set in Poland in the 1790s and tells of a Polish exile and the failed struggle for independence. The novel drew on eye-witness accounts from Polish refugees and was lauded by the Polish patriot Kosciusko, an acquaintance of the author's brother, Robert. Porter (1776-1850) is best remembered for her later book, The Scottish Chiefs (1810), a work based on the life of Scotch patriot William Wallace. She was the sister of novelist Anna Maria Porter, friend of Hannah More, and others. Amazingly enough for a work first written 200 hundred years ago, Thaddeus of Warsaw reads quite well, and the characters are quite sympathetic, although men cry a bit more than in similar modern day novels."},{"Title":"Thaddeus of Warsaw: A novel","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

It's a great story, great history and of course a lot of treachery and tragedy. I really enjoyed it. It is very long, must be about 1000 pages and the writer, Jane Porter apparently wrote it at a very young age, apparently in her late teens. Read it on a Kindle because you are going to need a dictionary handy because you are oging to need it - their vocabulary in those days was WAY bigger than ours today. There are many words in this book that I have never even heard of before. Critically speaking the author uses 100 words when 10 would do nicely. It's one of the best \\"stories\\" I have read, only surpassed by her other book written some time later called \\"The Scottish Chiefs\\", which was a truly incredible story based on William Wallace life. In my opinion her writing style is far better on this one, so it's slightly easier to read and follow.

This is a good story, more adventure than science, about his Polesotechnic League people. It is quite an adventure. David Falkayn gets thrown into the story and is saved by his boss and cohorts from an ignomious fate. The characters are pretty much stereotypes from mythology and history. I was surprised to realize that Nicholas van Rijn was based on Baron Von Bismarck, the Iron Chancellor, of Germany. There are aspects that are not appropiate to the Baron, but a lot of Mr. van Rijn's character is similar to what I read the Baron would have felt and done.There is a lot of daring do well in this story and some rather farfetched incidents that come out well. It is just amazing. Like Prof. Asimov and his pschohistoric saga, \\"Foundation\\", this is always peaceful to a fault.

David Falkayn and his alien teammates Chee Lan and Adzel. Others also want this world, and another alien race is discovered that is a threat to the Polesotechnic League.

It then explains different techniques and step by step examples of almost anything you will want to draw including still life, people, animals, sky, water, vegetation, etc. It does not cover hatchcrossing methods well.The last section is devoted to studying the styles of famous pastel artists Degas, Monet, Redon and Mir. You can imitate their classic techniques or follow the earlier examples of work which are more modern and contemporary.Pastel can prove to be a very satisfying medium to use as its colours are vibrant and instantaneous and provide a luminosity other mediums strive for. It is not without its drawbacks, ie smudges easily. This book shows you how to blend colour to achieve a spectacular result but expect much practise before you can place your masterpieces on display.Pastels For Beginners is translated from Spanish although you wouldn't know it.

Picture books, however, haven't properly plumbed this rich resource for all it's worth. Haven't, that is, until now. Enter, \\"Terrific\\" by Jon Agee. In it, the world's most inaccurate pessimist joins forces with a tropical critter and together the two work up an unlikely friendship. Prior to the publication of this title, Jon Agee's books had been either designer dreamboats of surrealistic fodder (as in \\"Z Goes Home\\") or they've been about the unlikely pairings of men and wild creatures (as in \\"Milo's Hat Trick\\"). \\"Terrific\\" falls squarely into the latter category.Most people would be thrilled to win an all-expenses-paid cruise to Bermuda. Eugene is not most people. His reaction? \\"Terrific. I'll probably get a really nasty sunburn\\". No sunburn is in Eugene's future, but a shipwreck does leave him stranded on a tiny desert island. Once there, he is befriended by Lenny the talking parrot. Lenny can't flee the island due to a bum wing, but he can draw a nifty diagram of the boat he and Eugene can build. Build it they do (with Eugene muttering, \\"Terrific. I'm going to permanently damage my lower back\\", all the while) and the two cast off. They are then struck sharply by a rescue ship and arrive in Bermuda. Eugene naturally assumes that Lenny is going to remain with the ship (which he once worked on) but the birdy surprises his new friend by making it perfectly clear that he's sticking by his side. And what does Eugene say without a hint of malice or sarcasm to tinge his words? \\"Terrific!\\".Consistently throughout this book Eugene sarcastically predicts one calamity and then gets walloped by a completely different one. It's funny, but sometimes Agee's pictures are at odds with his story. If you just read this book without looking at it, you might get the idea that Eugene walks around with a permanent frown affixed to his face. On the contrary, our hero is at times morose, lonely, grudgingly pleased, and mildly hurt. Agee draws with a deft hand. Images are crisp, clear, and reduced to their most essential forms. It's enough to make you not wonder too hard where exactly Eugene got the tools to build his desert island boat. Hm.It's hard not to root with Eugene every step of the way. His down-in-the-mouth approach to life is countermanded perfectly by Lenny. Lenny is, fortunately, not a permanently perky parrot or a bird with incessant platitudes. He's just a forthright guy who knows exactly how to utilize Eugene's strengths to get the two of them off the island. This is a lesson in cooperation without ever striking the reader as fake or saccharine.\\"Terrific\\" seems to mark a new step in Agee's picture book career. This is a book that is far more character-based than his past efforts. The result is that it has won accolade upon accolade. The art is fabulous, the story droll, and the words pitch perfect.

Can't have ice cream before dinner? You're the worst mom ever! Can't play the board game that they want? Then they don't want to play any game at all! These are typical situations that children often take a pessimistic stance with. The main character of this book also chooses to take a pessimistic stance, even when he wins a free cruise to Bermuda! Ironically, Eugene's mood begins to turn around in the midst of an otherwise unpleasant situation when his ship sinks and he is stranded on a deserted island.

This throws up some interesting and useful applications. For example, how many books do you see with a chapter on widowhood (Anna)? In many of the chapters, the lesson Brownback brings out of the character is to help us learn from that person's mistakes rather than proposing that they display great faith.For example Sarah shows us the seriousness of focussing on our circumstances so that we end up doubting God's promises; Miriam warns us of the danger of a \`what-about-me?' attitude when life seems unfair.It is rich, provocative, and dealt with the passages superbly (in most cases) and got down into the nitty-gritty layers of the heart. She understands how sin works, and how it disguises itself, and she aims for the sin behind your sin--the underlying heart issues.But what really sets this book apart is that she constantly points you to Jesus. Jesus is set forth as the supreme object of faith, not simply as a saviour, or as a substitute for the things we don't have, but as the Christian's first love. This is vital -- faith is not simply something to be encouraged by looking at others, but something to be fed by looking at Jesus.Well worth it!"},{"Title":"Legacy of Faith: From Women of the Bible to Women of Today","review":"I am currently in the midst of a summer-long study on a few select women of the Bible with our church's teen girls; so I've been compiling resources in this process. Lydia Brownback's Legacy of Faith book has been a good resource for the most part; however, I would make the following statements to anyone looking for the best resources in studying Women of the Bible:1. While her book is easy to read and makes some good points, her chapters do not go as deep nor are they as thorough as I was hoping (and sort of assuming based on other reviews) they would be.2. What her book did do was help me to have some illustrations and modern-day type of stories to go along with our studies.By far, the best resource available on women in the Bible is John MacArthur'sTwelve Extraordinary Women: How God Shaped Women of the Bible, and What He Wants to Do with You. His is not only very readable and applicable, but it has the necessary depth and thoroughness I have needed to really make this study work. I also love that his book has some good study questions in the back (in case you don't have the accompanying workbook). I've also used and appreciated Gien Karssen'sHer Name Is Woman, Book 1: 24 Women of the Bible.I would say that I have used and really enjoyed several other of Lydia Brownback's works - particularly her series on \\"A Godly Woman's Adornment\\" (Contentment, Joy, Trust, Purity). I just didn't feel that this particular book of hers was the best resource to have on women in the Bible."},{"Title":"Legacy of Faith: From Women of the Bible to Women of Today","review":"I sent this book as a gift to a friend in a foreign country.

The book was published as the museum \\"catalog\\" for a show of \\"retrofuturism\\" in the car designs and drawings of Mays and designers in his studios at the Los Angeles Museum of Modern Art. \\"Retrofuturism\\" is the derivation of new designs such as the New Beetle, from concepts and visual principles established in an earlier design, e.g., the original VW Beetle. The designers' rough sketches and drawings illustrating evolution of their designs are interesting. But the photos try too hard to be art in themselves and present minimal visual information about the design of the cars pictured. Buy this book for the \\"J. Mays, Designer\\" essay by C. Edson Armi and the \\"Q&J;\\" interview with Mays himself, not for its pictures.\\"J. Mays, Designer\\" will give its reader some mental traction on the slippery links between fundamental visual components of car design - e.g.,geometric shapes, proportion, outline - and the first-hand working insights of J. Mays as he uses them in \\"retro\\" designs such as the New Beetle. This essay can fine-tune the reader's brain in ways that will take you up a level when you see a car you like. Another essay by the show museum curator, Brooks Hodges, is mostly about the business sociology of design; it will not lead your mind to help your eye see more in a car design. J. Mays' comments on his own designs in the \\"Q & J\\" interview section that concludes the book criss-cross the \\"cultural,\\" business and visual considerations that make car design such a challenging art."},{"Title":"Retrofuturism: The Car Designs of J Mays","review":"Tracey Shiffman has designed this catalogue to look as though it's going from 0-60 in a few seconds, and has given it a sexy energy that perfectly matches its subject. In some ways it works better than the exhibition that's on view at the Geffen Contemporary... There, the concept cars are at rest and can't be touched; here they emerge suggestively from shadows, stretch, and zoom off in a blur of light.

If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"The Winning Hand (The MacGregors / Silhouette Special Edition, No. 1202)","review":"&quot;The Winning Hand&quot; is a highly enjoyable book, and reunites readers with one of Nora Roberts' most beloved families, The MacGregors. This is a quick read, but it still contains well thought out and lovable characters, an interesting storyline and setting, and of course, a wonderfully satisfying visit with some of our favourite characters from previous books.When Darcy Wallace arrives in Las Vegas, things just aren't going her way. She's down to her last few dollars when she happens upon The Comanche, a huge hotel/casino, and takes her chances on the pull of a slot machine. Suddenly, Darcy finds herself the winner of nearly two million dollars. Mac, son of Serena and Justin from &quot;Playing the Odds&quot;, runs the Vegas Comanche, and the innocent Darcy finds this handsome gambler irresistible. Mac can't stop thinking about Darcy either, and berates himself for even thinking about taking advantage of this sweet and lonely fairy of a woman. But their feelings are too strong to deny and Darcy and Mac begin a whirlwind romance.It is wonderful to watch Darcy grow as a person and gain confidence as the book progresses. She will surely win readers' hearts. We also get to see lots of Serena and Justin, as well as The MacGregor himself!This book contains an enjoyable, if slightly predictable romance, and characters who all readers will love. It is perfect for curling up by the fire on rainy days or lounging on the beach on sunny ones. I highly recommend this book for those times when you just need to take a break from reality and visit some good friends!"},{"Title":"The Winning Hand (The MacGregors / Silhouette Special Edition, No. 1202)","review":"The latest in the MacGregors does not disappoint.

This is Mac Blade's story- the son of Serena Macgregor and Justin Blade (don't forget to read their story). Darcy Wallace is a librarian running away from her small town life and marriage to a local bully. She ends up in Vegas- penniless, homeless and like a fairy tale, ends up winning almost 2 million dollars w/ the last of her money.Darcy is very likable and her naivete in Vegas bring's out the hero's protective instincts- shielding her from the press, her ex-fiance, and people who would take advantage of her new found wealth. It is a predictable love story, but i thought that was the charm- the two characters (esp Mac) struggle through their feelings, their differences and end up together.It was nice to bring back old favorites -Serena, Justin, and of course, Daniel Macgregor himself. His matchmaking attempts are so funny and the basis of this series. However, even if you have never read any of the Macgregor books- this one can stand alone. Its a must read!"},{"Title":"The Winning Hand (The MacGregors / Silhouette Special Edition, No. 1202)","review":"From the very first line of Chapter 1, I was drawn into the character of Darcy Wallace. It was so easy to identify with her. I felt transformed by every experience she had. I experienced every emotion that Darcy did, every anticipation. The Winning Hand was filled from beginning to end with excitement! It was unbelievable. I felt as if I were Darcy Wallace. I have never been in a casino in my life, but the vivid descriptions drew me from Houston and sat me right down in the middle of the desert of Las Vegas, NV. I could feel the excitement of the activity going on in The Comanche. Darcy reacted exactly the way I would have the next morning after her arrival. Ms. Roberts did a great job of making these characters come alive, yes, but for the first time since I've been reading romances (at least 18 years) the background, the setting, was a character itself. At the end, I could not wait to pick up another story about the MacGregors. What a wonderful, adventurous, romantic tale."},{"Title":"The Winning Hand (The MacGregors / Silhouette Special Edition, No. 1202)","review":"THE WINNING HAND is one of the books revolving around the MacGregor clan and spotlights Robert MacGregor Blade (they call him Mac), the son of Justin Blade and Serena MacGregor Blade. If you read my review on PLAYING THE ODDS or if you've actually read that book, you'll know the story behind Mac's parents meeting. If not, here's a brief synopsis: Daniel MacGregor (Serena's father) once again puts his matchmaking skills to work and \\"introduced\\" these two. Justin is a gambler and owner of a casino. Serena has taken a brief \\"tour\\" as a blackjack dealer on a cruise ship. They meet and the rest is MacGregor history. (I said brief!!)Like I stated, Mac is Serena and Justin son and has the job of running one of several casinos owned by Justin and Serena. Mac has a very hands-on type approach to running the casino and knows exactly what's going on at any given time monitoring everything from either the bank of windows from his office or the many security camera monitors lined up nearby.Darcy was having the worst day in her life, actually the worst several days. Her car broke down several miles outside of Las Vegas and she walked into town in the blazing sun. She was dazed, hot, dehydrated, and looked like she could use a shower and clean clothes when she stumbled into Mac's casino. She then took her last dollar and played it on one of those million-dollar-winner-type slot machines (you know the big ones in the entries to many of the casinos). Sure enough, she hits the million-dollar jackpot and then politely faints right into Mac's arms. Ok, sure it sounds like something that can never happen to the \\"normal\\" person, but hey, we can dream can't we?Mac feels like he needs to take care of Darcy since she won the money in his casino until she gets on her feet and has her stay at his rooms above the casino. (Did I mention that he takes his job very seriously?) I'm sure most of you can see where this is heading, but don't stop reading here...Of course they fall in love and the rest of the book is devoted to how Darcy and Mac resolve various issues and how they become business partners - just like Serena and Justin had years earlier. Just when things look like it will be smooth sailing, Darcy is kidnapped and Mac is beside himself. This kidnapping coincides with Justin and Serena's visit which has both of them reliving Serena's kidnapping. In fact, PLAYING THE ODDS and THE WINNING HAND almost seem to parallel each other!You're probably wondering if I'm going to recommend this book or not. You're also probably thinking that this is a weak story line and not a book that you'd be interested in reading. Well, if you want to laugh out loud, smile continuously while reading, and just have a good time, then this is a book you need to purchase, borrow or find with any other means available! This has become one of my favorite of Nora Roberts' romance type books - it's fun, refreshing even with a story line that has been done over and over again, and of course Daniel MacGregor puts in an appearance to spice things up.Now on the negative side, it is a quick read with only around 200 pages, not filled with much new material and at times seems redundant. It's also a little unbelievable at times - I mean who has actually gambled their last dollar and won a million dollars and then had the gorgeous owner of the casino decide to take care of you? Ah, maybe this is the modern version of Cinderella."},{"Title":"The Winning Hand (The MacGregors / Silhouette Special Edition, No. 1202)","review":"i started reading &quot;romance&quot; books about a year ago when a friend of mine gave me her old copy of sanctuary...i was hooked and since then, have read about 20 of nora roberts books. at this point, no other romance author interests me. each time i read a book of hers, im taken away by how involved i become in the story and characters. this book was no exception and though it is a short one (which allows me to whip right thru it) it is a great one! i absolutely love &quot;the macgregor&quot; :;smile"},{"Title":"The Winning Hand (The MacGregors / Silhouette Special Edition, No. 1202)","review":"From the very first line of Chapter 1, I was drawn into the character of Darcy Walker.

And that is the basis of this novel from the MacGregor series. Pretty young Darcy's car breaks down just outside Las Vegas and she walks onto The Strip. With her last nine dollars and change, she plays a slot machine in the Comanche casino and hotel. Minutes later she has almost two million dollars and the attention of Mac Blade, devilishly handsome manager of the establishment.Having read other Nora Roberts books, it was reasonably easy to extrapolate the plot that ensues. There is the obligatory R rated sex scene, after a stormy few days with Mac Blade, his parents and, unfortunately, The MacGregor, who shows up with his usual suggestions.Personally I have little interest in Las Vegas, with the the sort of people who go there to gamble and see the glitzy, shallow shows. It all seems such a waste of time. Ms. Roberts does manage to make it all seem very real if superficial.This novel is a bit better than most from this series, but not nearly as good as some of the books from later series."},{"Title":"The Winning Hand (The MacGregors / Silhouette Special Edition, No. 1202)","review":"I really loved the book.

Broke and alone, Darcy Wallace takes a chance on a big money slot machine and wins over a million dollars.I enjoyed reading about Darcy's enjoyment of all the things she'd missed up to that point and the way she unexpectedly finds herself and the life she's always wanted. I also enjoyed reading about the participation of the MacGregors in Darcy's new life. Darcy and the MacGregors are charming characters.My only problem with the story was the lack of character development for Mac. I had a hard time understanding what motivated him to do the things he did. The story would have been much better if his character was explained better.

It's definitely meant to be a feel-good story - nothing bad could possibly happen to Darcy. She's a very meek sort of person, and, in spite of what Darcy often says, I would agree with the hero of this book, Mac, that she is also pretty naive.

Frankovich and David Taub were invited to be guest speakers at the Florida Writers Association's 1st Annual convention/Royal Palm Book Awards. It took place from Friday 25th through Sunday 27th, October at the Orlando/Altamonte Springs Hilton Hotel. They gave a one hour Poetry Presentation (on Saturday), which preceded the Royal Palm Book Awards dinner (the Book Awards took place later at 10pm).125 guests, which included some of the 400 FWA members, publishers, editors, agents, book store reps, etc., attended the entire evening event.Approximately 150 titles had been submitted, over the past 6 months, for just about every genre of writing imaginable. The 'judging system' had been incredibly carefully devised, whereby copies of submissions were sent out literally all over the US - every judge had no idea who the other judges were, and each one had no connection / relationship to anyone belonging to the FWA - its members or the FWA Board members, Officers, Directors, etc.The 'scoring system' by each judge, for each book, was also very detailed - a list of criteria requiring a 'rating' for each aspect of the book, effectively giving an overall score book / per judge.The judging took place over several weeks, and all the rating sheets were then returned to a panel of the Directors, and collated by them PLUS overseen and notarised by an attorney! The collating of each book's scores, alone, took 17 hours! A small number of genre categories had been pre-determined, so that each genre category would have its own award - a Winner and Runner-up per category. THEN, finally, an overall &quot;Best Book of the Year&quot; award.For the Poetry category, there were approximately 40 books entered. Language of Souls walked away with the category's Best Poetry Book award!Then, the FWA's President and founder, Glenda Ivey, prior to the Grand Finale of naming the overall &quot;Best Book of the Year&quot; winner, announced that the overall winning book had achieved something wholly unexpected by the 'collating panel' - Namely that, while the overall winner had 'simply' needed to have the highest score of all the entrants, it had achieved a flawless 100% maximum score for EVERY criteria by EVERY judge. And so, this obviously can never be beaten - but only ever equalled - in their future annual book awards.Frankovich and Taub were stunned into absolute silence, when it was announced that the &quot;Book of the Year&quot; winner was........ Language of Souls.In a later interview, Frankovich commented, &quot;While we are obviously elated that Language of Souls won this award, what has stunned us the most is that a poetry book out-scored every other genre.&quot;"},{"Title":"Language of Souls","review":"This iz good but this iz not az gud az FlubblebopYim yam widdley woooo!"},{"Title":"Language of Souls","review":"Reading this book opens your mind to a higher consisiousness, these are 3 truly gifted poets"},{"Title":"Annihilating Difference: The Anthropology of Genocide","review":"This book covers well known genocides in Rwanda, Germany, Cambodia and Guatemala. It also delves into 'lesser' 'genocides' in Bosnia and the \\"U.S Mexico border region\\". It is these dichotomies that make the book problematic. First, the introductions explain different categories of genocide. Then there is a rundown of genocides of 'indegenous' or 'first' peoples. These are well known or not, depending on ones backround. The native american genocides in the Americas are covered as is the genocide of the Herero people, and the Armenians. Also mentioned are assaults on native peoples in South East Asia and India, as well as the Sudan and Australia.However some major assaults on people go unnoticed. For instance the ethnic cleansing of Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan in 1948, the killing of more than 250,000 Chinese by Indonesia, and of course East Timor. Genocide is selective, not in its fact, but in how the west perceives it. Certain conflicts are not called 'genocide' becuase of Political correctness. For instance the mass slaughter of Assyrians in 1920s Iraq is not mentioned.This is where the book breaks down. Wonderful chapters deal with post genoicde and trauma and memory in such places as post war Germany. However the foolishness that one article labels the American-Mexico border a 'potential' genoice or a place where 'genocide' terms ar eused is pure nonsense. IF this is true of the border area, then it is true of every nation in the world, and that downplays the seriousness of actual genocides like the Holocaust. if the Holocaust is 'like' the Mexican-American border region, then 'genocide' means nothing.The Bosnian case is also suspect. Most now confirm that the 'genocide' that took place, involved perhaps 2000 civilians. ANd of course the war and the 'ethnic cleansing' terms were political aimed only at Serbs, ignoring Croat and Bosnian and Kosovar atrocities. Genocide is not war, and this is where one writer is very mistaken. failed Attempts, or thoughts of genocide, are not genocide. The Sudan is genocide, and due to lack of information not one article details it, which shows the bias of western scholarhsip and the problem with these type of texts.Seth J.

It's slim, only 160 pages, and I thoroughly enjoyed every paragraph. Bonner explains in the beginning that Biology, more than most sciences, is a large collection of facts. Students are often so overwhelmed by the memorization of these facts that they are unable to synthesize the important concepts. Bonner then takes us on a journey through the Cell, Evolution, Genetics, and Development, and finally a description of how life is built from the simple to the complex, which brings us to ecology and conservation.I highly recommend this for the biology student who wants to gel all the information you've learned into a coherent narrative. This discussion of what the science of life really *means* is very helpful, and beautifully written.

Dodge offers a careful analysis of a British policy constrained by limited resources, limited political will, little on-the-ground knowledge, and a considerable load of baggage based either on other imperial experiences or a heady mix of Orientalist preconceptions and romanticism. The result, according to Dodge, was a series of mis-steps which weakened the nascent Iraqi state and set the stage for Iraqi history thereafter.Although this work is primarily concerned with the period directly after World War I, Dodge offers some useful - if tentative comparisons between the British experience and that of the United States today.Overall, this is a useful book for serious students of Iraq or Middle Eastern history. It may be too specialized for casual readers."},{"Title":"Inventing Iraq: The Failure of Nation-Building and a History Denied","review":"This scholarly and fascinating book studies a previous occupation of Iraq, by the British Empire's rulers, and it shows how and why this occupation failed.British forces seized Iraq at the end of World War One and until 1932 successive British governments tried to rule it. To support this forcible occupation, Britain's ruling class used a network of self-serving deceptions. It believed, and wanted everybody else to believe, that the majority of Iraqis wanted British rule; that Iraqis would freely choose a pro-British government rather than a pro-Iraqi government; that it could divide Iraq into \`good' countryside and \`bad' city, \`good' Kurds and \`bad' Sunnis and Shia; that its desire to rule Iraq was selfless, nothing to do with the Empire's demands for Iraq's oil and for airbases; that the continuing violence and unrest were legacies from the Ottoman Empire, not responses to being occupied; and that withdrawal would lead to anarchy.The forms of the Empire's control shifted from annexation, to League of Nations mandate, to a treaty of alliance, to an advisory role, and finally to disengagement. But the British people were not fooled by the propaganda or by the shifting constitutional arrangements. Dodge writes of \`the long-running public hostility of British public opinion towards maintaining an interest in Iraq'. This anti-imperialism helped Labour to win the 1929 general election, but Labour in government failed to do what the nation wanted - withdraw immediately from Iraq.Now Blair seems to want to repeat the dismal, costly and futile cycle. He follows Bush in rejecting the Iraqi people's demand for rule by Iraqis who win democratic elections. He denies the power and validity of nationalism, a nation's legitimate, democratic desire for sovereignty and self-determination. The people of Iraq have already defeated the Pentagon's effort to rule Iraq directly, and General Garner has been sacked. The Iraqi people have vetoed the State Department's effort to rule by courtesy of the returning exiles, and they have overturned Bush's proposal of rule by US-selected caucuses.Since 1990, US and British governments have forcibly occupied one country after another. But, as Dodge sums up, \\"Post-Cold War military interventions into failed or rogue states with the overt aim of reforming their political systems ... have been uniformly unsuccessful.\\" These interventions all failed because intervening is wrong. The effort to run another country is not noble and selfless; it is immoral because it is undemocratic and anti-national, and it is bound to fail. Blair damns nationalism as old-fashioned and reactionary, but what could be more reactionary than waging an illegal war of aggression then trying to rerun the Empire?Only the people of a country can rebuild it. Outside interference always worsens the problem and delays a solution."},{"Title":"Inventing Iraq: The Failure of Nation-Building and a History Denied","review":"This short book presents the (failed)attempt at nation-building in Iraq under the British Mandate system of post WWI. In 170 pages of actual text, the author shows how Orientalist discourse colored the declining British Empire's perception of Iraq and the middle east, relying on templates that were formulated in the Indian colony and then applied wholesale and on the cheap (sounds familiar) to the Iraqi area. The book doesn't go very far in discussing the roles of the sunnis, shi'ites and kurds; it focuses more on the ideology of the colonizers and then briefly applies these sentiments towards the US current babylonian adventure.This isn't the final word on European colonialism in Iraq, but it's an excellent start. I recommend reading David Fromkin's \\"peace to end all peace\\" first of all to get the total overview of the great power conflict at the heart of the reconstruction of the middle east and its continuing repercussions today.Edward Said, now we need you more than ever ..."},{"Title":"Inventing Iraq: The Failure of Nation-Building and a History Denied","review":"Dodge's book is about the British Mandate over the newly created Iraqi state. But the lessons are obvious for the American invasion and subsequent nation-building effort in Iraq. The result reminds one of the statement by Marx, attributing to Hegel the statement that history repeats itself, first as tragedy then as farce. This book should be read in conjunction with several others, the totality of these sending a strong message that not even a superpower can fully anticipate and control events--especially when such a country never really did decent post-war planning (and that which was done by the State Department was ignored).Consider Dodge's book along with: Risen, State of War; Bacevich, The New American Militarism; Packer, The Assassin's Gate; Diamond, Squandered Victory; and, dare I suggest it, Albert Somit's and my, The Failure of Democratic Nation-Building: Ideology Meets Evolution.It will be interesting to see how the history books treat the American war and occupation of Iraq. I fear that those histories will be most unkind; one can only hope that the United States can learn something from this. And the Dodge book can help inform that discussion. Would that the author had done more reflection on the relevance of the British adventure in Iraq to the current American nation building effort in Iraq."},{"Title":"Inventing Iraq: The Failure of Nation-Building and a History Denied","review":"Many would be quick to lament the fact that no one from the Bush administration read Toby Dodge's book Inventing Iraq. While it is abundantly clear that many mistakes have been made, Dodge himself states on page 158 that \\"for U.S. forces currently involved in attempting to reform Iraq's political structures, the libaries are full of books that provide no guidance. This is an important point because it underscores the fact that the situation facing the U.S. today is markedly different than one facing the British. Iraq was just coming into existance as a political entity and there was no sense of a collective \\"Iraqi\\" identity or nationalism when the British were involved. Also, Iraq's political development from 1932 onward would alter the society in many important ways.You might be able to accuse Dodge of writing a book that told his readers more about his own beliefs than Iraq's early development because of his timing. This book was published in 2003 (right around the time of the U.S. invasion), and it has many noticeable comparisons between the British and American experiences. For example, he notes that the British thought they would receive a warm welcome by Iraqis just in the same way that the \\"flowers and candy\\" lines were tossed around by the Bush administration. These types of examples don't fill the book, but there are enough of them to make Dodge appear as if he's making a statement about the 2003 war.Rather than going into an unorganized account of the British mandate period, Dodge offers an array of chapters that focus on particular details such as land reform, and the rural/urban divide. This type of organization will be a source of frustration for some because by focusing on these types of details, Dodge sometimes loses track of the bigger picture. This type of criticism has some validity, but the overall result is a revealing look at the Mandate period.If Dodge is to be faulted for anything in Inventing Iraq, it would have to be his lack of a discussion of domestic British politics. He doesn't completely ignore this area, but no discussion of what's currently happening in Iraq would be complete without also discussing how events were being shaped in Washington. Dodge goes to great lengths to discuss what he calls \\"Oriental Despotism\\" in attempting to explain British actions and motives, but this is ultimately not as effective as analysis of domestic British pressures.These minor problems notwithstanding, Inventing Iraq is a concise and well-written book that has a lot to offer to anyone interested in modern Iraq's origins. At 171 pages, it's a quick read and while prior research on Iraq certainly helps with this book, it's not a requirement. If one were to make a top ten list of Iraq history/politics books, Inventing Iraq should certainly be on it."},{"Title":"Inventing Iraq: The Failure of Nation-Building and a History Denied","review":"\\"The borders we've given this new state (Iraq) are guaranteedto create: strife in this region, abundant opportunity for military intervention, career advancement and glory---for the next 100 years\\"---so quoth a youngWinston Churchill who was a minor functionary during the Sykes-Picotperiod (1915-16) who was actually citing a quote by a more senior official.Frankly, I did not know that the Turks were delighted by this treaty becausea rather wroth Kemal Attaturk had a portion of the new Turkish Constitutionspecifically tell future generation not to play the Allies' game and attemptto take back traditionally Turkish areas of Iraq with military force.Attatuk forsaw the strife to come in Iraq and positited that eventuallythe coming Civil and Religious wars in Iraq would cause Turkish areas tobeg to rejoin Turkey---no military intervention needed.The author is either a Pollyanna or a career political hack.

This remarkable book, successfully for the most part, attempts to provide that understanding.The Turkish Ottoman Empire essentially imploded at the end of WWI. For strategic reasons the UK was particularly interested in retaining control the former Ottoman provinces of Mesopotamia (most of modern Iraq). This aim was complicated by the heady if unrealistic idealism of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson that greatly influenced the way the world was ordered after the \\"war to end all wars.\\" Rather than simply establishing a colonial government over Mesopotamia, the UK was given a League of Nations \`mandate' to exercise what is now called \`nation building' and create a viable, democratic, and above all, a stable state called Iraq in place of the Ottoman province of Mesopotamia.This the UK was perfectly willing to do as long it could also ensure that its influence would predominate in the new state. The principal British architects for the new state of Iraq were soldiers and administrators under the India Office or the Colonial Office. Their efforts were hampered by serious misunderstandings of Iraqi society that caused them to divide Iraq between what they believed were a \`natural', rural tribal society and a more sophisticated, but corrupt urban population. This misunderstanding caused UK officials to attempt to resurrect a tribal structure that was an anachronism by the end of the 19th Century. Tribal ties were far less important than those of landowner, clan, and village. In the end the UK execution of the mandate produced a dubiously stable monarchy that was not necessarily sympathetic to British interests. In spite what generally were good intentions, the UK only partially succeeded in carrying out its Iraqi mandate. This was do to two reasons: scarcity of funds to maintain the size of garrison to really exert UK control over Iraq in its formative period; and the failure of the UK to really understand the nature of the Iraqi people or the very real nationalism that had been awakened in them after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. This book to its credit manages to treat both the British and Iraqis with fairness and appears to have accurately captured the complexities of nation building."},{"Title":"Inventing Iraq: The Failure of Nation-Building and a History Denied","review":"great background history to today's strategic events in Middle East"},{"Title":"History of the French in India,: From the founding of Pondichery in 1674 to the capture of that place in 1761","review":"If you are interested in this subject, you might want to check Animesh Rai's work.

This volume focuses on Wright's Prairie Houses. As Lind notes, the Prairie School of architecture was inspired by the &quot;spacious, horizontal feeling&quot; of the American prairie. This book pays particular attention to several of Wright's Prairie masterpieces built between 1900 and 1908.This book shares many of the admirable characteristics of other volumes in the series: a profusion of superb full-color photographs (both interior and exterior), Lind's interesting text, illuminating sidebar quotes from Wright and others, and a brief but useful bibliography. Houses pictured include the Bradley House of Kankakee, Illinois; the Darwin Martin House of Buffalo, New York; the Stockman House of Mason City, Iowa; and many more.The only flaw in the book is the lack of any legible floor plans. Although floor plans are not a focus of this series as a whole, author Lind does call attention to the distinctive features of the Prairie House floor plans several times in the text. Thus, one or two representative plans would have really enhanced this volume. Actually, one floor plan is included, but it is used merely as a decorative background element: the plan is printed in a pale blue ink and has text superimposed on top of it, so it is not very legible.

At several points in the book, the poet highlights the importance of joy and pleasure in our lives. After watching the antics of a house cat, Blumenthal concludes:What can we learn from him who lives here, neutered, wormed, domesticated, curled? -How to reanimate again our lifeless world.(\\"Le Chat\\")In another poem, he observes, \\"Pleasure is something we need / To center us - holy - wherever we find it.\\" (\\"Saxophone\\").In other poems, he presents a dark vision of fate:Who among us wouldn't gladly be the chooser, if only the choice weren't a vast road looping over and over to arrive at the same place? (\\"The Forces\\")Mr. Blumenthal is a graduate of an Ivy League law school. But these poems sound not in law, but in the nineteenth century philosophy of Kant and Schopenhauer. \\"The Wasp in the Study,\\" for instance, presents an allegory of subject and object, the mind and the outside world. Like a wasp trapped indoors,the mind remains a captive of the room it's in, a tomb of many-colored windows with no door to test the scintillating glass it sets its visions of escape against.Sometimes, Blumenthal seems nave, such as in a poem about the Palestinian intifada in which he seems to say \\"there is so much beauty in the land of Israel; why can't we all be friends?\\" (\\"Anti-fada\\"). On the other hand, one of the most moving poems describes the succession of generations through the image of a father and son skiing:I am still better at this than he is, though I won't be for long, and so he follows me down the white hills of the Sangre de Cristos, he who wants to be better than his father is, as I've tried to be better than mine, though the trails and rivulets of paternity are deep, marked in greens and blues and, finally, blacks to signify the most difficult . . .These poems are very personal but at the same time they describe universal problems and ideas.

My own daughter is 8 years old, and I intend to share this book with her now. While some reviewers complain about the lack of content, as an 11 year old child I felt it provided ample information. My mother always kept an \\"open door policy\\" when it came to discussing sex, so additional questions I had were answered by her. That is how it should be. The book should be used as a tool to introduce sex, not a concise encyclopedia of sex and morality. I'm buying several copies, by the way, to share with my friends who also have children expressing curiosity about sex. And I hope the book is as helpful to my daughter as it was to me all those years ago."},{"Title":"Almost 12: The Story of Sex","review":"I found this book to be a great parental tool. It is age appropriate sex education from a Christian perspective. It was an excellent resource."},{"Title":"Almost 12: The Story of Sex","review":"The book is tastefully done so that an adult, preferably a parent, can read it to a child in order to impart the biblical truths about the purpose of sex, before the 'world' infiltrates their minds with lies, trash and confusion. A responsible parent will always cherish the time spent reading this book for 15 minutes to their child, and the child will remember the lesson for a life-time. Believe me, I know. I've read it to the younger of our six children and to some of their friends as well. I can see first hand that the respect and teachings have influenced their lives 15 years later!"},{"Title":"Almost 12: The Story of Sex","review":"This book is a responsible approach to teaching your pre-teen about reproduction. We are not just a biological accident, or decendants of apes. We are wonderfully knit in our mothers wombs (psalm 139:13). Presented in a very short, simple and to the point format. Meant to be read with your child."},{"Title":"Almost 12: The Story of Sex","review":"I used this book about 15 years ago when my son turned 12. Recently I was asked by a single mom to talk to her 12-year old son about sex. I was glad the book was still in print. I used the book to go over things with him and it went well. The book is centered on the Bible and starts with explaining how babies grow and develop in the mother's womb. The discussion then goes on to a review of male and female sex organs and how intercourse leads to reproduction. There is a good section on covering topics such as 'safe sex', homosexuality and STD's. The book is very tastefully done using drawings instead of actual photos. The emphasis is on God's intention for sex to be reserved for a husband and wife. A great resource for boys or girls."},{"Title":"Almost 12: The Story of Sex","review":"I read this book just before turing twelve over a decade ago.

We could have bought it 6 months earlier and he would have been ready for it. But it took me a while to find the right book that didn't have way too much information.

As a Christian, I was very offended for the author to claim to be THE intrepeter of God's word.The information presented is very minimalistic, concerning itself only with the basic conception and birth process. The author's only attempts to address children's questions about sexual feelings, masturbation, homosexuality, etc. is a simplistic &quot;I (the author, speaking for God) say it is a sin.&quot;The author, quite forcefully, attempts to replace parental responsibility of instilling morality in children, with preaching his own views, evangilizing that to not follow his views is sinful and punishable by eternal damnation. He even goes so far as to mock the Supreme Court of the United States!Highly recommended to avoid!"},{"Title":"Almost 12: The Story of Sex","review":"I felt that some of the illustrations in this book were too advanced for my 11-year-old. \\"Almost 12\\" would lead me to believe that it is geared towards ten and eleven year olds.

I believe it is detrimental to children developing today to have so many &quot;forbiddens&quot; and to teach them that sexual orientations different from the norm are wrong. This book tries to take the parent's place and teach morals directly to the child. If you buy the book, make sure to read it before giving it to your child to read, you may find out your child is learning exactly the opposite of what you want him or her to know."},{"Title":"Creating Web Sites Bible","review":"(...)

I've been doing application development for a long time, and some of that time has been spent doing web development. While I wouldn't grab this book to find an answer to an HTML or JavaScript question, I would use it to understand graphical composition, navigation, and more of the site structure thoughts. There's always new stuff to learn, and it helps to get new ideas from others in that area. And if you've seen my (lack of) graphical ability, you'd understand. Die-hard web designers will also squawk about the reliance on tables and frames for design. I'd tend to agree with them, but I'm also not as dogmatic about the whole issue.If you're a casual computer use who thinks they have a great idea for a web site, and if you think you could build that site on your own, you'd probably gravitate to a book like this. To be sure, everything you absolutely need to know is in here. But I think you could quickly find yourself overwhelmed with everything you need to learn to set the site up. And when you start talking about setting up an online store and shopping carts, you could end up making mistakes that could cost you dearly in security and fraud.So is it a good book? In my opinion, yes. It's well-written and there is a lot of valuable information in it.

There is an abundance of information contained within the 700 plus pages.The book has you working with HTML, CSS, Java Scripting, DHTML and XHTML. You get to try out and design frames pages, tables, forms, multimedia pages and cascading style sheets. Overall everything you need to become a very good designer is in this book including an excellent layout of the HTML 4.01 tags.The cd included has a number of utilities, most of which can be found just about anywhere on the web. Also included is trial version of Flash 5, DreamWeaver 4 and HomeSite 4.5 all of which have newer version out, so the next edition should have this included.Aside from those minor things, the files you are supposed to be able to use for some of the exercises weren't on my cd and I was unable to find them anywhere on the website so I think this needs to be fixed.

At a minimum, this play is a stark lesson on not being an a--hole."},{"Title":"American Constitutional Law; Introductory Essays & Selected Cases","review":"For any student of American constitutional law, this book is the best exposition of the fundamentals of the U.S. Constitution and the Supreme Court. Further enquiry into the subject is not possible without an understanding of the ideas presented in this book."},{"Title":"American Constitutional Law; Introductory Essays & Selected Cases","review":"I first used this text in the seventh edition (Mason, Beaney and Stephenson) in my undergraduate Constitutional Law class, and it has remained a constant resource for me. I have invested in two of the upgraded editions, including this latest 14th edition.Mason et al. has a wonderful style of combining accessible and interesting narrative essays with case law summaries and texts from rulings. The authors state in the preface that they see constitutional law development as 'an intricate blend of history and politics.' The Supreme Court functions in the real world (indeed, has a long-standing tradition of not deciding 'moot' cases, but rather only adjudicating in real life situations).The chapters rely heavily on case law and texts from decisions, but each chapter is introduced by an essay that sets tone, context, and highlights of particular interest. Where appropriate, the authors draw in texts from beyond case law - for example, in the chapter dealing with Congress, the Court and the Presidency, the authors bring in excerpts from the Federalist papers, and with the chapter on the development of due process, they excerpt Justice Cardozo's papers.This is a broadly sweeping text that covers the whole Constitution, each article of the primary text, various amendments dealing with governmental and procedural issues, and many chapters dealing with rights and liberties contained in both the Bill of Rights (first ten amendments) and other amendments. It includes indexes of cases, a good chart of Justices of the Supreme Court, and the full text of the Constitution and amendments.This is a book more intended for the student of political science or history who wishes to gain a better understanding of the processes and content of Constitutional Law at both the advanced undergraduate and graduate level. It may be useful as a secondary text in a law school's Constitutional Law class, also. It is not light reading, particularly in the case law sections, but the essays are worthwhile and can generally be read as stand-alone texts for those who want to get the broad overview without the case detail - however, beware of this approach, for the law and process is built on the details."},{"Title":"American Constitutional Law; Introductory Essays & Selected Cases","review":"American Constitutional Law: Introductory Essays and Selected Cases by Alpheus Thomas Mason and Donald Grier Stephenson is a book that when read you'll find an intricate blend of history and politics.This is an excellent book for those studing constitutional law as there are plenty of case study with selected readings, queries, and key terms associated with each particular case. You'll get a real good dose of the constitution here and why decisions are the way they are at that time. Applying standards drawn from the constitution, the Supreme Court is the ultimate arbitor and guardian of individual privilege and governmental prerogative alike.This book gives the reader a broad understanding of the present with respect to the past and includes relevant extrajudicial material. A very good introductory book on American Constitutional Law."},{"Title":"American Constitutional Law; Introductory Essays & Selected Cases","review":"it was a required for a class i took. i still keep it to re-read certain cases. good brief summation of opinions and decisions."},{"Title":"American Constitutional Law; Introductory Essays & Selected Cases","review":"So often, I've read statements on social media like, \\"I'm exercising my right to freedom of speech.\\" Or, \\"How can the government go against my religion.\\"Yet, when questioned, these citizens tend to really be saying that they are expressing assumptions are not willing to look at the truth.Do you know what are United States Constitution allows you to do, or protects you from?For me, the idea of reading about our federal constitution is exciting, because I know that in looking at the history, particularly the cases that went before the courts as our world has evolved allows me to be more comfortable with my opportunities.So, when I embarked upon reading \\"American Constitutional Law,\\" I did so knowing that it would be quite a journey through legislations, arguments, opinions, civil rights challenges, and quite frankly, anything that impacts our lives.Written in an essay style, followed by case law summaries that explain what happened, this book is not light reading.But who would want an history essay on our U.S. Constitution to be light reading?The first half of this book focuses upon our political history, and the powers that our Executive Branch, Congress and the Supreme Court has.And though, prior to reading this book, I thought I had a pretty good handle on those branches, I was especially intrigued by how laws are not only made, but also how they are evaluated as being good law.There are many phrases in this first half of this book that at first, I said, \\"Yeah. Yeah. I get it.\\"But, as I became more comfortable with these essays, I found myself not only comparing judicial decisions made, I also found that the \\"commonly-known phrases\\" such as \\"due process,\\" \\"interstate commerce\\", and others had so much more to them.The second half of this book focuses more upon individual rights under the most of the Bill of Rights.And in this section, I was especially by how cases must be presented on religious liberties, in order to get what you want.Like most other cases, it is not about the facts. It's about how you apply the facts to the laws, and how you present those facts that leads to the outcome.Reading this book has inspired me to look more closely at what is going on in the world and what the basis are for the decisions that are being made.And in doing this, I believe that this empowers every reader to improve their lives."},{"Title":"American Constitutional Law; Introductory Essays & Selected Cases","review":"I use this book for my US Civil Liberties class and I think this is a great book.

Return policy was difficult to locate."},{"Title":"The Moons of Jupiter","review":"I won't tell you what to look for or how to feel when you read Alice Munro. If you've never encountered her before, The Moons of Jupiter is the best place to start, early Munro at the height of her evocative powers. Don't turn to the Selected Stories first. Each of Munro's books is a suite of stories, interlocking in themes and often in characters, on the model of a sonata, a suite of musical movements. The experience of reading the whole suite is more powerful than the sum of the separate stories. Perhaps the story-suite is the successor to the floundering form of the modern novel.By the way, Munro is admittedly a woman writng about women for women to read, but I'm an outdoors guy, a baseball fan, a weight-lifter, and at least until my son was born something of a rascal, despite all of which I rank Alice Munro very high among my favorite fiction writers."},{"Title":"The Moons of Jupiter","review":"In The Moons of Jupiter, Munro clearly reveals the universal perplexities of our everyday lives. The characters have a rich realness to them and must be commended for their candid honesty. The strength of this book lies in Munro's ability to create a genuine perspective in which the reader has no choice than to become emotionally connected to the characters. I enjoyed these stories because there are many &quot;grey areas&quot; in which the reader must rely on his own experiences to draw conclusions. There are no definative endings to these stories. They are written in such a way that there is often a fine line between hope and despondence; only the reader's morals and values can recognize one from the other."},{"Title":"The Moons of Jupiter","review":"This review, or actually a question is on one of the stories included in this collection, Accident. Here's a spoiler so you may want to stop reading. The story starts out in the mind of a young schoolmistress, Frances. She is placed at a definite time and place, viz. her singing class is in progress, but she has stepped out to haunt the hallway just outside another classroom where Ted, the science teacher, is doing his class. You get all the impressions through Frances' eyes at something like \\"real time\\" so you think this is one of those stories that starts \\"today\\" and ends \\"today\\" and told from the central character's point of view. But no. The pace picks up, and the narrator, whom you thought was Frances, imperceptibly morphs into the \\"townspeople\\" or maybe some unidentified 3rd person, say, Alice Munro? Anyway, you find out that Frances is having an affair with aforementioned Ted, who is Finnish and married to a Finnish woman, Greta. You get a \\"jumpy\\" survey of the relationship up to now, or the day of the accident, i.e. the narration is no longer \\"in time\\" but by someone looking back thematically, categorizing the lovers' trysts by place, time, mood etc. Then, one day, I believe it is the same day Frances was hanging out in the hallway, an accident happens in which Ted's son Bobby is killed. The accident brings the Frances-Ted affair to the surface because Kartrud, a sister of Greta the cuckolded wife (if a woman can be cuckolded), getting wind of it, and having an ax to grind after Ted got in the way of the religious funeral the Finnish family wanted, goes to the school principal to complain. Ted, instead of giving some apology and a promise to end the affair, which was all that anyone wanted, goes super-righteous, declares his intention to marry Frances, and so it happens. The story's central idea being that Frances' whole life, including the two daughters she has with Ted, was an accident; for Ted would never have proposed except for the series of events following his son's accidental death.In terms of character, you get Ted, an uncompromising, idealistic fool and impostor that would sacrifice his whole life and family to a moment's irritation; Frances, a dreamy fool that would go along with that; the Finnish family, to whom the religious funeral they couldn't get matters more than anything else; Frances' mother, a dull woman only interested in food; Frances' sister-in-law, nosy, crude and exhibitionist; townspeople such as the school principal and the church minister, who just don't want a scandal. Standard contemporary adult \\"serious\\" fiction. No one outright villainous, but just mildly disgusting?So here's the question: What is one supposed to do with a story like this? It's a mechanical sort of question. In a detective story, you are supposed to scratch your head and try to guess. (Forgive if this is wrong. Just an example.) Some stories try to make you laugh, or get riled up, or fall into a trance, or whatever. But a story in which mildly disgusting and barely conscious people do very little? I just don't know what I am supposed to do with it. And to think this is mostly what you get when you look for quality fiction, as if all written by one person.Please, I am not trying to disparage the piece. I think it is good for the kind of story it is (see my four star together with the other stories so far). But reading it leaves me just mildly disgusted with the characters presented, because I think that's what they are. And I don't see why anyone would want this experience. Maybe, is it \\"realistic\\" unlike stories in which you may get even more disgusting people, but there is a point to it all? If it is realistic, doesn't it mean you get a lot of this stuff in you own life anyway? Why would you want more?"},{"Title":"The Moons of Jupiter","review":"I am not an expert, when it comes to literature, but my opinion about the book is as follows. The book offers some great stories with describtions so detailed that one can believe the stories are all true. SOme of them are very moving, some of them very shallow, but they are all great stories. The reason I gave the book 3 stars out of 5 is, that the stories are not connected. The only thing they have in common is that they happen in the same cities. After reading the book, the pieces of the book are still left shattered. I recommend reading the book chapter by chapter."},{"Title":"Berlin 1945: The Final Reckoning","review":"This is an excellently written history of the final days of Berlin in 1945. Some History books can be a little dry but this one makes you feel like you are there."},{"Title":"Berlin 1945: The Final Reckoning","review":"As a WWII history buff, I really enjoyed this book. This had the most detail on the last days of the Third Reich and how the end finally came about of any book I've read. The great selection of photos also helped keep the story in perspective.Also provided great detail on the key events leading up to the fall. Including, why the Americans didn't meet up with the Russians and the politics surrounding the relationships between the Allied powers.Great book for any history buff!"},{"Title":"Berlin 1945: The Final Reckoning","review":"This book is a fine pictorial history of the last gasps of the Hitler regime as it faced the relentless onslaught of the massive Red Army at the close of World War II.The book does a good job of explaining the importance of Berlin. It was not just the home of Nazism and its leaders. It was the second largest city in the world. (In 1939 its population was about 4 million. By the end of the war it was about 2.6 million.) As such, it was home to a significant portion of the German population and its defeat both symbolically and realistically rendered further resistance futile.A shortcoming of the book is that its account is skewed toward the Soviet viewpoint both in terms of this battle and of the war overall. For example, the author repeatedly emphasizes minor, even trivial, Soviet accomplishments with exclamation points in an attempt to make them appear important. The author also appears to rely heavily on (notoriously unreliable) Soviet statistics regarding the battle, although he avoids being pinned down on this as he does not include any bibliography.Nevertheless, the book is a good blow-by-blow account, and analysis, of the events leading up to the Fall of Berlin and the Fall of Berlin itself.The pictures of places, events, and people surrounding the battle are well-chosen and reproduced. There are a few well-drawn maps."},{"Title":"Berlin 1945: The Final Reckoning","review":"This is a very readable book on the fall of Berlin.

Lots of very interesting pictures of the battles and the aftermath. Good book easy to read."},{"Title":"Berlin 1945: The Final Reckoning","review":"This is a creditable but brief summary of the battle for Berlin. The overwhelming coverage concerns the Red Army closing in on the capital from the Oder River while there are a few words of the Americans moving on the Elbe River. The level of detail is sufficient to give a basic understanding of the difficult engagement and the ordeal the Berliners endured in trying to stay alive. I would suggest it would be ideal for a student or a person who doesn't have time to invest in a full length account of the battle. The photos which make up the largest portion of the book are really good which adds to the narrative but these popular photos can be seen in many other books. They include some of the leading personalities of both sides, weapons and the destruction the Soviets wrought on the city. It also shows that by 1945 Hitler's new legions were formed by teenagers. A few photos are gruesome and not for the feint of heart. Besides the summary of the battle, coverage also includes the trial and the beginnings of the occupation of the city.There are six maps of varying sizes which help but more and bigger maps would have been more helpful. Also included is an Order of Battle for both sides. There is no Notes or Bibliography but there is an Index.Though this book is good, its not meant to compete with the full length books by Beevor, Read, Erickson, or Le Tissier but if you're new to the war this book would make a good foundation before tackling a larger work."},{"Title":"Social Power and Influence of Women","review":"This book is a classic and a real shame that it has gone out of print.

This book is actually a companion to his other book, &quot;Jesus Through the Centuries&quot;, and attempts to understand why Mary has played such a prominent role in church theology, devotion, and tradition.This question becomes even more perplexing when one realizes that Mary's role in the gospels is very limited, and she is only mentioned once by name outside of the gospels. Yet, this did not prove a hindrance to the early church fathers who went about scouring the pages of the Old Testament to find references to the mother of our Lord. The one technique that proved most useful to the fathers was reading the Old Testament allegorically instead of literally. By employing this method the fathers were able to find typologial similarities between Eve and Mary. Therefore, by the end of the 2nd century Irenaeus was able to develop the comparison between Eve and Mary, so that just as the apostle Paul saw Christ as a second Adam, Irenaeus viewed Mary as a second Eve. Pelikan argues that since Paul began the process of applying such an allegory from the Old Testament to Jesus that it was not a stretch for the fathers to make the connection between Mary and Eve.The next step in the developing Mariological process was the application of the title, Theotokos, or the Mother of God. The need for such a title stemmed from the many Christological heresies that were appearing during this time. By calling Mary Theotokos the fathers were able to guarantee that Jesus' humanity was safeguarded, and also that his divinity was upheld. Nevertheless, Mary's new title as Theotokos only strengthened the growing devotion toward her. Pelikan shows that Athanasius, the great orthodox theologian, makes reference to a Marian celebration in his writings. In addition, in his writings against the Arians Athanasius argues against the position that Jesus was God's most perfect and best creation, but instead reserves that honor for Mary.When Pelikan arrives at the period of medeval history, he shows how Marian devotion blossomed into a full blown phenomena. During this time Mary was showered with such titles as Mediatrix, Queen of Heaven, Mother of the faithful and many other such titles. In Bernard of Clairvaux, Mary had a great advocate who spoke very highly of the Mother of God. Yet when it came to one of the most pivotal doctrines of Catholic theology, that of the immaculate conception, Bernard and Aquinas denied that the doctrine was a reality. They believed that such a doctrine made Mary immune from needing a savior and made her wonderful qualities seem less special. It wasn't until Duns Scotus argued that the immaculate conception saved Mary more perfectly by preventing her fall rather than rescuing her from a fall, that the doctrine became common in the West.Finally, Pelikan dives into the period of the Reformation and illustrates that although the Reformers eschewed much of Marian doctrine that developed in the middle ages, they did not in fact abandon everything. The Reformers maintained that Mary was indeed the Theotokos, defended her perpetual virginity, and some even held to her immaculate status. What the Reformers disagreed with were the practices of praying to Mary and the saints, and the view of Mary as a Mediatrix. The Reformers believed that the role of Mediator belonged to Jesus alone, and that all prayer addressed to Mary and the Saints was superfluous and useless.In the last chapters of the book Pelikan examines the Marian dogmas that have been promulgated by the Catholic Church: the immaculate conception and the Assumption. Pelikan traces the developments of these doctrines all the way from the fathers of the early church to the present day theologians and church officials who have expressed these views. Lastly, Pelikan shows how the person of Mary is an important person to all Christians and that she is an example of faith that everyone should strive to emulate."},{"Title":"Mary Through the Centuries: Her Place in the History of Culture","review":"This is one of the best works about Mary in recent years. Jaroslav Pelikan, an excellent scholar, gives an outstanding presentation about the place of the Virgin Mary in the history of culture. As he did with Jesus Through the Centuries, he uses his vast knowledge of history, theology and art to illustrate, in a fascinating and engaging way, the development of Marian theology and devotion. Pelikan goes in a chronological way, from the biblical tradition and the dogmatic and devotional definitions of the first centuries of the Church to the latest dogmatic definitions in Roman Catholic theology. The author also explores the view of Mary in the Islam, Eastern Orthodoxy and Protestantism. The book is both scholarly and readable, making it accessible to the scholar and the general reader."},{"Title":"Mary Through the Centuries: Her Place in the History of Culture","review":"Professor Pelikan adapts the successful format which he developed for Jesus through the Centuries: . . . over a decade ago to explore various presentations of Mary and her role as expressed not only in popular piety and theological development but also in other cultural expressions particularly literature, painting, and, to some extent, music. He has designed 16 chapters, each with a distinctive title, painting, and theme all organized somewhat chronologically. In his introduction, Pelikan explains the timeliness of this study, citing diverse contemporary issues such as feminist scholarship, Marian apparitions and ecumenism. He devotes chapter 12 to Goethe's treatment of &quot;the Eternal Feminine&quot; in his Faust; and chapter 13 to the popularity of Marian apparitions since 1830. Pelikan's interest in ecumenism not only informs his treatment of Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant views but motivates this whole collection. Moreover, he broadens ecumenism to look at Christian relations with Judaism particularly in the first two chapters and then in chapter 5 to include an extended treatment of the treatment of Mary in the Qur'an.Throughout Pelikan describes various presentations of Mary lucidly, perceptively, and, occasionally, provocatively. Although several of the chapters were written for other contexts, most chapters do reflect a common method. Both the professional scholar and the informed university student will recognize Pelikan's reliance on documented primary texts. He usually refers the reader to one pertinent scholarly treatment of the issue at stake. After two chapters dealing with the relative lack of detailed information in the New Testament, Pelikan goes on to describe the appropriation of themes and allusions in the Hebrew Scriptures by a process of &quot;creative amplification.&quot; To describe his own position on the development of doctrine, he appeals twice to the effective metaphor about a legend emerging like a pearl from a small irritant. One sign of this process is the exploitation of actual misreadings of the original language and in the manuscript traditions of the Latin Vulgate. He cites the issue of &quot;parthenos&quot; in Isaiah 7.14, the implications of the conjunction in Song of Songs 1.5 &quot;I am black and beautiful&quot; and the confusion at Genesis 3.15 over the gender of the pronoun. Unfortunately Pelikan does not apply his descriptive and textual skills to the apocryphal Protoevangelion of James which became a rich source of the legends and themes about Mary.Pelikan demonstrates his knowledge of primary evidence in subsequent chapters. In chapters 10 and 12 he deals with Dante's Divine Comedy and Goethe's Faust. In chapter 5 he describes the Islamic treatment of Mary in the Qur'an with its respect for her simple obedience, perpetual virginity, and motherhood of Jesus as human.Pelikan does relate specific themes of theological development to his approach. In Chapter 4 he deals briefly with the Theotokos mentioning the dispute at the Council of Ephesus in 431 but concentrating more on the antecedents of Cyril rather than on the crisis itself. This is surprising in view of the important difference with the Qur'an and the care he takes in chapter 11 to demonstrate the respect in Luther and in other reformers for Mary as Mother of God. Moreover the lack of a stronger focus on the Theotokos contributes to the omission of the significant Renaissance composition of the Madonna and Child. Instead most colored plates deal with the Annunciation and they should be incorporated within the discussion more effectively.He does deal with a number of doctrinal issues such as his presentation of her status as second Eve, with a particularly appropriate illustration, in chapter 3. He treats Jerome's contribution to perpetual virginity and Ambrose's effort to accommodate a respect for the state of marriage in chapter 8, unfortunately without acknowledging some of the current scholarship in this sensitive area. In chapter 14, entitled &quot;the Great Exception&quot; he sketches the long history of the immaculate conception beginning with Carolingian monasticism, noting the reluctance of Bernard of Clairvaux and Thomas Aquinas, and culminating with the Papal declaration of 1854. He sums up the theological issue lucidly but some of the texts in this chapter remain unidentified.This book demonstrates scholarship in the service of understanding diverse religious and cultural traditions. It will stimulate and at times provoke his peers; it will inform and always challenge the intelligent student.Paul C. Burns"},{"Title":"Mary Through the Centuries: Her Place in the History of Culture","review":"Scholar Jaroslav Pelikan of Yale University once again writes a powerful historical and theological book, this time devoted to Mary, the Theotokos. He reveals the controversies between the Latin West (Roman Catholicism), the Eastern Church (Eastern Orthodoxy) and the Protestant movements and their many divergent views. He takes great care to present the facts, but also reveals the rumors and mystery of history, as well as history's strengths and weaknesses.Regardless of one's theological perspective on Mary and her place in the Christian life, this is must reading for anyone interested in doctrinal development throughout Christian history. His chapter on the \\"second Eve\\" is clear, concise, yet thorough and accessible to both those who are lay people and academics. This chapter naturally follows into the doctrine of the Theotokos and its importance in Marian doctrine; but more importantly, though not always stated, its importance in the doctrine of Christ. Pelikan shows its development, again, concisely and clearly.Also, very interestingly, Pelikan takes the reader to a not very well known area by many Western Christians and that is the early place Mary held in Islamic cultures and how the Quran pictures her in extremely warming language that it rivals most material elsewhere found in that text.He does not shy away from the controversial aspects of Mariology as well, to include the bodily assumption, the apparitions, and the Immaculate Conception. He shows how the doctrines developed and the problems each one caused between Protestants and Orthodox Christians. Agreements and differences are discussed without making this book into an apologetic for one view or the other (not that apologetic material is wrong, but would have greatly side tracked this text).This is just another outstanding work of which I have had the pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Mary Through the Centuries: Her Place in the History of Culture","review":"From her earliest times, the church has gleaned \\"types\\" from the Old Testament that foreshadow the New. St. Paul, in his epistles, identifies Jesus as a type of Adam; the first Adam was disobedient and led to man's fall while the second Adam (Jesus) was obedient and led to man's salvation. With the filter of types, the church began to discover the gospel hidden in the Old Testament waiting for the advent of the Messiah. It was not long at all before the teachers of the church identified types foreshadowing Mary as well.Mary then became the second Eve; the first Eve was the mother of all the living, and the second Eve (Mary) became the mother of all who are in Christ. This typological approach expanded with time to identify Mary also with the sister of Moses, Miriam, and the wife of Abraham, Sarah, and others.The affect of understanding Mary in this way had profound affect on western culture. Dr. Pelikan provides more than the scriptural roots of Marian doctrines, he goes on to demonstrate how those doctrines shaped western culture and thought. Dr. Pelikan even delves into the Quran to demonstrate how Marian devotion was so prominent as to make an impact on Mohammed and Islam. What the Quran implies is a rich Christian tradition that includes Marian devotion very early in the life of the church. And that tradition spread rapidly even into the crucible of a new religion in the desert.Throughout this insightful and enlightening book, Dr. Pelikan introduces then expounds on each topic with clarity and depth of study without being tedious. The reader is not lost in the dusty or intimidating language of scholars but enriched with the cultural significance of Mary in the west. Included are several plates of paintings and sculpture to illustrate the beauty and richness of these traditions.Roman Catholics with devotion to Mary will find much to feed their love for the church and for Mary in this work. Non-Catholics, seeking to understand why such devotion exists, will find what they seek. All will appreciate the impact Mary has had on western culture."},{"Title":"Mary Through the Centuries: Her Place in the History of Culture","review":"As a Protestant convert to Orthodox Christianity I had the usual misgivings regarding the elevated role of Mary in the Orthodox and Catholic Churches. This book gives a thorough and scholarly approach to how marionology developed over the centuries in both the eastern and western traditions of the church. It was very helpful in enabling me to better appreciate why there is such a veneration of Mary even though there is not much biblical revelation about her. The most surprising thing to me was the Muslim connection to Mary. This book will certainly fill in your knowledge and appreciation for Mary and how she developed into such an icon of the church."},{"Title":"Mary Through the Centuries: Her Place in the History of Culture","review":"Pelikan is certainly a scholar, here exhibiting the sweep of some theology, music, poetry and art concerning the Mother of Christ.He peels back the layers of cultural time, revealing that the view of Mary has changed over generations and differently in the East and West quadrants of Christianity. Also interesting was the exploration into the Quran's view. He touches at points on the Protestant and Reformed view.What this reviewer found lacking was any real view of correct exegesis of the texts, which are continually smothered with cultural interpretations and philosophical musings about the topic. He at times seems fair of anaylsis, but tends to lean towards traditional buildup and expansion of tangental elements with suspect origins.All this said, this is valuable exploration and bibliographic resource for exploration into a topic which sometimes gets left out, but musn't. Fine art plates included and commented on as well."},{"Title":"Mary Through the Centuries: Her Place in the History of Culture","review":"Book Review:Mary Through the Centuries: Her Place in the History of CultureJaroslav PelikanDuring his final year of teaching history at Yale University, Jaroslav Pelikan composed Mary Through the Centuries: Her Place in the History of Culture, a comprehensive survey of the cultural and doctrinal influences of Mary, the mother of Jesus, upon the West. In a succinct and eloquent account, Pelikan invites the reader to consider the impact of this religious figure upon the landscape of the Western religious and cultural ideologies. From the development of orthodox Christianity during the third and fourth centuries until the postmodern search for identity during the twentieth century, myths, doctrines, and devotions about Mary have captured the interest and imagination of scholars, religious leaders, and the populous alike. He writes: \\"the doctrine of Mary proved to be one of the most important places to observe and test the processes by which great ideas have developed\\" (p. 200). For the Christianize West, Pelikan traces the relationship of the doctrine of the Incarnation to the unfolding of the legacy of Mary as the Virgin Mother of God, the Immaculate Conception, and the Eternal Feminine whose very body was assumed into heaven. As his documentation proves, Christianity's interpretation of Mary has influenced almost every aspect of Western religious history.Pelikan's research reveals the breadth of his knowledge not only about the religious and cultural history of Mary, but also his expansive awareness of the multifaceted influences that impacted the construction of the Western religious milieu. He leaves few stones unturned, few doors unopened, and few texts uncited. Being a survey encompassing over two thousand years of history, he rarely delves deeply into exegetical research; yet, with his mastery of the English language, he is able to pack each sentence with an overwhelming amount of information. This would be an excellent introduction for the undergraduate or master's level college student, while serving as a guidepost for doctoral students in their search for pivotal documents relating to the development of the doctrine of the Incarnation."},{"Title":"Mary Through the Centuries: Her Place in the History of Culture","review":"Dr. Pelikan presents an excellent, if somewhat abbreviated, overview of the role of the Virgin Mary in the history and doctrine of Christianity and Western culture. As a subject for scholarly examination, the Virgin Mary's colossal influence on Christianity is a prime subject, considering how minimal was her on-stage role in the Christian Scriptures.What was interesting about the development of her significance in Christian devotion and doctrine was how organic and natural it was, on the part of both theologians and the common believer, as if through the impetus of some divine tropism. As early as the year 150, in the Protoevangelium of James, we have evidence of the veneration of Mary as well as evidence of belief in her perpetual virginity. Other New Testament figures, like the Apostles or Mary Magdalene, were also subjects of early non-canonical literature and legends but the status and importance of the Virgin Mary in devotion and theology began to overshadow them all. Some time in the late 100s, Church Father Iraneaus of Lyons wrote of Mary as the \\"Second Eve\\" who, through her obedience, undid Eve's sin of disobedience, just as Jesus was considered a \\"Second Adam\\" who destroyed the death that Adam's sin imposed on us. What was intriguing was that he wrote as if he were drawing on a widely accepted and traditional belief that required no need for defense or exposition. It was that kind of typological Old Testament interpretation and need for logical consistency (if the bodies of Enoch and Elijah were transported to Heaven, then the Mother of God surely would have been even more deserving) that informed the development of Marian doctrine in the subsequent centuries. Although I wish Pelikan would have devoted more space to that topic, he provides a very good overview. It should be noted however that the ordinary believer never needed some clerical imprimatur to love Mary. And that would have been an interesting topic for this book. Why do we love her so much?Dr. Pelikan also deals with the reverance of Moslems towards Mary, Marian appararitions, and her prominence in the art and literature of Christianity, even Protestantism. This is an excellent book if you're interested in the subject."},{"Title":"Mary Through the Centuries: Her Place in the History of Culture","review":"This is an excellent book on Mary, the Mother of Jesus and the companion book on Jesus is excellent,too. Helps if you have a good foundation or at least are familiar with the Bible."},{"Title":"Mary Through the Centuries: Her Place in the History of Culture","review":"From the beginning of its existence in the womb of Temple and Synagogue in ancient Palestine, the Church has sanctified life and the transit of the year with the temporal and sanctoral cycles, surrounding us with traditions and pious customs to hallow times and seasons of life. These customs extend to certain days of the week, as well as dedicating months of the years to personages, themes, and events of Faith: for instance, June is the month of the Holy Eucharist, July the month of the Precious Blood, September the month of the Holy Angels, and May is the month of our Lady, St. Mary the Virgin, celebrated in song, prayer, and even coronation ceremonies, and above all in art and literature. Mary has exerted an influence over Christian piety and devotion, thought and imagination far above all other women, second only to Christ Himself in importance.The tracing of the various images and influences of Mary over the past two thousand years is the theme of Professor Jaroslav Pelikan (Sterling Professor Emeritus of Church History, Yale University) in his 1996 book \\"Mary Through the Centuries: Her Place in the History of Culture\\". Pelikan has written widely and extensively on the history of doctrines, the Bible, and other aspects of church history, and a book on the influence of Mary is not out of place among the works of such a scholar. Written as a companion volume and sequel to his 1985 \\"Jesus Through the Centuries: His Place in the History of Culture\\" (and in fact a later printing combines the two volumes under a single cover) \\"Mary through the Centuries\\" shows all the hallmarks of a long and distinguished career studying and teaching church history.Through sixteen chapter (varying between 12 and 16 pages in length), a preface and introduction, and bibliographic notes, Pelikan walks us through the intervening centuries exploring the different images of Mary, the ways in which she has been honored, and the influences she has had on Church and Society.The first two chapters provide a grounding in the (admittedly brief) biblical source-materials about Mary and the ways in which this material has shaped and been shaped by subsequent generations of believers and theological reflection. He defends his minimal concentration on the Bible as a source about Mary by writing: \\"Because this book is not an inquiry into who Mary was in the first century, but into what \\"through the centuries\\" she has been experienced and understood to be, biblical materials dealing with her have an essentially retrospective function here\\" (p7). Also in these first two chapters, he spends time on the notion of the \\"development of doctrine\\" as it relates, first of all to the dogma of the Trinity, and secondarily in relation to Mary, and explains that \\"For biblical scholarship\\" [and segments of Protestant Christianity] \\"the fact that \\"in the course of centuries mariology has had an enormous development\\" may be something of a problem. But for historical scholarship, that development is also an enormous resource\\" (p9).He spends the next 13 chapters (Chapters 3-15) traversing two thousand years, four continents, multiple faith communities, and numerous 'images' of Mary, covering such topics as particular centuries -the 2d-3rd, 4th-5th, and 12th-13th centuries-, the Ecumenical Councils as well as the Reformation, art and literature, apparitions, Eastern thought and devotion (especially the liturgical Hymns), as well as paraliturgical forms of Western devotion; there is even a chapter about Mary as she appears in the Qur'an. Also included are chapters covering individual themes such as the Immaculate Conception, the Assumption, the title \\"Theotokos\\" and Mary as Second Eve.A concluding chapter ties the various themes together making an argument for the importance to the study of religious social history of Mary, for as the author writes: \\"It is impossible to understand the history of Western spirituality and devotion without paying attention to the place of the Virgin Mary\\" (p216).The overall organization of the book is a combination chronological and thematic treatment, which is probably its one real weakness: i.e. one chapter covers a theme while the chapter before and after covers a particular time period, so the author and reader is constantly switching viewpoints. Despite this bouncing back and forth though, Pelikan presents the information in a way accessible to the general reader (who is, after all the book's intended audience), free of footnotes technical terms or untranslated quotations, making it ideal for anyone who wants an overview of the history of Marian devotion and its continuing influence and significance for the life of the Church. He writes not to defend any one particular understanding of Mary, but to showcase how the Church down through the ages has understood Mary, and in turn, how this understanding of Mary has shaped the Church and its surrounding culture."},{"Title":"Mary Through the Centuries: Her Place in the History of Culture","review":"A truly excellent introduction to the place of the Virgin Mary in the Christian Faith and the various ways she has been seen throughout history.

Gisella's family had a dozen chickens, each named for a different month. Flame, a wily fox, stole April and May. Armed with a crossbow Gisella entered the forest to kill the fox. She encountered an owl-person who insisted there must be a trial to determine whether or not Flame was really guilty. It was a most unusual trial, with a jury composed only of birds and a white spider as judge. Flame was found innocent. Gisella stared too long into Flame's eyes, and as Great Aunt Tanteh had warned, Gisella and Flame switched bodies.Thus begins a most unusual and magical tale. All the animals in this book can speak and understand humans. There is a war going on between the black army and the purple army. So much destruction is occurring that the magical, invisible world is rapidly disappearing. Even the ordinary, everyday world is in shambles. Gisella's family is being held captive in the Crystal Palace and are threatened with death. The emperor is trying to find out Great-Aunt Tanteh's secret: how she gets December to lay golden eggs.

This fairy tale world is mean and scary, and this may be a bit dark for kids below 4th or 5th grade, depending on the reader."},{"Title":"The Old Country","review":"The story begins in a familiar folk-tale format but transmutes into a parable that tries to walk the edge between a children's fairy tale and an adult allegory, and it doesn't really succeed at being either. The political and racial proselytizing in particular got a bit heavy, especially for a fairy tale, and would have been better handled more tangentially. Though supposedly aimed at young children, it is more suited to the late elementary crowd--and it is a light, quick read for anyone who likes foxes. The overtly fantastic elements introduced in the latter half bothered me a little, but once I accepted the turn the writing had taken, I was able to get used to it.The ending, however, made up for any faults encountered on the journey. It was a satisfying conclusion, and I have to say that I did not see it coming."},{"Title":"The Old Country","review":"My 3rd grader was pretty bored with this book.

But sometimes they are the perfect escape from today, and they are comforting: By and large, the decent people wind up doing fine. Yes, they are classist, and all of that, and in so being reflect their culture and time.However, many of them are just too ridiculous for words, so much so that exasperation overcomes one.But if I had to recommend just one Thirkell to someone, \\"Before Lunch\\" would be it.

(Flip and Find)","review":"I felt that this book is wonderful for children from about 1 year to three or four years. My son, 3 years old, has gone through two copies of this book. The first one fell apart because he carried it with him everywhere and always wanted to read it. He had to sleep with it too. It was and is his favorite book. I think he really enjoyed reciting the words back until he had memorized the book. Then he would read it back to me. This made him feel good about himself. Kids always want to know about monsters and witches and such, and this book answers some questions for them. It keeps their attention with a great topic and storyline, as well as the colrful illustrations. I would highly reccomend this cute book to anyone with young children."},{"Title":"Henry Holmes Smith: Photographs 1931-1986 : a retrospective, March 5-April 18, 1992","review":"Holy Pictures is set in Dublin, probably around the turn of the 20th Century, though it doesn't say exactly when. The novel centers around the Cantwell family, notably daughter Nan.Papa Cantwell owns a (blush) corset factory. But ladies are turning from steel-belted, all-weather laced corsets to rubberized, comfortable (well, relatively comfortable) models. Mr. Cantwell is as inflexible as his corsets and seeks to contour the past as tightly as cinched waists. Modernize? Not he! And there are predictable consequences to his business. He's a boor and a brute. His wife is a typical gentile booby, drifing along or actually drifting downwards with her husband. She's hapless against the tides of ruin that are washing up on their middle-class conventional life. She goes to the hairdresser, neglects the housekeeping and the kids.Nan does well in school and tries to make sense of the increasing disorder in the family. For Mr. Cantwell, it would seem, has a past, a past that comes back in the shape of a bundle of letters written in spindly green ink. Nan's coming-of-age as a woman is shot through with the sins of the adults in her life. Truly, the sins of the fathers are in this case, visited on the children. She notes that \\"grownups get money for nothing.\\" and that they take advantage of the weak, even children, whenever they can. The \\"nothing\\" is of course, not \\"nothing\\", and Nan finds out about the facts of life a bit too late as always.This is a fine, fine first novel and really has only the flaw of being over-ambitious and a bit exotic. The events are crammed in, doubtless from the author's incredible creativity and observant eye and ear. First novels sometimes are a bit over-stuffed, and despite the fact this is not a long book, it is very packed with events, characters, and imagery. But this is a minor literary criticism. This is a wonderful book to read, and if you can find a copy of it, do so. You will probably enjoy it as much as I did.I'm comparing \\"Holy Pictures\\" to Angela's Ashes (which was a memoir.) So the comparison is only that Boylan writes of tough times growing up in Ireland, and that the protagonist is a bright, worthy character surrounded by less-than-sterling adults. There, the comparison ends. But if you liked Angela's Ashes, you will very probably like \\"Holy Pictures.\\" Unfortunately, it is out of print, but used copies are available, or maybe your librarian was of a literary bent and bought a copy for your town. I hope so."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"Excellent and the immersion reading for this book is so fantastic, this feature really appears as if C. S. Lewis is reading it along with me."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"It's a little odd reading one side of a two-sided conversation but this is some of CS Lewis' best - to the point, clear, even humorous from time to time. a joy to read and much to consider."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"Just finished reading \\"Letters to Malcolm\\" by C.S. Lewis. It is generally considered to be one of Lewis's lesser works, but I would rate it as one of his best (chapter 21 may be one of the best things on prayer I have ever read). This intensely personal book was published after Lewis died in 1963 and is well worth your time if you get a chance to read it."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"In Lewis's last book he sums up many of his works, and his popularity, as a layman: \\"All this is autobiography, not theology\\" (105). In Letters to Malcolm, he writes on prayer, from experience, not any kind of interpretation of text. For instance, he writes on imagery, whether it is a source of concentration, a distraction, or an idol. He writes on his personal choice to combine reciting published prayers, sparingly, with praying in his own words. He writes of how irksome prayer can be, the proof being that prayer is assigned for penance.I enjoyed the book, from the perspective of one who has practiced the duty of prayer for years. It is very personal. This is created, in part by Lewis's use of a form he has used before - that of letters written from a mentor. The book also gives me the impression of how Lewis became more tolerant (though I hate to use such a word charged with political connotations). He is more accepting of other ways to come to the same point, for instance his discussion of a \\"true religion\\" in the commonalities of the experiences of mystics. He admits his weaknesses. This book is less rhetorical than his other works, like Miracles or The Problem of Pain, in that it is not the form of stating a thesis then refuting arguments of opposition."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"If you enjoy C.S. Lewis' apologetic works, you'll enjoy these letters to Malcolm where he discusses prayer and anything else that comes to mind."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"Some parts of this book are a bit dated and because most of it is actual personal correspondence some of it may seem a bit dated or irrelevant.However there are some places where Lewis states in one or two sentences something that takes most theologians or philosophers pages to say.The book seems to me to about much more than just prayer and probably some of the questions he attempts to answer about prayer will not be answered with the answers you want (they weren't the answers I wanted) but the pithy parts of this book are outstanding.This book is written in a more pedantic style than most of Lewis' other published works. If you liked Mere Christianity there is much in this book that you will also like."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"This book has moved to the \\"favorites\\" section of my Lewis books. His letters are informal and easy to read. Despite being written decades ago, they remain thouroughly relevent to today's issues."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"\\"Letters to Malcolm: Chiefly on Prayer\\" is one of C.S. Lewis' lesser known books, and yet it's filled with the same godly insight and striking phrases that we find in his other writings. What a wonderful thing it is when you have the greatest Christian writer of the 20th century (Lewis) writing about one of the most important topics (prayer)!Apparently, Lewis found prayer one of the most difficult topics to write about as well, because he had started on a book on prayer as early as 1952. Only after he hit upon the idea of writing the book as a series of fictional letters was he able to complete the book. \\"Letters to Malcolm\\" was the last book that C. S. Lewis wrote: he finished writing it in May 1963 and died November 22, 1963, the same day as JFK (and Aldous Huxley)!\\"Letters to Malcolm\\" is an unusual book on prayer, largely because of the form it takes. Lewis doesn't directly attempt to define prayer or give a complete manual of how to pray but instead offers practical advice on the practical issues related to prayer that most of us are facing but never talk about.Because of the stature of Lewis as a writer, the wonderful aids to prayer, and the thought-provoking way that Lewis presents his material, this is a 5 star book. It helps that it's only 124 pages of material: in reading it I don't have a sense that I have to rush to finish it but can savor not only the wisdom on prayer but also the way that Lewis expresses his ideas.Here are just a few of the quotable Lewis sentences from the book:\\"And they don't go to church to be entertained. They go to use the service, or, if you prefer, to enact it. . . . But every novelty prevents this. It fixes our attention on the service itself; and thinking about worship is a different thing from worshipping.\\"\\"We must lay before Him what is in us, not what ought to be in us.\\"\\"I have no doubt at all that if they are the subject of our thoughts they must be the subject of our desires.\\"\\"I have tried, since that moment, to make every pleasure a channel of adoration.\\"\\"Our emotional reactions to our own behaviour are of limited ethical significance.\\"\\"On the other hand, I find that the prayers to which I can most fully attend in church are always those I have most often used in my bedroom.\\"\\"Behave as if you loved God and man.\\"There are many good books on prayer out there, but \\"Letters to Malcolm\\" will make you think about how you pray more than just about any other book on prayer."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"This books consists of several letters written by CS Lewis to his friend and fellow author, Malcolm Muggeridge, on the topic of prayer. They write about some other issues as well, but (as the title indicates), chiefly about prayer.I love everything by CS Lewis, but this book would have been slightly better if it also contained the letters from Muggeridge. As it is, we only hear half of the conversation between the two men. Nevertheless, Lewis does a fairly good job filling in the blanks. He often summarizes the point or question of Muggeridge which Lewis then responds to.Not surprisingly, the ideas and thinking from Lewis on prayer is often surprising and intriguing. He addresses the issue of how to pray according to the will of God, and whether our prayers truly matter or not from the divine perspective, since God already know what we need and what we are going to pray for. He also talks about the dangers of prayer, and praying to the dead, and a variety of other topics.If you want to learn more about prayer, or want to get another perspective on prayer, this book is a good place to start."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"When I feel angry at the world, or just generally stressed out, this book helps me find my center. Very good philosophical arguments, as always from Lewis. It's made me reexamine my own beliefs on prayer."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"\\"Prayer is irksome,\\" says Lewis. Perhaps your experience has been similar. Does God listen? Is he moved by prayer? How can God promise that our prayers will be answered when we often see that they are not? In a series of letters with a friend, Lewis hits on many of these questions with a clarity of thought that is exceedingly rare. Some will be troubled by Lewis' Anglo-Catholic ideas of purgatory and praying for the dead, but don't let this dissuade you from appreciating a mind truly awake to God's presence. Practical steps to a better prayer life a hard to come by in these pages, but Lewis has a way of drawing you into the experience of prayer by giving the reader a sense of awe and wonder at God's majesty."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"This is the last book Lewis wrote before his death, and it was published posthumously. The title suggests it is a collection of letters, but it is actually a fictional correspondence, a chance for Lewis to offer some of his most mature meditations on prayer, mysticism, suffering, and the soul-work of Christian pilgrimage. This Lewis classic deserves to be much more widely known than it is."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"Wow. nothing more can be said, just Wow. This guy is one of the deepest thinkers i have ever read. He has amazing observations, on many things too, not just prayer, though prayer is the main focus of the book. His ideas are very interesting, and he is able to prove many of his beliefs fairly well. Personaly, i found his discussion on creation to be enrapturing, just making you think beyond what you had before. This book is amazing, and has many truths, and also gives you a ton of stuff to think about. I would reccomend this book to everyone, except for the fact that he is so intellectual i think that many people would get lost. He has a massive vocabulary, so not only is is a good theology/philosophy type book, but it also gives you a challenge in reading, which you cant often find. Very good book"},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"I am currently studying this book and I find it very interesting. Many of C.S. Lewis's remarks on corporate and individual prayer can be related to the struggle going on in the church about corporate and individual worship, especially in the Pentecostal circles. His comments get me thinking and searching scripture to learn what I believe about this subject. I recommend this book to anyone on a worship team as well as anyone just looking for an inspiring book to work on during devotions."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"Wow! This is a tiny book that's packed with huge thoughts on the mysteries and workings of prayer. When my mentor first handed it to me I thought, 'Good. I should be able to finish this in a few days and keep trucking.' Wrong. It took me a long time. Of course, I was reading it along side of something else, but still. I just wasn't expecting it to be so heady. (It's Lewis on prayer. I don't know why I thought it would be a cake walk.)Throughout the book Lewis makes these small, effortless statements that made me put the book down, take off my glasses, rub my forehead and stare out the window off into the mountains thinking, 'What in the world does that mean?' Or, 'There are so many implications connected to that simple statement.' And my head would begin racing (or just hurting).Lewis comes at prayer from a base of God's immutable timelessness. So in order to agree with him on some of his thoughts on prayer, it may be important to agree with him on that aspect of God's character. (See also my review of Terrance Tiessen'sProvidence & Prayer : How Does God Work in the World?.)What I appreciate most in Letters to Malcolm are Lewis's insights, or what he calls \\"festoonings\\" concerning the Lord's Prayer. This I found to be very practical for the ways in which Lewis applies Christ's instructions on prayer to his life: What does it mean to pray, \\"Thy Kingdom come,\\" and, \\"Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors\\"?I'm a fan of Lewis, and I enjoyed his mind-stretching commentary on prayer. It is encouraging that a mind like C.S. Lewis finds prayer to be just as mysterious as I do."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"\\"Domine Exaudi Vocem Meum\\" . . .C.S.Lewis . . . like Thomas Merton, was a man of faith . . . a man of thought . . . a man of contemplation . . . a man of prayer . . . and a writer . . . and so he frequestly lived and expressed his belief, his thought, his prayer, his soul, on paper, in words, in phrases and sentences and paragraphs which both communicated his spiritual pilgrimage and which also became classic \\"still shot photographs in words\\" of \\"everyman\\" . . .This is a short volume, not many pages, and can be read quickly . . .but which then draws you back to read and re-read passages more slowly and more thoughtfully and more reflectively so that like a spring rain, drop by drop, Lewis's reverent personal thoughts on \\"communicating with God\\" can sink in and help our own life of prayer to take root and grow and develope.as you read his \\"letters to Malcolm\\", don't approach them as if you were eavesdropping or a snooping voyeur spying on Lewis's private papers, but think of yourself as being \\"Malcolm\\" and these letters as having been written and addressed to \\"you\\" (beause they were . . .and are). You will find much of your own self referenced in his words and thoughts.Lewis doesn't and never tell anyone \\"how to pray\\", nor does he criticize how anyone else approaches prayer. he makes it clear that prayer is something we all share in common, yet is personal and unique to each individual person (it is not a procrustean bed, a one-size fits all, or all must fit one size device). but he does share HIS prayer experiences and what has benefited and served him in his walk and talk with God and his fellowman . . . and in reading, we also get reflection of our own selves as wwe walk along with C.S. Lewis on that same pilgrimage journey toward a common desitination, destiny and end point (or \\"beginning point\\" perhaps being more accurate to say).What is so good about C.S. Lewis is that he can take deep ideas and make them so much less threatening . . . it is exactly like a conversation with a good friend over a cup of tea or on an evening stroll, where all the pretenses are down,and we talk for real, not trying to impress or be impessed, but simply to speak reality. (although, C.S. Lewis never fails to impress! ha!)Reading any of C.S. Lewis's books or writings on faith and religion is more than worthwhile and rewarding. and \\"Letters To Malcolm: Chiefly On Prayer\\" is no exception. and a small book not to be missed or passed-by . . . it may surprise you how after you read it, you will find yourself returning to it more than once to savor sections or paragraphs that just ring with a resonance you identify with and recognize your own prayer relationship in."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"I read this book because of the luminous quote from it in Richard Purtill's Lord of the Elves and Eldils: Philosophy and Fantasy in C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. The quote appears in an essay in the appendix, \\"Did C.S. Lewis Lose His Faith?\\" in the Ignatius (2nd revised) edition and is not in the earlier Zondervan (first) edition of Purtill's book. The quote to which I refer comes in the last pages of Letters to Malcolm, where Lewis has shifted from the letter to the essay format. Were the entire book this readable, I would recommend it heartily. But it's not. Why?This is one of Lewis' last non- fiction works and arguably his most Anglican. Part of the difficulty is the form of the book, set out as letters to an unseen correspondent. This worked well in The Screwtape Letters because the devils in question explained their ideas at some length, as Lewis, in replying to Malcolm, does not.Lewis drops names and alludes to issues that make the book a good guide to his thought circa 1963, the year of his death, dropping them as quickly as they are raised. A few are: Macaulay, (Alex) Vidler, Petrarch, (John) Donne, (William) Blake, the Bishop of Woolwich, St. Paul, St. Augustine, (Simone) Weil, Queen Victoria, Lycidas, Burnaby, Juvenal, F.D. Maurice, Bonhoeffer, Newman, the Establishment, Herbert, Freudians, determinism, Arnold, MacBeth, Tertullus, Pelagianism, (Alexander) Pope, Plotinus, Lady Julian (of Norwich), St. John of the Cross, Owen (Barfield), St. Francois de Sales, Thomas More, purgatory, Odin, Charles Williams, Thomas More, and Thomas Traherne.These, along with the many untranslated Latin quotes, will make the book offputting for some readers. Lewis noted in An Experiment in Criticism that there are different sorts of readers, however, and I realize that while the above list will make one sort of reader avoid the book, another sort will be tantalized. That would be the right sort of reader for this book.Having said that, the last chapters, 19- 22, strike a more general tone and bits from them are often quoted in anthologies. The same may be said for the very beginning of the book, which is interesting for a different reason. The mid '60s was the time when the Book of Common Prayer, which had long been in use in the Church of England, along with the Authorized or King James version of the Bible, was withdrawn from use and revised. Lewis joins many Angilcans in mulling over the consequences of a new \\"Book\\". This will also have echoes for Catholics re: the changes of Vatican Two, as well as current efforts to increase use of the Latin Mass and replace the NAB in the liturgy with the RSV, recently (re)published by Ignatius Press.There are two quotes from Charles Williams in this book that are among my favorites, and many ideas echo those of Chesterton, who put them in a somewhat more accessible way in Orthodoxy. As with Lewis' last fiction work, \\"Till We Have Faces\\", this may be a book that a certain sort of reader, immersed in Lewis' millieu, will find singularly rewarding."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"Reflections on the relationship between human beings and God. Considers: Do our prayers change the mind of God? Should we rebel against suffering? If God is all-knowing, why tell him our needs and desires?

How does intelligence get mixed with such humility?"},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"I first read Letters to Malcolm many years ago as a younger Christian just getting to grips with some of the difficulties about prayer, and getting very frustrated with the lack of useful answers from people I knew and was being discipled by.Then I read this while I was a graduate student. I was a Lewis fan already, but I remember dancing around in the kitchen at midnight one night while reading it. Why? Not because he had all the answers-- but because he had asked the SAME questions. I was so comforted and consoled by knowing that not only was I not alone in my struggles and confusion, but that one of the greatest Christians of this century had struggled too, and with the same things.Not being an Anglican, I disagree with him on some points--but this is still one of the books I wouldn't be without. Read it and prepare to have your mind stretched and your faith uplifted."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"C. S. Lewis is most famous for his book on stripped-down, essential, \\"Mere Christianity.\\" It was an attempt to get to \\"bares essentials\\" of Christianity, the core common ground that unifies Christians of all denomination. He intestinally avoided the hot issues: \\"the discussion of these disputed points has no tendency at all to bring an outsider into the Christian fold. So long as we write and talk about them we are much more likely to deter him from entering any Christian communion than to draw him into our own. Our divisions should never be discussed except in the presence of those who have already come to believe that there is one God and that Jesus Christ is His only Son.\\" (Mere Christianity, viii-ix)This book, however, is a foray into these \\"disputed points.\\" He gives frank assessments of prayer, the Prayer Paradox (If God is omniscient, then why do we pray?), communion of the Saints, and other side issues. It is his most Anglican book-meaning that he does show the sides he takes within the loose confederation of Christian denominations.Because of this, I would not put this book no my A-List of Lewis Reading, or even my B-List. (I still struggle with \\"Till We Have Faces.\\") It is not because his book is bad, or esoteric, but it is focuses on thing that are not part of my denominational tradition. Still, then, I found it help to see things, such as prayer for the Saints and for the Dead, from his point of view, just by way of general information.I feel closest to the text when Lewis focuses with prayer. Some of his advice seems more like a helpful hint rather than deep theology. Other parts of were deeply thought-provoking, the vintage Lewis we know and love.The book lends comparison to \\"The Screwtape Letters.\\" Aside form the fact that it a one-sided collection of letters, there is not much comparison. These letters are folksy notes between two bosom friends, much like the foyer or parking-lot discussions we have after Sunday Service.That is how we should take this book-an after-service chat."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"I enjoyed this book, but was somewhat dismayed by lack of introductory material. For example, who is the Malcolm of the title? Malcolm X? Malcolm McDowell? It was only once I checked the customer reviews at Amazon.com that I learned it's Malcolm Muggeridge. Also, where are Muggeridge's replies to Lewis' letters? However brilliant it may be, it's difficult to put Lewis' correspondence into context without reading the other side of the discussion."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"This is one of those books where I found myself taking an hour to read a paragraph, which I had previously read. I just needed to ruminate on Lewis' thoughts. It's not theological in the sense ofMere ChristianityorThe Four Loves- he is clear here and elsewhere that he does not want to write a devotional book and indeed thinks he has little to offer on the subject, as he is untrained in these areas. So while he covers the same areas as Richard Foster'sPrayer, this book has a decidedly different feel. It is personal, as if it were a collection of real letters.And thus these are just letters. Often Lewis doesn't fully explain his ideas in an understandable way, to make it appear as if he is not writing to the general public, but only to Malcolm- a friend with whom he has a lot in common, with that secret language that all friends have. I appreciated too how personal asides were imagined, like \\"Your son is very welcome. We do *not* dress for dinner normally.\\" and \\"Please tell Betty I do not need a bed downstairs, I am feeling much better.\\" and, contrary to whatWalter Hooperwould have us believe, references to his conjugal life with his former wife.Lewis' musings have the advantage of coming at the end of his life, with the full wisdom available. I especially liked his thoughts on getting whatever we ask for in faith vs. Jesus prayer in Gethsemane, difficulties in prayer focus, and the effectatiousness of our prayers. In the end, we want to be heard, even more than having our prayers answered. Lewis is simultaneously so deep and so clear. As he said, he wrote for the common man. So as I read him, I find myself constantly thinking, \\"Yes, I didn't believe that before, but I see that now.\\""},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"This book by C. S. Lewis offers something his other books do not. Rather than being a work of fiction or an exploration of his thoughts on religion, this is an intimate exchange of letters between C.S. Lewis and his longtime friend, Malcolm Muggeridge. They discuss the nature of prayer, among other things, and the letters give us a glimpse into Lewis at his most thoughtful. He's not attempting to entertain or to present his case to an audience. He's exploring, with a friend, the most intimate feelings he has about religion. His frustrations, his most sublime moments communing with God, his feelings of inadequacy and much more are revealed in the form of letters to a dear friend. We can put ourselves in Lewis's place and travel the paths he travels, much as we would if we were writing the letters. This is Lewis at his most accessible. He's not the lecturer, the professor or the famous novelist. He's a man on the same search as the rest of we Christians.Muggeridge is a perfect foil. More of a curmudgeon and skeptic, he nevertheless responds to Lewis's questions and wonderings with respect and sincerity.Along with the Screwtape Letters, I find this to be one of Lewis's finest books about religion."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"Lewis's letters to a fictional friend address many of the perplexities about prayer and inhibitions to prayer likely to plague anyone who's ever thought much about it, and his writing is, as always, a pleasure to read.I'm from a non-religious background and found the practice of verbal prayer attractive but hard to make any sense of. This book helped me to get over some of my intellectual blocks to prayer and actually pray.(Two other recommendations for the prayer-impaired or anyone wanting to enrich their understanding of prayer: Ann and Barry Ulanov's \\"Primary Speech\\" and Karl Rahner's \\"The Need and the Blessing of Prayer.\\")"},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"As I left for vacation a few weeks ago, I wanted to take several books in case of rainy days. I read Piper's Don't Waste Your Life (see earlier post on that book) almost in its entirety on that trip and did not get around to the second book in the stack. I chose Letters to Malcolm because I could not decide if I wanted to read a C. S. Lewis book or a book on prayer. So, here I found both in one volume. This was C. S. Lewis's last book, written about six months before he died and published some time after his death. (Incidentally, he died the same day as JFK, 11/22/63).Letters to Malcolm presents to the reader one side of a two way dialogue between Lewis and \\"Malcolm.\\" We do not get to read Malcolm's letters, but Lewis's replies usually help us to know what in on Malcolm's mind. Many people often ask, \\"Who is Malcolm?\\" Some assume it is Malcolm Muggeridge (I think I have even taught this in the past). In actuality, it seems that Malcolm is a fictional character, with just enough biographical information given to make him believable, but not too much where someone might say, \\"Ah, I know who Lewis has in mind here.\\" All we know of Malcolm is that he and Lewis have been friends since college, and have kept in touch over the years. We know he is an Anglican layman with a wife named Betty and a son named George.It is hard to say if the \\"Lewis\\" who \\"writes the letters\\" is a characterized persona or if he is Lewis-proper. There are certainly readily recognizable streams of thought and biographical details that are consistent with the \\"real C. S. Lewis,\\" but there are a few surprises thrown in to keep us guessing. The daily deluge of letters that Lewis received and wrote undoubtedly gave him plenty of fodder for his \\"letter-writing\\" books like this one and The Screwtape Letters. It has been said that some of his most informative writing was in his letters, and we are thankful that so many of his letters have been preserved for us in print today.It seems that about ten years earlier, Lewis set out to write a book on prayer, but it was abandoned shortly after beginning. This is hinted at in Letter XII when he says, \\"But however badly needed a good book on prayer is, I shall never try to write it. Two people on the foothills comparing notes in private are all very well. But in a book one would inevitably seem to be attempting, not discussion, but instruction. And for me to offer the world instruction about prayer would be impudence.\\" So, with Letters to Malcolm, Lewis is able to write that book on prayer, which is very instructional, although it comes across as a couple of friends (\\"on the foothills\\" means that they have not yet ascended the heights of spiritual greatness) just sharing their ideas.As the two men dialogue (bear in mind, we only get to see half of the dialogue), we get to listen in and glean from their insights. Some of the discussion is practical, some philosophical, most theological, and some is even humorous (but you have to enjoy Lewis's sense of humor to pick up on this). On the practical level, Lewis deals with when, where, and how we ought to pray, whether or not we should use \\"ready-made prayers,\\" and the pros and cons of having a prayer list.There is rich theological insight given throughout the book. For instance, Lewis says, \\"We say that we believe God to be omniscient; yet a great deal of prayer seems to consist of giving Him information\\" (Letter 4). His description of how God answers prayer outside of time sounded much like Middle Knowledge: \\"I would rather say that from before all worlds His providential and creative act (for they are all one) takes into account all the situations produced by the acts of His creatures. And if He takes our sins into account, why not our petitions?\\" (Letter IX). The final letter finds a scathing attack on theological liberalism (the anti-supernatural liberalism of his day) which is as relevant today as it was when he wrote it. He writes, \\"A man who first tried to guess \`what the public wants,' and the preached that as Christianity because the public wants it, would be a pretty mixture of fool and knave\\" (Letter XXII).Conservative evangelicals will be uncomfortable with Lewis's discussion on several topics. He advocates a view of Purgatory, which though not the Roman Catholic view, is no less palatable to evangelicals today. He also advocates prayer for the dead, a practice that most evangelicals today would say belongs wholly in the Catholic camp. On the subject of the Lord's Supper (remember the Letters are \\"Chiefly,\\" not exclusively, on prayer), Lewis vacillates between Catholic and Protestant positions saying he is uncomfortable choosing one to the exclusion of the others. While we bristle at his openness to such a diversity of viewpoints, one has to confess that it is refreshing to see such an appreciation for the various tributaries of our Christian heritage.Refreshing is an appropriate word to describe Letters to Malcolm. Perhaps no part of it is more refreshing than the honest and candid confession found in Letter XXI about just how difficult prayer can be. He says near the book's end, \\"... by talking at this length about prayer at all, we seem to give it a much bigger place in our lives than, I'm afraid, it has. ... Well, let's now at any rate come clean. Prayer is irksome. An excuse to omit it is never unwelcome. When it is over, this casts a feeling of relief and holiday over the rest of the day. We are reluctant to begin. We are delighted to finish. While we are at prayer, but not while we are reading a novel or solving a cross-word puzzle, any trifle is enough to distract us.\\" So prayer is for us a duty, a chore, an irksome task. But this is because we are in \\"the school-days.\\" Soon these days will be past, and what we now view as duty will become spontaneous delight.In the meantime, Letters to Malcolm just might help some reader to make the most of his or her prayer time by teaching us how to do it well, and how to understand just what happens when we do it. I would recommend it to anyone interested in reading on prayer, or reading C. S. Lewis's canon. Knowing that he died shortly after the ink dried makes it a sentimental read for Narnians like myself, even though I believe that he has smuggled in some strange ideas past the watchful dragons in this book."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"What can we say? Unquestionably, this is Lewis's finest book: his warmest, his calmest, his most pellucid writing. Cheerful meditations on liturgical reform, petitionary prayer, the Eucharist, purgatory, and Joy (&quot;the serious business of Heaven&quot;). A book to be cherished, a book to be taken to heart.Even persons who are disinclined to venerate C S Lewis will be won over, I imagine, by this slender -- but infinitely magnanimous and supremely luminous -- offering. &quot;One of the purposes for which God instituted prayer may have been to bear witness that the course of events is not governed like a state, but created like a work of art to which every being makes its contribution.&quot; This book on prayer is a work of art, salvific and salutary. And now we will be silent, lest our superlatives run away with us!"},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"C. S. Lewis's twenty-two letters (to a fictitious friend, Malcolm)unveil his own personal questions and answers, failures and successes, struggles and perseverance with prayer. The letters are warm and insightful, and usually very, very helpful, covering a wide range of subjects related to prayer, including: corporate prayer and worship, &quot;ready-made&quot; prayers, the Lord's Prayer, petitionary prayer, &quot;those embarrassing promises,&quot; pleasure (&quot;patches of God-light&quot;), determinism, soliloquy, intercession, purgatory (which Lewis believed in), praying for the dead (which Lewis practiced), and more.Of course, I do not agree with nearly all of Lewis's conclusions. But he is a delightful writer and a warm-hearted spiritual director. The book was pure pleasure to read and helpful in many respects. It is, without doubt, one of the most helpful, practical books on prayer I have read."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"And I enjoyed every minute of it. This is, by far, one of the most complex books that I've ever read. Not necessarily in terms of structure - Lewis keeps the chapters mercifully brief. His vocabulary is immense, as is his knowledge of general philosophy and Christian church history.Most of his points went above my head. I'm an amateur student, still new to most points of religious, literary and logical criticism. However, Lewis gives me hope that an intellectual as impressive as he can examine, understand and appreciate the Christian faith as real and authentic. Maybe, someday, I'll be able to read this again and understand more of it.If you're ready for some mind-numbing theology and vocabulary, logic that will stretch your knowledge and thinking, read it. If you're looking for a simple guide or easy reading, this may not be for you."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"In his Christian works, CS Lewis tackles many difficult and important subjects--love, miracles, and pain, to name a few. For each of these topics, and for many others, Lewis uses a very straightforward technique, and explains things how he perceives them to be. With prayer, however, Lewis takes another approach. He was constantly writing and saying that he knew nothing on the subject, that he felt himself wholly inadequate to write about the subject. His solution was to offer his feelings on prayer in the form of informal letters to a friend, thus enabling him to explain his views without appearing to claim any knowledge on the subject.For all his feelings of inadequacy, Lewis does a remarkable job with prayer. Like many of his other books, this short work provides many insights which simplify and explain otherwise difficult subjects. He speaks not only of how and when we should pray, but also discusses what he considers to be the most elevated form of prayer, and offers his opinion of just what God expects of us when we pray.This short book can be understood without a background in Lewis's writings, as his ideas are not really dependent on his earlier theology (this was one of his last works). This book does lean toward the mystical at times, and can be somewhat difficult to follow, but the insights it provides on prayer are invaluable. This may not be the best introduction to prayer, but it is definitely worth the time for anyone wanting to benefit from the great Christian apologist's views on communication with God."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"The format of this book is in short letters to a friend on prayer. We are presented with only Lewis' side of the conversation, but his references to his friend's response or counterpoints is clear. I loved this book because it encourages us to pray, not to provide God with a grocery list of our problems or desires, but to draw into communion with God...and through that 'conversation' we learn about God and ourselves. Like other of Lewis' books (Mere Christianity)this book is short in length but long in wisdom. Also like Mere Christianity, you'll want to keep it in your library and read it again."},{"Title":"Letters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer","review":"Letters to Malcolm was the last book that C.S. Lewis wrote, and consists of twenty two letters written to a fictitious character named Malcolm, mostly concerning Lewis's thoughts about prayer. This may be the most personal glimpse of Lewis's spiritual side, and many have enjoyed his relaxed, warm dialogue in these epistles. For those wishing to meditate on the various aspects of praying (content of prayer, petitionary prayers - does God grant requests?, prayer as worship, penitential prayer, the Lord's prayer, or prayer for the dead) this book will give plenty of food for thought. Personally, I like most of Lewis's other books better than this one, but if you are studying the subject of prayer, pondering worship in prayer, or musing about whether or not praying does any good, this book will be a good purchase for you."},{"Title":"The Secret Benefits of the 8th of August-Revealed!","review":"Your ability to grasp the vast luck of the 8th of August and the following 88 days depends to a large part on your ability to master yourself. Over the next 88 days you will learn the secrets to wealth, love and power, among many other mysteries, but you will absorb them one at a time in a sequence designed to take advantage of the Numerological and spiritual strengths of these lucky days.I have divided my Lucky Mastery Sequence into 8 cycles of 11 days each, corresponding to the proper mystical influence of each cycle. Your study of the mysteries of the 8th of August will become easier and clearer if you follow the arrangement I have determined because each cycle of study depends on your becoming adept in the last. More important, though, is the fact that the subject and timing of each cycle absolutely depends upon the Astrological, Numerological and spiritual influences that are woven into it. I suppose you will go directly to the cycle dealing with the Secret of Wealth, but I strongly advise against it. Not only would you be attempting to study the subject without having conquered the prerequisite but by inoring the time sequence I have devised, you undermine the very strength of the 8th of August and the following 88 days.The 11-day cycle is central to my program for seizing the power of the 8th of August. The number 11 is itself a powerful one, symbolizing, like the number 8, symmetry and balance. It also signifies leadership, inspiration and mastery, which are essential qualitites you must develop to benefit from the 8th of August. Still, as you work your way through each 11-day cycle, it would be best to remember that the force of 11 is mercurial and difficult to maintain. If you find, while studying my Luck Mastery Sequence, that some of its concepts are hard to grasp, contemplate the dual meaning of 11, and realize that the most \\"slippery\\" ideas are the ones that are most valuable.--- excerpt from book's Introduction"},{"Title":"The women of the Mayflower and women of Plymouth Colony,","review":"Not bad, interesting, but boring and of questionable accuracy.

For mathematics has indeed matured in the United States in the last century and this work provides a series of documentary snapshots. A veritable army, this reviewer included, unites in criticizing the current poor state of mathematics education in the United States.However, we forget that the United States was a mathematical backwater until large numbers of mathematicians immigrated from Europe in the interwar period. Also, first-year students are now routinely taught material that would have been beyond that of many instructors at the turn of the century. There was a strong movement by colleges to eliminate mathematics requirements in the 1920' s. And the extensive growth in the numbers of mathematics students was largely a direct consequence of World War II.The obvious military benefits of technological superiority, largely imported from Europe to win the war, had a mathematical base. Furthermore, the GI Bill of Rights provided the money for thousands to attend college. And the growing conflict with the communist block helped fuel the technological fires, with extensive federal dollars made available for research. In mathematics, this led to a schism into the pure and applied factions that still exists today, although the continuous connections are more apparent than many will admit.The editor does a good job in selecting pieces that reflect all of this, providing a good deal of evidence indicating that this is indeed the best of times. Like all other human endeavors, mathematics mimics the society that surrounds it, and many social movements are reflected in the material.Like pi and e, some things stay constant. Instructors always question current teaching practices and complain about the poor quality of students. This is not a bad thing, for as long as these complaints are with us, mathematics will continue to thrive and advance.If you have any interest in how things have developed over the last one hundred years, pick up this book. Like members of a family, mathematicians have a heritage and roots to their ancestors, and it does us all good to honor them from time to time.Published in Journal of Recreational Mathematics, reprinted with permission."},{"Title":"The Secular Wizard","review":"I waited impatiently for the fourth book in the series A Wizard in Rhyme to be printed. I was not disappointed by the wait. I enjoyed the plot and characters have to be read to be believed. Stasheff has never failed to entertain me with a new twist to each book. I highly recommed this book to all readers of Science Fiction Fantasy."},{"Title":"The Secular Wizard","review":"This is the fourth book in this series and the one where Stasheff finally decided to mix up the plot a little. In the first book (Her Majesty's Wizard) Matt Mantrell was transported to a magical alternate Earth and helped free the kingdom of Merovence (France) from tyrannical satanic sorcerers, meeting various quirky allies on the way. It was awesome. But the second book (The Oathbound Wizard) just seemed to push the reset button. In that one Matt had to free the kingdom of Ibile (Spain) from tyrannical satanic sorcerers, meeting various quirky allies on the way. Then the third book did the exact same thing, only in Allustria (Germany) and with Matt's college chum Saul instead of Matt himself.This book finally does something sort of new. In this one the native prince of Latruria (Italy) manage to free the country from tyrannical satanic sorcerers all by himself, without any need for help from someone from our Earth. However, he refuses to ally with Good or Evil. Matt Mantrell journeys to Latruria to investigate. Along the way he (of course) picks up some quirky allies. However the tone of his adventures is quite different, as he is not journeying through a country corrupted by evil, he is journeying through one that has no sense of right or wrong either way.This book was a welcome change for the series, and luckily a permanent one. The next books don't recycle the plot of the first one either, which makes them a lot stronger."},{"Title":"The Secular Wizard","review":"A fun and original story.

In this field, technologies change rapidly and it's tough to keep up. Often, authors stop after a first edition of a book, either due to lack of sales, financial return, or lack of interest in creating a follow-up. Not only has Danny Goodman created a definitive guide to the JavaScript language, he's continued to keep it current and fresh through five iterations. For that alone, he could be commended. But aside from longevity, this is likely the most complete coverage I've seen on a given topic.By starting off with a tutorial that is easy to follow, the JavaScript Bible will appeal to new users of the scripting language. All of the essentials are covered, along with questions at the end of each chapter to test your retention. For the veteran coder, parts 3 and 4 are worth their weight in gold. Not only is every method and property of every object covered and documented, but you also are told what the browser compatibility expectations are. Since all the browsers are not equal in support of JavaScript, you can quickly get into situations where a coded routine will run for IE but not Netscape. You may even find problems between versions of the same brand browser. By paying attention to the compatibility information, you have a fighting chance of writing code that will be usable by more than one browser.This is also a situation where the CD-is actually useful. The bonus chapters actually add more content to the book, instead of just adding on demo versions of software that you will never load. Since the CD contains the entire text of the book, you also have the distinct advantage of loading the PDF to your computer and searching for information you need. There isn't much in this book that is a waste of time, nor is there much else I can imagine that could be added to the book to improve it. It's truly a classic.ConclusionIf you use JavaScript at all, this is the single reference book you'll need to own.

I did the same for a number of other Javascript books and most of the stuff wasn't in their index.First let me say that I am an Engineer with 20+ years experience so though I'm pretty new to JavaScript, I'm an expert in a number of languages.I found this book to be very well organized and incredibly helpful. I haven't tried reading it as a book cover to cover, and at 1200 pages (plus bonus chapters on CD) I never will. I use it as a reference and read just enough to understand what I need to do. As a result I'm coming at the book not as a novice but with enough understanding to have basic ideas of what I want to do. For this type of usage, this book is \\"fantastic\\".The CD is awesome. There are a number of bonus chapters (one which was very useful to me...using XmlHTTPRequest), and having the entire book available as a pdf is a totally great way to do searches. Too bad the .pdf is too big to be readable on my clie.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"JavaScript Bible (Bible (Wiley))","review":"The value of this massive book lies in its many examples. The JavaScript language is simple enough, but its the definitions of the system objects that create complexity in using it. Goodman spends lots of time going over the particulars, with short readable examples.This is great for the serious HTML writer. I'm imagining a reader who's done a good bit of HTML and may have a little experience with more common kinds of programming. That reader has probably looked into the source code for lots of other people's web pages, and has probably seen JavaScript embedded for various cool functions. Such people will appreciate the thoroughness, detail, examples, and friendly style of the book.That intended reader is not a battle-hardened veteran of software engineering or advanced student of computer science. People with more programming background may be disappointed by the relatively low density of the text, and by its organization. The author has created a successful organization grouping by task, but that is very different from a formal presentation of the language and standard APIs.Decide who you are and what you want. This is a book for a specific purpose and reading population, and seems to serve those very well. If your purpose or backgorund are different, though, the organization may not meet your needs.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"JavaScript Bible (Bible (Wiley))","review":"With nearly 10 years of javascript programming behind me and not one single day dedicated to alert \\"hallo world\\" or prompt \\"tell me ur name\\" bagatelles, and with almost 15 javascript books purchased over those years at a rate of one per year, I guess I have an educated and somewhat reliable word, which can be trusted, to say about this book - and its various eidtions.When I first purchased an early edition, I thought the title was a bit conceited: a \\"Bible\\", you see.If some book of this series ever fully deserved such qualification, this can be only Mr. Goodman's book. I can't vouch for future editions, but I qualify for the past ones: this book is definitive.The book is divided into chapters that deal with the subject object by object. This is exactly what is expected for coping with a language like javascript that is arranged with properties and methods that work on objects. That's the correct approach, simply, under any point of view, educational included.For each object all the properties and methods get explained in an astonishing manner.It is important to stress that unlike some \\"core\\" manuals (I think of some Php), these explanations are not snappy or short: they are detailed. They do not assume you can guess what they don't say by working out the rest from parsimonious and cryptic sentences as many online manuals invariably do: they employ all the words it takes to be clear and detailed.It seems mr. Goodman has understood that in order to be terse and clear you haven't to be so short and so cryptic, but only as short as it is necessary and not a bit more - and never, never cryptic.The new editions cover, with the highest professionality, all the new DOM related methods, and this accounts for why new editions get released: because the language is subject to huge evolutions since it got connected with the DOM.If the latter evolves, the former has to follow, and mr. Goodman has to write more.The reason a few beginners say that this book is not for them is easily explained: the book deals, as I said, with javascript object by object. It starts like that _nearly_ immediately.So, it does not cover the basics (which pertain to any scripting language and not just to javascript) in real detail.That is, the book _implicitly_ presumes something (but not too much): it somewhat presumes you know what a loop via a \\"for\\" cycle is, it somewhat presumes you know what an \\"if/else\\" conditional check is, and it somewhat presumes you know, more or less at least, what an array is: a collection of variables each arranged as key versus value.It does not presume more. And it is not that it does not provide explanations for those topics at all: it is that for an _absolute_ beginner grasping the meaning of a loop can be daunting regardless of how many words you spend. This is no mr. Goodman's fault: it has been daunting for us all the first times in our lives we saw loops.You have to chew on them on your own, with a little bit of torment and agony, and nothing, not even tons of words, could really ever bridge the gap of unfamiliarity that the first blast gives to a novice.This is why mr Goodman, arguably, does not spend _that_ ton.Provided you have a minimal knowledge, this is your javascript book. Period. Nothing compares. That is. Simply.Provided you haven't such minimal knowledge yet the matter is as follows: you will have it in a few weeks finding some route of your own - we all did that way if you had no teacher as I hadn't.I learned what loops are on mr. Jason J. Manger (1996) manual, and if you complain it is difficult to understand loops from mr. Goodman, wait to understand them via mr. Manger's work as I did!And once you will have that understanding, this will be, again, your book, your defintive javascript book, after you trudged your way through those few weeks.All the javascript routes lead to this book, like all the ways in the ancient world were said to led into Rome.Alberto Vallini"},{"Title":"JavaScript Bible (Bible (Wiley))","review":"I picked up this book and another one (that shall remain unnamed) recently when starting to learn javascript.

First, anyone who knows the basics of javascript, from advanced beginner to advanced js user. Second, anyone who wants to learn javascript and already knows some programming; you can use it as a tutorial, but only if you don't need much explanation about scripts and object-oriented programming.It really is just excellent for someone who has previously learned something about one of the chapters but needs a refresher and/or more detailed/comprehensive walkthrough.Four stars instead of five for a completely unnecessary mistake. Unfortunately, the W3c ignores people who do not have eagle-sharp vision and will fill a page full of semicolons and colons, or parens and curly brackets. If you don't have a font that clearly distinguishes these, it is a major source of semantic errors and eyestrain. The font chosen to print the code in this book could not be worse. Colons and semicolons are almost impossible to distinguish (not to mention periods and commas),and curly brackets look like thin lines with no curls.C'mon guys.

Nonetheless, it's also a language many like myself have to live with; so I can say this much about it...This book is certainly huge and also quite helpful to someone that knows HTML and needs some interactivity on the client side.

It explains some topics clearly and picks up on details in methods and nomenclature which were left out of the others, making them confusing. The text, itself, is relatively clear, and there are good indexes and lists.Still, the author makes assumptions of the reader's familiarity with coding, leaves the occasional logical stretch to be figured out.

Developing web pages is the hardest of all development technologies, you have to know a lot about different technologies, and make them work across all browsers. Thankfully Netscape, which was a major problem in the past, has come a long way and caught up to the rest. However, making Javascript work for each browser is hard enough, and this book really comes to the rescue. It tells you what works for which browser.

Browser differences and compatability, etc. are things no javascripter should ignore. However, this book, in my opinion, makes it overly complicated by trying to touch on every little twist there was in the history of javascript.At first, this book taught me a lot, but it started to get tiring when I'd learn a certain technique only to find out it was kind of out-dated or not the best way to achieve a certain task.I don't deny it's necessary to at least be able to recognize the old ways of doing things but for the new javascripter, this just makes things far too complicated in too short a period of time. Before reaching halfway through the book I got fed up because I no longer knew what was the \\"right\\" way of achieving my goal in my scripts.I would recommend this for people who are looking for the complete package of javascript knowledge, however, if you'd rather look to the future rather than dwell half your time in the past, I'd say go somewhere else."},{"Title":"JavaScript Bible (Bible (Wiley))","review":"Pro: pretty comprehensiveCon: This book is obviously written for the people without much idea about programming.

The behaviors in this book are spot on. Remember its a syndrome,you definatly WILL get some of the features of this neurobiological disorder but not all of them.

The book catalogues the lives of about 2,000 patients that were seen by Dr. Comings and his collegues, and so it covers pretty much everything. A few rules to follow if you have a loved one with this disorder:1 - Never Lie2 - Make no promises3 - Never strive to create an ill feeling in someone with TS, theycreate their own guilt, anger, disapointment, and sorrow.4 - Set the best possible example and shun risk5 - When they are young keep a regular schedule, structure is VERY good6 - Try to have a cold temper, HOT tempers are not usefull7 - They like bland food, do not fight over food, fix 2 meals, they eatcheep8 - They really do not know what happens next, and react badly tounpleasant surprises.9 - NO BB GUNS!10 - They are easily taken advantage of, watch them like a hawk, theyWILL jump off a clif if their best friend does.11 - Port - A - Patsy, scrutinize their friends closely.

This book was remarkably eye-opening. I especially found helpfull the chapters on the good aspects of TS and TS personality characteristics.I'll cut to the chase and give some inside insight. Chances are, as a Tourettic myself, that if one of us is involved in 'delinquent' behavior, it's probably due to our tendency to have a higher intelligence combined with a disgust for hypocracy in the 'system', so it's probably done just to show how the system has a huge hole in it. (However, I never fell in that category because I figured I'd get caught, so just kept my distaste with what I perceived as hypocracy - something else we tend not to stand for - to myself.)It's an excellent book for reaching beyond tics, to understanding why I speak so candidly, to hints at what is the best way for me to learn, all the way to having the tenacity of a bulldog. I thought these personality characteristics in me were just individual flukes! Then I read about brother and sister Tourettics who share the same. I read the opening case stories and couldn't beleive it. &quot;That's me!&quot; I exclaimed.Now, if only the medical community will catch up..."},{"Title":"Tourette Syndrome and Human Behavior","review":"This book answered so many questions for me about tourettes Syndrome and many questions I had yet to even conjure. The information is presented so that even the non medical person can read with ease. Despite the size I never put the book down once I started reading. The information gave me the information to confirm my suspicions that my son had Tourettes Syndrome and the knowledge and understanding of how to present that information to my childs physician and get a diagnosis. I read the book a few years ago but now as I am propelled to seek a degree in psychology from the information I learned about Tourettes Syndrome frequently I refer to &quot;Tourettes Syndrome and Human Behavior&quot; when I speak publicly on the subject and have referred the book to physicians, psychologist, educators and parents.Noreene M. Bailey parent of a child with tourettes psychology student at SFCC"},{"Title":"Tourette Syndrome and Human Behavior","review":"This book was written in 1990, and there have been great strides in research since then. Comings lumps too many other diagnoses into a description of Tourette Syndrome, which is confusing and can be catastrophic when you are trying to get the right treatment for an individual. Yes, SOME people with Tourette's have the other complications that Comings describes- but NOT ALL. It is fine to be treated for ADHD, OCD, TS, and other conditions if that is what you or your child has, but if you don't have ADHD, OCD, and other conditions, you deserve to be treated only for what you do have.The book is also slanted because it is based upon research that represents those who seek treatment for TS, not the general population with TS. Most people who seek treatment for TS have more complicated problems than just tics. Research since this book was published is more inclusive of the wider population.For the best and most up to date information, stick with the Leckman/Cohen book. Or read Amy Wilensky's book. Stay away from Comings. So much has changed in 13 years of research into TS and the human genome."},{"Title":"Tourette Syndrome and Human Behavior","review":"Don't let the thickness scare you. And don't think that Tourette's is just the \\"cussin' disease.\\" Dr. Comings has written a very readable yet comprehensive work on Tourette's Syndrome including a host of related \\"spectrum disorders\\" such as ADHD, ODD, OCD, and Conduct Disorder, etc. His background as a geneticist and treating physician give the reader both an understanding of the genetics and heritability of these disorders and comprehensive treatment guidelines regarding medications and therapy for them. I have been able to solve a variety of \\"mysteries\\" presenting in my practice that have responded well to Dr. Comings' RX recommendations. Dr. Comings\` book has been so useful in my psychology practice (private ADHD Clinic) that I have ordered copies for all my physician referral sources. Parents will find some info rather technical but Dr. Comings give you permission to skip chapters. His case studies and TS \\"pedigrees\\" will certainly hit home with many parents who have struggled with the troublesome but often subtle symptoms of the spectrum disorders. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Tourette Syndrome and Human Behavior","review":"This is book offers a wonderful and complete explanation of the origins and progress of this fascinating neurological disorder. Dr. Comings is most definitely NOT just a doctor who came up with a few speculative theories, as another reviewer implied. He is one of our country's premiere medical geneticists studying -- and teaching -- the etiology of psychiatric/neurological disorders in adults and children. He still consults on difficult cases out of the City of Hope in California.Before this brilliant man studied this disorder, Tourette's was frequently assumed to be the product of bad parenting (at best), the result of poor moral behavior, or demonic posession requiring exorcism (at worst). Now Tourette's, and its symptoms, are widely recognized by medical professionals to be an inherited disorder of neurotransmitter metabolism -- but it was not so until Dr. Comings published his well-documented findings based on superbly performed studies (that have been widely published in extremely reputable peer-reviewed journals).In this book, Dr. Comings documents not only his findings, but his journey as he learned more about this disorder and its related problems, which include obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit-disorder, and a host of other issues. He is a physician writing about the technical aspects of medical genetics, and symptamatology, but he still has created a volume that makes fascinating reading for scholar and layman alike."},{"Title":"Tourette Syndrome and Human Behavior","review":"As a parent of a child with Tourette's, I feel I must warn anyone trying to learn about TS to ABSOLUTELY NOT buy this horrifying book. It is full of completely outdated and flat out wrong information that has long since been dismissed by current clinical studies. Please skip it and go read Brad Cohen's book"},{"Title":"Tourette Syndrome and Human Behavior","review":"This unfortunately was the first book I read on the subject of Tourette Syndrome. My child was then 4 years old and newly diagnosed with the condition, and an absolute angel, sweetheart, mild-mannered, sociable pre-schooler with tics. I needed therapy after reading this book for fear of all the horrible things that might become reality for my child, not to mention I felt so low about my family members from a genetic pool standpoint, I wondered if I'd ever be able to lift my head proudly again.Fortunately many years have passed and much of what was indicated that very well could become my child's reality in living with Tourette Syndrome, (in terms of difficulties with the condition and socialization), never did. A second child within my family was later dx'd with the same syndrome and happily for us, things are going much better than this book would have ever lead me to believe.I encourage those who are new to this condition to start reading somewhere else before tackling this book, and when and if you decide to read this one, make sure you have a support group lined up for the after math. In my opinion, this book may very well cause more grief than the condition, if for no other reason than for the fear mongering of what may never come to pass.Fortunately, much research has been done in recent years on the condition, and I feel that the picture of living with Tourette Synderome is much brighter than my earlier days when I had nothing other than this book to benchmark the condition by."},{"Title":"Tourette Syndrome and Human Behavior","review":"I have suffered from Tourette's since around age 5. I'll spare you the clinical and genetical reasoning and studies he uses to make his point, I am not a doctor, but I do have Tourette's.I suffered from childhood tics, and a myriad of apparently associated behavioral problems, all brought to light in this study.This book was an eye-opener, I identified with so many things others with TS he had studied suffered from, I felt like I was reading a self-study autobiography.I was sick of hearing about just tics, those come and go in a lot of TS patients, I could handle those, they got better as I got older. The ones I had were very obvious; head-jerking, repetitive/constant throat clearing, blinking, throat noises, and host of other strange impulses I had a hard time controlling until I was older. I was teased, ridiculed, poked, studied and then forgotten when the obvious tics went away.Unfortunately the tics were the least of my problems, many of the associated ADD, OCD, addiction problems and behavioral disorders fit me to a tee, that Comings covered. The genetic trail he discovered seemed very reasonable and the act of my conception alone could've been a result of impulsive behavior associated with a form of Tourette's. The implications of modern human behavioral problems are almost over-whelming, astounding, and to an extent, throw-away a lot of preconceived notions we all have today about kids with TS, ADD, hyperactivity, addiction problems, minor criminal activity in middle class families, that otherwise have no explanation.For anyone wanting to know more about Tourette's, or who may have it in their family, this is the first book I would recommend. You simply cannot argue with some of the relative behaviors and passed-down traits and patterns of behavior in families, it is impossible to ignore.I lived it, and I don't really need someone to tell me otherwise, my impulses were not something born out of purely external, environmental conditions, I know that much.Comings is on to something here and it deserves praise and serious attention from the medical community.Even if you don't agree with his findings, the book itself and the case studies are very interesting and are something government, law and social officials/employees need to have a better understanding of."},{"Title":"Tourette Syndrome and Human Behavior","review":"This has been a very interesting book.

A biology background is helpful to understand the genetic and physiology chapters but not necessary as the author gives a step by step approach."},{"Title":"Tourette Syndrome and Human Behavior","review":"This book is a great book for the patient diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome at the secondary and tertiary level of the disorder; or a person in a personal relationship with the same patient. They will understand and relate much more throughout the pages without a \\"Scare Factor\\". There are possible more sever co-morbid conditions the Dr. amplifies in the secondary and tertiary diagnosis which are not so prevalent in a first level diagnosis if at all.I doc the book only 1 star solely for the purpose of some statistical analysis concerns which for the most part are of little value to most patients. It's a M.D. and Ph.D neurological posturing and arguing point for clinicians, researchers among many other peer review arguments. Nonetheless, the adjustment is warranted.One of the wonderful qualities of the book is the ease of language character for the lay reader in respect of the volume size and medical matter. It is not hard to understand the theories, line of reasoning, and detail Dr. Comings presents.True; the Dr.'s work is vastly based on those who seek treatment for the disorder, as would be expected because of his practice and leadership at the City of Hope. This is a plus however for those who seek treatment because it focuses on that range of patients. For that margin of patients it is illuminating and liberating to have a name and understanding by medical clinicians of what Tourettes has meant to them on their level.For a mild case of Tourettes, this may only be a book you can discover information about others who suffer from the disorder more than you. Don't let it scare you however. Even if your case is mild, the pedigree education, charts, tables, neurology, survey and more, can help you understand a riddle.\\"Having Tourettes is kind of like a riddle.

The ADD/ADHD kids are actually calmer and all students are learning more. (Less wear and tear on the teachers!) By learning ASL we are also encouraging communication with the Deaf.

I really did enjoy reading about Bambi a chocolate vixen that got a heart broken by a no good drug dealer with a dark secret. Bambi broken hearts leads to scandalous revenge on any man that crosses her path. Bambi would dig so deep in men pockets they are left standing dumbfounded! Karma is a bi@ch and Bambi's luck takes a few falls. There are a few books about gold digging women, BUT Bambi is just looking for her ture love and that is why I enjoyed this book so much.

I am glad that Ms. Turner woke up and smelled the dollars by going to another publishing company. Triple Crown was bringing you down. Congrats on a new deal and an editor that made your book shine like it should without all those messy typos and grammatical errors.I will say it a second time. Buy this book!!! It reads like a player's manual from beginning to end. Sheila E. will be proud that her song is the soundtrack for this book. The main character Bambi was schooled from the best, her mother. There were two main points I liked about Bambi - one, she wasn't a light-skinned chick with green eyes and straight hair. She was described as a beautiful black woman and all shades of black women should be appreciated from light to dark in our fiction. Two, Bambi wasn't from the projects which shows that not all gold-diggers reside in the hood. They come in all colors and backgrounds. Bambi makes mistakes and the dirt she throws out also comes back to her.Ms. Turner put so much game in this book that it should have come with Cliff's Notes. It was an exciting page-turner from beginning to end, puts you right in the middle of VA while reading. My hats off to Ms. Turner because I loved \\"A Hustler's Wife\\" but thought the next books were just okay. I'm glad I didn't write you off and when Miss Yarni was mentioned you had me. I will definitely be buying your next book which I hope will be a sequel with two of VA's top fictional ballas- Bambi and Yarni!"},{"Title":"The Glamorous Life: A Novel","review":"I am 50 years old and my 19 year old daughter recommended Ms. Turner's books to me. I thoroughly enjoyed reading \\"The Glamorous Life\\". I found Bambi and all of the characters very relatable to real life and while the plotline is uncomplicated, it was amusing and fun to read.

Use them before they can use you. But, youth plays its hand and she gets caught up, but like a 'real black woman' she picks her face up and plays the game like its supposed to be played. Enter an OG that likes what the package before him, and despite a preceding rep tries her out for starters. It's a fantastic voyage, but like life as we all know, one day you have to wake up.This book has a good story line, but it could have stood to have a little more meat and cheese.

The first was Hustler's Wife and I could tell where she was trying to go with the story but it was semi-average at best. I decided to give her another try when she moved on to a major publisher. Yes, there was great improvement in regards to editing and the actual flow of the story but the concept was just average. Nikki obviously has a strong fan base but she needs to give TCP credit for that. I'm sorry to say but Nikki Turner can't write all that well. Her style of telling a story is somewhat boring and definitely not original. Because I like to give AAlit writers a chance I will buy her new book. Hopefully the third time will be the charm."},{"Title":"The Glamorous Life: A Novel","review":"the book had me hesitant to finish it b/c it was kind of long-winded in the beginning. but as i kept reading, it did have its moments. this was my very 1st nikki turner original book. i think i will keep giving her a try. the ending of this book was a definite cliffhanger. i AM SURE that there will be a sequel to this book.

Bambi was a dark-skinned long-legged beauty who was not raised in the ghetto. Her mom did everything for her to ensure that she would not have to resort to that type of lifestyle but the streets called to Bambi and she answered. She fell in love with a small-time hustle named Reggie and her mother disowned her. He had her living in motel rooms and selling drugs for him when he had to do a 90 day bid. He came up and because one of the biggest dopeboys in the city and wanted to make Bambi wifey.On the day of their anniversary his other woman-who was actually a MAN- told Bambi that her fiancee was a homo-thug!!Bambi vowed from that day on not to give another man her heart like that. She became the ultimate gold-digger-getting men for their money and she was out. Floor-length furs, fast cars, glamourous trips, and clear uncut diamonds were her lifestyle cuz everyone wanted a taste of the black Barbie who rode the red Corvette. Bambi fell bck in love again with Lynx, another bgi time drug boy who finessed her and disappeared into the clear blue sky. What became of Lynx? You have to read the book to find out.

But once again I found it at Kmart for $5.99 and went on and got it...I'm so glad I did. After reading this book, I knew from that point on, I can't just go by what other reviews say about a book. I say that because they made this book seem horrible and just plain out boring, which it was far from. We all have different opinions but I know now that I have to find out if I like it our not on my own. So do not go by what other reviewers has to say about a book if you want to get it, get..if you don't, you my pass up a good read.AOUT THE BOOK ITSELF: This was a true page turner for me. Alot of drama and karma and from the last page... there will be more to come. The ending really shocked the heck out of me. Now I don't know who's going to end up on top. But what I do know is, one of the main characters that I'm rooting for will go down..it always happen, if not in the first book, then you best believe it will happen in the second one..it never fails! hell, after all the mess they pulled they all might fall.

However the plot was to much like trash tv for my liking complete with homo-thugs, drug dealers, baby mamas, ect.

This book could have used better proofreading i.e. refering to God as \\"he\\", when it should read \\"He\\" or \\"Him.\\" I am sure this book will appeal to those find designer lable name dropping, \\"shot-calling\\", \\"gaming\\" and hustling \\"glamorous.\\""},{"Title":"The Glamorous Life: A Novel","review":"This book was good.

The struggles and underlying themes are the same: karma, because what goes around comes around, hold your man down for whatever because if he sets you up you move on, but remember hold yourself down while staying in full length furs, and get all of someone else's money for the best revenge.Maybe I'm spoiled after reading Mina's Joint but I don't feel the love and passion between Turner's characters in any of her books. All I get from them is that they are about a hustle. Hustle him, them, work, blah blah blah. She makes love a hustle because drugs are involved.I'm not trying to say anyone is copying anyone but what's up with the few sentences about Bambi having a sister named Yarni. Hustler's Wife didn't make much of an impression on me but that's the name. At least the sisters can bond over their experiences of hustling.

The story was entertaining at best, but some of the situations were so far fetched it just made the scenario seem out of place.

You will not be disappointed. I am ready for Part 2. Great Job Nikki!"},{"Title":"The Glamorous Life: A Novel","review":"When I first heard the title of Nikki Turner's third novel, The Glamorous Life, I immediately thought of the song title of the same name made popular by Sheila E in the 1980s. Like the character in the song, Bambi Ferguson, the protagonist of the novel is seeking to live a glamorous life by using men to provide her wants and needs. For Bambi it seems as if she's suffering heartache from every man she has ever let into her life. Beginning with her father who abandoned her for his other, lighter family, to her childhood friend who made fun of her dark complexion in front of the other kids, and finally with Reggie, the love of her life. Reggie is the man she supported while he served time in jail, her future husband, who has a devastating secret that ultimately tears down their relationship at their engagement party.After suffering so much heartache at the hands of men, Bambi decides to heed her gold-digging mother's advice and hit men where it hurts, their pockets. With her stunning good looks, she has no problem seducing men out of their funds and quickly leaves behind a trail of broken-hearted and bitter men, until she meets Lynx. Lynx has heard the rumors about Bambi's lifestyle, but is determined that he can change her scheming ways. Together they try to embark on a relationship but soon their pasts come back to haunt them, and they learn that there are sacrifices to be made in order to live the glamorous life.Nikki Turner has proven that the third time is a charm and this is without a doubt her best novel to date. It provides readers with glimpses of the street life without being too graphic and has a cast of memorable characters. Although you might not agree with their actions, you are sure to understand their motivations. This book was also filled with DRAMA but it was not over the top. Having read both of Ms. Turner's previous novels, I can definitely see her growth as an author. I cannot wait to see what she comes up with next (I am hoping for a sequel).Reviewed by Latoya Carter-QawiyyAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"The Glamorous Life: A Novel","review":"Out of all Nikki Turner's books and I read them all.

She is young, beautiful and is engaged to a fine man named Reggie, who happens to be a big time drug dealer. Being the lady of a drug dealer has its perks, as anything Bambi wants is at her disposal; money is no object. Happy and on cloud nine, Bambi is living the life of a queen and feels she is invincible and nothing or no one can get in her way. All good things must come to an end and Bambi's happiness is no exception. On the night of her engagement party, she finds out that her fiance Reggie is not at all what he appears to be. The secret he has been keeping from her is enough to destroy her and subsequently end their engagement.Sick with humiliation and embarrassment, Bambi decides to give up on love. Her mother told her once before to only pursue men who have big bank accounts or who can take care of her financially. Bambi heeds her mother's advice and only becomes interested in men who have big pockets. She becomes known in town as a gold digger who has no heart. She starts a party planning business. Although her business is successful she still doesn't have anyone to share her life with. Then she meets Lynx, a drug dealer who sees her for more than the gold digger she is known to be. Bambi unexpectedly falls in love with Lynx and once again believes in love. He shows her things she has never seen and treats her the way she deserves to be treated, promising to never hurt her. Lynx ends up losing everything he owns and Bambi has to look inside her heart and determine if it's the man she loves or the money. Will Bambi stand by her man despite his circumstances or will she leave him and again pursue someone who has more money?THE GLAMOROUS LIFE is a fast-paced read that delves into the heart of money, power and respect. Although Bambi makes her own money, heartache causes her to seek men for their money as well. This book takes us on a journey of a girl not only longing for love and acceptance but also that almighty dollar. Urban fiction lovers will indeed love this book. Although this is my first Nikki Turner read, I definitely plan to pick up her other books. The characters drew me in from the first to the last page. Ms. Turner knows how to write a story that not only keeps you wanting more but also has you yelling, crying and laughing as well.Reviewed by Eraina B.

It is slightly outdated for this field (published in 1997), and I would not recommend someone to read this book. The topics in it are covered in more detail in other texts. As a proceedings of a summer school in theoretical physics, the level of math and physics is probably beyond most non-physics majors.

He presents scholarly analysis in very easy to read passages. Reading this book in particular greatly increased my understanding of Paul's extraordinary letters to Timothy and Titus on Christian leadership principles."},{"Title":"The letters to Timothy, Titus, and Philemon","review":"This installment of The Daily Study Bible Series covers the Pastoral Epistles and the letter to Philemon. William Barclay has given us a good devotional study firmly rooted in biblical scholarship.Scholars have disputed Pauline authorship of the Pastoral Epistles (I and II Timothy, Titus). Barclay's introduction covers the issues involved well. He takes a middle position where a later teacher expanded genuine Pauline fragments. Unfortunately, he does not expound this view in the commentary itself; he is silent about which sections are genuine and which are later. Since \\"we are still hearing the voice of Paul\\" (13), it probably did not occur to him to make the distinctions. Barclay's introduction to Philemon includes an interesting if speculative account of how this short letter became included in the New Testament.The commentary itself is best described as expository. Barclay does not only analyze the Greek text. Using exhortation, anecdotal stories, and other sources, he also suggests what these texts might mean today. From a strictly academic viewpoint, this commentary will seem superficial. For the popular audience for whom Barclay has intended this work, it should serve as a springboard for further study. Barclay provides a list for further reading for this purpose.Though this book is a good introductory work overall, the reader should be aware of a couple points. The first relates to these epistles' stances on women and slavery. Any casual reading of the letters will strike the reader as bordering on misogyny and condoning slavery. Barclay places these tests in the situation of the Roman/Greek world in which Paul wrote them. He makes a valid point that doing almost anything else would be scandalous (with women) or even dangerous (with slaves). To his credit, he says those circumstances no longer apply. However,considering the history in which these texts were and are used, I have to think he soft-pedaled these issues. After all Christianity is supposed to be \\"light for the world\\" (Matt. 5:14, NJB).The other issue concerns Barclay's treatment of other religions. When Barclay mentions them, he almost invariably creates straw men of them. He makes at least one anti-Semitic accusation without evidence. Against these straw men, Barclay over idealizes Christianity. Even granting this work is now more than twenty-five years old, Barclay should have been above that."},{"Title":"The letters to Timothy, Titus, and Philemon","review":"In his series of New Testament Commentaries, William Barclay gives us a commentary on the \\"Pastoral Epistles\\" and Philemon. 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus are called the Pastoral Epistles because Paul had written them to encourage and advise two pastors in Early Christianity. They give advice concerning the character and conduct that Christians should have, specifically the character and conduct of a church's pastor.Where Barclay's strength lies is in the meticulous analysis of the text. Paul tends to pack a lot in his sentences; Barclay picks the sentence apart and brings things into clearer view. While he does an admirable job discussing Paul's world in the light of the times (when slaves outnumbered free men, when women were neither to be seen nor heard, etc.); how Paul's words can be applied to a modern, slave-free, woman-respecting society; and spends a great deal of time analyzing Christian conduct.While the commentary is generally good, it wasn't much that I hadn't heard or read before. It can be argued that this was Barclay's intention. Since he translated the entire text from the original Greek, quoted many other Bible verses and Paul's pagan contemporaries (to illustrate the thinking of the day), etc., he could have written a pretty good commentary series intended for Biblical scholars. Instead, he wrote one for the regular chruch-goers.I do have to throw in one comment concerning the inerrancy of the Bible. Barclay speculates that Paul may not have written the entire epistle, but rather that someone found one of Paul's old letters and re-wrote it to address the Gnostic heresy in the Church. This speculation is dangerous as it encourages one to pick apart the Bible and throw away the parts that he/she doens't like. It makes the Bible subjective (\\"I don't like that part about no murder. I don't believe the Holy Spirit wrote that, so I'll ignore it.\\"). The Holy Spirit doesn't need an editor; It will have what it wants in the Bible and make sure that any \\"false teachings\\" are not included.In all, this is a pretty good commentary. It gives a thorough, Biblical analysis of the conduct of Christian pastors and lay-people. It also gives a healthy view of the historical period in which these letters were written."},{"Title":"The letters to Timothy, Titus, and Philemon","review":"Usual Barclay in-depth detail and background to understanding scripture. Excellent resource for scripture reflection provided you ignore the old style writing"},{"Title":"The letters to Timothy, Titus, and Philemon","review":"I wonder why I bought this book. In 1962 I read a book by William Barclay, something like the Mind of Jesus. At the time it seemed arrogant that someone would attempt to explain the workings of Christ's mind. It is as if God shared omniscience with this chosen person. This book was published in 1975 and it seems the connection between the mind of God and the mind of Wm. Barclay still operated.This volume is one of a series of works under the heading \\"The New Daily Study Bible.\\" This describes the depth of the work. Alas, not all of us read the cover closely enough and we waste our money. I have given up Bible study as a theologian for Bible study as a historian. The reason for getting this book is to see how a modern religious teacher would interpret a book of considerable importance to American history, the Epistle to Philemon. Because this is so important to me most of this review will cover Barclay's exposition of this tiny letter because I think the reader can get an appreciation of the whole work by examining how this epistle is handled.The story is very simple. Paul is a prisoner in Rome and an escaped slave finds him there. The slave is the servant of a wealthy churchman in Colosse. Philemon, the master, has housed Paul in his home and is well known by him. While the slave, Onesimus, is with Paul, he becomes converted to Christianity. According to Barclay Roman law was very harsh with runaway slaves and masters were supposed to treat the returned slave as badly as possible to keep others in line. Our author extols the courage of Paul in sending the slave, though he is a Christian, back to his Christian master. He implies both Paul and Philemon are in danger of prosecution. Onesimus as a slave is not worthy of too much concern.Barclay's explanation of why Paul would return a fugitive to his rightful master is proof apparently of that open information highway between the Scottish author and the Almighty. It is acknowledged that slavery is un-Christian. But the apostle and even Jesus could not say it was wrong because of the political and social conditions of the Roman world. Any such [slave] revolt would have been savagely crushed; slaves who took their freedom would have been mercilessly punished, and Christianity itself would have been branded as revolutionary and subversive. Given the Christian faith liberation was bound to come--but the time was not ripe; and to encourage slaves to revolt or leave their masters, would have done infinitely more harm than good. There are some things which cannot be achieved suddenly, and the world must wait until the leaven works.\\" The sentiments \\"the time was not ripe,\\" \\"things which cannot be achieved suddenly,\\" and \\"wait until the leaven works\\" hardly describe a religion which, despite what Barclay thinks, was very revolutionary and subversive. Such sentiments belong more to politicians than to apostles of a God of love. I can much more forgive Lincoln for hesitating because the time is not ripe than I can excuse Paul or Jesus for not speaking against slavery for this reason. Rome was notorious for its assassinations and murders but the church did not refuse to condemn murder. I have to agree many later [19th century] preachers nit-picked the letter to death trying to prove their positions on slavery and emancipation, but if anyone bothers to read this little letter I am sure Barclay's exegesis.The rest of the book has the same simplistic scriptural elucidation. Simple is not a problem, simplistic is not the way to examine anything that is important to you. Be warned about this book.I do not say that the author should paraphrase \\"Comrade Jesus Hath His Red Card,\\" although early Christianity was a radical movement. What I object to is the position Barclay takes that certain sins are so politically and socially ingrained in society, it would be disruptive for the truth to be pushed. To quote some religionists, \\"The SAFE truth shall make you free.\\""},{"Title":"The Complete Poems of John Donne","review":"While this collection has all the poems of John Donne like it promises, it has no glosses or footnotes. Also, some words differ from Oxford and Norton editions. If you're buying this for a class, you might want to choose a different collection of Donne poems."},{"Title":"The Complete Poems of John Donne","review":"This does seem to be a complete Kindle collection of Donne's poems, and they are properly laid out on the page (ie they do not run together like prose, as happens in some Kindle editions of poetry). But the table of contents takes the reader only to the first poem of different sections of the collection. Although each section has its own table of contents, these are not interactive - so that the only way of finding a specific poem in this big collection is to go to the beginning of the relevant section and then go through it page by page. Also, there are no page breaks - or sometimes even line breaks - between the poems, so that the title of one poem appears immediately after the last line of the previous one. This is the kind of mediocre editing that, in 2011, would barely be acceptable in a free edition, and certainly not for a book for which the editors are asking $3.99 . I hope they correct these errors and issue an updated version."},{"Title":"The Complete Poems of John Donne","review":"It was long time ago when I first became to know the poetry of John Donne.

The story is well done and a good depiction of the life of Southerners during the Civil War, particularly of women on the home front. As another reviewer said, I wish the author had finished off some of the story lines. For example, he does not take the Brannons to Texas. He does not tell what happens to the former slave, Roman, who is the central character in the first chapter of the book. As an animal lover, I would love to know what happens to the grey stallion.However, in my estimation, Lloyd James, the narrator of the audio version made the book. I listen to a lot of audio books and James has now risen to the top of my list of narrators. His ability to change his voice and the wide variety of voices that he uses is amazing. But for James, I would certainly have lost interest in this book.It's well worth the listen."},{"Title":"Appomattox (The Civil War Battle Series, Book 10)","review":"APPOMATTOX, the 10th and final volume in James Reasoner's THE CIVIL WAR BATTLE SERIES, certainly lives up to the preceding nine volumes. The ending of the Civil War, and the conclusion of the Brannon family saga during the conflict, is once again well-researched, and tautly written.Mr. Reasoner gives us characters we can relate to and care about, from the Brannon family, to Cory Brannon's wife Lucille, to Pie Jones and his wife Rachel, to Roman, Will Brannon's now freed slave, to the fearless men of the Texas Rangers, and even many of the minor characters. The reader can't help but becoming deeply involved with the lives of the characters. And, as always, the battle scenes are fraught with tension.I only wish the author had taken the book one step further, and had the Brannons reach their final destination, rather than still searching for their new future. However, this is a minor point, and certainly detracts little, if at all, from a riveting series.APPOMATTOX, as are all the books in THE CIVIL WAR BATTLE SERIES, is must reading for any fan of excellent historical fiction, and also highly recommended for Civil War buffs."},{"Title":"Appomattox (The Civil War Battle Series, Book 10)","review":"Shenandoah: The Civil War Battle Series, Book 8For Civil War buffs, lovers of the southern culture or just wanting a good book to read this series is it.

James Reasoner is an excellent author and I hope to find more books by him. Thanks Mr. Reasoner for a wonderful adventure."},{"Title":"Appomattox (The Civil War Battle Series, Book 10)","review":"For the first several volumes in The Civil War Battle Series the great irony in James Reasoner's books was that the particular battle that served as the title was usually covered in a relatively few pages at the end of the book. More than the strategy and tactics of a particular battle, however, the narrative was more caught up with the interpersonal problems of the Bannon family of Culpeper County, Virginia, so that many of us thought the series should be called The Civil War Soap Opera Series. I knew how the war was going to turn out, my biggest concerns was Duncan Ebersole getting his comeuppance and with how many of the Brannons would still be alive at the end of the tenth and final book. The latter concern actually last longer because it was not until the end of the ninth volume, &quot;Savannah,&quot; that Will Brannon became the first of the five Bannon brothers to get killed in the war.One of the reasons that the Bannons lasted so long was that they were essential to the far flung nature of Reasoner's narrative. Originally this was just Will and Mac in the Eastern Theater of the war, with the Stonewall Brigade and the Confederate cavalry at Manassas, Antietam, Chacnelllorsville and such while Cory represented the Western Theater from Shiloh to Vicksburg. Even once Henry and Titus got involved in the war, leaving Coredlia home on the farm with ma, they were busy covering other aspects of the war. Now, all the chickens come home to roost in the final book. Of course, Appomattox is really not a Civil War battle per se, not compared to Gettysburg and Chicamauga, but the site of Lee's surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia to Grant. This means that Reasoner has to cover a lot once he begins &quot;Appomattox&quot; with Mac and Roman burying Will.Mac is still with Fitzhugh Lee's Confederate cavalry while Titus is not a member of Mosby's Rangers engaged in guerrilla warfare in the Shenandoah Valley. By the end of the book Mac is involved with the defense of Petersburg and Titus is actually involved with a desperate plot to save the Confederacy that allow Reasoner to make him a part of American history. Meanwhile Cory is now part of the retreating Rebel army facing Sherman in the Carolinas and Henry is riding with Nathan Bedford Forrest in Alabama. Back at the farm Cordelia is still being courted by a Yankee lieutenant while Nathan Hatcher is serving with the Union army in the Dakota Territory and Cory's wife Lucille is heading to Texas to meet up with Pie and Rachel while waiting for the war to end so Cory can join her. Throw into the mix what happens to Roman and this novel moves at a faster pace than any of the rest. It often seems like Reasoner is bouncing around from character to character, making sure he is touching all his narrative bases. By the end of this book characters in different parts of the war are showing up in the same chapter, which was not what was happening before.In winding down the war the soap opera elements are about as reduced as the health and fitness of the Confederate army. There was really only one significant element left and it unexpected just sort of ends, so Reasoner is able to keep the focus on the reactions of the Brannons to the drawing end of the war. Capturing the reactions of the surviving Brannon brothers to what is happening is the strongest part of this book, even if he is forced to rush through the final months of the drawn out war. Still, it is hard not to be struck by how odd at the quick pace of this final book at the end of a ten volume series. If you go by the number of reviews written about each volume in The Civil War Battle Series it would seem there have been some massive desertions along the way, but overall the series holds up well and even if a couple of the Bannons become officers (a helpful way of having them in the right place with the right people at the right time) you do get a sense of what it was like for the ordinary soldiers of the Civil War."},{"Title":"Meet me at Midnight","review":"In 1816 England, Viscount Raphael Giscard insists true love is a euphemism for lust and insists he can prove it. His friends bet that he can not. They agree that Julia Brodie is to be the test specimen since she is deeply in love with Sir Simon Blake, who obviously returns her feelings. Raphael is to end that relationship by getting Julia to fall madly in love with him. Thus, he would be her lust object of the moment.Raphael begins his campaign to win the heart and body of Julia. As he succeeds in his quest, he soon finds himself doing the unthinkable by falling in love with his target. However, once Julia learns the truth about his original intentions, will she believe his insistence that he loves her?MEET ME AT MIDNIGHT is an enjoyable Regency romance that proves how talented Jacqueline Navin is as the tale never slows down even though it is character driven. The story line is fun due to the strong cast including the secondary players. With dry humor to counter balance the serious tone of the relationships, sub-genre fans will appreciate this timeless tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Meet me at Midnight","review":"I feel compelled to share my enthusiasm for this book since...

He wagers his scandalous friends that he can come between a couple who is obviously in love. He sets his sights on seducing Julia Brodie, a banker's daughter who is about to be betrothed to her beloved Simon.Raphael does not expect to be moved by Julia. But she affects in in a way that no woman ever has. She is compassionate, intelligent, and witty, and she almost makes him regret having become a hardened rake. Things go awry when the wager becomes public knowledge, and Raphael must marry Julia after seducing her.Raphael and Julia come to a truce of sorts in their marriage, but all is destroyed when Julia discovers the wager. In an ensuing duel with Simon, Raphael is severely injured, and he and Julia become further estranged. Raphael treats Julia horribly forcing her to part from him for a time. He must then come to terms with his past and discover the meaning of enduring love in order to win Julia back.Jacqueline Nevin's writing is reminiscent of Judith McNaught. The emotions between the hero and heroine are so real, so intense, that the reader can't put the book down until the conflict is really and truly resolved on or about the last page.

She has a great talent for drawing you into the story, and I was not in the least bored like I have been so frequently as of late. if you like historical romance, give this one a try, although then you will be upset she doesn't have many titles to her name."},{"Title":"Meet me at Midnight","review":"This is a great book, very well written characters, particularly a strong heroine. I have already re-read it 3 times in the two months I have owned it. The story itself is extremely well written and believable. The conflict and plot instead of seeming trite and overdone are fresh and exciting. I have never read Ms. Navins before but I can hardly wait for her next book!"},{"Title":"Meet me at Midnight","review":"A rake, a rogue - one of the \\"Bane of the Ton.\\" Can heartless Raphael sway Julia away from her handsome caring fianc&eacute;e? Sensible, perfect Julia - can she abandon all she was taught and fight convention?This wonderful tale paints a complete picture of a tortured man and the woman who fights to make him whole. Of course he fights her the entire time. Julia hopes to gain her freedom after a stunning betrayal involving an untimely wager and some \\"not so nice\\" friends. Raphael's tormented upbringing really makes you understand him. Not that you forgive him at first, but you can understand where he comes from.I had to force myself to put the book down and get some sleep. If I had turned two more pages, I would have been up all night. It has been a long time since I read a book that captured me from start to finish. The people, the love scenes, the settings are so well written-I truly was swept away.Do not miss reading this!!"},{"Title":"Meet me at Midnight","review":"This is one of my favorite novels. It has all the ingredients for a scrumptious treat; a sweet heroine, a reformed rake, sexual tension and wonderful plotting and dialogue.Julia is close to being engaged to Simon. She is totally unaware that Rafael has wagered with his dissolute friends that he can turn Julia's affections from Simon to him. He wants to prove to his cronies in the ton that even though Julia says she loves Simon, true love does not exist.Rafael is a master at the game. He is a known rake and actually uses his own reputation to endear himself to Julia. He recognizes that women love to reform men, and acts like a man that could be reformed if he had Julia in his life.Julia is indeed intrigued with him and before she knows it, totally infatuated with Rafael. He is charming yet vulnerable. When Julia calls off her wedding because she recognizes she does not love Simon, she knows she has done the right thing in her heart. She has fallen hopelessly in love with Rafael. She does not delude herself, however she knows Rafael is a rake and will probably never have a long term relationship with her.For his part, Rafael is pleased with his progress and wants Julia fiercely. She has become more than a wager but he is not sure how important she is to him. The specter of the wager being exposed to Julia is always a fear.Just when Rafael thinks he is in the clear he is exposed and his life changes quite dramatically. Julia transforms too and the last third of the book reveals the depth of their feelings.The sexual tension in this novel sizzles. Rafael's innermost thoughts are well described, probably better than Julia's. He is a man rejected by his father and his insecurities are evident when he has any dealings with the man. Rafael is very complex. Julia's personality is more straightforward; she is a good girl trying to make an advantageous good match for not only herself but also to benefit her family but she longs for more than the safe route. Fortunately Rafael shows her a better path."},{"Title":"Meet me at Midnight","review":"The basic premise is this:Raphael, a Marquee who had a terrible father who treated him as if he were ...(no one ever knows for sure), is so bored with life that he and his cronies decide to prove love doesn't exist by breaking up the season's pair of lovebirds, Simon and Julia.My problems with Julia: Well, she doesn't have the backbone to tell her mother what color dress to wear but decides to sneak out to sleep with Raphael? I don't buy that at all.Further problems with Julia...how could she forgive Raphael? He treats her like DIRT...I mean, it's awful. He's a jerk and still, she just goes on being the loving wife. He shuts her out of his life over and over again and still, she acts as if he's so wonderful and pines away for him.Raphael is just the worst kind of man....when he finally realizes how he's treated Julia, he reverts back to his actions when he was deceiving her to \\"prove\\" he's changed. To me, that just shows he has no imagination where romance is concerned. The actions, such as the white rose in her seat, when he was trying to seduce her for the wager's sake, are the same things he does when he tries to reconcile.And his friends...Ugh, don't even get me started. The only redeemable one is Martindale. The rest are practically rapists. Ugh. In particular, the fiend that Raphael assigns to Laura, Julia's sister. He nearly rapes her in his carriage!This book really made me sick."},{"Title":"Meet me at Midnight","review":"I just got done reading this book and I loved it. It was hard to put down, I couldn't wait to see what happened between Julia and Raphael. There were never any boring parts and it kept me interested all the way through. The ending was so sweet and romantic. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Meet me at Midnight","review":"This might be the worst \\"romance novel\\" that I've ever read. It made me sick to my stomach....I finished it..barely.The premise was this....an emotionally abused man makes a bet with a bunch of his friends that \\"love\\" does not exist and goes about proving it by \\"breaking up\\" an unsuspecting \\"in-love\\" couple. It could've been good...but believe me...it wasn't.I hated Raphael. I know that's strong language, but it is the only feeling strong enough to illustrate my point. I know that he suffered in the hands of his parents, but I NEVER empathized with him enough to condone his behavior and actions towards Julia. He was selfish, mean-spirited, and utterly evil in his pursuit of Julia (whom I really liked). Maybe Simon, Julia's fiancee, wasn't right for Julia, but he would've been kinder and \\"better\\" for her than Raphael ever was.I'm sad for Julia. She was lured away from Simon on a bet and never, in my opinion, got ANYTHING in return but an insensitive, uncaring, jerk of a husband. Even his supposed \\"reformation\\" seemed unbelievable, and by that time, frankly it was just to late. I'd have kissed him goodbye, just like I recommend you do to this book."},{"Title":"Meet me at Midnight","review":"It's true, this book has a loathsome hero but if you can hang in there long enough, the book provides satisfying twists and a rewarding conclusion."},{"Title":"Art nouveau garden","review":"This book of art nouveau applique patterns is very nice, and the patterns are beautiful.

On this simple basis, John Cunliffe has constructed a series of books that will surely appeal to all children who are old enough to understand a simple story, especially those who are just beginning to read for themselves. Both my children have loved Postman Pat from age about two and a half, and my nephew enjoyed him until about the age of 10. The text is well complemented by colourful pictures. This addition to the series fully matches the standards of earlier books."},{"Title":"String too short to be saved","review":"Donald Hall is a writer beautifully tangent to and cognizant of the New England spine we all wish to immulate in our thoughts of the 'old American spirit', a spirit too seemingly on the wane at present -even on 4th of July celebrations this year. His most recent collection of short stories , WILLOW TEMPLE , was my introduction to this Whitmanesque, Robert Frost-like wonder boy of observation. In returning to his early work in the Nonpariel Books reissue of STRING TOO SHORT TO BE SAVED one wonders why he has remained in the background, and hasn't found the wide audience he deserves.&quot;STRING...&quot; is a series of short stories of Hall's recollections of spending his summers with his beloved grandparents in New Hampshire. All phases of farming and maturing from a small child to a young adult are addressed in a wholly readable, poetic, illuminating fashion. Hall knows how to describe nature as well as anyone writing today. He also revives an appreciation for his roots that we could all study as journeys toward finding ourselves. &quot;To be without history is to be forgotten&quot; he writes.&quot;My grandfather did not know the maiden names of either of his grandmothers. I thought that to be forgotten must be the worst fate of all.&quot; Hall invites us to accompany him on his memories of haying, picking blueberries, visiting the odd group of people who have become indelible American daguerreotypes for him. &quot;The farm was a form: not a set of rules on the wall, but like the symmetry of winter and summer, or like the balance of day and night over the year, June against December. My grandfather lived by the form all his life, and my summers on the farm were my glimpse of it.&quot;Simple gifts, these. And the simplicity of Donald Hall's writing is what makes it so readable and so memorable. The book stands solidly on its own as a definitive New England memoir. In this new reissue there is an added Epilog which traces Hall's return to his Hew Hapshire memories and farm after many life changes. This Epilogue is worth the price of the book. If only this edition weren't tainted by the crudely inappropriate pen and ink pictures imposed on the pages of each new chapter. But that is the only unnecessary clutter in this otherwise tender book."},{"Title":"String too short to be saved","review":"If you claim to like poetry or writing where the ink squiggles can actually allow you the experience of feeling the grist and sand of a place between your toes...take out any work by Donald Hall and you'll feel the tide of the New England coast coming in over your feet...Often mislabled with the churl quip, \\"regional writer\\", Mr. Hall is much more....a master of making you feel you are where he wants totake you...His characters come with the authenticity of having either been known, met, or viewed by Hall, or conjured from his collective memories and boiled down like a fine cider from actual sips of experience he's had with like individuals in his native New England......And what individuals he finds and has found in the ernest incredibly delicious confines and environs of the North East...In \\"String Too Short\\", Hall takes on the not inconsiderable task of fleshing out the rich hues of his own New England ancestory..You can smell his grandmother's kitchen, taste the dusty hay from his grandfather's barn, and feel the New Hampshire sun on your face via his entrancing and detailed prose...Mr. Hall? Are you out there? As a one time correspondent known to him as \\"John-Tom\\" I hope all is well with the venerable \\"Don\\" of Eagle Pond...Mr. Hall has taken himself off the pony express of fans he has deservedly developed over the years...and as one who has come across his work and spent pleasant minutes and hours in fine examples of his work, recommended to other readers here such as \\" Their Bright And Shining Eyes\\", \\" Without\\", \\" Here At Eagle Pond\\", and lately, \\" The Painted Bed\\", Mr. Hall has well earned praise and a rest in the bright sun of poetry and masterful observations on life around us he has picked up through his well lived adventures and travel...ALL OF HIS WORK..highly recommended!"},{"Title":"String too short to be saved","review":"A very poetic and wise account of a fading world that the author was lucky enough to be a part of. Quite moving in places, funny in others. A very satisfying book."},{"Title":"String too short to be saved","review":"Donald Hall first published this collection of short stories, set in the rural area of central New Hampshire, in 1960. Most of the stories reflect his summer-time experiences with his grandparents, on their farm, during the \`40's. There is a Marcel Proust \\"Remembrance of Things Past,\\" quality to Hall's reminisces of his youth, and the joys he experienced with his grandparents, just as Proust did, in a rural corner of his native France. A portion of that joy was the heritage that his grandparent's conveyed to him, going all the way back to his great-great grandfather who had participated in the Battle at Vicksburg. And the wonderful title, one that beautifully conveys the frugality of farmers who performed their life's work in a less than optimum environment for raising crops or livestock. It was derived from the label on a small box Hall found in the attic, after his grandparents were deceased, filled, as you might now guess, with small pieces of string.But Hall is not uncritically nostalgic for a paradise lost. One of his more biting reflections is conveyed in the story \\"A Hundred Thousand Straightened Nails.\\" The story concerns Washington Woodward, the character who would retrieve nails from timber, and attempt to straighten them, so that they could be reused. At the beginning of the story Hall describes such people as: \\"So many of them lived a half-life, a life of casual waste.\\" Hall's conclusion at the end of the story: \\"He has saved nails, but wasted life.\\"...\\"... and his straightened nails had rusted into the dirt of Ragged Mountain.\\"But the preponderant aspect of his stories is nostalgic warmth, and for me, and possibly for the potential reader, the stories that may forever linger are the ones concerning a summer haying, or the picking of blueberries high on Ragged Mountain, with the attendant concerns about his grandfather's health; for his grandfather was \\"pushing\\" it to the limit. In \\"Luther, Nannie, and the Callers,\\" Hall recalls the era before TV, when \\"The late light of the evenings of early summer invited people to ride in their automobiles, and they gave themselves reasons by paying visits.\\" And, \\"He was older than my grandfather, and I remember him snatching flies out of the air with his fast hands when he was more than eighty.\\"Overall, Hall recounts the past that is not dead, and he says: \\"To be without a history is like being forgotten. My grandfather did not know the maiden names of either of his grandmothers. I thought that to be forgotten must be the worst fate of all,\\" which was a passage that moved another reviewer. As he said in \\"Old Home,\\": \\"... but for many years I had daydreamed of a self-sufficient life in the country.\\" Fortuitously, his daydreams never took the nightmare form that eventually consumed Hester in the same story.The curious aspect of these stories is that his parents are almost completely missing, both in relationship to their parents, as well as to the author.In the epilogue, Hall says that: \\"...I made that familiar confusion of personal loss with social decay; in the death of one man I saw the death of his people and his landscape.\\" Yet life came full circle, and he decided that this particular piece of rural landscape in central New Hampshire, with its views of Mount Kearsarge, would be his final resting place. Departures, yet continuity. A solid, 5-star read of life, as it once was, in rural New England."},{"Title":"String too short to be saved","review":"I loved every bit of this book; the descriptive writing of Donald Hall took me to another world and my only complaint is that it was too short. This book is memories of Donald growing up and spending weekends on his grandfather's farm and his experiences haying, blueberry picking and the people he spent time with. From my own farm experiences, I feel his descriptions are very true, especially haying. I read this book afterLife Workwhich is auto-biographical, and they were terrific to read one right after the other. Next I just receivedEagle Pond.

Happy reading."},{"Title":"String too short to be saved","review":"This book sat neglected on the table in the workroom at my school with a \\"free to good home\\" tag for several weeks. Finally I took it home and gave it a chance and I sure am glad I did. A great collection of short stories/essays all tied together into a cohesive memoir. I really enjoy history and agriculture and this book was one of the better ones of the type I have read. I know it is based on the author's recollections of his youth, but the characters and descriptions were so vivid and each chapter created a wonderful vision in my mind as though I had been there too. The chapter on haying with his grandfather and hired man should be required reading for every 12 year old in the country as it described perfectly the activity that almost all youth would have participated in 100 years ago, but hardly anyone does by hand now. Good for anyone who enjoys American history, rural life, or just simply a well written memoir."},{"Title":"String too short to be saved","review":"I purchased this book for a class. If not for the class, I don't think I would have ever read the book. It did bring back some memories of growing up on a farm in Minnesota and of time spent with my own Grandparents.

The term \\"fairy stories\\" is something of a misnomer, however, as no true fairies appear or even make cameos. Instead, these stories tend to take something from nature (e.g. The Ugly Caterpillar) or something from tradition (e.g. The Discontented King) and spin these people, animals or objects into a nice anecdote to read with your little ones. And the illustrations are gorgeous!Highly recommended if you like vintage kids books and stories."},{"Title":"My very own fairy stories","review":"\\"The Rubbery Dubbery Smiles\\" was my favorite childhood story.

Schlosser cites many examples and gives anecdotes regarding the three issues the book covers, namely marijuana, migrant labor, and pornography. To say, however, that the book covers these things, is a falsehood. It is merely a skimming of the facts, void of emotion and opinion, and this makes the book very hard to follow. True enough, it would be great for a paper or report because of its factualness, but for everyday reading, it sure didn't do much for me.Holding the three separate essays together is the underlying theme that Americans have a private integrity which is not consistent with their public integrity, and this is very true. Without this point, I don't know that the book's three tiers would be able to connect. The first two, marijuana and migrant labor, easily flow together because of their agricultural base. In addition, they have a strong documentation base because of the laws around them and Schlosser goes into some interesting details about the process of manufacturing the products. The third aspect of the book is weak because it's not illegal (now, at least), though the fact that it is probably considered \\"underground\\" makes it interesting, and who doesn't love reading about porn, right?I suppose Schlosser should receive a big \\"E\\" for effort. Attempting to tackle three large subjects is honorable, but he perhaps should've been less ambitious and more interested in thoroughly researching one topic. Would've been easier to write three books that way."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"fantastic...if you liked fast food nation, and have thoughts about our society...then this is for you. a true eye opener..."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Disappointing. When I first bought this book, I thought it was going to be on the underground market/economy. I found out that it was not the only subject covered. Since this book covers more than one subject, each subject is only superficially covered. Fast Food Nation is much more deeply researched and is definitly a must have &quot;Bible&quot; on the subject matter. Reefer Madness is a book to forget quickly. Don't waste your money on it and let's hope that Schlosser's next book will be better."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"A must read for every legislator in the country.Should also be required reading for highschool seniors so that they know the real truth about America's backward policys."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Eric Schlosser's Reefer Madness gave a great insight into the marijuana world. I did enjoy reading this book and extending my knowledge, however all it was was factual. Maybe if i was doing a report on this subject this would of been a good book to obtain information, but i do like some opinion and emotion in a book that i am reading."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"I give Reefer Madness one star not because it is unreadable or devoid of information, but rather because it is dishonest and utterly pointless. If Fast Food Nation was Schlosser's platinum record, this is his lousy follow-up EP.Each essay is, individually, a decent (if thin) treatment of its respective subject matter. But Schlosser does not make even the faintest attempt to give each issue its due -- these are MAJOR public policy issues, not cocktail party tidbits -- and even his afterword fails to explain exactly why they're appearing in the same book together. Presumably the common theme is the underground economy, but he does not describe any real similiarities other than the banal observation that drugs, servitude, and porn are illegal (or not, in the case of porn) and profitable for certain people. And he does not even attempt to create an overall portrait of the \\"underground economy;\\" at best, he offers small glimpses into it.Finally, each of these issues is of vital importance, and giving them slapdash treatment does no justice to their gravity. Reefer Madness is nothing more than the scraps of other books that Schlosser was too lazy to write."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Wow, what an excellent and well-written book.

What's even more interesting is that as people opt out of paying-- they still expect benefits from the system, e.g. health care, subsidized college tuition, retirement monthly checks. Alot of people, from off the books housekeepers to electricians, may be disappointed that being off the books has a long term price, but that may not matter if they somehow marry or live with someone else who has benefits available.

There were no pages missing and everything was caefully intacted."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"The book contains three essays by Eric Schlosser. As with Fast Food Nation, the research is fascinating, fast paced and interesting. Eric also manages to present his research in a balanced fashion, although the predominately liberal democratic bias is apparent. The articles as a whole treat with the \\"underworld economy\\", the economy of businesses that exist on the fringe of legality. A brief summary of the main articles follows. Skip if you want to read the book with bias.The first article, \\"reefer madness\\", is a diatribe against the current war on drugs as it pertains to marijuana. Through adroit presentation of the personal element and history with interspersed statistics Eric Schlosser convincingly portrays the war on marijuana as detrimental to the American society. There is no convincing evidence of the harmful effects of marijuana when used moderately. There are currently more than 700,000 Americans overburdening the prison system with more than one year for marijuana offenses. More than half of these prisoners have never been convicted of a previous felony. Marijuana has some possible medical use. Marijuana can be grown cheaply. The plant, Hemp, has many possible uses in paper, textiles etc. Finally, the war on marijuana has produced inequities within the legal system, with some first time criminals serving life sentences (more than most murderers) for simply the transportation of large quantities of marijuana.The second article, \\"In the Strawberry Fields\\", is an expose of the current use of illegal immigrants from Mexico as cheap labor in the strawberry fields of California. Again a balanced account with a clear bias towards ending the abuse of the migrant workers. The account is reminiscent of many passages in Fast Food Nation that deal with the treatment of workers in the meat packing industry. The most striking abuse is the lack of adequate housing for the immigrants, which is largely a result of the property value of suburbs stretching from Californian cities (slums for migrant workers drive down the property value of the adjacent developing suburbia). The most striking counterargument was the admission that many of these migrant workers are earning money for their impoverished families back home. On the whole, it does seem like a system that needs reform, especially as concerns housing, citizenship, and the harshness of the border.The third article, \\"An empire of the Obscene\\", is an examination of the economics of the pornography industry. It is a largely historical essay covering in depth the time period from about 1960-1990. There is a brief look at what came before (the Victorian gentlemen editions of porn, the stag films of the 20s-50s shown to white men clubs) with a glance at the 90s and the changing of the industry (the lax enforcement of obscenity law under Clinton, the rise of the internet - will magazines survive? or for that matter with the proliferation of free porn and amateur websites, will profit continue?). The main focus was on Reuben Sturman, the \\"Walt Disney\\" of porn, whose multimillion dollar porn empire was eventually broken by the IRS (Sturman laundered most of the money he made). He had survived all obscenity cases! One of the most interesting facts was the depiction of the porn business in relation to strip clubs. Porn stars can make 20,000 for an appearance at a strip club, which has led to a kind of \\"porn certification\\" of strippers. (The better your porn resume, the more you can make as a featured stripper!) Philip Harvey of Adam and Eve from Hillsborough, NC, also received an interesting 5 page report."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Eric Schlosser is one of today's great journalists. He does incredible research, writes beautifully, and includes tons of entertaining details without distracting from the heart of his important topics. I found this book both thought-provoking and entertaining. Certainly the recent legalizing of medical marijuana in several states shows that we've gradually moved towards his recommendations in the first chapter, but the second chapter, on the exploitation of migrant laborers by our economic system, is still just as relevant today. The third chapter, on the history and economy of the porn industry, is perhaps less troubling than the first two, but it's very entertaining reading anyway!"},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Reefer Madness is an excellent read. This book should be required reading for every politician in America. Perhaps then we can collectively pull our heads out of our rear ends and begin to make and enforce realistic laws concerning marijuana, migrant workers, and porn.

Upon finishing the book I found myself enraged and disillusioned with the workings of our government."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Reefer Madness is broken up into a 3 sections, each on a main topic (see title) with sub chapters. I loved it because of the way the information was presented. It flowed very well and was rather informative.

The book came in very good condition like the description says. The price was worth my money for a hardcover book. Great service. Definitely looking forward to ordering from them again."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Reefer MadnessThis book examines the illegal drug trade (of course as opposed to by the legal drug trade), the adult entertainment business and illegal immigrants (which technically is not a trade but it is the selling and buying of labor itself).This book along with Phillip K Howard's The Death of Common Sense create a interesting portrait of modern libertarian thought.Anything that serves itself as a business will exist. When said items or practices become illegal it actually can increase the aggregate demand.Here is a bit about the drug trade.Think about it this way. What if there is a major drug bust and drugs get off the street. Ok now since the amount of users stay the same the amount people are willing to pay now increases. What does this attract? More dealers because they can make more. If users are arrested then the price can go down but then that might attract those that normally would not be able to afford the drug. Either way there will always be a supply and demand as long as there are buyers and sellers. Sending people to jail over drugs instead of rehab is poor public policy. If there are violent acts performed while under the influence that is one thing but to suggest mere addiction warrants incarceration. Incarceration itself pretty much ends someones economic future. You receive free food, water, shelter, clothing etc and any job skills you had have softened during the duration. In addition a criminal record prevents someone from obtaining a legal firearms license so one can argue that the war on drugs actually disarms people.In looking at illegal aliens it gets interesting. First they cannot be called illegal immigrants because immigration is legal. Logically that would be akin to saying \\"legal murderers\\". It is interesting to point out that within the Americas there has always been a source of cheap labor. From its discovery in 1492 there was slavery although one can argue that chain gangs during reconstruction invoked the 13th amendment but it was not officially called slavery - that was involuntary servitude. Any feminist will correctly state that women did the back bone of most household labor only to be outsourced with automation by the 20th century and children were usually used for factory work up until the early 1930's. If there is demand for a given product but it cannot be found legally then it will be found illegally. He also makes a good note that the pseudo halfway attempts with visas are not viable. Many nations these days are a mix of right of soil or right of blood. To assume that those on long term visas will not get married or not have children is a bit thin. It is one thing to be treated by an employer as an employee, this is natural. But to be treated by a nation state as an employee is not a real citizenship. The country should encourage those that have higher degrees in staying..say allocating green cards for those that come here and earn a Ph.d.On a separate note I have been to China and I have seen a plethora of pirated software. Of course they want more western software but if they cannot afford it what is the recourse? There are no big established brands so far in China that have the same reputation of western ones (BYD is NOT BMW that's for sure :-))In examining the adult entertainment business it always brings up what exactly is obscene. In examining Amsterdam he notes that when much of the industry was legalized there was an explosion in growth and use. But it tapered off with natives. If anyone goes there now the head shops and prostitution dens are largely used by foreigners/tourists. On a same note we do not see say muslims from the middle east arriving in the USA only to do keg stands and visiting strip clubs the second they land the plane! Making some illegally simply creates pent up demand that is gradually released when it becomes legal.Naturally any law is only as good as its enforcement. However, the idea that the war on drugs can be won is laughable at best. As the late great Bill Hicks said \\"How can God have made a mistake\\"? Most drugs come from plants or come from a given industry that sought to use it for experiments(insert psychology here). Despite the best efforts of the state of Arizona illegals will still come into the area (the law is not racist but potentially sexist). The best way to deter illegals is to simply stop giving them services and to raise any regressive taxes (fuel, food, sin taxes etc) as they probably will not attempt to pay income taxes as that would create identification fraud which would be another criminal charge. It is also interesting to see the reactions to the industries. Ceasar Chavez organized farm workers which lead to large agricultural companies to upgrade their equipment to be more efficient. This lead to illegal aliens going further northward as their work was largely gone.In terms of legalization I believe it was John Stossel that stated we do not see the head of Coors getting into a fight with the head of Budwizer. If something goes from being illegal to legal and regulated much of the illicit activity around it will dissipate.When the economy hits a rough patch local and state governments are much more likely to legalize given activities. Gambling has been debates in many states but it is only mentioned here slightly. This is a very good book and hopefully in the future the author will write a updated version given the change in the overall economy."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"I read fast food nation by Eric schlosser and LOVED it! I'm not done with reefer maddness. But so far so good. I love the how informative his books are. While also being entertaining. A+"},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Reefer Madness is divided into three sections. One about American law enforcement policy pertaining to Marijuana, mainly concentrating on the ridiculous sentences that are doled out for a \\"drug\\" that is less harmful than what your Doctor prescribes. The second section he talks about exploitation of illegal Mexicans by California agribusiness in the strawberry fields. He treads politically correct waters in that part of the book but the exploitation and wretched working condtions can't be denied. The last section mainly focuses on the rise and fall of porn kingpin Ruben Sturman, who ended up dying in prison for tax evasion. This book isn't nearly as good as Schlossers Fast Food Nation but its worth reading if any of the subject matter interests you."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Everyone here seems to be commenting on what a great writer Schlosser is and I couldn't agree more. For a non-fiction book to be such a page turner is quite a rarity. This is a lucid, well-researched, and rational look into &quot;taboo&quot; subjects people tend to have extremely strong opinions on. Reefer Madness strips the subjects of their stereotypes: the pothead, the illegal mexican stealing American jobs, the sleazy porn industry and looks into why these things are so loathed in public and yet remain so relentlessly prolific and lucrative. I found the segment on porn some of the most engrossing....growing up mostly in the internet age it's hard for me to imagine supreme court cases and federal investigations into what is basically considered tame by modern standards (and probably available for sale at your nearest mall). But it was the research on marijuana &quot;madness&quot; that fascinated/perplexed me the most. When we look at other countries which have legalized the possession or sale of drugs and see that they have not collapsed in some doomsday scenario...... When we consider how many criminals we've created/locked up simply for possessing a joint.......it simply defies logic. By reading this book I hope we will all finally be able to base our opinions on facts and reason and not propaganda and unfounded fear, opening the way for a genuine dialouge."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"i was very interested in this book after reading Fast Food Nation, however the subject matter covered in this book was far too broad. Each of the three subjects covered here could have been separate ( and quite interesting) books. Instead, each of the subjects get a maximum of 100 pages and a minimum of 50 pages. The book was a quick 2 day read, but it left me wanting more in depth information."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Some critics have mentioned here and elsewhere their difficulty of finding the connecting thread of the three articles that make up this book. Reefer Madness is an entirely different animal than Fast Food Nation, which I think gained a large part of its appeal because it explored the impact of a single industry so thoroughly. The argument in this book is looser but I think no less compelling. It builds upon one of the central ideas of Fast Food Nation, where Mr. Schlosser shows how companies who claimed to support free market values are actually benefitting from a whole host of government subsidies such as SBA loans for franchises, or federal tax credits for worker training where no real training is provided. Here he shows through separate stories how some of the legislators who are the staunchest advocates of the \\"free market\\" also want to create or uphold punitive laws that punish people inordinately for marijuana possession and pornography, while these same people seem to have no qualms about letting industry folks exploit the cheap labor of Mexican immigrants to pick strawberries. One of the most telling sections describes congressmen who pushed for punitive drug laws but then later did everything they could to get their sons off when they were convicted. What Schlosser does so effectively here is show that the \\"free market\\" proponents do intervene in the marketplace all the time on behalf of their own interests, while often ignoring the plight of those less immediate to them. As a cohesive argument, this is a more difficult book to wrap your head around than FFN, but it demonstrates the same compassion and clarity and fact-based reporting that marked the other book, and it is a voice desperately needed in a time when dissent against the political right is often more angry than cogently reasoned. The book offers us a vision of another America we could be, where our private morality is consistent with our public one."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Reefer Madness is divided into three chapters. The first is about marijuana, the second is about cheap labor with illegal immigrants and the third is on [....]. The author writes this book based on the United States \\"black market\\". He gives somewhat of a biography on these 3 topics, which I feel is helpful for those, like myself, who are not aware of their history.The first chapter is focused on marijuana. Schlosser provides interviews with many people who have had encounters with marijuana. Living in California, I have found it amazing to hear the penalties for marijuana use in other states. In chapter one for example, a man was arrested for possesion of 1.6 grams of marijuana, enough for a large joint. Living in Michigan, he received 14 months in jail. The second section is focused on cheap labor, or illegal immigrants in Guadalupe, California. Schlosser focuses on harvesting strawberries:the difficulty of it and hard labor that is being underpaid. The third and final section was the longest of the three. It focused on an underground [...] king Reuben Sturman.I very muched enjoyed reading this book. If you liked Fast Food Nation, than Reefer Madness is a must read."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Eric has done it again. I read his last book Fast Food Nation, and was impressed with his depth and skill at writing. This book was even better.Eric sets up the book with a discussion on the U.S. Drug war on Marijuana. He unpacks several cases where the government has spent millions of dollars to stop something that has never proven to be lethal or dangerous to ones health. Then, he steps into the world of the migrant worker, especially those in the strawberry fields of California. Eric raises the question: Why does the government do so little for these people who are being used and abused for their cheap labor? Schlosser ends with a discussion on the pornography industry. He again refers to how the government spends billions of dollars attempting to limit something that is a freedom this country was fought to defend.I am an evangelical pastor with a conservative, republican upbringing. This book raises major questions for some of the verbal stances I take against things such as Marijuana and pornography - which I believe are both wrong - and do and say nothing about the plight of the migrant workers and the injustice they receive every day. I don't see the justification of spending so much money trying to eliminate products of capitalism and a free nation. Even though I think that getting high and the obscene are horrible for ones life...so are cigarettes, eating too much fast food, being lazy - but those are choices that individuals have to make, not be forced upon by a large government. Especially when women and children cannot eat because the same government will not protect the rights of these workers.As you can see this book grabbed me. It will grab and challenge you to!"},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Schlosser, the author of the recently famous Fast Food Nation, follows up with another, though less than stellar, piece of social commentary. This time, however, he splices this shorter book into three different, partially related topics. One is about marijuana, the other is about migrant farm workers, and the last part is about the porn industry.All three sections explain the history, the social injustices, and the current state of those particular topics. With three different section, Schlosser fails to go in depth into some of the major issues. While not a flaw in itself, sometimes the information could have been more statistical or insightful.The first section is the best. He describes the continuing and perhaps fruitless effort of America's political system to stop the spread of weed. Though mostly anecdotal, he does open eyes to the unequal and baffling judicial and legislative steps to stop this so called problem.The second part of the book mainly concerns migrant strawberry workers from Mexico. Though informative, I think he fails to reveal why such a system continues to thrive. While describing their living conditions, there is little mention of the &#65533;Not in my Backyard&#65533; movement,, and no mention of California's proposition 13. When he discusses there working conditions, he fails to fully explain the proposed guest worker program, nor does he provide statistics that could shed some more light on the subject.The last part, about the porn industry, is terrible. While most of the book is dedicated to high level issues and concerns, he basis this story on a porn distributor's legal dilemma in painfully boring detail. It seems like Schlosser really was obsessed with someone who wasn't that interesting. Schlosser goes into agonizing details - like literally giving the life story of the guy who eventually examined the porn distributor's taxes.This book is a quick read, but this leaves the impression of quick book of unrelated information tied together in order to capitalize on the buzz of the author's previous book."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"\\"Reefer Madness\\" sets out to examine three areas of the underground economy: the marijuana trade, migrant workers, and pornography. The book's strengths lie in Schlosser's ability to combine interesting tidbits of information with compelling personal stories of people involved in one of the examined industries. Much like \\"Fast Food Nation\\" when Reefer Madness is at its best it will inform, anger, and fascinate you.That said, the book also has a number of problems. The most important is the lack of similarity between the three issues he examines. Simply put, while the lessons of the marijuana trade and pornography are quite similar, those of migrant workers are wholly different. The government's zealous ideological crusades against pot and pornography and its various reversals with regards to what is deemed legal or illegal make the cases for both quite similar. On the other hand, migrant workers, to my mind at least, are a much different issue. Instead of being on the demand end of the black market, they are on the supply end. The incongruence between Schlosser's three cases mean that the introductory and concluding chapters are muddled by focusing on the rights on individuals to do as they wish (in the cases of marijuana and pornography) and the human rights issues raised by migrant labor.The second issue dividing the essays is Schlosser's use of a protagonist to whom he regularly returns to highlight his points. This scheme is effectively employed in the first two essays (marijuana and migrants) but chapter on pornography comes closer to becoming a biography. In addition, the focus of the story moves from the nature of the black market to the tax evasion case brought by the IRS. This story is quite interesting and told in a compelling manner, but it adds little to his larger point about the government's obsessive crusade against porn.The final critique offered here is that Schlosser tends to downplay the negative human impact of pornography. While highlighting the horrendous conditions of migrant farmers in California, he fails to draw strong connections with the exploitative nature of the porn industry. In this area Schlosser should have been clearer about the benefits for those in the industry of bringing the porn industry into the mainstream.\\"Reefer Madness\\" may strike some as a throw-off book sandwiched between two larger projects. In many ways this may be true, but it does not diminish the quality of the essays. In particular, Schlosser's arguments focusing on mandatory minimums for drug offenses and the rise and fall of a porn king are simply fun to read. The book's engaging style and cogent arguments allow it to overcome its inconsistencies and lack of coherence."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Hot on the heels of his massive success with the superb &quot;Fast Food Nation,&quot; author Eric Schlosser has filled in the gap between it and his next project with &quot;Reefer Madness.&quot; The book purports to explore the American underground economy, and Schlosser's preface tries to link the book's three sections together using that theme, but it ultimately doesn't come together as a cohesive whole. The three individual topics (the criminalization of marijuana, the exploitation of migrant farmworkers and the rise of pornography as a major industry), however, are quite interesting.What's obvious is that Schlosser has reported on these subjects before and has merely updated them to be put into book form. The incidents he describes for the most part took place back in the 1990s, which makes them less than immediately topical. Nevertheless, like with &quot;Fast Food Nation,&quot; the author has some strong views and isn't shy about sharing them. Schlosser is a refreshing breath of fresh air as a journalist in that he refuses to buy into the conventional wisdom and asks the kind of questions that rarely get asked in other forums.Overall, &quot;Refer Madness&quot; is a good stopgap for people who enjoy Schlosser's style. It made me look forward to his next project, which will explore the American prison system."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"First off, I should say that I did somewhat enjoy the book. I don't align with a lot of Schlosser's ideas and his ideology. But I respect his journalistic approach (despite its blatant one-sidedness) and his ability to make readers think deeply about current issues.Still, these essays don't really belong together and the title is misleading. I feel that Schlosser really wasted 3 good ideas by condensing them into a single book. Maybe he can blame it on the free market. Much like politics, Schlosser makes his readers bundle purchase 3 stories and a spin of subjective commentary instead of giving separate objective stories.The book begins with a description of the underground economy and the black market in America, peppered with some careful derision of the free market system (somehow the political system escapes his analysis). I expected this to be the prominent theme throughout the book, but was sorely disappointed. In retrospect the introduction seems merely to serve as a launching point for an attack on government regulation or lack thereof.The book ended with a conclusion that tried to loosely connect all the ideas together with contradicting points. It only added to my overall disappointment. It is here that the author finally removes the faade of economic analysis and demonstrates that the theme is really social, not economic welfare. I wish I had skipped it entirely."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Not as good as Fast Food Nation, but still an eye-opener. I wish there had been more of a wide-range of information. As other viewers stated, his focus was too narrow, even within the three sections. The porn section, being longer, was more interesting. And, the book is full of startling facts and statistics. However, I would have appreciated more discussion/analysis to go along with it all."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"This is a powerful expose but it lacked the punch that Fast Food Nation had.Drugs, immigrants and the adult biz are issues covered but I wanted to read much more of each.This was like an appetizer, I wanted a full course meal.There are great stories along with facts but this seemed like only 50% of energy was put forth.Nonetheless, this is essential if you want to know more about taboo topics.Schlosser is a talented writer and I will pick up his next book."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"My laziness with non-fiction reared it's ugly head with this book. Broken up into three sections investigating, respectively, the marijuana industry, migrant farm labor and pornography, this book is actually very readable. A lot of the book tells short biographies of people affected by either government policy or big business in the various industries. I especially liked the section on migrant labor, which focuses primarily on the Santa Maria Valley in California, where my mother grew up. I got bogged down in the pornography section, by far the longest part of the book, and could have been edited a little more. I also found parts of the narrative could be preachy and sensationalist, but you learn more than you ever thought possible about the underground economy."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Eric Schlosser examines the paradox that outlawing things often brings about more harm than would have resulted from leaving them legal. His arguments won't convince many readers but the fact is that history supports his view and does not show that drug prolhibition, alcohol prohibition, prostitution prohibition, or anything of the kind has succeeded in preventing an amount of harm that approaches the harm caused by the prohibitions themselves."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"After having read Schlosser's first book, \\"Fast Food Nation\\" and walked away from that feeling simultaneously repulsed, disheartened, newly informed and wildly entertained, I looked forward to his next expose. While the first section on Marijuana (\\"Reefer Madness\\") is brilliantly told, flawlessly researched and heartbreakingly disturbing, the two extended essays that follow lack all the promise of the first essay. \\"In The Strawberry Fields\\" feels slight and under-researched. It also lacks the dramatic ingredient of the human element, focusing primarily on broad strokes to classify the poor illegal immigrants and the overall grim situation of farming strawberry crops, both for the workers and the farmers themselves. \\"An Empire of the Obscene,\\" which focuses on the porn industry, gives Larry Flynt less than 2 pages, Hugh Hefner a passing mention and doesn't delve into the participants (actors, writers, directors, producers) of the film trade at all, with the exception of spending a smattering of time with porn star Nina Hartley. Instead, Schlosser focuses on the endless (and, quite frankly, boring and monotonous) obscenity charges sought by the U.S. Gov't against businessman/smut-peddler Reuben Sturman. There are a few compelling incidents once IRS agent Richard Rosfelder enters the picture and sets up his daunting task of getting Sturman into prison Al Capone-style by charging him with tax evasion. But while the first two essays have strong points of view about the individuals suffering from their participation in the underground markets, the porn essay lacks that, because Thurman is an arrogant, multi-millionaire with little charisma or decency to his character and the author himself seems to care little for him or his travails. I would recommend the marijuana essay, but I would say don't bother with the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Please let me preface this review by saying that I've been happily married for 26 years, have two tween boys, am agnostic, don't drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes or consume any illegal drugs. When it comes to pot, I don't toke it, eat it or even wear the darn weed. With that in mind, our national policies towards marijuana are nothing short of lunacy. Much like his previous book about the fast-food industry, Mr. Schlosser does a commendable job in explaining the history of our pot laws and the outright fallacies propagated by a pandering government to paranoid, morally-uptight interest groups. The author does what any industrious, muckraking journalist should do and researches the topics. The three subjects in this book: marijuana, illegal immigration and the porn industry could have each been expanded into their own books. However, the author is a wonderful writer who weaves facts, personal observations and human-interest stories to produce a highly informative and compelling read. It hard to walk away from this book without seething in anger at our society's moral hypocrisy. With any luck, a hundred years from now, people will be shaking their heads and wondering, \\"What the hell were they thinking?\\""},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"This is a powerful book. Broken into 3 parts, it deals with the history of our approach to marijuana use; our use of illegal immigrants, specifically in the strawberry fields of California; and the development of porn in our country, how it grew, and how our government's attempt to suppress it only continued to spark the flame.Eric Schlosser's meticulous research is written in an easy to understand form. He states the facts without any bias. For instance, you'll learn that a young man, with no prior record, arrested for marijuana possession can receive a longer prison sentence than a convicted murderer or rapist. And, while our country is in an uproar over illegal immigrants, our government allows these people to be used like slaves when convenient. When they are no longer needed, they are rounded up like cattle and sent back to Mexico.In the end, whether you agree with his conclusions or not, a new light is shed on a world most of us pay no attention to. And perhaps tells us that we need to get more involved."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"My name is Hannah G and I read this book for my economics class for senior year. I really enjoyed this book because it was a way to learn about economics while still reading something that was \\"dangerous\\" and also very abundant in high school. I like how the book wasn't extremely biased in the sense that it gave information on what the government was doing to \\"protect\\" people from drugs and information on what the effects really are on your body."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"In REEFER MADNESS, Eric Schlosser looks at the effects of U.S. policy on the underground or \\"black market\\" economy. Specifically, he examines three diverse \\"commodities\\" - \\"recreational\\" or illegal drugs (specifically, marijuana), cheap labor (provided by undocumented workers or \\"illegal aliens\\" from Mexico and South America), and \\"adult\\" materials (primarily pornography) - and the American \\"war\\" on each. Schlosser narrows the scope of his study by focusing on a few key players in each of these underground economies: Mark Young, a recreational pot smoker and middleman who was given a life sentence for brokering a marijuana deal; California strawberry farmers and the migrant workers who pick the finicky fruit; and Reuben Sturman, a \\"pioneer\\" of the porn industry (and a jackbooted thug).REEFER MADNESS is an engaging study of what happens when a supposedly free and democratic government attempts to stomp out vices that it deems morally corrupt. The section on U.S. drug policy is especially enlightening - and quite relevant, given the current upsurge in drug-related violence along the U.S.-Mexico border. Pornography receives the lion's share of attention, seemingly at the expense of immigration, which is a shame; I felt as though Schlosser barely scratched the surface of the latter, while I grew bored of Reuben Sturman's story by the end of the book. Schlosser concludes REEFER MADNESS by tying all three tales together, thus making a larger statement about civil liberties and the strengths and weaknesses of the \\"free market\\" in the U.S. Again, though, he probably could have devoted more pages to this synthesis had he not lingered on Sturman and pornography.Overall, it's a fascinating and engaging read, and vividly demonstrates why all American citizens should be concerned with their government's attempts to regulate individual conduct - even if it's conduct with which you may personally disagree."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"I loved Eric Sclosser's previous book, 'Fast Food Nation' and hoped this book would be as interesting. I was disappointed. Because there are over 100 reviews already written about this book, I will keep mine brief.The book is about the underground economy that Mr. Schlosser believes is contributing greatly to our nation's gross national product without being taxed. There are three sections to this book:1) Illegal Aliens2) Marijuana3) PornographyMr. Schlosser spends a lot of time discussing how the above are mainstreams of the U.S. economy. I don't doubt the veracity of his claims but the book was boring. 'Fast Food Nation' kicked butt. I couldn't put it down. This book, however, was a slow read. There were no new insights or surprises.I look forward to Mr. Schlosser's next book and hope it has the kick of 'Fast Food Nation'"},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Free markets are a myth. Well functioning markets depend on a complex alignment of public and private values, culture and laws. When these causes are not aligned, the model breaks down. One measure of market malaise, if not social malaise, is the size of black markets in the economy.In Reefer Madness, Eric Schlosser estimates that black markets in the U.S.A. are about 5% to 10% of the total economy. In less developed economies or transitional economies such as Russia, black markets represent 40% or more of the total economy.Why is this of concern? According to Schlosser, black markets undermine government and democracy, both in respect and revenue, creates criminals of both producers and consumers of black market products and services, and creates unnecessary spending on litigation, the courts and prisons. Almost all Americans are guilty using black markets, even if it is paying the plumber or other trade in cash to evade taxes.Schlosser explains his thesis with three cases studies: marijuana, illegal immigrants, and the porn industry.With the marijuana black market, he effectively argues there is limited evidence that marijuana consumption is harmful, and that many people consume it. Indeed, it is difficult to make a case that it is any worse, and possibly better, for people than alcohol, which is legal. The greater harm has come from overzealous prosecution of dealers and users, filling prisons in record numbers. However, armed robbery and murder often carry lesser sentences. Current laws and prosecution of marijuana use are an abject failure. Both consumption and production have increased over the decades. Marijuana is arguably the largest cash crop in the United State.Given the disconnect between public and private values, would not an alternative policy, such as decriminalizing the use of marijuana, regulating its use in the same manner as alcohol make some sense? Schlosser makes a clear case that it would produce a social net benefit, increasing tax revenues, reducing court cases, and start emptying prisons. There would also be less tangible benefits such as greater respect for the governing authority.Illegal immigration is the second case study, focusing on the black market for Mexican labor in the California agricultural community. Schlosser shows how cheap illegal Mexican labor has distorted producing strawberries, ostensibly to California's advantage in the short term. But in the long term the effect will be painful, because the farming community is so far behind now in adopting new technology, because of the cheap labor. As well, cheap foreign labor has reduced the local standard of living and increased black markets, which some experts estimate to be as high as 30 percent in the LA area.The long term effect if continued will be to create a homegrown peasant economy. The solution does not lie in building fences or other restraints to immigration. The most effective policy choice according to Schlosser is developing and ensuring fair labor practices, including a decent minimum wage for all workers, whether they are immigrants or not.The porn industry over the past century is the subject of the third case study. Indeed, Schlosser provides a thumbnail history back to Comstock's antiporn crusades in the 19th century. The major focus is on the last 50 years and the remarkable cultural shift in American attitudes toward porn during that period. Schlosser focuses on the story of Reuben Sturman, the dark genius of the modern porn industry, and his battles with the government. While Sturman eventually goes to jail for tax evasion, his victories in the courts in fighting charges of porn pave the way for the modern porn industry.Sturman's story also highlights the role of the courts in reflecting cultural change in community standards over the decades, a role well suited to judicial interpretation rather than legislative or administrative law. Arguably, the black market in porn is much less than it otherwise would have been without these decisions.While Schlosser suggests that reason will win the day, his three case studies are less than reassuring. It seems irrationality, ignorance, and inertia play a powerful role, especially for marijuana and immigration. Problems that can extend for decades and generations eventually undermine the integrity if not the foundation of a society founded on the principles of free market democracy.Schlosser's book is a must read for anyone interested in the health of their democracy and market system."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"First, I'm compelled to agree with some other reviewers, that this book seemed less \\"focused\\" than Schlosser's gem, \\"Fast Food Nation.\\" Indeed, I ran across the book by accident, and got it because of my respect for Schlosser's other book.Then, when I started it, I wondered if that he focused a lot on the \\"sex\\" portion of the title trinity, you know, to titillate the reader and make a quick buck. But the book wasn't a let down. I think the author did a fairly good job of summarizing his point in the epilogue. And I tend to agree with him. I'm a little of a libertarian in that I think it IS inappropriate for the government to interfere where it's not of \\"their\\" business.That said, onto the book.Marijuana is fairly harmless, and something probably the vast majority of us had experimented with in our \\"younger years.\\" Indeed, the greatest power of pot is in its symbolism. It was a symbol of rebellion, for the users and their opponents. And the focus of the \\"drugs\\" element of the subject trinity is marijuana.I'm old enough to remember, or at least having read of pot being a ghetto drug. If you read books on drugs in, say, 1957, marijuana was something you'd find in Harlem. Of course it later became popular in Greenwich Village from whence it became that sign of bohemian rebellion. I needn't go over the rock stars that made it famous. But, after all these years in which it has been proven again and again less harmful than alcohol, there are politicians who suggest life imprisonment for those who indulge. (One of them covered in the book sang a different tune when his son was busted. What a shock. The evil weed becomes less evil when it's so close to home.)It really is amazing how many people were given long, long prison sentences, and/or lost their property, reputation, etc., because of something so harmless. Schlosser used the marijuana obsession to lead into the American obsession with drugs in general. And I particularly liked his observation that, what with 15 percent (or was it more?) of Americans using anti-depressants, it's not likely that drug \\"problem\\" is going to go away easily. (Something he may have covered but didn't is that, while the society decries the use of drugs, we watch ads on prime time television for prescription drugs to do none other than make us feel good. What me contradict?)The shortest element of the trinity was cheap labor. And it is a subject that is to me heart-wrenching. Migrant laborers especially in enlightened California pick things like strawberries, asparagus, and other crops the appearance of which is a key element of their value (and for which machinery hasn't been developed to pick them and keep them looking so \\"nice.\\") For this they are paid next to nothing, and their work conditions cause Schlosser to describe their work as indentured servitude. In a country in which we are allegedly so enlightened, that we treat people like we may have hundreds of years ago is among the signs of the depth of our hypocrisy. And the author mentions how, one of my pet peeves, the public relations industry, makes that pathetic condition look more passable to the public.Yes, the \\"sex\\" portion was longer than the others. And there were interesting, and titillating elements. Everyone remembers, for instance, when \\"Deep Throat\\" made the news. But there were interesting things going on in the same era which the author describes in details of which I was unaware before. Like, I didn't know there was one individual pretty well responsible for most of what developed as a porn industry. Even more, the details of the commission set up during the Johnson administration to examine the \\"effects\\" of porn on the society escaped me before. This book gave an interesting history of all of that. (While an undergraduate, I studied to a fair degree the Johnson era's analysis of sex and violence in the media. I'm not sure if that's the same commission to which Schlosser refers, but they came to similar conclusions: that there isn't \\"an\\" effect but what effects of either sex or violence are tempered by, for instance, how the participant's family observes either. Interesting, and logical in retrospect.)Of course, there was always talk of the mob having control over the porn market. Was that true? Schlosser seems to at least challenge it. (One could say that had SOME control, as they do over gambling, prostitution and other alleged vices. Nothing unexpected there either.)Anyway, despite the length of the discussion on the sex element, I wasn't over titillated. There was more substance than sex there, and I liked that.Again, Schlosser did a fair job of summarizing at the end of the book, suggesting that the government intervenes to a comical degree in subjects like marijuana and sex--the harms of which are pretty dubious--and doesn't intervene where it should, in the realm of involuntary servitude.I understand Schlosser's next book will be about the U.S. prison system, something that desperately needs to be analyzed--and criticized. I hope his new book is more like his first on fast food. \\"Reefer Madness\\" was good, and interesting, but seemed less focused, somewhat like a serial. Schlosser seems to do better in a focused volume and to the next I look forward."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Schlosser's examination of the underground economies of marijuana, illegal immigrants, and porn does a lot to give you background information and then takes it nowhere. Every essay feels like a detailed exposition with no further material. Some of you intellectual types like to say this encourages you to think for yourself - I say it's lazy writing.Nothing new of real interest is revealed - pot is still popular and unfairly punished, California's agriculture thrives on exploited immigrant labor, and porn makes a ton of money and is more mainstream than ever before. And that's it - that's what this book covers. I just saved you $10 bucks. In the beginning of the book, Schlosser says that all three need to be understood in context of each other. And that's really the last mention of there being a connection between the three. Out of all fairness, I haven't finished the last essay or the afterword but it doesn't show any sign of changing.Maybe I'm just missing the point but quite honestly, despite what the book description on the back says, there is no \\"powerful investigation that illuminates America's shadow economy\\". Simply, there's some interesting exposition that teases of an interesting story/argument/eye-opening conclusion but ultimately fails. In the end, I really should have checked it out from the library and I advise the same to you - don't waste your money on this book."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Schlosser picked three gripping topics to suck the reader in: marijuana legalization, migrant labor, and pornography. I love the idea, but I was never sure how the three connected, and the book never really came together as a whole. Nonetheless, I learned a lot from the different sections and I enjoyed the experience.The marijuana legalization section was exhaustively researched, well-written, and made an intelligent argument. I was ready to go join a new cause when I finished that chapter. Schlosser skillfully interspersed history, politics, legal statistics, and touching vignettes to make a strong case for a need for a shift in the focus of the war on drugs.I was similarly interested and energized by the migrant labor section, but I didn't feel that Schlosser provided and clear course of action to follow. The proposed measures to improve conditions for migrant workers are highly controversial, and I can see both sides of the issue.The third and final section was the least well developed. It had much less to do with the pornography industry as a whole than it did with the career of the very mysterious, but influential, Reuben Sturman. Schlosser should have made this a separate biography, but no one would have picked it up, because Sturman is such an unknown.If you have an interest in any of these topics, or just like a good expose now and then, pick this book up. It's not the end-all word on any of its subjects, however."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"After finding \\"Fast Food Nation\\" an engrossing and captivating read, I was somewhat disappointed to find this collection of three essays to be average and unconnected. The marijuana and strawberry articles are definitely superior to the last third, which deals with the outlaw-to-industry history of porn. It's good writing overall, just not really worth buying in book form. This experience was analogous to my interest in the periodical \\"Mother Jones;\\" initial fascination due to some good research, followed by a gradual decay of interest due to predictably one-sided reporting. Hopefully, Schlosser will come back with his next book to prove himself more than the average liberal journalist (there's enough of those). Fast Food Nation was great, but it doesn't justify paying for this collection of B-sides at full price."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"In this book Schlosser promises an investigative examination of the economic and social issues behind black market activity in America (just look at the cover), but such promises do not materialize effectively. Instead of the in-depth manifesto promised in the prologue and summarized very quickly in the epilogue, the main body of this book is merely three essays about different types of black market activity. The first concerns marijuana, and here Schlosser comes close to a strong sociopolitical treatise on public vs. private attitudes toward recreational drug use. Instead, the essay merely becomes a dissertation on the ridiculous politics and inaccurate morality behind the drug war. Schlosser's ideas are certainly accurate, as the drug war is definitely a dismal failure. However, this subject has been covered extensively in dozens of other books, and Schlosser's short essay here offers nothing new.The second essay, concerning black market migrant labor, sticks closest to the book's presumed focus on the economic and social phenomena behind illegal activity. Unfortunately this essay is very short and Schlosser does not give the amount of detail and in-depth research that this issue deserves. I propose that he write a full book on this issue as his next project. Problems similar to those in the marijuana essay also afflict the final portion of the book, dealing with pornography. Schlosser's supposed focus on the economics of that industry devolves into an unnecessarily detailed biography of the longtime porn kingpin Rueben Sturman. It's an interesting story but surely detracts from the book's focus.Schlosser's writing has improved since his opus \\"Fast Food Nation,\\" which was marred by sarcastic polemics and flimsy conspiracy theories. The main problem with \\"Reefer Madness\\" is that Schlosser fails to achieve the goals which are loudly proclaimed on the busy cover, and which he promises to examine in the introduction. It's true that Americans (plus their politicians) publicly condemn but privately crave black market phenomena such as drugs and pornography. These supposedly illegal markets are the best examples of truly unregulated capitalism, giving people what they want efficiently, although supposedly free-market politicians try to crush them. These markets also make up surprisingly large portions of the American economy, with potentially major social implications. Schlosser promises to examine these issues, but mostly doesn't. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Although the author is gifted, this is a very light-weight sequel to Fast Foot Nation and the author's next book on prisons is therefore already suspect. This could have been a great book--indeed it could have been three great books--but in the rush to publish a second book in order to profit from the justifiable applause for his first one, the editor and publisher and author have all failed.There are three articles here: the first is about the inconsistencies of the drug versus the murder laws, the number of people in jail for marijuana, and the social implications of all this; the second is on the underground economy of illegal workers and profiteering abusive corporations (McDonald's is especially evil in this depiction); and the third is about pornography but with a twist, focusing on how hotels and other major corporations are profiting.The books ends with a very short but thoughtful observation regarding the need to change the law and punishment so as to back away from life-ending punishments for individual behavior that is merely self-destructive or distastement, and focus the heaviest punishments on those who commit economic crimes against society and entire sub-sections of society.In each of these three cases, there are other books that are better--Deep Cover by Michael Levine on the futility of drug enforcement and the corruption of Drug Enforcement Agency &quot;suits&quot;; Forbidden Knowledge by Roger Shattuck, on pornography among other things; and The Informant by Kurt Eichenwald, on the sweetheart triangle between national-level white collar corporate criminals, big law firms, and a compliant Department of Justice that lets the richest bad guys off easy.I would caution the author to not do this again--the next book had better be as good as Fast Food Nation, or he will fall into the second rank of serial writers rather than culture-changing authors, where he deserves to stay.I would also encourage anyone considering buying this book to do so--it does have useful information--but more importantly, if you have not read Fast Food Nation, go to that page and think seriously about buying and reading it now--as McDonald's gets blamed overseas for being the epidemy of all that is hateful to Islamics, as Kraft Food pays lip service to healthy food in its realization that Oreo cookies are killing kids, what Eric Schlosser did in Fast Food Nation is being appreciated more and more each day--with that book, he did indeed change national consciousness, an achievement that will stand in history as a turning point in creating a healthier America."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"You'll be able to breeze through this book possibly because it is written by a chap who also writes for magazines which means he knows how to get to the point. Reefer Madness is a book that takes on three seemingly unrelated topics and tries to tie them together in such a fashion that it makes a statement about contemporary American Culture. I have chosen to give this book Four Stars only because, while I found the book quite interesting and the discussion engaging if disturbing, I came away unconvinced that these three things have are any more able to sum up the Nation's zeitgeist (or dysfunction), than any other three things that arguably illlustrate our schizophrenic cultural tendencies, say the Methamphetamine craze, rampant and pervasive white collar crime and our cockamamie foreign policy. In section one the author discusses the odd juxtaposition of the widespread and safe consumption of marijuana and the draconian punishments and penalties doled out for its use, sale and growth. In the next, he describes the conditions surrounding an entire economy (agricultural America, California, however you want to break it down) that is dependent upon a huge pool of cheap and illegal labor and extrapolates it to our national economy. In the final section he traces the rise and fall of two early pornographers, rather porn merchants, making the ironic connection between a publicly stated abhorrence of the trade with the rather massive amounts of money that the condemning parties spend on it for private use. In a brief final chapter the author tells us that these three things are somehow emblematic of and a natural outgrowth of the small government mantra chanted by a new breed of Conservatives who praise free enterprise above all and condemn big government but whose policies actually enlarge the government in order to stamp out perceived ills while lessening government oversight for favored business ventures. There is an internal contradiction in the argument and I think that you as the reader will pick up on it as you read along. I think that the author would have been more successful if he had chosen to make this a book about right and wrong and the role that money plays to twist the result of the equation. This point of view would be especially effective in that part of the book where he uses direct quotes from specific politicians who call for strict penalties right up to the death penalty for drug dealers and then who hypocritically intervene on behalf of their own children to free them from punishment after they have been caught, you guessed it, dealing drugs. Perhaps doing this would have made the book less easy to read, certainly it would have made it less easy to write but it would have made it that much better. Anyway, I think that it won't hurt you to buy and read this book. Doing so will probably make you angry, it will certainly open your eyes to some things about our laws that will leave you disturbed and it may even help you to become a better citizen, all for less than ten bucks used."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"I agree completely with the other reviewers who say that this book is disjointed and not cohesive. Although each essay, taken separately, is thought-provoking and well-research, the book as a whole does not explore the \\"black market\\" in a cohesive manner.The author makes good arguments in each of the essays. He points out the ridiculousness of an American drug policy that seeks higher sentences for marijuana growers than murderers. He argues that America's lenient enforcement of labor laws is affecting not only the illegal migrant farm workers, but the rest of our economy as well. He also illustrates the changing values and legislation relating to the pornography industry.What he doesn't do, however, is tie these things together. He has obviously included all of these issues as a way to compare them against one another. But the end product reads more like three separate pieces and less like true investigative reporting on the so-called underground economy. Although I enjoyed this book, it did not live up to my expectations after _Fast Food Nation_."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"There are three long, but very well-written essays in this book, portions of which previously appeared in the Atlantic Monthly, Rolling Stone and the US News and World Report.The first, the title essay, is on the marijuana business in the United States with a concentration on the \\"killer weed's\\" legal history, its economics and how it is cultivated today. Schlosser presents the unembellished facts along with some vivid detail about the growers, the sellers, the law enforcement people, and the politicians. Reading this reinforces my belief that the \\"new prohibition\\" (not so new anymore of course) is really a full employment program for the law enforcement establishment endorsed by hypocritical social conservatives (Rush Limbaugh would be a fine example) and Christian fundamentalists, most of whom have little idea about what is going on.The second essay, entitled \\"In the Strawberry Fields,\\" is about Mexican laborers in virtual peonage in California, the history of this phenomenon, its politics, its economic consequences, and the reality of today's conditions in the field and across the border. The endemic political and economic hypocrisy is illustrated by Scholosser's eye-opening observation on why Mexican migrants are routinely rounded up and sent back to Mexican in a kind of (wink, wink) revolving door policy. When migrants are allowed to settle here and raise their children, the states end up paying for their education and welfare. However by periodically deporting them we benefit from their cheap labor \\"while Mexico...in effect...[pays] for the education, health care, and retirement of California's farmworkers.\\" (p. 95)The third essay, \\"An Empire of the Obscene\\" is about the pornography business with the focus on porn king Reuben Sturman and his nemesis IRS agent Richard N. Rosfelder, Jr. who finally got Sturman for tax evasion. Although this is the longest essay in the book (longer than the other two combined), I found it the least interesting. That Sturman was able to launder and hide his profits off shore in the same manner as drug dealers (and, for example, Enron) was interesting, as was the way Schlosser chronicles how pornography has become such a huge business that it now accounts for a significant part of the revenues of some Fortune 500 companies.Holding the essays together is Schlosser's idea that the private morality of Americans is inconsistent with our public morality, and that the evidence for this is especially compelling in these three domains of the black market economy. He frames the essays with an introduction called, \\"The Underground,\\" and a postscript named rather hopefully, \\"Out of the Underground.\\"Some highlights:\\"Today approximately three-quarters of all $100 bills circulate outside the United States.\\" As Schlosser notes, this \\"serves, in essence, as a gigantic interest-free loan\\" from them to us. (p. 7) (I just hope that George W. Bush's huge deficients don't lessen the world's love for the Yankee dollar and lead them to adopt the Euro instead.)\\"Import barriers [on marijuana] drove prices high enough to make domestic production extremely profitable,\\" allowing UCLA professor Mark A. R. Kleiman to note that this is \\"a rare instance in which protectionism actually worked.\\" Schlosser adds, \\"Some American marijuana is now worth more per ounce than gold.\\" (p. 36)\\"The new mandatory minimum laws [for marijuana possession and trafficking] took...power from the judge and handed it to the prosecutor\\" who could decide who to prosecute and for what. (p. 45) This results in an uneven application of the law and \\"de facto sentencing by police and prosecutors.\\" (p. 53) Added to the power the police have because of the forfeiture laws, and one sees that justice in marijuana cases can be anything but. Schlosser cites an example in Ventura County, California in which drug agents had first obtained an appraisal of a $5-million ranch and then raided it for marijuana cultivation only to find nothing growing there. (p. 62)A further point about the forfeiture laws (which I think are unconstitutional since they are seizures without due process) is that informers may get up to one-quarter of the proceeds. Schlosser claims that this has resulted in a \\"new business: the buying and selling of drug leads. Defendants who hope to avoid a lengthy...sentence...can now secretly buy information from vendors on the black market.\\" (pp. 62-63)Recalling that justice Douglas H. Ginsburg (nominated by Reagan) declined nomination to the US Supreme Court \\"after confessing that he smoked marijuana as a young man,\\" Schlosser recalls the McCarthy era's \\"defining political question\\"--Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist party?--with today's question that congressmen and political candidates have to answer: Are you now, or have you ever been, a pot smoker? (p. 49) On page 51 Schlosser notes however that \\"Legislation to impose drug testing on members of Congress has repeatedly died in committee and never reached the floor for a vote.\\"Finally, Schlosser compares America's attitude toward the drug Viagra with its attitude toward marijuana. He recalls Bob Dole's TV commercial for Viagra and then notes that \\"Elizabeth Dole, now a US senator from North Carolina, apparently doesn't oppose this sort of recreational drug use.\\"Bottom line: social conservatives will deplore this book, and right wing AM shock jocks will rant against it, while most of the rest of the country will ignore it. Too bad. This is a fine piece of work by Schlosser and everyone involved in the project, and an engrossing read."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"This book is supposed to be a look at the American black market but focuses exclusively on Marijuana regulations, illegal immigrants for agriculture in California and the porn industry.The essay on Marijuana is excellent; Schlosser gets a lot of useful numbers to show that the government is being too strict on marijuana use and how marijuana offenders are being punished more than even violent criminals. He traces the history of marijuana regulations in America and speaks about the political forces that have motivated this hard stance towards marijuana use. The essay is exceptionally well written and keeps a good pace from the first page.The second essay is called Strawberry Fields and speaks about the plight of illegal immigrants working in agricultural fields in California. The essay speaks about another kind of black market in America, but is neither as gripping nor detailed as the previous one.The last essay, is supposed to be about the pornographic trade, but is instead for the most part a biography of Reuban Sturman, a Cleveland business man who one the first porn business men in America. Schlosser speaks about how Sturman kick started the porn industry in America and how the government tried to peg him down, often unsuccessfully, finally throwing him in the coop for tax evasion. The essay does not give a comprehensive picture of the porn underground market, rather sticking to the underground market of one man. The other essays offer a more top-down perspective, which this one completely misses.Schlosser's basic premise for the book is good, but he should have integrated the essays better and should have spoken more about other types of underground markets. Coming after the best-selling Fast Food Nation, this book feels more like a hastily thrown together bunch of essays to make a quick buck rather than a carefully written expose of the American underground.Though this book disappointed me (I was hoping something like Fast Food Nation) I am giving this 4 stars as Schlosser preserves an un-alarmist tone throughout the book. Although we know he is against these things, he never displays a bias and presents the things as they are, which is very commendable. the book is steeped in numbers and he tries to provide a quantitative basis for all he presents."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"This was a page turner, and an eye opener. Ill keep this short, this is a great book!!!!"},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"I am a literature snob; nothing gets my thumbs up. (This book is lucky it's non-fiction.) The subjects of the book are of ubiquitous items and the economies behind them. It highlights some incredible stories, commentary from notable people, and great fortunes with Eric's supremely enjoyable understatements and images. What could be more tantalizing than reading about great fortunes made from dealing material that is barely beyond &quot;coffee table&quot; acceptable? It is one of the few books that gets me excited! Eric, you can be proud of your work -- live long and prosper (and write more books)."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Mr. Schlosser has republished his magazine articles which, as to strawberries, contain factual errors. The California Court of Appeal has specifically held that Growers of strawberries for most Shipper/Packers are independent contractors, see Zendejas v. Kirk Produce (1998) 2d Civil B110632 and Herrera v. Kirk Produce (1998)2d B103704 and not sharecroppers. His work while interesting reading is misleading and factually inaccurate as to the matters I discussed with him some years ago. Connecting strawberries with pornography and marijuana is a non sequitur."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Need I say more than this could maybe be three good magazine articals.

All I could think of is Fast food writing."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"The subject matter in the book is interesting, but I didn't get the feeling that Mr. Schlosser's research was nearly as thorough as what he did for Fast Food Nation. I would have much rather heard more about any of the three topics of the book than the limited coverage."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"\\"Reefer Madness\\" was one of the more enjoyable books I have read this year. Schlosser is a very captivating writer, who makes some very persuasive arguments against traditional notions of how free market economies work.I felt that the first essay on marijuana argued successfully that a huge portion of the American economy is fueled by illegal activity. The second essay on migrant fruit pickers is fascinating, but failed in several ways to make Schlosser's point about underground elements of the national economy. Finally, the essay on pornography and Ruben Sturman was an entertaining read, but I felt had almost nothing to do with the overall theme of the book. Yes, Sturman worked very hard to hide his profits and deceive the government, but his empire ended more than 20 years ago. I think more contemporary examples would have been benefited the overall argument.I would highly recommend this book, but I think that Schlosser could have worked harder towards proving his theory of the black market's power over the U.S. economy"},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"I agree with some of the other reviews - this volume does not have nearly as unified of a theme as Fast Food Nation. It does feel a lot like three books in one loosely connected by the concept of the underground economy. However, I think this is an excellent description and history of three sections of under-the-table economics - pot, porn and immigrants. Marijuana is probably the best written section, while I feel that the strawberry section could have had a little more in-depth discussion of the complex (and long history of) immigrant wages in the U.S. Worth reading, but not for the same reasons as Fast Food Nation."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"This book does not live up to the standard Schlosser set in Fast Food Nation, which I read last year. Made up of three essays, one on Marijuana one on illegal immigrant labor, and one on the porn industry. The premise of the book is that Schlosser will describe the underground economy of which these three topics play a major role. But the essays actually tell nothing about economics and right away get into political topics on which Schlosser is not at all shy in stating is own preference. In each topic, Schlosser actually uses one or two case studies, but the overall point of these case studies is not at all clear.By far, the most interesting topic is the porn industry, if only because this topic is just not covered much. Rather than an economic study, it should be relabeled a history of the porn industry. Even here, though, the material is not really a complete history, but rather a couple cases that Schlosser has followed up on, and the central topic is the government's war against porn producers. Schlosser's own reading is also uninspiring, but I think that is really just a result of material that is neither academically rigorous nor exciting or relevant as investigative reporting (which is what Schlosser is really aiming at)."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"I brought along Eric Schlosser's Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labour in the American Black Market to read on my vacation and found it every bit as interesting as his excellent and informative previous book Fast Food Nation. The first section \\"Reefer Madness\\" looks at the underground economy of marijuana. It underscores the ridiculous mandatory sentencing drug laws that keep non-violent, low-level drug dealers in jail longer than murderers, rapists, and child molesters. Just another holdover form the overzealous Regan administration's \\"War On Drugs\\"-just another misguided governmental policy like prohibition and anti-pornography crusaders (more on this later). Let's just legalize it and tax the hell out of it like cigarettes and alcohol. The second section, \\"In The Strawberry Fields\\", is an investigative piece about the exploitation of illegal immigrants and the underclass as laborers in Californian strawberry fields, low pay, no benefits, improper housing, poor conditions, etc...It's tantamount to slave labor, sweat shop style management ethic that we ignore now that most of it takes place offshore in developing countries like China and Vietnam. The whole book makes you want to become an activist, but it also details the system and mentality that you're up against in these situations-so it seems futile. The last section details the folly of the government's demonization of pornography, which seems ridiculous in retrospect since Disney has holdings in pornography these days where hard core images are just a mouse click away. What a waste of time, money, and resources that was. As usual, Schlosser has done an admirable job researching his subjects in revealing the folly of man."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Eric Schlosser's Reefer Madness has three interesting essays in it, but I can't quite figure out why the three are in this book together. In the introduction to the book, Schlosser says his intent is to expose the underground economy of the US for what it is. The first essay concerns marijuana and the ridiculous way it is handled in the US. Next, he focusses on the miserable lives of migrant strawberry pickers. Finally, he exposes the seedy underside of the American porn industry. All three essays are interesting and provocative--the marijuana chapter may be viewed by some as especially controversial. Schlosser's writing is well-researched and clear. But, the book just doesn't hang together as a cohesive whole, which I think it could if he had given it a couple more drafts--it almost seems that this book was rushed out before it was truly finished. Still--it is definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market is really three books in one. The best, is the titular story, with which the book opens, documenting the history of marijuana laws in the United States. The author, Eric Schlosser, who also wrote Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal, tries, at first, to be fair to both sides of the legalization argument. But the struggle is futile, as overwhelming evidence mounts against the U.S. policy of incarcerating casual users of marijuana with punishments greater than those sometimes given to murderers.The middle part of the book is about undocumented migrant workers who, essentially, subsidize California farms by working well below minimum wage. This is well-written and interesting, but who would buy a book if the cover said it was the story of migrant farm workers? Lots of people, I'm sure, but not nearly so many as are buying a book called \\"Refer Madness.\\"The second half of the book is about the rise of the adult film industry in America. It chronicles the tremendous effort that was used to enforce obscenity laws in the past for depictions that are now available from fortune 500 companies today.The theme uniting the sections book is that the laws prohibiting things that people want (drugs, pornography, to work) will always create a black market, and will end up doing more harm than the things that are being prohibited, by creating resentment for law enforcement, and by preventing people (especially undocumented workers) from seeking help from the police."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"This is another eloquent and scholarly journalistic effort by Schlosser focusing on issues resonant with practically anyone in American society. Readers will be impressed with the author's substantial researchm which is organized and presented in an eloquent yet unpretentious and \\"readable\\" fashion.\\"Reefer Madness\\" marks a shift by Schlosser to more partisan journalism by his conspicuous and passionate observations about the social justice implications of our reliance upon undocumented \\"illegal\\" farmer workers, as well as the irony of how an agricultural economy based upon such labor, as well as the hypocracy and inconsistencies of our \\"moral\\" legislation regulating America's immense demand for recreation drugs and pornography, in actuality work to undermine our legitimate economy.While the thread of commonality throughout this work is the immensity of this parallel economy, and the impact upon and threat it poses to our \\"legitimate\\" economy, the three topics he studies are pretty much distinct and separate issues. It requires the reader to stretch a bit conceptually to see the valid, but somewhat subtle connections.Schlosser's sorrow, outrage, and angst -- especially concerning undocumented workers -- are moving and heartwrenching, especially since they are backed by irrefutable statistics. Readers should be warned that you will find yourself hard pressed to ever again eat a farm raised strawberry in good conscience in light of the exploitation and oppression its production represents."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Like the numerous other reviewers on here have mentioned, this book is actually 3 completely different stories look at aspects of American society and, how and where money goes when it is not exchanged above the board. The first section deals with marijuana and it is a pretty interesting read. Facts are all referenced and opinions are sprinkled throughout without being overwhelmingly bias. I enjoyed the book, but I had anticipated it would be all about drugs and the drug trade, not about migrant workers and strawberries. Good book, but not what I had expected. Shame on me for looking at the title and thinking it was all about Reefer."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Got it for my English class. This book tells you what you probably wouldn't see in your life (unless you come from an environment like this). It could be a little too....too much &#34;detailed&#34; information."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Eric Schlosser returns in his second published expose' on three different underground economic topics, each an essay originally released in Rolling Stone Magazine. The three essays on marijuana, illegal immigrant workers, and pornography constitute this opus on America's underground economy which accounts for what Schlosser and others believe is 10 percent of the whole American economy constitute \\"Reefer Madness.\\"While not nearly as in depth as his first book \\"Fast Food Nation,\\" Schlosser does more muckraking on topics that not only interest readers who know little about these underground economies, but can also keep the readers attention with experiences and biographies of participants in the underground economies.I truly think that Schlosser went far more in depth to exhume scarce facts in \\"Fast Food Nation,\\" while only briefly over-viewing these three topics in \\"Reefer Madness.\\" To get to the point... it would have been better if \\"Reefer Madness\\" was Schlosser's first work instead of \\"Fast Food Nation - He obviously set the standard for himself too high with his first work.Schlosser does an excellent job not only presenting these three essays, one leading into the other through prose vignette, but offers a preface of ideas to help set up the reader before the presentation of the three essays. Referencing points from Adam Smith's \\"On the Wealth of Nations\\" for the current reigning market system, Schlosser sees what many others refuse to see... Everyone has his or her vice and there is money to be made from this market!Schlosser finishes \\"Reefer Madness\\" with personal points of view and his own ideas on these three portions of the underground American economy and how things about them can be progressively dealt with, and even legalized!?!?!Eric Schlosser is currently working on another investigative report unfolding the secrets of the American prison system - I am not sure when this work will be released."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"\\"Reefer Madness\\" is an uneven examination of the American underground economy. Mr. Schlosser does not attempt a comprehensive examination -- notably absent are software piracy, music downloading, prostitution, offshore banking and gambling --but appears instead to have selected three topics that, presumably, might help sell copies for his publisher. (Such are the perils, apparently, of having to follow up the classic \\"Fast Food Nation\\".)The first section is dedicated to illegal drugs. Mr. Schlosser does a very good job savaging the contradictions of legal and illegal drug policies in this country. In only 64 pages, the author provides background, statistics and case studies that make for very compelling reading. His conclusions are consistent with what most reformers have been arguing for some time. The draconian laws and failed policies of the so-called 'War on Drugs' are so out of step with mainstream American thought and practice that Mr. Schlosser's sly rewrite of a John Lennon anthem resonates with power: \\"this war is over, if you want it.\\" This devastating critique was my favorite of the three essays, by far.The second section on illegal labor is a scant 34 pages long. It is focused on the plight of strawberry pickers in California. Mr. Schlosser's keen powers of observation and solid research methodology combine to produce a scathing critique of the inhumane conditions that many migrant farmworkers endure. But by focusing on such a thin slice of the American labor market, it may be difficult to judge the validity of the author's generalized recommendations about rectifying labor abuses nationwide.Personally, I was disappointed that the third section on the porn industry was as lengthy as the other two combined. The story was mostly a history lesson and biography centered around Reuben Sturman, who the author shows was primarily responsible for growing the porn industry through most of the post World War II era and who tirelessly defended it against its enemies. But while Mr. Schlosser's article makes it clear that porn was officially repressed for many years in the U.S., today that no longer seems to be the case. Consequently it doesn't seem to provide much support for the author's theme of the contemporary state of the underground economy, although the story was certainly interesting and extremely well-written.In the end, one wishes that Mr. Schlosser had been able to fully develop these stories into three separate books. The stature that the author has gained as a result of \\"Fast Food Nation\\" guarantees that his views have power, but I'm afraid that diluting the subject matter probably takes away some of the punch. That's too bad, because in my view the drug laws and the labor laws, in particular, badly need reform.Here's hoping that Mr. Schlosser's publisher gives this talented writer the opportunity to produce another gem on par with \\"Fast Food Nation\\" the next time around. But in the meantime, Mr. Schlosser's fans can get a quick fix by reading this entertaining but slighly disappointing book."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"This book should be required reading for all the law and policy makers in this country. In plain, simple language, the author puts forth scathing attack on the wars on drugs and porn, and informs us of the often-ignored plight of migrant workers. He also gives the reader an idea of the immense size and scope of the underground economy in this country. An excellent book."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"After reading the fantastic book Fast Food Nation, I'm willing to read anything that Eric Schlosser publishes. When I heard what the subject matter was for his new book (pot, porn, and illegal labor) I wasn't that interested but I wanted to find out what Schlosser had to say. In the introduction, Schlosser writes that the book is made up of three essays that are mostly unrelated, but these essays were tied together with the idea of the American Underground Economy which pervades the book. Reefer Madness is Schlosser's attempt to show how large the underground economy (meaning, non-taxed and illegal money) is in America. Schlosser discusses the laws and the social conditions that have allowed these things to occur.The first essay is on Marijuana. Apparently, marijuana is America's number one cash crop, but it is illegal to buy, sell, grow, or possess any amount of marijuana in America. Schlosser gives the history of marijuana legislation and reveals the severity of the punishments regarding marijuana violations (even compared to murder). This essay looks at the applications of marijuana laws throughout United States history. It highlights some of the absurdly harsh penalties given for first time convictions of even trace amounts of pot; this essay also shows the disparity in verdicts for the children of politicians compared to the poor. There are comparisons with the drug laws of other nations and a discussion on the health risks and health concerns regarding marijuana. Very interesting essay.The second essay deals with illegal labor in California. Specifically, the essay is on the illegal labor in the strawberry industry. This is the shortest essay of the three, but it does a good job in explaining the rise of migrant labor since the 1970's and why farm companies would use this labor. Surprisingly, most of America's strawberries are grown in California and at least half of the labor provided is illegal. The conditions that these workers (from Mexico) live in is horrible and the labor itself is one of the most physically demanding work that one can do on a farm. Illegal labor is becoming a larger and larger sector of some industries as these men (mostly) will work for significantly lower wages just so that they can have work. This essay had more of a human story to it and was more emotionally involving than the Marijuana essay. However, this essay didn't seem to have the societal import that the discussion on marijuana law did.The third essay focuses on pornography. Schlosser does not touch on the morality side of the pornography issue, but instead deals with the economics of porn. Like the other two essays, this one details the history of pornography in America and happens to be the longest of the three essays. Pornography is big business and the U.S. government has been cracking down on the industry on an off for years. For many years, the leading figure in the industry was one man, Reuben Sturman. The legality of porn is constantly in question and at the base are the very hazy obscenity laws. Much of this essay is about Sturman, his rise to lead the industry and the attempt to convict Sturman.Any one of these essays could easily become a full length book and would be very interesting individually. Taken together, the tie that binds them is not very strong and the transition between the essays feels a little jumpy. This is an extremely interesting book and one that I am very glad that I read. Individually, these are excellent essays, but when taken together, they lose some of the narrative force that Schlosser excels at. This is worth reading, without question."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"I am somewhat disappointed by this book. Mr. Schlosser approached his first book 'Fast Food Nation' with a clear argument as a thread for his investigations; Fast food is bad for American's health, and undermining to their values. An interesting argument defended with creativity and terrific research. In contrast I can't seem to find the argument behind this book.First, a brief synopsis. 'Reefer Madness' consists of three essays about different elements of America's underground economy, marijuana, migrant labor, and pornography. The central argument of Schlosser's book appears to be that each of these markets are underground, and that they are big - at least I think. He never really tells us. From there it's hard to see what point he's making.In the marijuana piece, Schlosser argues that marijuana is a lucrative business, that the product is in high demand, and that marijuana laws are arbitrary, unfair, illogical, and in many instances inhumanely cruel. All true and well argued, but so what? Schlosser does a good job outlining the scope of the breath of the problem (though, it wouldn't kill him to footnote his facts as he goes along) and then simply stops and writes another essay. A much more interesting piece might have continued the investigation of the marijuana issue asking questions such as who are the users of marijuana, what purposes and whose interests do punative marijuana laws serve, what do marijuana distribution networks look like, not just in the midwest where the product is created, but in central cities where the product is consumed?The second essay is about the use of migrant laborers to grow strawberries. Again, Schlosser does a nice job outlining the size of the problem, but again it's not clear what he is arguing? In the first essay he seemed to be arguing that marijuana is a desired commodity, and that we should decriminalize its production and use and let the 'invisible hand' of the market give consumers what they want. In the migrant labor essay, Schlosser seems to be arguing exactly the opposite. Here the government has essentially decriminalized the use of cheap Mexican labor by California agriculture to deliver strawberries and other labor-intensive crops cheaply to market. Schlosser demonstrates how many domestic growers exploit this labor to increase profits, and indeed they do, but again what's the point. This is essentially the same free market exploitation Schlosser was recommending for a decriminalized marijuana market. Why is the free market good for a product that gets you high, but bad for one that makes a yummy desert? Further, who does Schlosser think is going to do the grunt work of marijuana production in the event it is decriminalized? Isn't it reasonable to assume that some of this work would be done by migrants? I think it is, and I also think it's reasonable to expect Schlosser to make some of these connections between his essays for us. Unfortunately he doesn't, so his book serves more as reference than analysis.The final essay discusses the mainstreaming of pornography, and is out of place against the others. Unlike pot and strawberry picking, porn is neither illegal nor agriculturally based, and the essay suffers for it. An area of strength in each of the prior essays is Schlosser's documentation of laws regarding the subject, as well as fascinating though superficial and entirely too short discussions about the way the products are produced. This essay has neither, and much of its material has been covered better, more fully, and with a more original spin in other sources. The only thing porn possibly has to do with the other essays is that it was once illegal, and that it makes for a titillating subject due to its so-called underground nature.Anyway, you get the picture. This book is thoroughly average and unfinished. Each topic represents an enormous subject area. In 'Fast Food Nation' Schlosser took one subject and covered it comprehensively to great effect. Here he takes three subjects and covers each superficially. Schlosser has the potential to be an important nonfiction writer in our time, but he's just not trying hard enough here. Each of these topics deserves at least the treatment he gave Fast Food, and probably more. As they stand each of these essays leave you sadly unfulfilled, sort of like fast food."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Drugs, pornography, and cheap immigrant labor are three areas of known controversy when it comes to the buying and selling of goods and the government's attempts to regulate these economic activities. Yet all three of these areas represent growing, thriving components of the national economy. This latest book by Eric Schlosser examines these three segments of the economy, and while it provides some good insight in some areas, it misses the mark in others.In the first chapter, the author talks about the fallacies and misleading information about marijuana and how the failed war on drugs has caused countless American tragedies while doing absolutely nothing to stop this very lucrative business from continuing to thrive underground. Many people have been unnecessarily searched; had their property seized under false pretenses; and sometimes have even been killed by the drug police. Schlosser correctly points out these many travesties of the drug war, and he concludes the chapter by stating that the only logical resolution to the problem to legalize the product and tax it.The chapters on the pornography industry and migrant workers are not quite as good, but they still have some good points to make. Schlosser talks about the frustration faced by illegal workers who want a job and often give in and work in the strawberry fields of California for very low wages. They have no recourse because they are here illegally. And with the pornography industry, Schlosser seems sympathetic to those who are prosecuted for engaging in consensual activity. However, in these two chapters, Schlosser isn't very clear on what should be done to solve the problems. After the chapter on immigrant workers, all Schlosser can do is blame the free market for the problem. The situation is, of course, much more complex than that. The real issue is what to do with migrant workers. If they had full rights and if employers were held accountable for their actions, there wouldn't be a free market problem. It almost seems like Schlosser just threw this in because he couldn't think of any other way to address the issue. With the pornography chapter, Schlosser correctly states that morals cannot and should not be legislated so he manages to provide a little more guidance than he does with the migrant workers problem, but he doesn't say much beyond that.To help give this book a more humanistic side, Schlosser speaks directly to some of the people involved in these underground markets and he includes direct quotes from many of them. This is a good idea, in my opinion, because it helps the reader gain a better understanding for what is going on and what the people involved are thinking as they involve themselves in these illegal activities.Black markets, while illegal and unethical, comprise a large part of the U.S. economy. There is very little that can be done to eliminate them completely. But we, as a nation, can make some moves that would minimize the negative impacts of these underground economies. \\"Reefer Madness\\" does a decent job in showing how much damage can result when business is forced to go into hiding and he does a fair job (although incomplete) in showing what can be done in some instances to lessen the impact of the black market. These activities will never disappear, but there are many things we can do to keep the problem from getting worse, as \\"Reefer Madness\\" correctly points out."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Don't be fooled by the title. This is not some hippie counter culture drug book. It is a beautifully written scholarly examination of the underbelly of the American Society.The main theme of the book is centered around the underground economy. The author argues, by examining the underground economy of any society, one can see a more accurate and telling picture of the society as a whole. Just as individuals have public and private personas that are often in conflict, so can a society. The book focuses on the American culture and legal system.It is broken up into three essays: first an examination of the history of marijuana use and the war on drugs; second, an examination of the treatment of migrant workers; finally, an examination of pornography and obscenity laws.The threads tying these seemingly disparate subjects are sometimes blatant, sometimes subtle, but always telling. By examining how the American society deals with these issues, one can draw clear corollaries to better understand how we deal with other controversial issues facing our nation including abortion, abuse of government powers, privacy, the war, etc.. It is the examination of the rationality (or lack there of) of our policies regarding these three topics, and the ethics with which those policies are implemented, that we are left with a scathing commentary on the seemingly schizophrenic nature of the American culture and value system."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Eric Schlosser returns after \\"Fast Food Nation\\" with more interesting and researched material. He has the thoughtfulness of keeping his personal opinions out of his work and presents the facts.The black markets in America today, though a significant part of the economy, functioning in free-market form, exist everywhere. However, they don't seem to get much media coverage. This review is in regards to the portion of the book focusing on Marijuana. For example, the local television media in Seattle has repeatedly stated over the years, though seldom, that Washington state's number one export is not Apples but Marijuana. So, why the hysterical legislation, laws, Feds, and police presence regarding it. It's number 1 because there's a demand, and there will always entrepreneurs to supply a product that people want. Schlosser also examines the War on Drugs. No one can argue today, that it has even been minimally successfully.One example of the failed war on drugs in addition to price increases and violence, is the case of an Ohio man. Mark Young is now serving life in prison without possibility of parole for participating in a minor marijuana deal. In a comparison, you could approach someone, say a mother walking with her children, and blow her head off with a shot-gun and serve less time in America in most states. Whether in a moral, legal, or economic sense, we live in a nation that has simply lost most of its' common sense.One of Schlosser's solutions to reducing the sweepingly negative societal negative effects are decriminalizing marijuana. Interestingly, he doesn't support the government regulating and taxing it. Many proponents of decriminalizing Mary Jane believe they can reduce or retract Marijuana laws by giving the government a motivation to do so: more revenue via taxes, and, allowing the government to regulate it. And, regulation = control. All this would do would give the government the impetus of taking more money out of citizens' pockets. Imagine, how high those taxes would be, considering green-13 is a \\"sin\\" and would be under the guise of \\"sin taxes,\\" like cigarretes and alcohol. The government would also control who gets to grow it, how they can grow it, where they can grow it, where they can sell it, and how much they can sell it for. Like farming in America today, can you imagine large Corporate Marijuana growers? These newly government appointed bureaucratic corporate fat-cats would have lobbyists on their behalf, dig for federal subsidies, loans, federal land, and who knows what else.Schlosser is one of the nation's most insightful and effective writers in contemporary America."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"1. This book is not as strong in research, documentation or overall in-your-face persuasiveness as Fast Food Nation.2. This book was compiled and expanded from three essays previously written by the author for the Atlantic Monthly. (He's currently writing a book on the US prison system and I think this was to get another book out between FFN and that one)3. The three articles ARE DEFINITELY related. But it requires more thinking on the part of the reader. It's not laid out quite as clearly as FFN:Marijuana, illegal immigration and porn. Pot and Porn laws are mercillessly enforced and broadly condemned by politicans, yet have been shown over and over to be of no real social harm at all. Huge amounts of money wasted that could be used to fight real problems or create real benefit. Illegal immigration, on the other hand, is a horrible social disease that is swept under the rug and in practice even encouraged.The common thread is hypocrisy. The common thread is taxpayer money going to waste. The common thread is lives ruined for no reason by unnecessary AND lives ruined because necessary action wasn't taken. The common thread is the that the actions of the government are not based on what's good for the society. They seem to cater to the irrational whims of public opinion. And the result is *sinister.*4. This is a fascinating and powerful point, but it's not made as clearly as it could be.5. This book is nonetheless very much worth reading. If for no other reason than it's great cocktail party chatter to be able to talk about the porn mogul that only insiders know about.6. If you read this book, keep thinking about it after you put it down. It pays dividends."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"When looking at the title of Schlosser&#65533;s newest work, one&#65533;s first response has to be &#65533;how did he manage to cover sex, drugs, and cheap labor all in a single book?&#65533;(some might even say he couldn&#65533;t have covered their own personal experience with all in a single book). The answer, as one might have assumed, is simple&#65533;sketchily. A look at America&#65533;s underground economy, the editing begins immediately with the decision to limit such an analysis to these three gargantuan topics&#65533;clearly there&#65533;s a lot more going on in the shadow economy-- just ask the folks at RIAA.Any one of these topics would have been enough for an entire book, so if Schlosser is to be criticized for skimming through the information (which he does), it&#65533;s hard to see how, once the original decision for the book was made, he could have done otherwise. The look at cheap labor, for instance, is only a few dozen pages. The section on &#65533;drugs&#65533; is really only focused on marijuana and the laws surrounding it, and even these are occasionally tossed out more as lists than in any sort of more reflective analysis. The section on pornography is longer, which might lead you to think it&#65533;s more in depth, but just as with the drug section, Schlosser narrows his field and focuses more on a single pivotal figure in the development of pornography as a mainstream business. Its general history, modernization, feminization, incorporation, etc. are mentioned, but all too briefly. Finally, anyone who has read any recent lengthy article on any of these topics will probably not find much (beyond the individual figures themselves) new here. Even the context of the underground economy is not particularly original, as all three are oftentimes analyzed in just that context in their own right (how many articles on pot does one see that doesn&#65533;t mention the estimated amount of money spent on growing or consuming it?). And that context is weakened somewhat by the section on pornography. After all, when The Greatest Hits of Nina Hartley is being distributed daily by AOL-Time-Warner or the Marriot and Larry Flint is running for governor of California, just how underground is this business?That&#65533;s the bad. The good, and there is a lot of it, is just what one would expect from the author of Fast Food Nation. The prose is highly readable and extremely lucid. The research is well-documented, effective, clearly explained, and (mostly) seamlessly interwoven into the stories. And the personal stories (a man sentenced to life for being a middle-man in a pot deal, the long-time attempt of the federal government to indict porn purveyor Reuban Sturman, along with others) lend a sense of humanity, realism, and intimacy to the discussion, which all too often remains on the abstract level in most analyses&#65533;so many people in prison, blah blah blah. Schlosser rifles off the statistics as well, but he grounds them in the stories of real people, and that is what makes this book at least somewhat effective, despite its sketchy nature.Anyone coming to this from Fast Food Nation is probably bound to be disappointed and one wishes his publisher had convinced him (or agreed to allow him) to do a single book on each topic. Anyone not coming to it with preconceived high standards set by the author himself, and just looking for a readable, quick, informative look at each and any of these could do a lot worse."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"The title of the book, Reefer Madness, itself portrays a strong image in my mind. Eric Schlosser is ingeneous to name it so, as it introduces the first essay fairly. The section goes into great detail about the producing, hiding, buying, and selling of marijuana and its governmental punishments in America in the past and in the present.Next up to bat, is the second partition about the sex/porn industry. As done with marijuana, Eric Schlosser gives the whole package about pornography, mainly the players in the industry and how they got away with money laundering and tax evasions and more.Last but not least, the world of cheap labor, the world of illegal immigrants. The shortest section of them all, perhaps because this is the least concealed subject. The majority of people know of this, and Eric Schlosser digs out a little history and the business philosophy to explain the desire for cheap labor with disregard to the benefits of the workers.I recommend this book to anyone interested in any of the above. I enjoyed it particularly because I was learning something new every page, and gaining a better understanding of the underworld and those who run it."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Schlosser's newest work is simple, to the point and straightforward in a way in which a entire 600 page tome on each topic of marijuana, illegal immigrant workers, and pornography would be overblown and boring alongside the many that already exist. I found the writing engaging, detailed and filled with facts alongside personal/historical content. Very few opinions from Schlosser arise with exception to his conclusions. Otherwise this book sticks to the facts and figures and some are quite alarming.Reuban Sturman is almost like a small-time chump change character in the wake of the Enron boys. The chapter on porn was more or less insightful for a variety of reasons. First, Reuban was always dealing with overzealous prosecuters and wealthy backers that in the end were actually as big a crook as himself. Savings and loan scandels, offshore banking, swiss bank accounts are mostly the hallmarks of American wealthy elite. The very people that are actively locking up middle class and poor Americans that attempt to do business as they do to try and make ends meet or climb the ladder in a stagnating economic environment where your damned if you work a minimum wage job and damned if you sell some marijuana. Bush and the Enron clans are very much at falt as are Reagan and the Clintons. The supposed leaders of our country try to enforce laws with which they can't even abide by themselves, as if they are above the black market that helped create them. The reality is they are all fallible. Every last one of them, and until we change the laws to reflect our behaviors and habits Americans will suffer the consequences. If any leader had a conscious they'd release all the non-violent drug offenders and really go after the murderers or excutives skimming the cream off the the top of most Americans paychecks, $140million for Dick Grasso?? Gee I wonder why so many dotcommers are out of work?Even Flynt complains that there is \\"too much\\" pornography. It seems impossible for marijuana, software, music and porn to maintain any real value in an oversaturated market where the idea of scarcity is no longer valid. The laws against these crimes are based on 19th century thinking. They are irrational in light of the changes that have since taken place. With pronography everywhere it no longer matters to people, the same would be true of marijuana. The reality is more people occasionally use drugs than really let on, why would somebody tell the truth on a survey? It's true that people can maintain a job and have families yet still use a little every once in a blue moon. The fact that beer is everywhere doesn't mean everybody is addicted to alcohol. The logic of the drug war is childish, and more akin to a school bully mentality. If Corporate businesses can cry and complain about taxation and get away with pilfering billions in offshore accounts than laws against drugs should be taken off the books. But then with transparency the corporate types can't get away with their activites, turn the spotlight off drugs and onto the enron types and watch as renewed calls for stiffer drug penalties, more funding for DARE, prisons and the like get brought up in the house or senate.For leaders to admonish the public about the dangerous black market of internet smut, marijuana and illegal immigrants and yet have no problem with making a profit in some way from all three is the point of this book and the reason it merits 5 stars because nobody could have said it better(maybe PeterMcwilliams). I'll also say though that Fast Food Nation is good for entirely different reasons than Reefer Madness. Glad to see somebody doesn't write the same book over and over."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"This book (as manofspain correctly pointed out above) is essentially three magazine-length articles compiled into a book.This is not to say that the topics are inconsequential, or that Schlosser's treatment of them is less than honest (in fact, his personal honesty is one of the strengths of the book), but more to point out that these are at best superficial treatments of topics that deserve books of their own (in addition to those covering other aspects of the shadow (i.e. untaxed) economy).So what is this book good for? Well, it's a good intro to worlds people may not know much about. I'm planning on giving a copy to my Republican/Libertarian father-in-law for Father's Day. It's also light enough in tone that you can take it to the beach for your summer reading, although the subject matter might get you an additional search at an airport security gate. &lt;wry grin&gt;In conclusion-- Reefer Madness is not a waste of money, but it's more &quot;People&quot; magazine than &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot;. If you are willing to accept that standard going in, you'll have a good read."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Schlosser's book revealed many issues that were indeed terribly disturbing. Perhaps this book might be effective in rousing people towards social action by exposing such pernicious idiosyncracies that contribute to the problems of our society today. His narrative makes one question whether we do live in \\"the land of the free\\" through his case studies in the unjust and often ridiculous prison sentences of those convicted with marijuana (despite the severe lack of evidence and that the defendant was only charge through association). Schlosser's chapter on illegal immigrant labor, with the examples of the strawberry workers in California, has made me hesitate and wonder how much is being sacrificed and taken for granted when I go to the grocery and pick my fruits and vegetables.On the other hand, the part about pornography was more of a history description rather than an investigative analysis. Nevertheless, I will admit that that too was very engrossing. The history behind the sex industry and its moguls involves an intricate tale of indictment, tax fraud, and even the notorious mob crime families. I highly recommend this book because it compels people to think about their situation, not as an individual, but as a part of the collective unit called society. The information that the reader may uncover is not pretty and is deeply disturbing, but perhaps the best way to arouse a useful reaction in all of us is through a relatively real and high dose of shock therapy."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"An important book, from a respected journalist, this comes at a frightening time in American culture and politics.

Commercialized sex, illegal drugs and cheap labor would probably common choices of many citizens. Eric Schlosser examines the magnitude, origins, visibility, commonality and manifestations of these three mainstays of the American scene.The book is divided into three chapters, each dedicated to one of these hot-button topics. The chapter on commercialized sex examines the history of prostitution, pornography, and the recent spread of nudie bars and topless bars in the USA over the last 100 years plus. Schlosser examines the origins of peep shows, the first girlie magazines pre-Cold War, goes over the founding of Playboy and Penthouse, and the current spread of pornography over the Internet. The chapter on drugs examines the history of marijuana primarily, with some side notes on the meth plague, cocaine, and other drugs to have swept thru the American street scene. The chapter on cheap labor examines migrant and illegal labor including child labor and sweathouse labor. Both industrial and agricultural labor are included. This chapter is a natural extension of Schlosser's first book: Fast Food Nation, in that it covers the practices of slaughterhouses and farms, and extends into factories not related to food.Overall, a good book and worthy reading. Anyone in high school or above should find this book accessible, and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"There is something undeniably intriguing about a book with a neon yellow cover promising lurid tales of \\"sex, drugs, and cheap labor.\\" The seductive nature of Eric Schlosser's subject and the effective marketing behind it, however, belie the gravity of Reefer Madness.Following on the heels of his previous work, Fast Food Nation, Schlosser is keeping with the long tradition of yellow journalism in wresting the mammoth \\"informal economy,\\" better known as the black market, from the back alleys of public consciousness and putting it on display in the storefront of mainstream media. In three painfully enjoyable essays, Schlosser takes his reader on excursions through the war on marijuana, the precarious lives of immigrant farm workers, and the illicit sex industry in the United States. Schlosser paints a vivid image of hypocrisy in the policies of the U.S. government by examining the sheer strength of the underground economy and the waste of government resources in legislating morality to its citizens.The book is composed of three essays, each previously published, each revolving around what the very existence of the black market mean to America. Or, as Schlosser sums it up, \\"If the market does indeed embody the sum of all human wishes, then the secret ones are just as important as the ones that are openly displayed.\\" \\"Reefer Madness,\\" as its title hints, investigates the U.S. government's war on marijuana. \\"In the Strawberry Fields\\" delves into the lives of Southern California illegal immigrant farm workers, whose lives of virtual servitude is but one example of the reliance of the U.S. on exploitative labor, and our stunning rejection of those who provide it. The closing essay, \\"An Empire of the Obscene,\\" traces the life of America's pioneer in the pornography industry, in almost every way a Horatio Alger story of entrepreneurial success, but branded a criminal for peddling smut.The commonality in each of Schlosser's essays in this book is the exploration of the perversion of the American ideal. Weber's Protestant Ethic meets Larry Flynt, if you will. In each scenario, whether through agricultural facility and personal liberties, in the case of marijuana criminalization; immigrants in search of a better life, in the case of stigmatized farm workers; or punishing a successful businessman because of his lack of morals, Schlosser returns to the unpleasant image of America as a bundle of hypocrisies. On one level, each scenario is the embodiment of an American archetype of success. For a country that prides itself on its immigrant history, hard-work ethic, and financial success stories, it seems strange to make these folks the villains. This is what Schlosser is getting at: that these people would be heroes if the \\"American ideal\\" were anything more than a myth, and a dangerous one at that. Forgotten in that ideal, or at least rationalized somehow, is the fact that our national heritage also includes a strong grounding in Puritanical morality. This is perhaps the most dissatisfying aspect of Schlosser's book, that the exploration of our moral grounding is never explored all that deeply, though it is criticized. However, it is indisputable that Schlosser feels that the American ideal has a dangerous and powerful hold on the public consciousness, which he demonstrates repeatedly and faithfully.In his criticism of the perversion that morality can play in public judgment, Schlosser uses an interesting crusader from 19th-century New England to illustrate the degree to which Puritanism has swayed the reaction to social vices. Anthony Comstock was a grocery clerk from New York who mobilized groups such as the YMCA in the 1870s to suppress obscene materials. To Comstock's favor, in 1873 Congress passed the \\"Comstock Law,\\" which prohibited the transmittal of \\"obscene, lewd, or lascivious\\" items through the Postal Service. Crusading through the postal service lines for next several decades, Comstock harshly enforced these laws with the full support of the federal government. Comstock's motivation came largely from an incident as a young boy in which he was shown pornography by farm workers, apparently disturbing him for the rest of his life. Clearly, Schlosser presents Comstock as a caricature of zealotry that many would disregard as an episode from our distant past. However, Schlosser's intent is not merely to mock a man who many of us would regard as extremely priggish. Comstock is but one example in American history of those who have imposed a personal and moralistic agenda on the nation. American history is laced with such individuals, and, further, the public shows a large degree of acceptance for such policies.Criticism of the book is tangled with the very reasons that it is an enjoyable read. Critics on the political right would accuse him of being a left-winger with a clear agenda (like me?) in a brightly packaged polemic. An honest liberal would have little with which to disagree. But, Schlosser is not slyly interweaving his opinions into the body of these essays. He reserves opinion for the end of each essay, where he clearly states his beliefs in no uncertain terms, and what he regards as a sensible plan of action. If authors such as Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, and Ann Coulter took such an approach, they would be publishing pamphlets instead of thick volumes. So, in this regard, Schlosser is to be commended when he states clearly, without moral judgment or overstatement, in the conclusion, \\"The decriminalization of marijuana should be the first step toward a rational drug policy. The benefits would be felt immediately.\\" In fact, it is worth noting that Schlosser, like many of the authors of recent liberal polemics, provides a serious amount of research to substantiate his claims, suggesting that either liberals need to work harder to make themselves credible or that they simply have a better work ethic.The dissatisfaction that comes for a liberal reading this book is the fact that Schlosser is preaching to the choir. Although a distinguished journalist and serious investigator, his shocking statistics and exhortations for action are likely going to be met by receptive ears, which is to say, not those in positions to actually change policy. The cover and title are immediate disincentives for any Washington politicians to take a read. Further, even those who might benefit from reading Reefer Madness are unlikely to be swayed. Therefore, the question becomes what was Schlosser's motivation in writing this book? Is his intent to inform the national debates over each of these topics, or is he attempting to establish himself as a liberal? This question is a lingering one for me, and perhaps I will never find a satisfactory answer.Perhaps, ironically, Schlosser's book is attractive for the same reasons that its subjects are: it is a type of forbidden fruit. In the United States, especially in the patriotic surge following the 2001 terrorist attacks, it is unfashionable to question nationalistic conventions. If teenagers are drawn to marijuana because their parents forbid it and married men are lured by the pornography stands because they is immoral, is it also possible that disenchanted citizens are tempted by a book that portrays its government and policies as laced with duplicity?I wonder what Anthony Comstock would say?"},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"In his second book, Reefer Madness, Eric Schlosser explores the inner workings of three underground kingpins: marijuana, migrant labor, and pornography. Many of his arguments bring up compelling concepts and intriguing ideas that question the function and necessity of these unspoken institutions. While each page is riddled with facts and trivia about this under ground economy, the book fails to live up to its predecessor, Fast Food Nation. Reefer Madness, which is comprised of three essays, focuses more shallowly on these three topics where as Fast Food Nation delves deep into the nitty gritty details of one. Reefer Madness would have been much better as three books than one, especially since Schlosser never really connects the three in any way besides the fact that they are handled under the counter. Even with that connection, pornography is legal and therefore not really all that under ground. Reefer Madness is an interesting read, however nothing in comparison the Schlosser's previous work."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"What do porn, pot and strawberries have in common? Leave it to Eric Schlosser to find the connection...money. And not just money, but under the table money...black market money that fuels our economy to the tune of billions each year. According to Schlosser those billions are only increasing and it's due in part to America's war on porn, war on immigration and it's war on drugs. Three failed political agendas that cost far more than they're often worth. Agendas that only seem to exasperate the problem they are trying to fix.\\"Reefer Madness\\" is a book broken into three parts, the war on pot, the abuse of migrate farm workers, and the crusade against porn.In part one Schlosser focuses mostly on the question of sentencing rights in drug cases. Because of the \\"War on Drugs\\" it is not uncommon to go to jail for pot years longer than a rapist or murderer. Such policies have push a penal system to the brink, overcrowding prisons and forcing out dangerous criminals while pot growers and dealers take their place.In part two, we learn about a new form of sharecropping that's springing up in California and that relies almost solely of illegal immigration.Part three focuses on Reuben Sturman, an underground porno king that defied the U.S. Government at every step, until his greed got the better of him.The book uses black market money to connect the three essays, and it's a fair connection, but each of these sections really goes off in it's own direction leaving me to think that the essays really are worthy of their own books. Even though I was shocked and angered by Schlosser dazzling reporting I kept wanting more. Schlosser never really goes into how the FCC is now going after perceived indecency on cable television. He never really looks beyond pot in the first section or beyond California in the second. I realize that these subjects are extremely complicated but by paring these brief reports with each other he weakens his overall message or messages. As a result \\"Refer Madness\\" will never have the impact that \\"Fast Food Nation\\" had which is sad because it's message is just as, if not more, important."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Utlizing 3 case studies related to marijuana cultivation and distribution, illegant immigrant workers, and the pornography industry, Schlosser does an excellent job in providing a scintillating look at the underbelly of the black market American economy. The most favorite section of mine is the profile of the evolution of the pornography industry from the 1970s into the Internet Age. Having survived numerous obsenity and indecency charges levied in various court districts, pornography, has not only become a multi-billion dollar industry but a mainstay revenue source for giant Fortune 500 corporations such as General Motors. The battle of the porn industry to achieve legal rights for distribution is well chronicled through the case of a former Cleveland based, comic book reseller who went on to become one of the richest profiteers in the history of the porn industry, Rueben Sturman. Well done follow-up to the immensely successful Fast Food Nation. While this is much more jumpy and less tied together, it is still highly informative and perception shattering. Looking forward to future Schlosser muckracking entendres."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"If you're one of those people who enjoys your ignorance, stay away from Reefer Madness. Author Eric Schlosser uses a blend of anecdotes and hard statistics to paint a vivid picture of three shadier avenues of American life- the marijuana trade, illegal farm workers, and pornography.I disagree with the other reviewer's criticisms that Schlosser does not do enough to give a clear focus to his work. The best muckraking presents facts for readers in a vivid way and then lets readers decide for themselves. The most compelling part of the book is the section on marijuana.As Scholsser points out, marijuana is a ubiquitous substance in America today. I knew that much, but before reading I hadn't understood the extent to which it is cultivated right here in the USA. (I'd always imagined offshore Rastifarians motorboting the stuff in out of the Carribean, nicely toasted themselves as they come.) Schlosser paints a vivid picture of those who grow and distribute marijuana, and clearly demonstrtes the injustices that have been foisted on them. I don't want to give too much away, but how can a life prison sentence for smuggling drugs ever be justified? The focus on the \\"bad guys\\" humanizes a group that is too often demonized and who may, in the future, be recognized as entrepeneurs. Also very valuable to me were the comments the author gathered from law-abiding citizens regarding people who use, grow and sell marijuana. He has, I feel, done a good job placing the drug in the context of our culture, and shows how the market operates whether the government would like it to or not. Reading the essay, one is left with the impression that the government's enforcement of anti-marijuana laws has much more to do with politics that with protecting the American people. Having read the essay, I truly believe that if all anti-marijuana laws were repealed tomorrow, Americans would wind up safer, happier and richer than they are today. I dare anyone who disagrees with me to defend their position AFTER reading this book.Whether you are a student writing a project on law enforcement or drug use, a law enforcement official looking for insight into your quarry, or simply a citizen who wants to be a more informed voter, I reccomend reading the first third of the book. It will show you how baffling, arbitrary, and counterproductive US marijuana policy is. Schlosser goes far enough in suggesting one solution for the marijuana \\"problem\\"- legalize it and tax it, just like cigarettes. It's up to the rest of us to become informed enough and implement this or another more sensible policy.The other essays lack some of the verve and captivating qualities of \\"Reefer Maddness\\", but are a cut above the average and are worth reading if the subjects interest you particularly. They do have the same virtue of allowing the facts to speak for themselves."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"After bring impressed with &quot;Fast Food Nation,&quot; I began &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; with high expectations which simply were not met. While the book is reasonably well-researched, there is simply too much preaching. The obvious biases of the author in all three essays (!) brings the accuracy of his hard data into question. The writing style is rather dry, which makes a strange climate for the sensationalism of Schlosser's claims. This book is neither as objective, nor as well-researched (there are more field anecdotes and narrative history than hard numbers), nor as interesting as &quot;Fast Food Nation.&quot; What a shame."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Upon purchasing 'Reefer Madness' I thought it would be a detailed account at America's obsession with the criminalization of marijuana users. Wrong. Perhaps a third of the book is on this topic, then the author proceeds to address such heady subjects as illegal immigration and pornography to fill in the rest of the pages. Beyond this the author has almost a hundred pages on notes and an index. So yes, I was disappointed.But it has to be said the author had done his homework, and he writes well. He does raise some very provocative subjects and handles them in a mature fashion. But ultimately he does not cover enough of each topic, not by a long shot. I was left wanting more.Bottom line: the author has done much better with 'Fast Food Nation'. Missable."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"this was a very informative and interesting book to read. i enjoyed it a lot. the only thing i didnt like was the &quot;cheap labor&quot; section, mainly b/c that is just not something i am interested in. but, that is a very small portion of the book."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Eric Schlosser's Reefer Madness is an excellent follow-up to his first book-length investigative journalism masterpiece, Fast Food Nation.Reefer Madness shows the breadth and depth of the American black market. He shows how trade in marijuana, migrant workers, and pornography is affected by the extent to which each is affected by the underground economy. His recommended solutions do not go as far as I would like in eliminating the black market. For example, he would decriminalize marijuana rather than regulating and taxing it. This being said, everyone should read this book. It will open your eyes to the reality of the massive underground economy we have in the United States -- nearly all of it created by restrictive government policies."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"This book makes some really great points about the underground economy and how much it affects this country."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"This book went to a new level of muckraking. Not only was it just as powerful as Fast Food Nation but it hit right at home. I believe more people can connect with Reefer madness from all ranges of age. I felt that as a teenager this book was more interesting on a personal level. How does this guy do it?"},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"I had read Eric Schlosser earlier book, Fast Food Nation -a book that made an impression on me -this book, by contrast, is a major disappointment.It was far too one sided - if I had handed this same text in as part of a term paper in High School my teacher would have returned it to me and said something along the lines of &quot;this is not acceptable&quot;. Mr. Schlosser appears to have reached a conclusion and thereafter only includes information that directly supports that conclusion. Ironically I would have to say I likely agree with most of the author's claims - I simply would take a more balanced and comprehensive view of the issues.That the author did not present a more balanced book is rather unfortunate - the issue of low cost or cheap labor is important enough to warrant more thought than the author bothered to put forth.Having leveled that criticism I would not say the book is not worth the cover price. It was and I would recommend the book to anyone who would also have the opportunity to read other books on the subjects as well. I would also take a chance and purchase a future book by the author."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Pulp Non-FictionThis book is a collection three stories: A marijuana bust, illegal immigrants avoiding busts and a porn bust. The connections are not obvious, and Schlosser doesn't make much of a case to link them. As such, I've spent more time puzzling over the links than reading the book itself.It seems the stories outline America's curious method of managing consumer behavior and mass marketing practices. Schlosser doesn't consciously investigate mass marketing as a subject, but the technology of global marketing is the thread that holds these stories together. By 'global marketing', I mean TV, radio, the internet, etc. I also allude to the global distribution systems that companies like Wal-Mart, GM and Sony have established.The technology of global marketing is designed to evoke consumer demand. Consumers are trained to focus on specific brands by relentless repetition of inconsequential jingles, imagery and metaphors. Despite our high opinion of 'free-will', we are creatures of habit and rarely think about those that manage our habits (except for mom, maybe).This book is about the underbelly of the system. Freedom of expression is a highly praised feature of American life, but can we let someone employ the technologies of mass advertising to sell cocaine and a evening at the brothel?As every good American knows, the mass marketers must be controlled. The American solution is product criminalization (prohibition). It is no coincidence that prohibition of alcohol and modern mass marketing emerge together in the late 19th century American experience.In this light, the book is a set of case studies in American efforts to control global marketing of these 'too easy to sell' products. The focus is our curious selective criminalization of producer/distribution roles. In the case of (cheap) strawberries, the picker goes to jail. In the case of marijuana, the middlemen get the longest jail sentences. In the case of porn, the newly-rich get shut down by the 'establishment' and their lawyers.This story can be told with statistics and theory, but that wouldn't sell many books. Naylor has a nice book on the subject, Wages of Crime: Black Markets, Illegal Finance, and the Underworld Economy. It has an Amazon ranking of about 285,000. Not a best seller. Schlosser has a different marketing plan and it seems to work. Schlosser's book has an Amazon ranking of 80.I call his technique 'Pulp Non-Fiction'. Schlosser retells each 'bust' (or non-bust) in terms of a Perils of Pauline plot line. In the genre of 'true detective', he offers us the titillation of pulp-fiction with the moral righteousness of Upton Sinclair's 'The Jungle.' Injustice is the subject, corporations the villain and titillation the emotional thread.I think there are a lot of people looking for a sense of what is creating a black market in America, but the sucker emotional narrative of this book is part of the problem. It is the same sort of emotionalism that politicians use to get elected and mass marketers use to 'increase demand'. I doubt that many will put the pieces together and get more than the titillation value.Don't get me wrong, the guy writes good pulp. It's not a hard book to read."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Although it is slow at some points, I enjoyed this book. I found the information that Schlosser had to offer fascinating. If you liked Fast Food Nation, you'll enjoy Reefer Madness."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Welcome to the dark, where some things are happy to be left. Schlosser dances along the fence of our perceived morality by presenting three very underground markets and how they have evolved from their shadowy births to their magnificent prosperity--independent prosperity, that is. Untaxed money, radical employee/employer relationships, and incredible law interpretation are presented in the baited environments of porn, marijuana, and strawberry pickers. Yep, even the strawberry picker. Schlosser has once again, as he did in Fast Food Nation, brought to light the underbelly of the beast with the faintest of biases, leaving the reader to realize that capitalism is alive and well just about everywhere in this country and that right and wrong are but peripheral considerations in the end. The bottom line will always be the hand that rules."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Let me start by saying that I do not give detailed reviews of the books that I offer my opinions on. If you want to know exactly what is in the book, read every other review on this page. I just give my opinion, so here we go:I fell in love with Schlosser's first book, \\"Fast Food Nation\\", and anticipated enjoying this book as well. I have to say that the three topics covered in this book were interesting to me and I expected Schlosser to cover them with the unflinching reality that he brought to his first book. While he did a great job of presenting the facts in what I feel was an unbiased, professional manner, he fell short in translating these facts and stories into anything that moved me. It was like reading a report. While he has to remain unbiased, he still has to present the facts in a way that evokes some sort of feeling from the reader. What he did so masterfully in \\"Fast Food Nation\\" was lost in this sophomore work. I left each of the three topics feeling that, while the information was presented expertly, it was just information. What's the point? I understand that we are losing the fight that we shouldn't be fighting against marijuana. I understand that migrant farm workers create their own third-world in the middle of America. I also understand that the moral majority has their eyes closed to the fact that porn is an expression of human nature. I get all of this. What I want is to learn something new. This felt like a term paper that never went out on a limb. You have to give it a \\"B\\" for effort, clarity and style, but I never once put it down and thought for more than 5 minutes on any of the subjects.Overall, I have to say that it was a good read (particularly because I enjoy Schlosser's writing style and voice), but this one just doesn't live up to the writer's potent reputation."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"This book was a big disappointment. I was eager to open the cover after the tremendous Fast Food Nation, but this book is just a sad set of diatribes on 3 unreleated topics: marijuana, strawberry picking, and pornography.Much space is wasted on the first topic describing the crimes and severe sentencing for a pot trafficer, as if this is news to anyone. Why not write about the millions of small neighborhood dealers, the casual and everyday users (including some state court judges), the cartels, the local vice squads, etc.? Apparently this would have required Eric to do some actual field research, rather than a few jailhouse interviews. We don't need to spend $24 to learn that the mandatory minimum sentences have filled prisons with nonviolent narcotics offenders.The second topic, though purportedly related to the first by virtue of the fact that the illegal aliens who pick strawberries are part of the underground economy, is in fact a completely separate piece that is more relevant to the issues raised in Fast Food Nation. Yes, the living conditions for immigrant farmworkers are far from ideal, but is this really news? And is this really a problem? The workers make 10x the amount they could make in Mexico, and we get cheaper food products.The third topic is again unreleated to the first two, and serves mainly to provide a biography of the man responsible for distributing pornographic magazines through adult bookstores. Not only is the rendition dull, but it is of little relevance in today's internet driven industry. Why not write about the people who create the internet sites, the people who act and model for adult print/internet/dvd materials, the people who work in the clubs found in all major cities, and the amateurs who are bypassing the system by hawking their wares directly to the public, not to mention the people who work in the prostitution industry (both illegal aliens and abused kids)? Again, this would apparently Eric to conduct some actual field research as opposed to a few interviews with the IRS agents.Do not under any circumstances pay full price for this book, it is not anywhere near the quality of Fast Food Nation. Eric, we deserve better."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"I found this book to be incredibly disorganized and scattered.

I was disappointed after reading his earlier work."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"A very good collection of 3 essays that each probably deserve a book of their own by this writer.

It is discouraging and disappointing that people can go to jail for multi-year sentences for marijuana possesion and have longer terms than people convicted of assultStrikes me that the easiest way to take on the undeground economy is to eliminate cash - make all transactions either stored value cards, credit cards, debit cards or cheque cards...."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"The story is basically about the American Black Market. The things that he is very strong on are marijuana, cheap labor that is done by immigrants, and pornography. He also talks about the major role marijuana has taken in the American Society. He also said that The American policy has done far from harm than good. The main thing that I was able to get from the chapter about drugs was that he wants to keep the drug education honest and present. He also refuses to propose a long-term goal of fully legalizing marijuana, essentially meaning that the drug would remain in an underground economy.One other subject that he touches on is cheap labor that is mostly done by immigrants. I think he made a strong point when he said that employers have to be the ones that re responsible for their hiring practices. An example that he had was the strawberry fields in California and how they were using immigrants to do the cheap labor. In conclusion I though that this book was okay but not really what I was expecting because there were parts where it was kind of boring. I mean I heard a lot of good things about his other books but in this book it wasn't what I was expecting sorry to say."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"I, too a fan of FFN, was expecting another stellar investigative journal novel from Schlosser. I agree with the other reviews: the marajuana conspiracy chapter was the best written, and could have made for an entire book itself. The immigration chapter was majorly disappointing! There is so much more to the issue, that needs to be researched and brought to the \\"average joe\\"'s attention.In my opinion, the last chapter on porn was boring. Certainly a history lesson - and lengthy at that - which loses focus on the issue of pornography and as it relates to the society at large. Instead it provides a biography for those interested. I wasn't, and never finished the book.I give a four star rating based on the excellent first chapter. That alone is worth the price."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"This book caters to a varity of differnt readers in several differnt ways.

I enjoyed Schlosser's style of telling this story immensely, and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"I really enjoyed eric schlosser's previous work, fast food nation, so i was expecting a lot from reefer madness. It's a collection of schlosser's magazine articles as opposed to a book so the three essays don't exactly work together to produce a singular work. However each essay does provide a pretty good understanding of each issue. The underground economy is a pretty big sector of our economy that needs to be looked. Most people participate in it to some extent since it includes certain mundane things like babysitting and lardwork for cash that goes unreported.The first essay deals with marijuana and the effect it is had. Over time, marijuana has been increasinly cultivated domestically often in places like the midwest and kentucky so a very middle american thing really. It furthere goes into how there is a great variety of punishment depending on where you are and how sometimes the punishment can seem severe. The second essay deals with migrant farm workers, mainly those who work on the strawberry fields in California. It looks at things like the effect of agriculture, minimum wages, union and ill-legal immigration affect our society. The last essay deals with the pornograph industry looking at how it has increased over time and government attempt to limit it.Pretty good overall though schlosser could have written a book on each one of the three topics."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"\\"Reefer Madness\\", by Eric Schlosser is written in three main sections. There is a section on the underground marijuana trade, the migrant labor trade and the porn industry.Unlike many reviewers, I think the author made a wonderful point. All three activities are illegal, yet they thrive and produce copious amounts of profits for the people involved. Often that profit is taken at the expense of the workers, and they do not share in this bounty. His theme is that if these activities were legalized, or regulated, they would produce income for the country at little harm to society.I do think the author made a mistake in incorporating the three subjects together in the same book. While well written, the thread that holds the three together in tenuous, at best, and he would have made a better choice by examining each of the subjects, in more detail, in separate books. That is the reason I gave the book only three stars.The writing is clear, and the research is unmistakably that of Eric Schlosser. I would recommend the book if you want to learn more abut each of these underground activates or if you are a fan of the author. It is also a good boo to be used to stir up discussion on any of the three subjects, or all three at once."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"This book had a similar affect on me to &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot;: I would read it until I got too angry and had to put it down. Much like the earlier book when you are done you will feel informed. You will also feel used, sold to, lied to and manipulated. It will leave you wondering if there is a single industry left on earth that has any integrity.Don't just get angry, get involved and do something about it."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Having read the author's previous book, and holding the same reservations that anyone would have about follow-ups (that it won't be nearly as good as the first outing), I picked up this book and set it aside for a quiet time. When I finally got around to reading Reefer Madness, I found I could not put it down. Time literally stopped, and some passages merited second and third readings. On his second try, Schlosser delivered big-time, and while more of an academic essay and an ad populum appeal to values than hard-hitting investigative journalism, it still manages to uphold the tradition of excellence in muckraking journalism.The book consists of three extended essays on such diverse but inter-linked topics as pornography, marijuana and migrant, specifically illegal agricultural, labor. The subjects are inter-linked because first they are part of a vibrant, free-wheeling and dynamic underground economy in America, and second there have been some rather unusual linkages between the two. One colorful example of such linkages is the fact that many enterprising drug producers have on occasion used illegal migrant labor to tend to marijuana crops in out of the way places. Another very colorful (or disturbing, depending on your point of view) example is the prolific use of marijuana and other illegal drugs as inducements to get participants to perform certain acts in the pornography industry or as a means of obtaining such drugs (which for some reason, the author fails to mention, even though numerous anecdotal affirmations of this are available).Nonetheless, each activity represents Big Business in America. One of the three, pornography, has made the transition from the fringe to mainstream business, and because of this, does not really count as a true underground activity, at least in my mind. The problem of illegal migrant labor has been knowingly overlooked as a result of a gentlemen's agreement between corporations (which would not be nearly as profitable without it) and the government (which would prefer to use as little of its resources as possible policing this problem). On the other hand, the marijuana trade has been and is patently illegal, and the author suspects that this state of affairs will change, moving towards that of pornography, or that of illegal migrant labor. The situation for each of these industries, beginning with their history, the extent of activity currently in each sphere, and the impact each has had, particularly on those who participate in each sphere, is covered in a fair amount of detail.The book exposes how We The People really get what we want, and reveals an undisclosed truth as to how our economic and social order really maintains itself. For example, food has become cheaper over time in no small part because of our government's stance on migrant labor. Of course, there are the occasional crackdowns and sensational raids, but that merely goes through the motions and panders to the Press and flag-waving conservatives. As such, more than a few adherents of the Back to the Land Movement and Ecological Farming ideologies should take note.It also reveals the gross double standard we apply to those who are governed and those who do the governing. American Express, I believe, once advertised its credit with the phrase 'Membership has its Priviledges'. Something similar can be said about our ruling elite, who overturn drug (and other) convictions on their relatives and cronies, but throw the book at the average wage earning schmuck.Granted, the second chapter, In the Strawberry Fields, covers not only illegal farm labor but also the California agricultural industry. However, the industry as a whole is totally dependent on either illegal migrant labor or laborers who receive neither a living wage nor health benefits. The third chapter, An Empire of the Obscene, intertwines the growth of pornography with the exploits of perhaps the most famous elder statesman of smut, Reuben Sturman. Mr. Sturman was the most successful entrepreneur of porn, whose marketing skills and innovative insights literally formed the modern day adult industry. He also proved himself to be a very interesting character study, being an unusual blend of savvy salesman, entrepreneur, flag-waving patriot and conservative family-man. Mr. Sturman also took on the formidable federal government by becoming a most unlikely champion of first amendent rights, and won while simultaneously dodging his taxes and thumbing his nose at the IRS. This colorful character alone would make for very interesting reading in a separate book.As a whole, the book takes a Progressive stance towards each of these activities, focusing on the effects each has on the people directly involved in the particular activity. While there exists some grousing about the free market and capitalism, particularly in the preface, The Underground, and the epilogue, Out of the Underground, the content, I believe, will provide positive reinforcement for many that are for social justice (and Pro-Pot and Pro-Porn) and will spark some heated debates. Reefer Madness definitely makes for good, fascinating reading, and I bet that if one were to lend his or her copy to a friend, he or she would never see the book again."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Schlosser scores another hit - if you haven't read his Fast Food Nation there is something wrong with you - with this missive about 3 disparate subjects. Schlosser blends reportage with historical information and keen personal insight. His view of 'all things american' doesn't rely on gloss or political correctness. I can imagine that most people won't have the social concience to read this book, they'll stick with Martha Stewart.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Reefer Madness is a collection of 3 extended essays about the underground market in America for marijuana, migrant workers, and pornography. The author has focused primarily on the economic aspects of the underground. The topics themselves are quite interesting. Reading about the strict laws against marijuana use are both frightening and mind-boggling. How can consuming something as harmless as a joint warrant a harsher sentence than what is often handed out to murderers or other violent criminals? How is the US contributing to the influx of illegal immigrants in the US by failing to regulate agricultural growers who employ migrant laborers from Mexico for little to nothing? What does the overwhelming consumption of porn in the US reveal about how out of touch mainstream thought and criticism regarding porn are from what many people feel about it privately? The point being there is never an absence of food for thought. Schlosser feels that few laws albeit strictly enforced ones and government regulation of certain areas like business and worker's rights are necessary to produce the kind of equal and fair economy and country that most people espouse. Few would disagree with him there. Ultimately though, this book is somewhat stilted and doesn't form a very cohesive whole. While some of the essays seem to hold great promise they aren't developed enough and seem to be a little helter-skelter. As if the author gathered up his information from previous papers and interviews and decided to just throw it together to form a book. You understand his position but not convincingly. I am sure the author was riding a high after his previous success with Fast Food Nation but this book fizzles and eventually becomes less than hoped for. Once again, interesting food for thought but to feel sufficiently informed about these subjects you'll have to turn elsewhere for more detailed and channeled knowledge."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"This book is similar to his first one, Fast Food Nation, so I'll say basically the same thing I said about that one. If everyone had to read this book our country would be in better shape. This is an eye opening, life changing book that'll make you seriously question the policies and economics of our country. Read it and wake up!"},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"To be quite honest i really hate reading. This book really grasped my attention, and it really enlightened my sence of the economy and what we really dont know about it. This book i had to read for my senior class, economics. I am really glad that i got the oppurnity to read these essays put into this book. The next book i will be reading is Fast Food Nations, in the hopes that it will be as good as this noval was. My take is that we know that things go on however we dont really know how much that they effect our economy as a whole. I really recommend this book, hoping that you benifit as much as i did."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"This book asks a lot of questions, and points out many imperfections in American society. If drugs, porno, and illegal aliens are so bad why are the so pervasive in our country? If these things are so common in a democracy why are they illegal?"},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Seemed more like three short stories which were not very well developed. I'd suggest you spend your money elsewhere."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Fast Food nation is still the superior work but Schlosser still provides a compelling read in his follow up effort. No one is surprised that Fast Food is bad for them, but most Americans give very little thought to the relationship our government has with these underground economies. If you don't employ illegal workers, own a business in the sex trade, or have dealt with the justice system for your marijuana use, you need to read this book and learn something about the actions of our government and society. We hear the rhetoric, but Schlosser does a masterful job of exposing how these systems work, who they benefit, and the substantial gulf between what our leaders say and what they do. The author could tie the essays together more tightly to a central theme, but this is a muckraking piece that throws muck on the govt and on all of us consumers who enjoy the products (cheap produce, weed, and porn) but would moralize about how they get to us. The fact remains that most of us won't care too much about these hypocrises until they hit us or someone we care about, but at least we won't have the excuse that we weren't warned"},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Let me start by saying I thought Fast Food Nation was great. Reefer Madness (&quot;RM&quot;) falls far short of that standard, though.In essence, RM is a collection of what should really be three magazine articles. Further, some examples/stories are stretched out so long that it seems that the author is just trying to fill up space.For example, the longest section of the book is supposedly about the Porn industry. RM spends so much time on the story of a particular Porn businessperson that the book seems more like a bio of his life than a study of the underground Porn economy.RM claims to be about the huge underground/black market economy, but, the three sections (pot, migrant workers &amp; Porn) seem largely unconnected. The book has no cohesive thesis or point.On the plus side, the author is a skilled storyteller and he does a good job of telling the stories of the players in the different industries."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"I read this book as I am interested in the topic of how the war on drugs has hurt our country more than helped it, and was looking for more information. However, it was the section on immigration that changed my life. Until I read this book I used to be pretty liberal Florida Democrat and a bit of an environmentalist. The only two people I have voted for president that won were jimmy Carter and Al Gore. After I read in this book the speech Sen Kennedy made in 1965 after changing our conservative immigration laws to an open door policy favoring non traditional immigrants that has flooded our country with millions of immigrants a year I became outraged. Everything the critics in 1965 said would happen as a result of the chnge in our immigration laws has come true in spades! In 1986 the criticisms of the 1986 amnesty of illegal immigrants also came true. Everything Kennedy and his pro amnesty open border traitors has said has been a lie.Without the massive amount of immigration that has taken place in the last 40 years our population would be stable, with the current tidal wave of immigration we will have a population of close to one billion in my grandchildrens lifetime! Unlimited immigration for an unlimited time is unsustainable. Yet all debate on immigration or population growth is shut down with cries of racism. Read the speeches Kennedy gave in 1965 and 1986 about immigration and amnesty and you will be angry too. For more information on how the tidal wave of immigration is affecting our country go to [...] and read this book."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Suffice to say it's a wonderful read, eye opening and well thought out.Unfortunately, it has a title that will automatically dissuade the people who need to read it from doing so--along with the fact that it is a book.For God's sake, don't casually recommend it by name to anyone who's not very bright; they'll start rumors about you if you do.Highly recommended.Michael"},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"This is the second Eric Schlosser book I've read and it met my high expectations. He is an amazing journalist and is bold with the topics and ideas he sheds light on. Reefer Madness puts the pieces together, and realistically portrays the abundance of underground economies and its effect on the free market. I found many of his judgments have been brought to my attention before, but finally it was laid out before my eyes with great evidence. Although at times I found it both repetitive and plentiful of facts, I still thought this was a great read, and helped open my eyes to the present challenges of the American economy."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"I now know more about drug and obscenity laws than I ever imagined I'd need the brain cell storage to accommodate ... and that's a peculiarly good thing. I came out of this book with a new set of unlikely personal heroes - men and women who first challenged the absurdly restrictive obscenity laws in order to make health and birth control information legal to ship through the US mail ... and even folks like the irrepressibly obnoxious Larry Flynt, who is in some respects our nation's last defense against enforced, legislated morality. Read about the bizarre, inconsistent and patently ridiculous drug laws that keep marijuana users under a heavier legal boot than convicted child rapists. Find out why I will never again, so long as I live, spend money at a Taco Bell. If this seems like a broad spread to cover in one book, that's because part of the beauty of Schlosser is his ability to ferret out the very real connections between legitimate business and the black markets that we (as the blindly consuming public) may never suspect.In our present culture of conspicuous censorship and our lamely moral-high-ground-napping political climate, this is a highly instructive read. GO AND GET IT. Consider it your civic duty to educate yourself on what your government and its corporate cohorts are really up to while you're not watching."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"It's really three separate books, or perhaps three magazine pieces. Each is an excellent piece of investigative journalism. He investigates the marihuana industry, migrant labor, and pornography, in each case using the stories of one or two individuals as a focus. There's a lot of gripping human interest, suspense-filled action, and crusading exposure of injustice.He does have an unifying message, about the opressiveness of government, which is spelled out in a short afterword but really each piece stands alone and this affects readability. There are no cross-references between the three pieces. Taken individually each one is great. Advocates for marihuana legalisation will cheer through the first piece but yawn through the other two.If you're a First-Amendment-loving card-carrying ACLU member you'll enjoy the third piece best.The other problem with constructing a book in this way is that each piece is too short to give full space to opposing viewpoints. If these had been articles in Atlantic Monthly or the New York Times we would have had an interesting extra dimension. Readers' letters would have come in, with corrections and counter-arguments, and Schlosser would have replied to them. We miss this in book form."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"Sex, Drugs and Illegal Immigrants. With topics like that, there is no way the book could be dull, right? Well. . . Schlosser did it, at least in parts of this collection of three essays.There is very little in here that you won't come across somewhere else. He spends a lot of time talking about the crazy sentencing guidelines we have for Marijuana crimes, which is important and interesting, but not new. Similarly, the plight of illegal immigrants in California and porn purveyors has been done.That said, Schlosser does not how to tell a good story. He can get you pretty fired up about the injustice of it all, particularly with the Marijuana prison sentences for small time criminals.A more serious complaint is that Schlosser doesn't give much thought to the other side of the issue. You might not like the drug laws, but at least acknowledge why the issue is difficult.Overall, not a bad read for, say, an airplane, but you might be better served picking up an Atlantic Monthly."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"The premise of the book is simple - the impact of black market in three different fields - drug (specifically pot), porn, and illegal immigrants is much more than acknowledged...but the organization of the book doesn't live up to the reputation of the author. Both books by the author, undoubtedly deserves critical acclaim and serious attention. However, the current book pales in comparison with the well-organized, single-themed Fast Food Nation. Nevertheless, the book does raise interesting questions in an apolitical way and each of the three disparate segments in the book is a great &quot;essay&quot; in itself. Each of the segments uses a slightly different narrative style ranging from reporting to some character profiling, all interspersed with some stark observations and interesting questions. For any of the three problems highlighted in the book, the author doesn't offer any analysis on what needs to be done to alleviate any of the issues raised. That drawback diminishes the value of the arguments to a small extent. Apart from the above minor complaint and the lack of a common thread connecting the three topics, the book is an excellent read and is highly recommended for any serious reader."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"With Reefer Madness, Eric Schlosser provides us with another extraordinary piece of reporting. This work is well documented (a large number of pages are deveoted to notes and references) and is a compelling, hard to put down read. Perhaps the most important theme that unifies the three essays in this book is how the US Government manipulates the moral and legal arguments for or against an issue (legalizing marijuana or cheap farm labor, for example) in order to meet its needs or agenda. An eye opening look at three underground industries and at our own dishonest policymakers."},{"Title":"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market","review":"I'd love to write as well as Eric Schlosser, but maybe that's why he's the bestseller. With such a gift he should say more.He makes a good case against the War on Drugs as it pertains to marijuana. He gives the history of Harry Anslinger, the DEA, the politicos from the 40s through today. He tells how the crop is grown, harvested and distributed. How it has benefited from agricultural advances.He'll sell a ton of copies because of &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot;. A far better book, by a guy who lost blood earning his story, is &quot;The Big White Lie&quot; by Michael Levine. I flog this book because it is out of print and seems to have had a short run. A chapter is available in &quot;Into the Buzzsaw&quot;Though Schlosser is sympathetic to the immigrants he limns in his second and shortest essay, he does not venture much in the way of suggestions as to a policy for dealing with them. Of the many books on the subject I most highly recommend the section from &quot;Diversity in America&quot;. For well reasoned though passionate positions on the matter see online research by the Human Biodiversity Institute.As for porn, so what? Like it or not there isn't much we can do about it. Yawn."},{"Title":"Audel House Wiring (Audel Technical Trades Series)","review":"This book was made available by amazon.com and was relatively inexpensive and very informative, providing hours of guidance with good pictures.

I borrowed the book and read through a few chapters,I then realized this was the best vascular book I have ever read. There are a lot of vascular books out there, however none compare to this one. After reading through this, I found all of the diagrams and definitions were much easier to retain and understand then all of the other vascular books on the market. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning vascular ultrasound."},{"Title":"Techniques in Non-Invasive Vascular Diagnosis: An Encyclopedia of Vascular Testing","review":"I am a program director of a sonography school. I have been looking for a vascular book that is properly organized AND has enough depth to pass the boards. This book is organized as it should be. First covering anatomy and physiology and then focussing in on the actual tests that are performed in a modern vascular lab. So many \\"highly acclaimed\\" books are scattered, with emphasis on a \\"technique\\" such as PPG, that you are lost as to how it should really be used. I could easily build a course around this book. However, it is very skimpy on details. It may tell you how to perform the test but the subtleties of interpretation are lacking."},{"Title":"Techniques in Non-Invasive Vascular Diagnosis: An Encyclopedia of Vascular Testing","review":"This book contains a lot of good vascular information. Some of my negatives would be that the chapters dont list the chap at the top of each page, so it's difficult to find where the chapters actually start.

The departure point for this book was the 100 million word electronic corpus of texts of the COBUILD project. These texts, representative of the language, were analyzed for frequency of words and for their patterning. The grammar is the second main work which resulted from this initiative by Birmingham University and Collins, the other being a Dictionary. All the examples in the book are taken from this enormous database, and there are 'real' rather than made up to illustrate a point. The other useful feature is boxes of words that behave like the point under discussion. This allows users to 'do things' with the langauge rather than just understand it."},{"Title":"From This Moment On: A Guide for Those Recently Diagnosed with Cancer","review":"Arlene, wherever you are - you have written a wonderful book for cancer patients and survivors!
