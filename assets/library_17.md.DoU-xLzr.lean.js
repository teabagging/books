This book offers a lengthy guide to homemade beer, complete with reference material about the different styles of beer; how they are made, how strong they typically are, and other basics.Part of the reason Papazian's first book was so much fun was due to its writing style and humor. This, the follow- up, is more technical in nature and not quite as entertaining to read. It sticks mostly to the facts and leaves out much of the fun, making it a little more likely to induce sleep than inspiration.

The plot is expertly crafted and well nuanced, keeping the reader turning the pages. With dialogue that rings true, it makes for a riveting read.The story revolves around a young woman, Donna Edmunds, who works for an advertising agency. She meets a very handsome man, Victor Cressy, at a company party, and he wines and dines her in dramatic fashion, sweeping her off her feet. Finding him to be a fantastic and attentive lover, as well, he is the man of her dreams. When he proposes two months later, she accepts, thinking that she has died and gone to heaven. What she does not know is that she in on her way to living a hell on earth. You see, Victor Cressy is a sociopath.At first, the change in Victor and their relationship was imperceptible. It began subtly with a question here, a question there, a suggestion here, a suggestion there. It then escalated to demands that had to be met, assertions of imagined slights, rules that had to be obeyed. Victor separated Donna from her old friends and family, until her isolation was total. It finally culminated in a control so complete that Donna, as a person in her own right, no longer existed. The cycle of extreme and profound psychological abuse had attained its goal. The old Donna was merely a memory, as the new Donna was too afraid to say anything, do anything, or opine on anything. Instead, a Stepford wife with two children had replaced her.In reality, Donna was a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown, an enigma to all who would meet her, asserting herself in bizarre ways which were only a cry for help . One day, Donna meets a man who recognizes her profound despair and treats her as a human being. She begins an affair with him, which enables her to reach deep into herself and come to terms with her life and her marriage. She asks Victor for a divorce and custody of the children.The court scenes for the ensuing divorce and custody action are wonderfully drawn, as they are the setting for explaining the deterioration of the marriage. The points of truths in their respective accounts are told from different perspectives in a three dimensional, well fleshed narrative that is tautly drawn. One gets a very definite sense of the psychological horror of the marriage and the reason for Donna's almost total annihilation of self.The divorce is granted, but she retains custody of the children. Donna soon finds out that even though she won, she lost, just as Victor had promised. Five months after the divorce, with the visitation arrangements in place, all had been going smoothly. Victor seemed to have adjusted to the situation and, when they met, treated her with civility. One weekend, he picked up the children, as usual, and admonished them to kiss their mother goodbye. It was not until they failed to return as promised, that she realized the import of his admonishment. Victor had merely lulled her into a false sense of complacency. In reality, her nightmare was far from over and was, in fact, just beginning."},{"Title":"Decidle adios a mama/Kiss Mommy Goodbye (Spanish Edition)","review":"This story is so real I felt I was living it.

I personally love the figure and felt that he was calling me stupid since I like the current version and what it has come to mean.I only skimmed the rest of the book but most of it was stories from natives and just more garbage about misinformation.

This wonderful &quot;villa&quot; on the corner of 5th ave. and 70th st. on Central Park East in Manhattan, once belonged to the steel and railroad tycoon Henry Clay Frick, is house to his amazing art collection. The paintings at the Frick collections are invariably of the highest quality, including masterpieces by Duccio di Buoninsegna (panel from the &quot;Maesta\`&quot;), Giovanni Bellini (the unforgettable &quot;St Francis in the desert&quot;, detail is also on the cover), Holbein, Tiziano, Rembrandt, complete rooms by Boucher and Fragonard, and many many more (Whistler, Watteau, one feels almost guilty by not mentioning them and others...). A museum book should provide luminous access to the museum exhibits, both for those who haven't visited the museum and want a first acquaintance with it, or those who visited it and want a wonderful reminder. This book delivers the goods in the shape of wonderful and vividly colourful reproductions, accompanied by succinct descriptions.

Although I have not visited the museum first hand this books inspires me to put such a visit at the top of my list when next visiting New York.There is just enough information accompanying each piece without overwhelming the artwork.

I am far more familiar with those aspects of medieval warfare that relate to chivalry and heraldry than I am with those that relate to the specific weapons used. From ballistic siege weapons to cannons and artillery: all are covered here. With more than 350 illustrations and drawings, this book provides details of the armour, equipment and uniforms of archers, infantrymen, and cavalrymen (and their horses). It also includes 15 maps of medieval Europe and significant battles within it.In addition to the illustrations, the topics covered include feudalism, siege techniques, the Crusades, the transformation of warfare, cities in warfare and castle building techniques. Of particular interest to me at present were the sections on the Hussites, the Condottieri and mercenary corps, and Renaissance trends. The chapter on peasants at war was especially interesting, as was a chapter on the Teutonic Order.In summary, if you want an overview of the way, why, and how of warfare from the fall of the Roman Empire through to the end of the Protestant Reformation (the Thirty Years War), this book is a wonderful reference. For those of us seeking a general understanding of weapons and some context of various warfare related developments as part of a broader historical context, this book covers most (if not all) points.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Medieval warfare","review":"A must have for the armour enthusiast.

I am the Doug that she has mention-she and her children have been nothing but a blessing to our church and to me personally.

The book gives flashes and glimpses of people, situations and areas outside the usual experience. The author also compares this area and events with those of the US at differing periods of time in the US history. I found it very interesting and found myself wanting more at the end.

It's a very personal narrative and must be viewed as such so keep an open mind if the reader is not &quot;liberal&quot;."},{"Title":"Second Chances: A Travel Narrative of Southern Africa","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, especially the interesting, as well as beautifully written, chapter on Namibia. A part of the world so little known to so many. And having once farmed in the Congo, I appreciated the author's descriptions of her stay on the two ranches in South Africa. She is quite an amazingly strong, compassionate, and insightful lady - with the bright, inquisitive spirit of youth and the wisdom of one who has lived life to the full. All in all, the book is a must for anyone who plans on traveling in South Africa."},{"Title":"Second Chances: A Travel Narrative of Southern Africa","review":"The good travel books are the spontaneous ones, those with a minimum of advance planning in which the traveler always seems to be coming upon new things: discovery rather than simply uncovering \\"interesting\\" sites. Further, the best travel books are those in which the unfolding experience reveals new dimensions of the self as well as of the place visited. SECOND CHANCES is a fine contribution to this superior rank of travel books. Martha Hopkins gives us a remarkable portrait of southern Africa just emerging from apartheid onto a hopeful terrain where real democracy seems within reach. In the same context her knowledge of herself grows in scope and discernment, with the feeling that she, like a significant region of the world, has been blessed with a second chance to review the past and construct a better future: this time to do it right.

Sounds like typical household with teenagers, right? Luke Carter's clan of witches and warlocks may be a little out of the ordinary with their abilities to fly, cast spells, and throw balls of flame, but in many ways they face the same problems of today's typical family. There's never a dull moment, as heroic swordplay, rapid-fire dialogue, and adrenaline-rush action will keep the teen reader engaged. Twelve-year-old Luke is a reluctant hero, an American-style Harry Potter with \\"slacker\\" attitude and guts. Better yet, he's far from perfect - he's impatient, makes lots of mistakes, and learns as he goes. The book's author A.J. Ensor never talks down to teen readers and doesn't overdo the Celtic references and ties to Merlin and Camelot - most of the action takes place in the Florida Keys and upstate New York There are portrait paintings that talk, people that morph into animals, and a magical forest that's home to dinosaurs and gryphons. It's got everything a young sword & sorcery fan could ask for, including some loose ends that will surely require a sequel."},{"Title":"Luke Carter and the Sword of Kings","review":"Luke Carter and the Sword of Kings is one of the most imaginative novels I have ever read. Taking place in the modern-era, the book gives American compettition of wizardry mostly familiarized with Europe. Luke Carter is one of those books you pick up and cant put down until you're finished, it's one those books that makes kids pretend to be sick so they can miss school and finish the chapter they are on.This book takes you on an imagination roller-coaster with plenty of loop-de-loops and camel backs to go around. Luke is your ordinary American boy with not so ordinary abilities. When Luke finds out he is different, he also finds out how much danger he is in. The Darkside is after him and his only chance is The Citadel a school for \\"practitioners\\" in a magical place where T-Rex's still roam in some parts.There is so much more but I dare not tell more and blow an adventure that is worth taking."},{"Title":"Luke Carter and the Sword of Kings","review":"Oy!

The characters, the plot and the background of this magical world are woven together in a fast paced story that is hard to put down. I purchased the book from the author at the UCLA Festival of Books this past April. If certain things like work, food and sleep hadn't been necessary, I would have kept reading all night long.Mr. Ensor has given us another place to escape to while reading. As a member of Clan Cameron, I appreciated the family references as well as the various bits of Keltic language and lore. I highly recommend this book to both children and adults. It is in my opinion pure enjoyment for fans of magic and swashbuckling fantasy."},{"Title":"Option Lock","review":"A better title for OPTION LOCK might be - DOCTOR WHO, OR HOW I STOPPED WORRYING ABOUT THE BOMB AND LEARNED TO LOVE SAM IN A WET T-SHIRT... and yes, the wet t-shirt does make it into this novel, and it's just as odd and misplaced as pretty much everything else found between the pages. OPTION LOCK, the Eighth 8th Doctor adventure, is an odd mix - just by reading it you can tell that nearly all of this book must have been written and submitted by Justin Richards to other publishing houses and rejected. It's a gripping tale of US nuclear policy and a secret space defense platform known as STATION NINE - with this in hand, he hammers in the Doctor and Sam, steals BIG from the Third Doctor's adventure - THE DAEMONS (almost all the plot and feel from that adventure is in OPTION LOCK - if the BBC didn't own it, and this wasn't a DOCTOR WHO novel... they would have sued), plus adds in the Fifth Doctor's THE AWAKENING - and hopes for the best. But it dosen't work - Sam and the Doctor are hardly in this novel, and even when they are, they are reduced to playing roles that just outright bore you and make you cringe (see said passage about the wet t-shirt). Sam still is one of the worst WHO companions - and I think I finally have found the reason why, and it's this: she has no skills. None. Other than biting her fingernails, hiding, and still making eyes at the Doctor - she does nothing. At least with other companions, they had a talent - Ace could fashion explosives (and she could fight), Susan was a Time Lord, Viki was a mental giant, and on and on and on... the only companions Sam might feel at home with are Mel (who never got an introduction in the series proper) and Dodo (who never got an exit - she just disappears about two episodes into THE WAR MACHINES and is never seen again) - but they are rare cases. Overall, this book is just plain dull and offers nothing new to the DOCTOR WHO universe. But, they are becoming harder to find... so if you're a collector, I recommand picking one up to make the set - but as for entertainment, you're better of either writing your own - or watching the series on tape."},{"Title":"Option Lock","review":"This book is not especially hard to get into, but finishing it really is a challenge. The whole plot centres around a group of alien beings who crashed on Earth in the thirtienth century and now a wealthy Englishman is trying to revive them, even if it means starting a nuclear war. A solid enough plot. However, its just the way it's done that I dont like. The aliens feature in it at only two points both of which are relatively short. If it wasn't for those two brief sections of the story you wouldn't know the plot even involved aliens and at times it seems to run independently of them. It does feel very Bondian at some points, especially in the parts involving the Russians and the Americans. Not a bad novel, just incredibly boring."},{"Title":"Option Lock","review":"Sometimes you get the impression that the writers of these books really wanted to write another type of novel, but the BBC requires their Doctor Who line of novels to actually mention the title character once in a while and so suddenly they have to shoehorn the Doctor in there somehow. Granted, the inclusion of the Doctor isn't that awkward here but one does get the impression that Richards wanted to write a suspense filled novel of high espionage but instead settled for a novel of nuclear war and aliens and oh, right, the Doctor. That aside, the bits with the Doctor are pretty good, he and Sam are pulled off course and land on present-day Earth and find themselves guests in a house where some strange plan seems afoot. These sections are interesting as the Doctor tries to piece together an unfolding mystery before the people in the house figure out that he isn't on their side and afterwards he's just trying to stay one step ahead. However, interspersed with all the alien fun as scenes involving the US government either engaged in conspiracy, being victims of a conspiracy or discussing whether a conspiracy is actually present. As much as I enjoy global politics, for some reason I don't find the sequences with the US President interesting at all and found myself flipping pages to get back to whatever the Doctor is doing. This is sort of a compliment because I think Richards writes a really good Eighth Doctor, he's got a mixture of the other incarnations but slightly different enough that he stands out and he does manage to carry most of the novel without doing anything too mysterious or deus ex machina. He even get to be an action hero for a little bit. The aliens' scheme may not exactly live up to the complexity it's clearly hoping for but it at least seems partially well thought out, although sometimes unduly complicated and if a secret platform existed orbiting the planet I suppose the plan would be entirely plausible. And things do get better whne the global hijinks start to dovetail with whatever the Doctor is doing and they don't seem to be occurring in two entirely different novels. But the end starts to go over the top just a little bit, although admittedly the blood and violence is a change of pace. Sam is a little bit better than normal although she's still nothing special (everyone seems mad over the wet T-shirt scene, but it's just so much static with her) the authors do seem to want to subject her to at least one trauma per novel so that she can weep uncontrollably, plus it gives them something to comment on in the next book for the sake of continuity. There's nothing really bad about this book and it's actually well written and well constructed but when you're finished it's just kind of there, without any real excitement or any striking images or themes to take home. Even the secret of the paintings (it drove the artist mad and he killed himself) really isn't that spectacular once you find out. It's a book that goes down easy but leaves you with nothing to take out of it, so I can recommend it as a not-bad book, I can't really recommend it as a great book. Does that make any sense?"},{"Title":"Option Lock","review":"I love Doctor Who novels. I love modern military and espionage novels. But I love the two genres for very different reasons, and they just don't mesh together well. It's an entertaining enough read, I suppose, but the book just doesn't seem to hang together very well and there are WAY too many false climaxes."},{"Title":"Option Lock","review":"This book was hard to get through at times. The Doctor and Sam are forced to land the Tardis on Earth in the 21st century. They find themselves on a manor estate and get caught up in the sinister machinations of the &quot;Lord of the Manor&quot;.Frankly, although I like James Bond, the middle section of this book was boring to me. I kept thinking of stories like &quot;Independence Day&quot; where the suspence was kept to the breaking point without bogging down the story. If this is all accurate (and I suspect it is), I know more about the responses of the US Government to a nuclear strike than I ever wanted to. I suppose all that detail was necessary to the plot to explane why the LOTM was doing what he was doing. But, oh it was boring! Not enough Doctor in it.That's another thing - the character of the Doctor was wrong. I can see a trend here - the authors of some of these books seem to see Sam as an Ace-wannabe that is growing into a Mad Max kind of woman. Strong, tough but can still be female and break down in tears. Humm - maybe, but it isn't quite right yet. Not a book I'll be likely to read again."},{"Title":"Option Lock","review":"A solid Doctor Who book which mesmerises the reader with an action sequence of James Bond proportions. The mysteries in the story are wonderfully built up and the character of Sam Jones fleshed out in surprisingly strong fashion. Never derivative or boring, Option Lock is a great introduction for new readers to a wonderful science fiction series."},{"Title":"Option Lock","review":"OPTION LOCK is a very visual book, perhaps one of the most visual Doctor Who books I've ever read. This means that there's a lot of dialogue, a lot of action and not a lot in the way of character introspection. We get a lot of information about what things physically look like, where they are in relation to each other and comparisons to other objects. The locations are vast and sprawling. We have a large James Bond type control room with giant view screens and computers with blinking lights. It comes complete with it's own Bondian villain with a silly twitch under his eye.This visual flavour makes the story feel more like the book version of a multi-million-dollar film that's already been shot rather than an adventure that's written specifically for the book format. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing at times and to the author's credit, it's done very well here. The visual nature of the prose leaves the reader with several of the pivotal scenes etched into the mind. It has a very large and cinematic feel to it that can be quite enjoyable if one is in the mood for that. The plot is not actually overly complicated, yet the action moves forward fast enough to keep things enjoyable.In short, this is a fairly good, fast-paced, solid action-adventure. It's quite entertaining and if you're looking for something that's light but not at all bad, this is probably one of the early BBC books that you should look into."},{"Title":"Firebrands: Building Brand Loyalty in the Internet Age","review":"Michael Moon puts together scores of ultimately meaningless charts (this guy adores power point), tarts up basic brand jargon with John Gray's insufferable Mars and Venus spiel, and ends up with a book that is useful to those who can say things like &quot;mediaspace value chain&quot; and &quot;brand trust network&quot; with a straight face (yeah, my clients are gonna eat that up, evil chuckle).

Finally, they provide ample and well-explained pointers to further reading to help understand some of their basic ideas more clearly.As a consultant working for a systems integrator, one of the things that impressed me the most was the focus on execution. Many books about branding seem to imply that the technical details are irrelevant to brand success, but _Firebrands_ makes the point that a relationship with a customer only has brand value when supported by appropriate policies, training, and technical infrastructure.

Even her spouse Wayne, who call his new boat &quot;baby&quot; tells her she is &quot;the baby&quot; while the craft is a &quot;generic baby.&quot; However, when Wayne takes his new ship out for a test run, the steering wheel fails and he crashes. As he dies in Maddie's arms, he promises her that he will send her an angel because he vowed never to break her heart. She believes her beloved Wayne.A year has passed and Maddie still expects an angel to appear. Her uncle hires a stranger, Chase, who was found drifting at sea with no memory or identification. Maddie believes that Wayne sent Chase as her angel, but though he cannot recall anything he knows he is no angel. Still, he finds himself attracted to Maddie and soon they join forces to try to learn who he truly is.Though a bit more inspirational than readers normally receive from Tina Wainscott (see A TRICK OF THE LIGHT and IN A HEARTBEAT), BACK IN BABY'S ARMS retains the awesome author's ability to make the impossible seem feasible. The story line is taut, poignant, and exhilarating as two damaged psyches find healing in love.

The characters in Maddie's family were just goofy. I couldn't decide if it was the author's attempt at injecting humor or they were just strange. They reminded me of the movie \\"Junebug\\". It was distracting to me. I liked Chase. The mystery was pretty good, but the climax was a little over the top. Maddie's transformation was just too much too fast.

The story follows Jonah Flying Cloud on his frightening trip to the school in Pennsylvania where his hair is cut (a sign of mourning with his people), his Indian clothes taken from him, and he's made to wear scratchy long underwear, thick woolen uniforms, and shoes that hurt his feet. His days are scheduled by bells and bugles, and he's marched to meals and classes where he's taught to speak the white man's language. He's even taken to church and told he'll burn in a fiery pit forever if he doesn't accept the white man's god. Jonah Flying Cloud dies, brokenhearted, at the school and is trapped between the place of his earthly life and \\"the land above the clouds, where the eagles fly.\\"Jonah Flying Cloud's first-person narrative unfolds in alternating chapters with present-day Jenny Muldoon's story. Jenny moves with her mother and new stepfather to military quarters at Fort Sayers, which once housed the Indian school. When she finds out that her new home was once the school infirmary, the stage is set for her to meet the spirit of Jonah Flying Cloud who needs her help to be released from his dark half-world so that he can join his family and tribe members in the afterworld.Both stories keep the reader moving quickly through the pages. In an interesting subplot, Jenny helps a friend, the son of the commanding general at Fort Sayers, stand up to his father and get help for his alcoholic mother. At the end, Jenny is finally able to figure out how to help her Indian friend. The novel ends with a final, poignant scene between Jenny and Jonah Flying Cloud.This book a must for anyone interested in learning about the Indian schools. Its compelling story is sure to capture the interest and imagination of readers of all ages. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Place at the Edge of the Earth","review":"This is a beautifully written and important book. It will give all readers, young andold, a better knowledge, understanding, appreciation and sympathy for the Indianchildren about whom the author writes with such deep feeling. Rice has managed tobalance the stories of the two main characters--the young Indian boy, Jonah FlyingCloud, who died over a hundred years ago and the modern day young girl, JennyMuldoon--with exceptional skill as the two young people \\"meet\\" in a time warp andgradually become sensitive of one another's feelings.This is a well-told, smoothly flowing tale, a real page turner. Rice has a knack forperfectly capturing the way young people talk, how they respond to one another and toadults. Once again, balance comes into play in the way the author weaves flashes ofhumor into the central, serious story line.Though I hated to have the book end, my spirit soared at the conclusion, whichdeserves to be read and reread several times. It's truly beautiful.The Author's Note, where Rice speaks of writing this book \\"from the heart\\"should not be missed.

I was even bending over the kitchen counter the other night, reading it while dinner was boiling down to nothing on the stove!Besides being beautifully written, as one would expect from the author if you've read any of her other books, this book has everything. It's suspenseful (oh yes!), but is also a wonderful story of developing friendships and family relationships. It's a terrific ghost story, a mystery, and even a detective story added for good measure. All perfectly and believably combined. But most of all, the author weaves a fascinating factually-based story of something that happened once to American Indian children. Heartbreaking, and rings absolutely true.I promise you, if you read this book, you'll never look at an eagle feather in the same way again. Or for that matter, be able to put the book down once you've started it!"},{"Title":"The Place at the Edge of the Earth","review":"The Place at the Edge of the Earth by Bebe Faas Rice is a moving story of Lakota Indian children who were forced to attend one of the many government boarding schools \\"for their own good\\" to tame and civilize these \\"filthy savages\\" and make them imitation white people. But as the story unfolds, and we meet Jenny Muldoon in the present and Jonah Flying Cloud in 1879, Rice's narrative so clearly portrays the Lakota Indians as rich in their culture, sensitive to each other and strong in family ties. The mystery surrounding solving the murder and the covered-up lynching--and Jenny's gutsy determination that someone take responsibility--keep the book moving at a fast pace. The facts taken by Ms. Rice from government documents, interviews, tapes, and visits to Indian schools (described at the end of the book) are interwoven into the story so smoothly that children will absorb the history like osmosis. This gripping story experienced through Jonah Flying Cloud stayed with me, whereas facts from history books fade quickly. I came away from this book with a new understanding and compassion, and I believe young readers will also. This will be a much discussed book in classrooms, not just for its information on the Lakota Indians, but for how we currently treat--and mistreat--all people who are different than we are and, therefore, scare us. An excellent addition to school curriculum or simply for a rousing good mystery."},{"Title":"The Place at the Edge of the Earth","review":"The United States Government in the last two centuries took Indian children from their reservation homes and families -- often forcefully -- and sent them to boarding schools set up to acclimate them to life in the white man's world. This story blends a contemporary setting with flashbacks to this historical time as the ghost of an Indian boy who died there manifests itself to a girl who presently lives in quarters where the school once was. This chapter of history unfolds in sensitive and powerful writing as these two young people from different worlds together confront and resolve the trauma of their lives. This impeccably researched novel is for young adults, but tells a story that should be read by all ages."},{"Title":"The Place at the Edge of the Earth","review":"This is truly a remarkable book: touching and shocking and thought-provoking and yes -- one where having a kleenex or two handy is a very good idea. Although it is a fantasy -- a ghost story, actually -- it is based on hard historical fact taken from documented materials including archival tapes made by older Indians recounting their own personal experiences in the government schools of the late 1800s such as the fictional one in this story. They told their own stories of how they suffered through the inhuman treatment of Indian children designed to rob them of their belief systems, cultural identity, self-respect, and for many -- sadly -- their own lives. Young people will easily relate to the two main characters, seemingly disparate: the ghost of a young Indian boy forced into attendance at the school so long ago, and a contemporary teenaged girl. Both are at odds with themselves and consequently those around them. They are loners, and like most loners, they are lonely.They are intensely human and likable and the reader is drawn to them from the start. Mrs. Rice writes exceedingly well, and this story moves so swiftly and compellingly that it is with regret that one reaches the end of the story and closes this moving book. This book should be available in all middle schools, and could be used as the basis for discussion in a history unit."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"This is yet another wonderful book within the Chronicles of Prydain series by Lloyd Alexander. I highly recommend this series for both the young and young at heart."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"This was very intriguing as Alexander added a new location to the magical and wondrous land of Prydain, the small island where princess Eilonwy goes to practice being a lady (which is what she hates doing the most) while Taran and the others join along to protect her from a plot to steal her lineage's magic power from generations back. This book, as usual, was filled with great adventure, surprising back stabs, traitors, friends and foes to defeat an old time rival for the protection of the magical power held at the mysterious and old castle of Llyr, the soul location of Eilonwy's magical lineage. This is not my favorite book in the series, though, but it was still very good and definitely worth taking a peek at."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"Alexander prefaces The Castle of Llyr by stating that, \\"For each of us comes a time when we must be more than what we are. And this holds true for princesses as well as assistant pig-keepers.\\" You'd think that with The Castle of Llyr being focused on Eilonwy, and my being female, this book would be my favorite. Yet except for The High King, the tales are all seen from Taran's viewpoint making The Castle of Llyr still a boy's read. Second, for much of the time, the story centers around the attempts of her friends to protect her. You see, Achren has returned and is seeking revenge. Well, actually, it turns out that Eilonwy is the last princess of Llyr. She alone has the power to invoke the magic devices and potent spells of the House of Llyr. And so Achren actually is seeking Eilonwy so she can control that power and rule the Prydain kingdom. Third, although I love Eilonwy as much as the other major characters, in many ways Eilonwy fits the stereotype of girls in traditional fantasies. Her societal role is to dress up, chatter, cook, and serve men, but she rebels against it by wearing men's garb, wielding swords, and demanding rights as an equal. In the sense that she refuses to become a respectable princess, Eilonwy serves as a role model. In other ways she doesn't, for she regularly thrusts herself into the forefront as one of the guys. For all these reasons, The Castle of Llyr is not my favorite book.Yet I still like it. For within its pages, we meet the Prince of Rhun. He reminds me of a younger version of the inept and impatient but honorable and likeable Taran. I enjoyed how easily vexed Prince Rhun could make Taran. When Rhun introduces himself, he realizes to his shame that he forgot to ask anyone's name. Now he has to repeat his whole greeting. In telling about himself, Rhun proudly talks about how easy it is to command a voyage: \\"All I have to do is tell the sailors....\\" Thankfully, the sailors know how to do their job and quietly go about their tasks without paying heed to Rhun, who has no idea how a ship is really run. Unfortunately, his lack of knowledge doesn't stop him from trying to take his hand at steering, any more than it once kept Taran from trying to make or brandish a sword. Under Rhun's control, the ship lurches so violently that Taran is thrown against the bulwark where he receives a nasty bump on his head. Still, when Eilonwy disappears and is suspected of being in danger, Rhun is among the first to join the search party. Despite all impending doom, he refuses to turn back but vows to find her. Through Prince Rhun and other new characters, Alexander instills humor into a sometimes dark story."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"Thirty years after I first read it as a child, I took a look at \\"The Castle of Llyr\\" again. The book was my least favorite of the Prydain series when I was a child--and my opinion of it has changed considerably. I suspect the reason I disliked it as a child was how different it is than the first two books in the series--instead of stopping evil forces threatening to rule the land, our heroes must rescue a captured princess.While the plot breaks no new ground, \\"The Castle of Llyr\\" is propelled by the solid cast of characters that Alexander continues to develop. As a child, I was struck by how the two lead characters- Taran and Elionway--grew in each book and, thirty years later, the way Alexander matured them continues to impress. While there is less action in this novel than in the first two books of the series, Alexander is able to subtlety weave a number of messages in \\"The Caste of Llyr\\" that younger readers might gloss over on the way to the next adventure scene.Elementary and junior high students with a taste for fantasy stories will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"This particular installment is a little darker than previous Alexander books I thought. I liked the story line development and characters, as i have read this now at the age of 12 and 40. The sense of imagery is really well presented by Lloyd Alexander and after seeing as many movies as I have, I still was able to imagine and enjoy this story and it's characters."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"Finally, books I remember enjoying as a kid that still stand up to re-reading as an adult!They are sometimes described as coming-of-age stories, and that is true in the best sense of the term. Alexander is deeply concerned with growing up, and he examines many of its central, deepest, and most profound aspects, such as discovering one's personal identity, and responsibility. Each book in the series looks at these themes in different ways and builds on them a little more. My favorite in the series, Taran Wanderer (which I had expected to enjoy the least), deals with these issues so simply and directly that it acquires an almost allegorical quality. He teaches many important life lessons that are every bit as relevant to us grown-ups as to young adolescents just beginning to struggle with these issues. And he does so through engaging stories and a memorable cast of characters. From now on, whenever I find myself in a situation that tests my courage or integrity, all I have to do is think to myself, \\"A Fflam never falters!\\"Some people like to complain about the supposed similarities between these books and those of Tolkein, but apart from some basic structural features stemming from their common mythological roots, there really isn't a lot of similarity in the details. Even in the most obviously similar part---the ending---what is really interesting is how it differs. I can't say much without giving it away, but let's just say that Alexander, to his credit, ultimately says almost the exact opposite of Tolkein. No, Alexander's fantasy world isn't as complex and well-developed as Tolkein's, but these books were written for a younger audience, and let's face it, nobody can stand up to a comparison with Tolkein as far as that goes. I think if people, of whatever age, take these books on their own terms, they will find them to be a rewarding experience."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"This is a terrific series for adults and for teens.

Princess Eilonwy is sent off to the care of the King and Queen of Mona to become a lady. When Taran accompanies her, he finds a romantic rival as well as a sinister plot. This book was just as cute as the earlier books--maybe a little cuter because of Taran's frustrating realization that he is romantically interested in Eilonwy."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"Princess Eilonwy goes to her beloved home isle where there has been no battle or fights. It's where forests go for miles and miles, flowers bloom everywhere and when Taran is in his chamber Lord Gwydion shows up and tells him Eilonwy is in danger and Queen Achren is after her. Eilonwy is stolen and Taran, Prince Rhun, Fflewddur, & Gurgi, look for her. On the way, Taran and his champions get in some trouble. Eilonwy is under queen Achren's spell. Taran fights against it and... it's your choice to find out more.I liked this book because Lloyd Alexander did a good job with Fflewddur; he made him with a good sense of humor, funny. For example, on page 77 a mountain lion was running after Fflewddur and he said \\"Great Belin, she wants me back!\\" Previously in the story Fflewddur is trapped by her and he escaped so that's how she wants him back if your wondering .Another good thing I liked about the book is when Taran and his companions were trapped between the big mountain lion and how it adored Fflewddur. Another thing I liked about the story was that Taran has grown up, understands more and comprehends more. For instance, when Taran and the companions were trapped by Glew the giant he made a promise to the king he would keep his son Prince Rhun safe and would let nothing hurt him and he keeped his oath. On thing I didn't like about the book was when Taran and his companions were trapped under ground. Alexander didn't put a lot of detail in this scene so I couldn't picture what the under ground looked like but everything else in the story was pretty good with a lot of detail. kb, red creek"},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"This book is very enjoyable.Eilonwy finaiiy gets alot of action.Taran and his friends meat prince Ruhn,and Fflewddur Fflam finally gets a horse...or some ridding animal.I would tell you what it is but thats half the fun.Right now I am working on finishing THE HIGH KING and the story in CASTLE OF LLYR is very important to the story of Eilonwy.If you are planing on reading all 5 books this is a MUST READ book to understand."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"The princess needs a bit of deportment apparently.When you decide you need to work on the aristocratic side of a girl, of course you would send her off with a pig keeper and a beast man, wouldn't you?Because of this, and a bit of a princess triangle, they all end up in a Land of the Giants type scenario, or at least in part.Here, along with a bit of magic, is a fantasy book where a crow actually comes in useful as a good thing."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"I beleve that the book could have been better but unfortuneatly the author decited not to make it quite so exicting and have eilonwy fight and defete the dark enchantiss.

Things get complicated when Taran, who has started to fall in love with Eilonwy, meets the Prince of Llyr, who becomes an immediate rival for Eilonwy's affections. Worse yet, when they actually get to the Castle, they find an old adversary they thought long dead is still around, and wants Eilonwy as much as either of the boys, though for very different ends. This sends the company on another adventure.It's as fun as the other books in the series, but it is kind of depressing to see such a well-worn, clich&eacute;d way of keeping a series alive woven into a series that's become such a backbone of juvenile fantasy literature. Still, the adventure is well-paced, as always with Alexander, and the writing is still solid. A minor dip in the series, hopefully rectified soon enough. ***"},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"I read the Prydain Chronicles as a child and still find them enjoyable today. I look forward to one day sharing these tales with my children."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"The Castle of Llyr is the third book in the Chronicles of Prydain, a series with such interesting characters and wonderful storytelling that each book is better than the last. This entry is something of a love story between Taran and Eilonwy, whose feelings had been hinted at in the first couple of novels. Eilonwy is forced to learn how to be a lady, all the while seeking to sneak away from her new castle home and go back to adventuring. She gets her wish, only to be kidnapped. As such, it is up to Taran and his companions to rescue the princess.As is usual for the Chronicles of Prydain, the plot is familiar but the story is not. Lloyd Alexander takes standard fantasy tropes, in this case the \\"rescue the princess\\" plot, and turns them into something unique and charming. In addition to returning supporting characters like Gurgi and Fflewdur Fflam, Alexander adds several new characters that are as unique and entertaining. The world of Prydain is alive not only with locations and history but with characters that you will grow to love.As the focus of these novels is on Taran's journey from adolescence into adulthood, you will see more development along those lines from him. This growth of character is not forced or sudden, and the end of the novel will leave you feeling like he has more growing to do. He does, in fact. Fortunately, the Chronicles of Prydain continue with another book following this one. By the time you finish The Castle of Llyr, you'll be thinking of little more than reading the next book in this wonderful series."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"A friend loaned me her copies of this series. I enjoyed them so much I wanted my children to be able to read them, but I was apprehensive about having them read her autographed copies, and they weren't available at our local library. I was so delighted to find them at amazon.com and at such a great price I just couldn't pass them up. This is one of those true classics, great for both kids and adults. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"The third book in Alexander's Prydain Chronicles is certainly the most romantic of the five books--Taran practically admits to being attracted to Eilonwy and shows jealousy when he learns that she's being sent to the Isle of Mona not just for \\"princess training\\" but, rather, because a prince (Rhun, providing the book's comic relief) is her intended husband.This book takes the form of a standard rescue-the-damsel-in-distress story but Alexander keeps the pace brisk and introduces new characters that will return in future books: Llyan, a giant mountain cat, and Glew, a giant. Dallben and Coll only appear in the opening chapters, but returning characters include wandering bard Fflewddur Fflam, Prince Gwydion, and evil Queen Achren.I woouldn't say that this is the best book in the series (that would be The High King, in my opinion) but it's a close second."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"This is a great series. One of my favorites and my husband's favorites."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"All of Alexander's main characters are back in this book (besides Doli I think), and once again Alexander does a wonderful job of portraying the battle of good vs. evil in the fun garb of a fictional adventure. This book highlights self-sacrafice, as Taran has to choose whether or not to help the man competing for the same things that he wants. It also highlights the immorality of selfishness, as Glew is pretty much selfishness incarnate and ends up stuck in a cave with no way to get out, until Taran and co. decide to be merciful to him even though he tried to kill them.This books is lots of fun, definitely a recommended read, along with the rest of the series.Overall grade: A-"},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"Castle of Llyr is one of the coolest books I've ever read. It may not make sense if you haven't read the first two books in this incredible series, but even still its awsome. You may look at it and say, 'Its to long' or 'I don't like books with magic'but trust me, no matter what it looks like it is one of the coolest books I've ever read. If you like magic and sword fights, this is the place to be. If you like realistic fiction, you may want to look somewhere else. This book is 80 percent action, 15 percent just looking and searching,and the remaining five percent... is romance. But not enough to gag you, don't worry. The main character is Taran, the boy without an identity.The villian is Arawn death-lord, and his name says it all. There's kings and queens and sword fights and witches and people who love revenge. There's a wide variety of characters, too. If you like to read or just hear about fighting(some, not very violent), this is the book for you. One thing- if you're under 10 yrs. old you probably won't understand it. otherwise, its perfect."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"This has all of the best things of a long line of the best fairy tales of all time. This book has knights and princes with a giant cat and a magical harp player and a orge creature with battles and mystery. I still remember every idea of the plot and every detail of the novel. IT IS WONDERFUL WITHOUT A DOUBT."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"This book was my favorite of all the Prydain chronicles. Partly because a lot of the focus was on Eilonwy, though she was absent most of the book,(she has always been my favorite character) but also because it had great moral questions, and we finally begin to see Taran turn into an adult as he realizes as much as he cares about Eilonwy, he must let things be. In this book, Dallben decides that Eilonwy must leave Caer Dallben because it is time for her to learn how to be a young lady. He sends her to the Isle of Mona, and allows Taran to go with her, at least for the journey. On the way Taran struggles with his feelings for Eilonwy and his annoyance at Rhun, Prince of Mona, who is a bumbling fool, at least on the outside. Through an interesting chain of events, Eilonwy is kidnapped, and Taran learns that she is betrothed to Rhun without even her knowledge. They all go on yet another epic adventure to save her, as Taran must come to terms with his conflicting emotions. Another amazing thing about this book was that I didn't hate the love story part. Usually I hate mush because it seems as if they put it there just to be mush, and it rarely has any overall effect on the story. This however, was completly different, and I was actually hoping they would end up together. So, this is an excellent book that any fantasy lover would adore, though it would make more sense if you had read the other two books first."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"I have heard complaints that this book is boring, lacking in action. Obviously, some people fail to appreciate the DEEP EMOTIONAL TURMOIL Taran endures on his quest to rescue his beloved princess (the greatest heroine in ALL of fiction, thank you very much) so that she can marry a bumbling idiot in prince's clothing. Oh, wailings of misery! as Gurgi would say. This is the best book of the series, and my personal all-time favorite. A word to adults: don't cheat yourself out of Prydain because the series is &quot;for kids&quot;. I'm 20, and can fully enjoy the dark drama of Tolkein as well as the next fantasy-lover. But don't pass up the mini-wheats just because they're frosted! These books are ageless; these characters are as real as your own best friends. In fact, the fifth and final novel is dedicated to &quot;all the boys who might have been Taran, and the girls who will always be Eilonwy.&quot; Thank you, Mr. Alexander; I am one of the latter (this explains my lack of brevity!). READ THEM."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"The continuing epic story of Taran the Assistant Pig-Keeper and his rag-tag motley crew of kings, princes, and furry ape-like creatures. This book in the Prydain Chronicles is, truth be told, far more usual than its predecessors. While the first two books in the series were fairly new and different adventure tales, this one falls back onto the standard rescue-the-princess-from-the-evil-enchantress mode. Eilonwy is in trouble, and we learn much more about her background and history than ever before. Added to the usual mix of characters for spice (the dwarf Doli fails to make an appearance in this tale and, I assume, leaves a gap) is another unwanted Prince. This time it's Prince Rhun, a good-hearted if completely incompetent young man. His betrothal to Taran's beloved Eilonwy does nothing to make our hero love him more, but the prince's sweet nature and good spirits eventually win everyone over. Also introduced by the cat loving Alexander (remember, this is the author of the interesting \\"Time Cat\\") is Llyan, an over-sized mountain cat that has taken quite a liking to bard Fflewddur Flan's harp playing. All in all, it's a pleasant mix of lovable characters. As you might be able to tell, this is not a good book to begin the series with. At this point, we know these people (and animals) fairly well and nothing they do will come as much surprise to anyone. It still amazes me to no end how prolific kings and princes are in this land. Though I understand that much of the point of these books is to show how little birthright counts when it comes to being good and strong. And it is quite a relief to see Taran doing something other than hot-headedly rushing into danger as he's done in the previous two books. Alexander's characters are growing, slowly but surely. It is with glee that I look forward towards reading yet another installment in this enjoyable series."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"A slight break from the thunderous intensity of Prydain's battles, Book 3 features our favorite characters from the previous two books. Again, maintaining continuity will greatly enhance your experience of each story. Eilonwy, the girl adventurer must return to her proper position of Princess, or at least learn to be more like one - no easy task for this independent spirit. She is sent to the Isle of Mona unknowingly to be prepared as the future Mrs. Prince Somebody. Taran, her best friend and best enemy, is sent to escort her to Mona. Unfortunately, there are plots afoot and Eilonwy is gone before they know it. Taran, working through his odd, new emotions for the Princess, is off and running with the faithful Gurgi and king-cum-bard Fflewddur. We also meet the silly, sweet Prince Rhun, a tuneful kitty, a subterranean giant, and a real witch.While this is about Eilonwy, her heritage, and her future, it's also about the future of the friendship as people must change and follow their own destinies. Taran poignantly learns that sometimes the very most you can do is nothing. The change of pace is a refreshing, as we see the characters develop with each other instead of having to constantly flee/fight evil. This adventure feels more like a quest, with challenges to overcome and a goal to reach. In the process, all the heroes become closer and richer together."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"Taran has matured a little since the first two books; he's now less eager for a fight and also more aware of his feelings for the Princess Eilonwy. However, she's sent to the Island of Mona, the homeland of her ancestors off the coast of Prydain, to learn about becoming a proper young lady.Taran escorts her there with the loyal creature Gurgi and the foolish Prince Rhun as company. Once on the island Taran learns that Eilonwy's alleged aunt, Achren, has intentions for Eilonwy's magical powers that would be disastrous for all, and when one of Achren's sinister agents kidnaps the princess Taran leads a rescue mission to save her.Along the way they meet a harp-fancying cat in the forest and a midget named Glew in a cave, though both cat and midget have become giant-sized from Glew's magical meddlings, and the delays they cause make Eilonwy's plight all the more urgent.The themes of the book become ever more mature, as Taran sees in Rhun some of himself at a younger age--much to his irritation. And though I missed it as a child, the romantic tension between Achren and Gwydion is very much there (as it is in the first and last book, as well), adding greater nuance to a story in which Taran can't quite express his feelings for Eilonwy the way he'd like her to understand them. Not unlike most people in love, actually.The locations and plot may suggest that this story is a sideshow from the rest of the books, though the observant won't fail to notice certain characters and plot elements that lead directly up to the conclusion of the series."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"This is one of the funniest of the Prydain Chronicles. Humor is definitely one of Alexander's strengths, though also one of the series' few weaknesses, in that Alexander's characters each have their characteristic gags that they repeat over and over (the Fflam's propensity for exaggeration and bravado, Gurgi's alliterative interjections, Eilonwy's wilfulness, and so on), which quickly comes to seem too heavy-handed and belabored. But the fun is so genuine and so charming that one can forgive its obviousness. This is especially true in _The Castle of Llyr_, in which Taran speaks for all teenagers (and many of us who are older and who pretend to be wiser) who have suffered the torments of seeing the one they love in danger of bestowing his/her affections on a patently unworthy object (of course we would never object if the other guy--I speak as a male--were worthy of her--but somehow he never is). Once again, Taran has to make the choice between the appearance of heroism (in this case, being the one to rescue Eilonwy) and the reality.A welcome new twist, however, is the focus on Eilonwy, whose character undergoes further development. In this novel, Eilonwy has to make tough choices of her own, having to do with her magical heritage and its potentiality for both good and evil (especially the latter, as Eilonwy's former mistress, the sorceress Achren, reappears quite literally with a vengeance). Throw in a giant cat and a tiny (well, tiny in spirit) giant called Glew, and you have a thoroughly enjoyable entry in this excellent series."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"This fantastic book is an amazing sequel to The Book of Three and The black cauldron. Finding these books in my school library, I read the first one over winter break. I couldn't wait for the break to be over so I could get the sequels. This book turned out to be my favortite out of all five, though The High King was a close rival. The enchanting story about how Princess Eilonwy goes to Mona with Taran and Gurgi is facinating. All of the characters are unique in there own way, no matter how odd the character is. I love the character Prince Rhun. He is really funny. The ending of this book surprised me. I thought that Eilonwy would come willingly, happy to be rescued, but the ending is far from that. It is truly a worthy sequel to the first two books."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"The third book of the Prydain Chronicles is excellent, but somehow a little awkward. It is reminiscent of the teenager that Taran has become by this time, as he learns to help an inept prince to become more of a man. It teaches excellent values that adults as well as children should have. Enjoy this book, but read it as the third, following &quot;The Book of Three&quot; and the &quot;Black Cauldron&quot; or else it may loose some of its majesty."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"As a kid I read the Prydain books again and again. I can't resist some Harry Potter comparisons, and since they make a good common point of reference, I'll use the device here. The Prydain books aren't quite as exciting and magical as HP, but they have many of the same coming of age problems expressed through allegory, and frankly I find the characters better developed, more humorous, and more likeable. This is the third in the five book series, and to my mind the weakest but still very, very enjoyable. The protagonist of this book, as of the others is Taran of Caer Dallben, an orphan of unknown parentage and now an Assistant Pig-Keeper. He is being raised by a monastic collection of former war heroes and semi-wizards, and is always insecure about his lineage. In this book he also struggles with the crisis of his best friend, the princess Eilonwy, being forced to leave to learn to be a lady. Other main and recurring characters, save perhaps for the princess, are more or less also neurotic in delightful ways. Alexander avoids formula, even though the plot when described could sound like a million sword and sorcerer books. The depth and likeability of the characters lifts it above most fantasy books,though, especially fantasy books for kids. We grow up with Taran, and the character he develops is character that would almost universally be recognized as admirable. I highly, highly recommend all of them- at least as much as the HP books. Again, I think this may be the weakest one, but it's still terrific."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"Lloyd Alexander's five-part \\"Chronicles of Prydain\\" is essential reading for anyone, regardless of age, gender or reading preferences. Although they are classed as both fantasy and children's literature, these books can be enjoyed by everyone, not just for its fantastical elements and the broad good vs. evil conflict, but for their gentle humour, loveable characters and vindication of humanity over, not just fantasy-evil, but the more base qualities of greed, ignorance, spite and pride. At their core, the books are a coming-of-age story for our protagonist Taran, as he journeys from boy to man in troubled times, acquiring wisdom, humility, kindness and responsibility as he goes. The best part is that this process is gradual, but not stagnant. In each book, Taran has grown, and yet there's always more to learn on the path to becoming a man.As such, this third volume of the series \\"The Castle of Llyr,\\" concerns Taran's developing feelings for his friend and companion Princess Elionwy, who is being sent to the Isle of Mona in order to become a proper lady. The enchanter Dallben, with whom the young people live with, has himself ordered it. Neither are particularly pleased with the decision, and Taran is even less pleased to discover that Elionwy's new guardians have plans to betroth her to their son. Prince Rhun of Mona is hapless and clumsy, and jealousy rears its ugly head when Taran becomes acutely aware of his position in life as an Assistant Pig-Keeper.And yet all that must take a backseat when Elionwy is kidnapped, and Taran must work with Rhun, along with harpist Fflewddur Fflam and the faithful Gurgi, in order to bring her safely home. Their journey takes them into subterranean caves and across mysterious islands, only to find that the object of their adventure has been bewitched by the evil enchantress Achren who plans to use the Princess's latent powers to reclaim control over Prydain.As well as this, there are other familiar faces, such as the warrior Gwydion and the talkative crow Kaw, (though sadly, Doli doesn't make an appearance) and several other characters that play a part in the action both here and in stories to come: Glew, the \\"smallest\\" giant in fiction, the beautiful cat Llyan (who Alexander called \\"the prototype of cat-greatness\\") and Prince Rhun, whose clumsiness is offset by his endearing cheerfulness and awareness that he isn't quite the prince he should be. We learn more about Elionwy's heritage, particularly the purpose and nature of her glass bauble, though the full story of her people won't be fully explained untilTaran Wanderer (The Chronicles of Prydain). And of course, we get the first romantic overtures between Taran and Elionwy that are both poignant and typically awkward, as you'd expect from adolescents.The entire series takes place in the land of Prydain, which is heavily influenced by the mythology of Wales, as found inThe Mabinogion (Penguin Classics). Though it sounds like your typical fantasy-setting, there is a particular charm to this series, born out of Alexander's love and respect for life, his wit and wordplay, and the wisdom that he manages to infuse into his story without ever sounding preachy or pretentious. These five books, and the companion anthology of short stories set in Prydain's past, are essential reading for any child, to be put on the shelf right next toThe Chronicles of NarniaandHarry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-6)."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"The best book of the five! Aside form introducing Llyan, the huge cat, and Rhun, who's even worse than Taran used to be,it has a wonderful dramatic scene at the end. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"This is a very good book! Not at all boring! I finished this book in one day it was so good!Eilonwy leaves for the Isle of Mona to train on how to be a proper princess. Taran, is notified of her great danger from Prince Gwydion. Prince Rhun, Taran, Kaw, and Gurgi set out to save the Princess from Achren."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"In this 3rd book of Lloyd Alexander's fantasy series, set in a fictitious, Welsh-like land, the Companions (encountered in the previous two books) undertake to escort the headstrong Princess Eilonwy over the sea to the Castle of Llyr, where she will receive training in Royal Behavior. Unbeknownst to the protagonists, however, the evil sorceress, Achren, is working out her private agenda to one day claim all of Prydain--for which she needs Eilonwy's inherited skills. To complete her vile scheme she enlists the spidery aid of the castle's Prime Minister, Magg.Although the two most prominent female characters appear at the end of the book, the Companions, fiercely loyal to Taran,offer a variety of talents in their quest to find and rescue thetomboy princess. In addition to our old friends (the Prince of Don,shaggy Gurgi, the truth-stretching bard, and Kaw, the crow (Hey, it always helps to have a winged ally), the author introduces readersto new characters: Glew, the dwarf who dabbles in potions andLlyan--a huge mountain cat with a fondness for harp music.Nevertheless, it is the character of young Prince Ruhn of Mona who proves the most human catalyst thrown into this mix; although nominally in command of the ship and then the expedition to find Eilonwy, this cheerful fellow proves an awkward bungler. Hopeless in times of trial and serious danger he seems an arrogant fool, proving more of a nuisance and even a burden to the would-be heroes. Beneath his oafish attempts which contribute to Taran's challenges the feckless prince aspires to marry Eilowny one day--a fact which galls Taran privately. Even worse he has promised the King of Mona to guard the youth at all costs and return him to Mona safely. Despite repeated instances of his awkwardness the prince amazes them all as he comes of age during this quest and offers to sacrifice himself for the princess.As the author points out in his introduction: this book offers more comic relief and also more hints of romance than the previous two books. Boys will easily relate to Taran's physical and mental struggles as he desperately seeks to prove that he is of greater value than his humble title of assistant pig keeper. Girls will enjoy the literary shenanigans as well. Here is Adventure Lite for Middle Schoolers."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"I read this book in about 3 hours it was so good!

Taran accompanies Eilonwy to Mona to find that he has a rival in the form of the Isle's clutzy Prince Rhun.

The feckless Price Rhun is hilarious, the cat Llyan is frightening, and the giant Glew is frustrating. Even though it stars and progresses rather humorously, the end gets dark and dangerous. This is a good book despite it being the shortest and funniest of the series. So take it for a good read."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"The Castle of Llyr is the third of the Prydain Chronicles. In this exciting adventure, Taran and Eilonwy are sepparated. Eilonwy is sent to a castle, where she is to learn proper &quot;lady&quot; etiquette. On Taran's visit with his companion, he notices something strange. The next day, Eilonwy is gone. This was a great book of adventure and fantasy. I would say it is the best in the five book series, and reccomend it to anyone who likes a good read."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"I read the Prydain Chronicles in elementary school and just recently re-read them. It's fascinating to me how much the YA fantasy formula has changed over the years, but this series is still a classic. I recommend it to anyone interested in epic fantasy."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"This is going to be a \\"typical internet review\\" in which the star rating is seemingly positive (or at least so-so), yet the review itself will dwell on the negative...***After over 20 years of sharing my life with Lloyd Alexander's Prydain chronicles, it has taken me up till now to realize why The Castle of Llyr feels the most underwhelming of the bunch, the least satisfying, the most unfinished. After all, it's not the quality of the writing, for it's as charming as ever. And the characterization of our beloved companions feels just as spot on as ever.It's the plot. Don't get me wrong. I have no problem with a book that (presumably) focuses on the Princess Eilonwy. The problem with Llyr is that it wastes this opportunity. The premise seems tailor made for exploring the character of the irrepressible Daughter of Angharad Daughter of Regat--what makes her tick, her family history, maybe giving longtime Prydain readers a true demonstration of her mettle... And yet she's absent for almost the entirety of the book! She puts in a couple of cameo appearances (ala Gwydian) at the beginning and end, but otherwise, her character is merely referenced by the others.In Llyr, there is some talk as to Eilonwy's potential to be one of the greatest enchantresses in Prydain (show us this!), there are mentions by the other characters of her irascible personality and how her abductor is surely going to regret kidnapping her (show us!), and mentions of her rich family history (show us!).Eilonwy is a character who has a mysterious past, comes from a long line of enchantresses, is set to be wed into a royal family, is kidnapped and put in mortal danger, and becomes the focal point of an island-wide search... And throughout it all, she is A.W.O.L. The themes I mentioned above are merely teases for the reader, musings voiced by the other characters. This not only makes the adventures of Taran and company feel a bit like \\"same old, same old,\\" but robs Llyr of having a strong identity of its own compared to the other 5 books. Llyr could have been the book in which Eilonwy (one usually reserved as a foil for Taran) came into her own. As such, it's more known as the book where we meet the giant cat. It's a book that doesn't seem to be about anything in particular except superficial adventures. (Indeed, the only part of the story that feels \\"important\\" is the end in which, not coincidentally, Eilonwy is finally on the page again.)[Compounding the problem: Not only is the kidnap victim largely absent, but the villain is as well. This off-screen stuff works fine when the villain is Arawn who can symbolize elusive, universal evil for the reader. But when the story is smaller like Llyr's, when the villain is more of an individual with a specific characterization, and when the plot is not painting in the broad strokes of \\"ultimate good vs. ultimate evil\\"--having such central characters absent for the entirety of the story presents a real problem. By the time we get to the ending which is meant to be a bit heartrending---(through bewitchment, Eilonwy does not remember who her friends are)---it's a bit like, \\"Who is this again? Oh, it's the girl we saw at the beginning. And who is the bad guy? Oh, it's this complete stranger who this book has not given us any time with until now.\\"]Imagine if the movie Cast Away had just focused on the Helen Hunt character and her 4-year decision to marry her dentist, with brief cameos by Tom Hanks at the beginning and end, and you kind of have The Castle of Llyr. It's sad that the 10-page short story \\"The True Enchanter\\" (found in the Prydain companion piece \\"The Foundling\\") feels more illuminating to the Eilonwy character than the whole of The Castle of Llyr.In the past I have read people (mildly) criticize Llyr for having a plot that feels insubstantial compared to the rest of the Prydain stories. Indeed, this is true. For unlike the other Prydain stories, one never gets the sense that a lot hangs in the balance. The companions aren't trying to save all of Prydain here, just one person. However, despite this, I feel this sense of \\"smallness\\" could have been offset had Llyr actually focused on exploring Eilonwy's character, the presumed subject of the book.We're not even sure if she's in much danger at all until the end. It's like reading a Scooby Doo mystery where the only investment you have is waiting for them to pull the rubber mask off at the end and find out whodunnit. Both the kidnap victim and the bad guy are absent for the entire story, and we're essentially left to hang out, once again, with Shaggy, Velma and the gang, whose escapades and shtick we've already seen multiple times by now, as they explore the haunted amusement park.I would guess that if any new readers chose Llyr as their first foray into Prydain, they'd be affected even more than a longtime fan. After all, why should someone care about the kidnapping of a character they never met before now, are never really given a reason to care about, and is mostly just alluded to by others.Make no mistake, the adventures we *are* presented with concerning Taran, Gurgi, Fflewddur, etc. are entertaining enough as always (if not exactly profound). And that pleasantness is why I feel the book deserves the three stars. But after realizing all that is missing, it's hard to unsee that big hole in the middle. Llyr would have benefitted from having at least a hundred more pages to give it a center. We could have gotten both the frosting and the cake. Llyr as is, is just the frosting."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"In this book Taran's thoughts and feelings about Eilonwy are the primary context of the story. It does a good job of setting up the next book in the series, Taran Wander, to offer a thorough exploration of Taran's self-understanding. As always, Lloyd's Prydain stories are accessible to young readers."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"i read this book when i was a youngster and just wanted to relive the story again. good for any child or adult that yearns for a simpler time."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"The Chronicles of Prydain continues in Book 3, The Castle of Llyr. Assistant Pig-Keeper Taran and his friends are going on another journey. This time, young orphan Princess Eilonwy is sent to the Isle of Mona where she will be taught the most difficult skill set she's ever had to learn: how to be a lady. The king and queen of Mona will teach her the courtly things every young princess must know. On the way, they meet the king and queen's son, Prince Rhun, who is a lot less competent than one would desire in the heir to the throne. He likes to be in charge but has no clue what he is doing. Very soon it is revealed that the king and queen intend to have Rhun and Eilonwy betrothed. All the while Taran discovers his true feelings of love for Eilonwy. But other plots are also going on. When Eilonwy is kidnapped, everyone must work together to save the princess from the evil enchantress Queen Achren.The story is exciting and moves quite quickly along. The romantic intrigue is an interesting addition to the adventure. It is definitely handled in a very kid-friendly way. To make things more complicated, the king asks Taran to watch over Rhun as they hunt Eilonwy's captors. Rhun eventually admits his own incompetence and his desire to prove himself worthy. There's lots of good drama and character development. The story seems a little episodic at times. They fall into many misfortunes and distractions that do not seem connected until the end of the story.Like the other books, it is very kid-friendly and I can't wait to read them to Jacob and Lucy."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"I recomend this book only to kids above the age of 9 because the book is a little scary.the book &quot;the castle of llyr&quot; is an exciting adventure.I got caught by the book in my school book fair.When i saw the book, i decided to read the summary on the back.it seemed so good i bought the book imeadetly.it was better than i expected."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"I have read The Castle of Llyr many times and it is one of myfavorite books. I love the Prydain chronicles and this book is rightin the middle of the whole story, we know the characters from thefirst two, and this book (of the five Prydain books) is a little more &quot;fun.&quot;I do suggest that you read it."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"The Castle of Llyr mostly has events occuring on the island of Mona, not Prydain. This book has a different feel than the previous two. It deals with Eilonwy leaving Prydain to &quot;act like a lady&quot;. Knowing her from the other books, she'd rather be doing what the guys are doing. Also Taran becomes aware of his feelings for her. Although they're usually arguing, I could see this sort of thing coming from a long way off. The main surprise is how someone(I'm not saying who)wants revenge and wants to exploit the unknown magical powers of Eilonwy to rule Prydain. The book, while simple like the others, gives great detail of how Mona is supposed to look like, and the actions of the heroes are easy to imagine. In this third book of the Prydain Chronicles, the main issues with Taran are jealousy and wanting what he seemingly can't have. If you read the first two Prydain books, this one won't be a disapointment."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"The transition from somewhat aimless humor and action to the gripping &quot;conclusion&quot; is fairly abrupt, which is why it seems like a finale when it's really about a third of the book. However, that's not a complaint. It easily lives up to the first two books, and it certainly has a distinct style - you should read it even if you didn't enjoy them."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"I thought that &quot;The Castle of Llyr&quot; was the best cronicle, I thought the companions were the best characters and I really enjoyed Gwydion.

I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"Lloyd Alexander never ceases to amaze as he rolls along in his classic Prydain Chronicles series with, The Castle of Llyr.

I can't wait to read the 4th book!"},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"This book introduces plenty of new characters, but lacks much action. Flewddurr(correct spelling?) now owns a very (VERY) big feline...(TWANG)err, so to say, gets stuck with it... sheesh, I wish I never took this harp...(TWANG)"},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"The third volume of Lloyd Alexander's Prydain Chronicles, \\"The Castle of Llyr,\\" is something of a diversion. The action leaves Prydain, and the adventures have less to do with the larger struggle against evil in the wider lands.That doesn't mean this isn't a fun and humorous book. It is. Consider it something of a side adventure.One of the great joys of this series is the steady progression from lighthearted children's fantasy to more adult themes and a grimmer tone, allowing the reader to grow along with the characters. What begins as a light fantasy becomes very serious, and it works well. By the end, you feel as if the characters have taken a life's worth of journeys, learning from them as they went.The five wonderful books in this series feature an interesting cast of characters. Most of the action centers on Taran, a pig keeper destined for great things. Others, including a stereotypical spoiled princess, a crazed Gollum-like creature, and a hapless bard, take part in a series of increasingly epic adventures.In this volume, the cast find themselves in another kingdom, where Eilonwy is busy learning to be a lady. A conspiracy of sorts appears, and our hapless heroes find themselves caught up in it. They encounter another batch of odd and interesting creatures, including a giant stuck in a cave too small for him and a giant cat, and grapple with corrupt (or simply irritating) nobles. By the end, we have some new and welcome cast members.While on the surface this volume is not wholly essential for the broader Prydain story, \\"The Castle of Llyr\\" advances Taran and Eilonwy's relationship and introduces some characters who will appear again later. The writing is direct and lively throughout, frequently using humor to disarm serious situations, though the pacing is not as perfect as other volumes.The Prydain Chronicles, including \\"The Castle of Llyr,\\" are recommended reading for anyone who enjoys fantasy, especially classic children's fantasy. This series is among the best of children's fantasy literature, walking the fine line between being accessible to young readers and being appealing and engaging enough for adults to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"The Princess Eilonwy has to go to the Isle of Mona to learn how to behaeve as a young lady.

You will be missing so many adventures."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"After the tinge of grimness in THE BLACK CAULDRON, Lloyd Alexander gives us a more light-hearted jaunt to Prydain in the third book of the series, THE CASTLE OF LLYR.I love this rollicking romp, but this is my least favorite book in the series despite our introduction to the smallest giant in all literature, Glew who has a wildcat the size of a carthorse, Llyan.The basic premise is that Princess Eilonwy is being sent to the Isle of Mona to be educated as a proper young lady. There's talk that she will be betrothed to Prince Rhun, the heir-apparent of that kingdom. Taran, Assistant Pig-Keeper and our hero, discovers he doesn't like separation from Eilonwy and he likes the planned betrothal even less. Prince Rhun is a nice guy, but a total klutz! To make matters worse, when events transpire that put Eilonwy in danger, poor Taran is taken aside by the King of Mona. The King, knowing that his son is less than competent, asks Taran to look after Rhun as well.Talk about a heart-burning situation! Rhun strives to live up to his position and Taran strives not to mind the fact that he has to repeatedly save Rhun when he really wishes the prince at the devil! This is very funny for the reader.Events move at a rapid pace in this volume, however the ending is still abrupt and still makes me indignant. My lips are sealed on that--this is a no spoiler review!Perhaps another reason that I like this book least of all five books in the series is Eilonwy herself. I love her daft comments and she's assuredly brighter than Taran, but as a character she never changes. From book one to five, Taran undertakes a journey that step by step takes him into manhood. Although Eilonwy is roughly the same age, she seems born with the knowledge that twists Taran around her little finger; she'll never change from girl to granny. It's the one flaw in Alexander's vision that he can't show us anything of Eilonwy's journey into womanhood. I can't call it a small one, but I love this series so much I can't mark it down too much. Call this four and half stars, then, in comparison to the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"Dont mind if I rated this 4 stars. THis is a great book, I couldnt stop reading it, but its just that THe book of Three was more interesting. I read this book since 5th grade(now im in 6th grade)its a lot interesting.I hope this review will be useful to you !!!thanks!!!"},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"I have only recently discovered Lloyd Alexander novels. I read THE BLACK CAULDRON, and immediately became so enthralled with Alexander's writing style and story-telling that I had to read the rest of the Prydain Chronicles. THE CASTLE OF LLYR, the third book in the series, met my need to involve the characters of THE BLACK CAULDRON and THE BOOK OF THREE, but this book is not THE BLACK CAULDRON, and seems to fall a slight bit short only because the overall theme of the novel is not approached quite as strongly.This installment of the adventures of Taran Assistant Pig-Keeper finds him escorting the Princess Eilonwy to the Isle of Mona where she is to be trained as a \\"real\\" princess, and then married to Prince Rhun, the bumbling prince of the isle. But sinsister forces are at work, and soon Eilonwy is spirited away, and it is up to Taran, Fflewddur the bard, Gurgi, and Prince Rhun to rescue her. They encounter many dangers along the way and quite a few interesting surprises that concern themselves and the Isle of Mona.- As far as CONTENT goes: There is definitely the use of a lot of magic in this story, between potions, magic items, and spoken enchantments. There are also a couple of disturbing sequences involving the possible brewing of certain characters. Parents may want to take a peek at these sections first to make sure their youngsters can handle it.THE CASTLE OF LLYR was a great adventure story that will immediately draw any reader in and not let go. Alexander has a wonderful way of catching hold of the reader with his story-telling. The theme addressed here is wonderful as each character learns something about themselves and how exactly Eilonwy's bauble really works.Fun read for a rainy day."},{"Title":"The Castle of Llyr","review":"I thought that &quot;The Castle of Llyr&quot; was the best book in the series.

It covers an amazingly broad spectrum, and brings together in one little volume the fruits of a lifetime of reading and exploration. Even if you're not a writer, by the time you finish this collection, you'll want to be."},{"Title":"The cool war","review":"The Cool War compliments another book by Frederik Pohl, The Merchant's War, and both depect versions of the future with weak governments helpless to contain forces of exploitation. This one anticipates how future wars will be undertaken through attacks that cannot be traced back to their source. The lack of accountability prevents retailation on any tit-for-tat basis, but soon enough everyone adopts that method and is undermining the stability and economy of every other power.Although none of the events depicted in The Cool War have happened yet, author Frederik Pohl nicely anticipates our excalation of terrorism, and he gives a wry fantasy about what the Mideast may do with all their money when the oil starts to run out.In the years since The Cool War was written, it has shown prescience, and it is valuable as a cautionary tale."},{"Title":"The cool war","review":"I would have one time considered myself a major Frederik Pohl fan, his novel Gateway stands as my personal favorite book and the writing techniques he used there seemed revolutionary at the time I read it. For all his high quality works through the 70's including 1976's Man Plus that climaxes with the release of 1977's Gateway, which swept the science fiction award field with both the Nebula and the Hugo, the quality of works after that quickly tapered off. Even Gateway's sequel, Beyond the Blue Event Horizon, which was a 1980 Nebula and 1981 Hugo finalist is really subpar and was riding on the coattails of Gateway by this time. So by the early 80's with the release of Starburst and The Cool War, there wasn't much joy in reading these. Even the book cover for The Cool War, a military tank with flowers and peace symbols painted on it was asynchronistic in being at least 15 years out of date by that time. Oh, the ideas are there and quite powerful. The Cool War is about environmental warfare between countries, attempted pollution of water reservoirs etc, with the title representing something between a hot war and a cool war. This concept is even more meaningful today that it was then. And this concept has been used elsewhere, Neal Stephenson has some of it in his novel The Diamond Age with neighboring countries battling \`coolly' or subtly via clouds of nanobots overhead. The concept is so powerful that it seems that Pohl could have written almost anything and it would have been good, but instead this is just a disappointment. Frederik Pohl though is definitely worth reading. Instead of this novel, I would defer one to his 1970's works."},{"Title":"The cool war","review":"Unitarian minister Reverend Hornswell &quot;Horny&quot; Hake is forced to join a secret government cadre of dirty tricksters called &quot;the Team&quot; in this wry, futuristic spoof of a spy novel. Hapless Hake's total incompetence becomes apparent almost immediately when he is abducted by the mysterious Leota, who works for an underground organization dedicated to fighting the Team. This doesn't stop Hake from carrying out his first assignment: escorting an unruly bunch of teenagers on a tour of Europe in order to reduce worker productivity. This campaign is typical of the &quot;Cool War&quot; Pohl envisions in which nations engage in covert operations designed to make the opponent significantly less competitive economically without the kind of national culpability that might generate a military response. Hake finds himself well rewarded for his pains, but is troubled by the moral implications of his actions. In particular, he worries that the minor annoyances caused by the Team are hurting innocent people more than their governments. The intentional wastefulness of the Team goes against his long-ingrained distaste for what this resource-starved society calls &quot;piggery&quot;, and in several subsequent encounters Leota asks him how he justifies his part in activities that seem so morally abhorrent and at the same time so politically meaningless. As Hake begins to act more independently, he falls afoul of the Reddi brothers, a pair (literally) of professional mercenaries who sometimes work with the Team, and other times work against it. Will Hake make his final stand for the Team, against the Team, or for himself? There are few enough really likable characters in this cynical, but still amusing novel, and Hake in particular is so easily dominated by whomever he happens to be with at the time, that readers may want to shake him and shout &quot;Why are you doing this&quot;? The story seems to imply that any attempt to interfere with the lives of strangers (for whatever reason) is ultimately both immoral and self-defeating. Even the seductive Leota comes to realize this eventually, at what may be thought of as the turning point of the novel. The Cool War has eliminated violent military conflict, but still espouses a spirit of competition and mutual degradation, which in the end, can't be good for anyone. Although this book addresses some serious issues, the tone is light and comedic, so it doesn't leave much of an impact. The combination of sci-fi spy thriller and romantic comedy, while unusual and even refreshing, just isn't that effective, so while this book is likable and even amusing, there may not be enough substance to satisfy everyone."},{"Title":"The cool war","review":"Jump into a future world becoming more and more like the world today.Mr. Pohl paints a tale of what a \\"Cool War\\" means. One of sabotage, assasination, and terror. Large governments are run by their bureacracies, more concerned about their own power games than the well being of their citizens.Written in 1981, this enjoyable short book has much to say about our current world."},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"English author Chadwick is the only author I can think of who manages to blend historical fiction with historical romance seamlessly from start to finish. I liked this novel better than her prior one, &quot;The Love Knot&quot;, because this one gets to the story's central conflicts faster. Set in medieval times, like all of Chadwick's novels, Miriel and Nicholas are the lead characters, brought together when she nurses him to health in the convent where she is a novitiate. Miriel escapes from the convent and follows Nicholas, only to steal part of the treasure he recovered in the marsh so she can make a new life for herself. This sets the stage for a very rich tapestry of medieval life to unfold, which has a full complement of characters including various people to whom Miriel and Nicholas are married. The central villain is Miriel's second husband, Robert, whose evil acts as a wealthy merchant were common in this time period. Nicholas and Miriel come together and apart throughout the novel. For those readers who don't like lead character separations, this might be a problem but it was not one for me. If you like this novel, also read Chadwick's &quot;The Conquest&quot; and &quot;Daughters Of The Grail,&quot; other five star novels by her."},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"Chadwick's writing is superb, her knowledge of all things medieval and the wool trade is beyond question, but couldn't we have chosen more sympathetic characters? Miriel starts off promising as a victim of her mother's bad decision in a husband. She's been groomed for the wool trade by her indulgent and successful grandfather but then rushed to the nunnery. She's constantly a thorn in the side of the nuns and then meets deathly ill Nicholas, who was washed ashore from an ill-fated baggage wain of King John. She helps to nurse him back to health (did we forget there were two other nuns involved in his nursing?), then runs away from the convent when they rid her of her one vanity - her hair - after she shows it off to Nicholas and gets caught. We see this character lie, cheat, steal, and then marry twice to further her position. She commits adultery with Nicholas, refuses to leave her husband for him, and then is upset when he goes back to his mistress. Ahh, the fine Nicholas, with the red-haired jealous mistress, but he deeply loves Miriel??? So much so, that he goes straight from Miriel's bed to the mistress?? Hmmm. Not exactly the romance novel material I'm accustomed to.Call me overly romantic, but I like the main characters to be people I can admire for their \\"romantic\\" notions of chivalry in as brutal a time as the medieval period. Chadwick's fine writing style and knowlege of the period kept me in the book nearly to the end, until I realized that I really didn't care what happened to anybody."},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"In 1216 England, Nigel Fuller roughs his stepdaughter Miriel Weaver for her disobedience and disrespect.

She trusts no male and he is a wanted soldier of fortune with no name or future. Over the next few years, aristocratic roadblocks continue to insure no relationship forms between them.THE MARSH KING'S DAUGHTER is an entertaining medieval romance that highlights the abuse of power that dictates much of the early thirteenth century noble lifestyle. Miriel is a brave woman, but her gender leaves her a victim as men make decisions that she dislikes for her. Nicholas is also impotent to help because he too is a casualty of the monarchy. Fans who enjoy an insiders look at a bygone era will gain immense pleasure from Elizabeth Chadwick's wonderful historical romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"Another excellent medieval historical from Elizabeth Chadwick! Her books never disappoint the reader. This is the sixth novel I've read by this author and it is one of her best yet!This story involves the lives of Miriel Weaver and Nicholas de Caen. Miriel is physically and verbally abused by her stepfather continually until he decides against her will to dump her in a nunnery. She eventually escapes with the help of Nicholas whom she had nursed back to health in the convent infirmary. He had been a prisoner with King John's baggage train in 1216 carrying all the royal regalia until the fatal tide and quicksand ends everyone's life but his own. He then takes a chest unknowingly containing a fortune in silver and Queen Matthilda's crown.Literally down the road, Miriel parts Nicholas' company with some of the silver and Queen Mathilda's crown. He finds this out and becomes enraged and vows to one day get revenge. However, for much of the story they live out different lives with different people until they fatefully meet again.I loved the detail and descriptions particularily concerning the wool trade, especially the manufacturing of the different types of wool fabrics and colors. This book had me turning pages until 2 a.m. anticipating what would happen next. A very exciting read!"},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"This was a story that seemed to follow the way of life in the Middle Ages; during the reign of King John and Henry. It doesn't give romance or value to life that we have nowadays; anyone whos anyone is at deaths disposal. The story also reminds of womens rights back then; there were none. If you were born out of wedlock, or an adulteress, there was little recourse; esp. for the lower classes. The story strives for realism; but I feel the love story part between Miriel and Nicholas is a wee bit more fantastical than keeping with the rest of the story. Which is fine, right? So its well written.Miriel has made some tough decisions and they are not always to her profit; however, as a woman---and a bastard runaway, she had little choice and her vision of the world is skewed. Her story is pretty sad. But I can see a sort of pattern of survival.Its almost the same as Scarlett O'Hara's!Nicholas' story is not as sad; I half wanted him to live happily with Magdalene. That part was bittersweet. Does Miriel really deserve him? I don't know. But does she deserve to be happy? YES.The story: Miriel is sent to the convent against her wishes. She finds Nicholas, a survivor of Johns treasure train disaster and nurses him back to health. When he leaves the convent, she wants to go to. Is desperate to. He grudgingly allows her to come along and thus their adventure begins; together and seperately then together again throughout the novel. Very graphic in descriptions."},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"This book started out very well and went downhill quickly. Meriel and Nicholas fall in love basically from sight only. This is not love it is lust. Meriel is far from being a heroin. Granted her husband Robert was a villain but she committs adultery with Nicholas thinking Robert is a nice man and doesn't even know he is evil almost till the end of the book. I found the heroine selfish and lacking any trait I find desirable in someone I am supposed to be cheering for. There was almost no dialogue between Meriel and Nicholas which makes it difficult for the reader to root for the two to get together. There is much more I could say I found lacking in this book but in general, the feelings a reader should be able to share with the characters in the book were nonexistant."},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"Fascinating characters, and a real feel for the period of history make this book unforgettable. I was completely captivated by Nicholas and Miriel, and found the villain (no names here!) spine-tinglingly nasty. An abosrobing read-I wish all historical novels were as good as this one."},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"I am beginning to wonder if me and reviewer Crystal Oats have been reading the same book. I was totally captivated by the characters in The Marsh King's Daughter. Meriel is a strong heroine who has to make some difficult choices and I found her personality intriguing and sympathetic. There was plenty of dialogue between her and the hero, and the love triangle was beautifully and sensitively handled. The Marsh King's Daughter has been on the historical fiction bestseller list in the UK and has had accolades from such doyennes of the genre as Roberta Gellis."},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"Characters full of human foible living in interesting times: two of the key ingredients in a great story.I enjoyed this novel immensely. The central relationship develops against a background of medieval history which showcases both without overwhelming either. I wanted to know more about the events of 1216 and I became engrossed in the characters whose story I was reading.Ms Chadwick makes medieval history come alive!Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"Elizabeth Chadwick writes very well, but I can't fathom what the title has to do with the story. I find this kind of ironic because I picked it up because of the title. The Weaver's Granddaughter might be a more fitting title.The characters are not likable yet they are compelling all the same. They are selfish, evil, petty, lustful, and occasionally good. I suppose if you want a good example of human foibles, this would provide it. It could have been a short story and still had the same effect. I heard the audiobook and the narrator did a lovely job with the voices.Fair warning for parents and young readers, Chadwick is very descriptive in all scenes, including \\"romance\\" and \\"bedroom\\" scenes."},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"This was my first time reading the wonderful Elizabeth Chadwick and I have to say I was not disappointed. I could not put the book down and I was up until 3am so I could finish it. So why only 4.5 roses and not 5 if I enjoyed it that much? Just personal preference, really. I think Elizabeth Chadwick did a wonderful job with this story and she was able to blend fictional characters, historical fiction, and historical romance together beautifully.The story was about Miriel Weaver and Nicholas de Caen, fictional characters set at the beginning of Henry III's reign in the early 13th century. Miriel has been imprisoned in a convent by her stepfather and Nicholas is a rebel against King John. They meet when Nicholas ends up sick and injured at Miriel's convent and she nurses him back to health. She then runs away with him when he leaves, seeing him as her only way out. Miriel then steals something of Nicholas's (which happens to be part of the royal regalia that HE snatched) and runs from him, setting herself up in Nottingham, hoping for a new life. The rest of the story is about their two separate lives until they eventually meet up again. Miriel ends up married to a really evil man, though she doesn't realize it immediately, and Nicholas becomes a very successful sea captain. The events at the end of the novel really rush along and kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end.While this wasn't about any historical people (though of course they are mentioned, they just don't play any major roll in the story) I really enjoyed it and I thought it was incredibly well written with well developed characters. You can feel sorry for Miriel as she suffered the way most women suffered during the middle ages - being at the whim of the males in your life, be it father or husband. I was a bit surprised that she really didn't have any inkling about how horrible her husband, Robert, really was and the lengths he would go to in order to get what he wanted. I did feel a few of her decisions were poorly made but she was doing what she felt she needed to in order to survive. I really enjoyed the bantering between Miriel and Nicholas as they tried to hide the fact that they already knew each other when they were finally thrown together again.The part that interested me the most was how Chadwick \\"explains\\" what happened to King John's royal treasure, which really did disappear around this time. As no one ever found it or knew what happened to it, it was fun to see her way of explaining its disappearance (though what happened to the Empress Mathilda's crown at the end made me want to cry).I would certainly recommend this to anyone interested in the time period. I would also recommend it to readers who would like to start reading historical fiction; this is an easy step into the genre as it doesn't throw a ton of historical information at you all over the place."},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"I have read many works by Ms. Chadwick and have to say I particularly enjoyed this one. No one is talking deathless prose here, but for sheer entertainment this one fills the bill. Well-plotted, fast-paced and pretty much believeable, the book moves along at a bracing clip without faltering. Chadwick's period dialogue rings true and she succeeds better at portraying actual people - as opposed to cartoon sterotypes - in this novel than in some of her earlier attempts. This would be a good choice for airplane or beach reading as it demands little of the reader. As an aside, I never did figure out why the novel has this title. No \\"Marsh King\\" any where that I found?!!"},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"The story begins in England, 1216 and follows through until 1221. Miriel Weaver is illegitimate. Her mother had had an encounter with a man who abandoned her after he got what he wanted. She marries, and the man who raises Miriel hates his stepdaughter's spirited ways. And so, he sends Miriel to a convent against her wishes. Miriel does not want to be part of St. Catherine's, especially because many of the nuns are abusive. How on earth will she be able to escape the abbey? Lucky for her, an opportunity arises. Nicholas de Caen is a prisoner of King John's. When the king and his cronies die, Nicholas manages to escape death, thanks to a couple of nuns who find him. Miriel saves his life, and in return she wants him to help her escape. He does, and she steals from him in the process. Well, the stuff she steals is stolen as well. The goods are King John's treasure, including his great-grandmother's jeweled crown. The stolen goods are literally a king's ransom. Throughout the years, while these two are apart, they each make prosperous lives. Nicholas prospers in shipping, and Mariel as a seamstress. The one difference is that she is forced to marry a man when finds out she is a fugitive from a nunnery. She gains her freedom, only to remarry a dangerous man. Through it all, her spirit is never broken. And when she and Nicholas reunite, the attraction is palpable, but also life-threatening...Once I picked up this book, I literally couldn't put it down. I have read four Elizabeth Chadwick novels now, and I marvel at her ability to create wonderful stories with accurate historical backdrops. This one is set during the end of King John's rein and the beginning of Henry III's. She creates a fictional account of King John's missing royal treasure, but it is Nicholas and Miriel who suck me into this wonderful book. The Marsh King's Daughter is full of history, romance and adventure -- with compelling protagonists, secondary characters and villains -- with so many twists and turns that you won't want to catch your breath, wanting to know what will happen next. The story has its tragic and bittersweet moments, and that's what makes it special. The other books have these elements as well, making Chadwick a glorious storyteller. This is the shortest of her novels I have read so far, but it is also the most intriguing and readable. I've enjoyed all of her books so far, including The Conquest, my second favorite after this one. If you're in the mood for a Medieval historical, I cannot recommend this enough. It is worth the UK import price."},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"Much of Elizabeth Chadwick's research is carried out as a member of Regia Anglorum, this is an early medieval re-enactment society. Her writing in recent books has become much more accomplished. She now writes about the period with the convictions of her obvious knowledge of the subject and has also made a subtle change from writing what were in effect historical love stories (nothing wrong with that) to historical novels with a love interest.This book is set in 13th century England. The country has been through a turbulent time the Lionheart a King who was virtually never seen by his subjects, either away at the crusades or in his lands across the channel is long dead but the ransom money raised by Richard's mother for his release from captivity has left his subjects much the poorer. The Lionheart's younger brother King John is coming to the end of a reign fraught with troubles, many of his barons and subjects unforgiving over John's attempts to usurp the throne while Richard was away. Amid all of this Nicholas de Caen, a knight injured fighting King John's troops is nursed back to health in a nunnery . . .The author's style is slowly changing, to my way of thinking for the better, but what does remain constant is her knowledge of the period about which she writes and her ability to draw the reader into the story, until they could almost be there. This is a rare talent indeed."},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"Born out of wedlock, Miriel Weaver adored her grandfather, a master weaver of fine wool. Her step-father takes over the weaving business upon her grandfather's death and Miriel rebels against him once to often and is packed off to a convent, although her rebellious nature continues and she doesn't exactly get along with life with the nuns either. Nicholas de Caen was a prisoner of King John until the baggage train is lost when the tide overtakes it as they are crossing the marsh. Nicholas reaches shore and finds quite a prize - a fortune in coin and the crown of the Empress Matilda. He is able to hide the treasure before he collapses from the ordeal and is eventually found by Miriel and another nun and nursed back to health.Miriel follows Nicholas when he leaves and convinces him to escort her to safety in a new town, but when he falls asleep the lure of the crown and the silver is too much and believing she's entitled to some for saving his life she takes what she considers her fair share and soon sets herself up in the wool business. Unable to trace her, Nicholas cuts his loses and uses what is left of the treasure to purchase a ship or two and begins shipping goods. Miriel eventually marries twice, but neither marriage is for love and both are older men. Her second husband Robert is ambitious and controlling and will stop at nothing to achieve his ends, including murder. Of course fate ordains that Nicholas and Miriel's path will cross again - will it develop into love or hate for her betrayal? What will Robert do when he realizes the two have a past connection?Well, you know I'm not telling - read it for yourself. This was another outstanding saga from Elizabeth Chadwick, I simply cannot get enough of her books, and every one of them sends me back to another world, another time. This was a bit different from the author's usual story; you won't find any lords, ladies or knights in this one. Just a fascinating look at the ins and outs of the wool trade, an interesting foot note in history on the disappearance into the quicksand of King John's treasure. I really enjoyed the pairing of Nicholas and Miriel and as for Robert, what a delightfully OTT baddie. Oh, and for the record I do enjoy a good well-rounded bad guy, I just dislike it when authors use cheap tricks like yellow teeth and stinky breath *telling* me how bad the baddie is instead of *showing* me. Hats off to Ms. Chadwick for knowing the difference. Five stars."},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"This one was as good as &quot;The Champion&quot;, which says alot as I thought it to be one of the best novels I've ever read.

If you love medieval, historical romance you should not miss out on reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"If you've ever wondered what it was like to live in the Medieval times in England you have only to open the cover of any book written by Elizabeth Chadwick. In true \\"Chadwick style\\", \\"The Marsh King's Daughter\\" tells the tale of love denied and human suppression, and the ultimate triumphs of love and personal accomplishment. I believe that Ms Chadwick's best known tale, \\"First Knight\\", only lit the way in the path of her success. Each of the books that have followed has only brightened the path in which she is heading. \\"The Marsh King's Daughter\\" is no exception yet at the same time exceptional.Chadwick transcends the genre with this extraordinary story. This is not a traditional romance but a well thought out, exhaustively researched and intensely involved literary masterpiece. Chadwick concocts believable characters and puts them in a thoroughly observable setting, gives them historical and fictional obstacles that bring them around to as perfect a climax as could be written. The title of the book, \\"The Marsh King's Daughter\\" is brilliantly tied in through an analogy of one of Aesop's Fables of the same name. The marsh where King John's treasure is lost essentially brands him the King of the Marsh. Miriel, the daughter of an environment she is born into, exemplifies the suppression from some of the men in her life and her struggle to escape.I searched high and low in this book to try to find something that was off, something that didn't quite click. I came away with only one thing that I feel very strongly about. It is that this book is just not long enough! Even at just over 400 pages and as gloriously complex as it is, the pages of this book fairly flew through my fingers. As I read \\"the end\\" on the last page I couldn't help but scream, \\"I want more!\\" Whether you're a long time fan of Elizabeth Chadwick's work, or a first time reader, you'll be screaming the same thing at the end.~ Kemberlee, reviewing for CompuServe Romance Reviews Charter Member of RIO (Reviewers' International Organization) Copyrighted 2000"},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"Miriel is an unruly, headstrong girl, whose stepfather places her in the convent of St. Catherine. While there, she comes into contact with Nicholas de Caen, a rebel against King John. While still a prisoner, Nicholas rescues John's infamous treasure from the swamp, and attempts to run away--accidentally (or not) taking Miriel with him. Their adventures, together and apart, take place over the course of about five years, as hate eventually turns to love.It's true that Elizabeth Chadwick's books, especially those about fictional characters, tend to follow a certain pattern: two would-be lovers are torn asunder by circumstances beyond their control, and they must battle against the odds to eventually return to one another. The main female character usually is very headstrong., and there's often a nails-on-a-chalkboard bad guy thrown in to complicate the plot. The Marsh King's Daughter is a little different, however; the excitement in this book lies in the fact that Nicholas and Miriel don't know that they're attracted to one another--in fact, they have every reason to hate the other! So it's this tension that gives the novel that extra excitement. I've described Elizabeth Chadwick's heroines as headstrong, which usually equates to modern; not so with Chadwick's female characters. I never get the feeling that Miriel, or even Nicholas or the other characters, never stepped out of the thirteenth century.Elizabeth Chadwick is also extraordinarily skilled at recreating the feel of the thirteenth century. She's mostly known for her novels about the twelfth century, but she depicts this period of time just as well as she does the other. With Chadwick's novels, you're guaranteed a historically accurate read, without being bogged down in too much overwhelming detail. There's only so much that anyone can really know\\" about people or places from 700 years ago, but Elizabeth Chadwick really knows how to pull the pieces together. In all, this is another good, solid novel from Elizabeth Chadwick. I've only got four novels left of hers to read (including the forthcoming To Defy a King) and I'm really trying to parcel them out!"},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"I've read a few of Chadwick's books now and have become used to her excellent writing style. She had me hooked early in this book, and while Miriel and Nicholas weren't the most sympathetic of characters, I admired their ability to make it in such a rough world. The story, while well put together, was rather predictable. I figured out Robert early on, and wasn't surprised to find I was right, and I knew what would happen in the end. But that foreknowledge didn't stop me from enjoying the book. Its certainly one that brings this time period to life, and one that makes me once again wonder just what happened to King John's treasure!By the way, some reviewers complain about the lack of romance in this book. No, this isn't a historical romance,its historic fiction, which suits me just fine!"},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"I loved reading this book. Elizabeth Chadwick rarely disappoints and I found I couldn't put this book down. Miriel and Nicholas are excellent characters that the reader will simply love.The story has good pace, wonderful period details and a gripping story. Enjoy this one!"},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"I love to read historical fiction, but I am disappointed in this one.The whole story has somewhat a negative feeling to it. The main characters seem to deal with a lot of anger and hate. Forgiveness is not much part of their lives. Miriel, the main character ,who is very independent and surely not treated nicely, when she is forced into a convent, where she meets Nickolas, she does not care for either and finally steals from him, after he helped her to escape. He also has a lot of anger, which does seem to soften later on.I wished they would have worked through that anger and been able to forgive, but instead she marries( Spoilers:) twice w/o love, though that probably happened often in the middle ages, but then when she meets Nickolas again she fornicates ,what causes her a lot of guilt and he has a relationship w/ a prostitute,who he finally marries( after he is disappointed that he can not marry Miriel). The characters also curse often and God is not part of their life except for mentioned prayer for the dead etc. I also did not appreciate the detailed descriptions of all of the love making to her husband,( which she hated) and to Nickolas, whos wife conveniently dies after childbirth."},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"This is a vivid tale of two intriguing characters that is loosely based upon the disappearance of the treasure of King John in 1216. With the fate of the items being lost to us it gave Ms Chadwick the opportunity to create a wonderful story of one possible, albeit unlikely, scenario.I found this novel to be a riveting tale that kept me turning page after page. It was so easy to become entwined in the lives of Miriel and Nicholas, and Ms Chadwick has once again shown herself to be well-skilled in the creation of vivid and complex characters. I found this particular novel to be somewhat similar to her novel \\"The Conquest\\" in style. The characters in these novels are not historical figures but rather imagined people of long ago, crafted so that they may bring a lost era of history alive once more.Even though this is not a novel based upon actual events, the reader is given a wealth of information of how life in the weaving industry was conducted at the time. Nicholas is involved in the shipping industry, which provided the reader with such context also. All that is missing in this novel is the context that would have allowed the story to tie-in with the larger events of the time period. Apart from the early depiction of the loss of King John's baggage train, and later the death of Eustace the Monk, there is little else that allows the reader to see how larger events were unfolding. However, this is not necessarily a criticism, as most historical novels deal with such larger events and it can be refreshing to read of the common people for a change. This just means that the author has to use her imagination a little more.Some may find that the story becomes a little predictable towards the ennd, but I personally feel that it did not ruin the overall novel. Sometimes it's nice to have a comfortable ending in a novel, and I was definitely left with a smile after I finished this one."},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"Fantastic story and engaging story-telling. What I generally like about British authors and their style is their realistic approach to the plot and characters - no contrived plots or events happening because the author 'wants' to put her beloved characters in a 'good light'. Despite being a romantic tale it shies away from sentimental nonsense. This story is well told but my only complaint is that I would have liked the main characters to have more time especially at the end. The time they spent earlier in the book seemed furtive and 'snatched' so I would have liked more time for normal interaction. But all in all a strong story."},{"Title":"The Marsh King's Daughter","review":"If you've ever wondered what it was like to live in the Medieval times in England you have only to open the cover of any book written by Elizabeth Chadwick.

I admired the Miriel character - unforgettable. Unfortunately, that's not what I think of the love of her life, Nicholas. I think that Robert, at some level, in some ways, suit her better (aside from fact that he's a selfish lover... but what medieval husband isn't?). He protects her and appreciates her strength, spirit and intelligence. In fact, the most poignant self-declaration of love for Miriel was by Robert. If only Robert wasn't made to be that cruel to Miriel, but then again, it's only b'cos he really loved her, in his own way. Nicholas, did not deserve Miriel, no matter how much she loved him. Nicholas truly deserved the whore (Magdalene) that he married. I find it unbelievable that he couldn't find any more worthy women (well, put it down to his noble nature, but it's more a reflection of his weakness and lack of imagination) to marry. I wished Miriel had found someone else other than Nicholas (a better male protagonist is Sabin, of the Falcons of Montabard, which is a better book). Magdalene, what can I say... I was cheering during her death scene. Put her out of her misery. She had it so easy so far... sounds callous, but glad she died.

There are things in this book that caused me to think about my own situation in a new way. Some of her insights are profound. It couldn't have been easy for Ms. Thompson to write this book.

It's a real page-turner; I found it almost impossible to put down."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"I've read several books trying to understand the beast within myself, and Tracy Thompson's is the most open and useful account I had found. I especially liked the way it captures the moments not just in hindsight but as turmoil and pain felt at the time. I've found it near impossible to reflect on my own moments of agony with a clear, wide-open eye. Another thing I respect is that depression isn't a one-shot thing, and reading her account of coming back out again was uplifting. As one who also was on the fast track to success only to stumble on myself repeatedly, I very much appreciated her story. Hers is one of the book that prompted me to write a letter as soon as I finished to thank her."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"Tracy bravely discusses her recurrent bouts of depression and the effect her illness had on loved ones. Her writing is top-notch and her attention details pulls the reader into her memoir as if the reader was with Tracy throughout her depression. I found the self-analysis to be a bit confusing at times, but overall it's a book I'd recommend for anyone suffering from depression or with loved ones suffering from depression. I recommend it for anyone who enjoyed &quot;Prozac Nation.&quot;"},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"Good book that describes the journey through depression. As a mental health therapist, I've recommended this book to my clients."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"Sometimes it's nice to sit down and peer into someone's madness, and find, to both amusement and astonishment, that what separates &quot;us&quot; from &quot;them&quot; might not be so large after all."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"What hope and comfort the author gives to the depressed person or their loved ones. The author has clearly expressed the suffering one does when they are depressed, often able to put in writing my very own thoughts and fears. This book gives hope of recovery from re-current depression and gives tools that anyone with a mental illness can use, despite the fact that it wasn't meant to be a &quot;this is how to fix your life book&quot;. It is the story of one woman and her trials with re-curring depression and how she overcame her &quot;Beast&quot;. A must read for anyone involved in mental health or suffering with depression. I keep my copy close at all times to refer to when I feel I have lost hope of ever being &quot;well&quot;. If you feel the same I would strongly encourage reading this book."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"Although not as poetic as Styron, funny as Manning or star-studded as Conkrite in their wonderful depression accounts, The Beast occupies a unique niche because of the author's brutally honest account of her low self esteem and acceptance-starved pysche that existed in spite of her career successes. I felt Ms. Thompson had looked inside my brain and revealed to me things I had never even admitted to myself.Yes, depression is an illness, with biological as well as psychological roots. But, while I would like to think of myself as an innocent victim of depression, it is closer to the truth to admit that I have held to incorrect perceptions since childhood that may have pre-disposed me to this illness. Ms. Thompson has accepted that painful fact about herself, and has shared it to our great benefit."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"I have read many books on Depression and other mental health problems since the summer of 1993 and this is the best that I have read yet. I would highly recommend it to anyone that either suffers with, or knows someone who suffers with Depression. The way Ms. Thompson has written this book really hits home for me and it was inspiring to know that there are people who have overcome this terrible disease and are successful at their chosen careers. IT IS THE BEST, THANK YOU MS. THOMPSON FOR SHARING YOUR STORY."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"Tracy Thompson's personal story of her lifelong struggle with Depression was extremely enlightening to me. A close friend of mine has been suffering through bouts of Depression during most of her life. While I knew instinctively there was something drastically wrong at times, I never fully understood the pain and anguish she was coping with until I read Tracy's story. While portions were very unsettling to read, it was heartwarming to see Tracy finally coming to grips with The Beast (her term for severe Depression) and understanding it's power. Throughout the book I saw incredible similarities between Tracy and my friend's behavior. I now can relate to what my friend has been going through, and understand why she behaved as she did from time to time. I also gained the respect that The Beast is a formidable force to be reckoned with. However, thanks to modern science and pharmacology, it appears that the taming of The Beast is a possibility for many who suffer from it's unrelenting grasp. This book is a must read for both those who are suffering with severe Depression AND those who care about a loved one who is dealing with this debilitating disorder."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"This is a fascinating first-person account of grappling with a lifelong pattern of depression. Tracy Thompson is tough and honest in looking at herself. She fearlessly searches to find out why this happens to her and what she can do to stop it.With her training as a journalist, she turns an objective eye on herself. It is this honesty that gives the book its strength. The portrait she paints of herself is not flattering. She sees the manipulative and deceptive behavior that she carries on in an effort to keep others near her, to secure herself from falling into another episode of depression.We watch her growth and her setbacks. We go along with her to therapy and to the hospital. It is not an easy book to read; it is painful at times, but it is also a remarkable achievement."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"I have suffered from a low-level, but chronic and debilitating depression for over 14 years. I, at times, grieve over those lost years of my life. Medication and occasional therapy have seemed to work for me, however, and I'm finally living. Yet, it is difficult as I struggle to change my patterns of thinking and behaviour. Which brings me to the book: this book was and is a god-send. She described so eloquently and precisely what the beast is about, how it devastates and how we learn to cope with it. Unfortunantly, these coping mechansims don't work well with the rest of the world. She confirmed many of the thoughts and feelings I have had and taught me new ways to cope. She has given my family and loved ones a new understanding of me that I could not convey because (thankfully for them) they had no clue what I was dealing with. Reading this book has literally been a turning point in my life, she has inspired, coached and encouraged me to start again, to try again, and I am greatful beyond words."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"An honest book from the heart written without gimmicks, sleaze, etc. like the usual self-help and avante garde illness-type book. The prose is excellent (it is no wonder the author was able to succeed in a successful job in journalism, despite her illness, VERY TALENTED); the book is very absorbing not boring, and offers very sound ideas about dealing with the worst of negative feelings; it was uncanny how it hit home. I recommend it highly to anyone for themselves or a loved one going through depression. This book will be remembered for a long time."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"when i read i have this tendency to underline or highlight phrases and words that strike me. reading this book i eventually had to give up on the note-taking, because otherwise the entire book would have been highlighted! i saw myself in nearly everything tracy went through. it helped me to understand things about myself that i wasn't even aware of. the periods of being &quot;fine&quot; in between the depression, the way it would sneak up on her, the way all motivation to work or function would just fly out the window, the way a person could seem perfectly &quot;normal&quot; to everyone around her and yet inside be a complete mess. all i want to say is thank you!"},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"For many, many years, I suffered terribly from depression, a tradition in my family. I was finally diagnosed a few years ago, and now take medication that enables me to live a normal life. Even so, this book gave me powerful insight into The Beast. I saw myself on every page. There were elements of this disease that I wasn't able to see until I read this book. (Like the fact that I was lying to myself and others about having the disease.) Reading it, I had &quot;aha&quot; after &quot;aha.&quot; Since then, I have told three people - my friends - about what I go through and what I have been through. That's a big step for me. If you can't sleep, or if you sleep too much; if you aren't in counseling because you're afraid you'll be committed; if you are in agony but you think &quot;everybody&quot; lives this way and just handles it better than you; if you don't want to live like you live anymore; if the anxiety is like a sock in your throat; if you feel like &quot;nobody&quot; could understand, please buy this book. It will help you. If you know or love someone who you think may be suffering from this disease, I recommend reading it. It will help you understand why they are doing what they do and may help you help them."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"Unlike some authors of depression memoirs, Tracy Thompson is brutally self-aware and isn't afraid of sharing her less than flattering experiences with a mood disorder. Especially, since she is a journalist and in the public eye (as I am, but to a much lesser degree), I admire her bravery for &quot;coming out of the closet&quot; so to speak. As she (and I) found there are a LOT of people out there grappling with a mood disorder and taking medication (cracks about Prozac notwithstanding).The book is unique because Thompson shares her unglamorous but effective tools for dealing with depression (after therapy and medication have been established). I, too, suffer from horrible perfectionism and it was heartening to read that this writer was able to overcome at least some of it and go on to have the life she wanted. Sharing the messy side of depression isn't what makes this book different, but that the author was able to take a long, honest look at herself and begin to make steps toward change was. Bravo."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"As a member of 12-step groups I and a &quot;long-timer&quot; I found this book extremely helpful in seeing myself in a new light. I was having trouble with anger and resentment. I have done the steps and it was helpful but her outlook on depression, which I have too, helped me understand myself in a deeper,more insightful way. I can see what is under the anger and yes sometimes the rage I feel. I also saw where I still have poor coping skills. It's not pretty at times but until I deal with my &quot;demons&quot; I will never get the recovery that some &quot;old timers&quot; have. I don't want to be a person who hasn't really changed much and I want to feel the full range of emotions that &quot;normal&quot; people feel. I have thought about Prozac but I'm still afraid it will change my personality. I use clonazepam. I have PTSD. I have only used it about 3 months and it's not working as well as at the beginning. I want to eventually not use any prosciption drugs. But like Tracy, I'm finding it helpful at this time. I'm just starting to learn to deal with PTSD and it's scary and confusing. I feel like I'm new to therapy again. Plus Im just starting to see how fundamental Christianity has done it's damage to me. I was in denial about that phase of my past that was my childhood. Thankfully I found Unitarian/Universalist church. Thank you Tracy for your book. It was worth the effort to write."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"A must-read for those who have their own beast or are close to someone who does. Thompson does a superb job describing what life with depression is like. She outdid herself in this investigative report about herself."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"The opening passage of the book gives any reader a great example of what an extreme, or even moderate, clinical depression is like. Though most of us don't have her specific beast, anyone with a full-blown clinical depression has something like it, and will be cheering for her as she fights her way out of her depression. It gives all of us hope that we, too, will see the end of the tunnel. A must read for people with this insidious illness."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"Like other great heroes, Tracy Thompson probably does not consider herself heroic. Nonetheless, she is very much a hero of mine. \\"The Beast\\" helped me soldier through the blackest days of my life, for which I will be forever grateful to Ms. Thompson.\\"The Beast\\" is an exceptional and excellently written description of a deeply private, highly accomplished woman's journey out of a dark night of her soul.If you suffer from depression or if you wish to better understand depression in order to support a loved one, I encourage you to read \\"The Beast.\\""},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"This is a book from the inside out, meaning the author writes well about the subject because it comes from within. I have read several books about depression, and this is the one that has impressed me the most. Honest, well-written, and it tells it like it is. At times I found myself disagreeing with the author's actions (but who am I to judge) as if she was a character (see, it reads like a good book, a novel even, definitely not self-help and never ever patronizing), but I always appreciated her honesty and \\"straightford-ness.\\" Somehow I found this book at the time I needed it the most, when I had given up all hope of getting better. I'm still not convinced I will, but this book has me rooting for the author. I am ever grateful and thankful it exists.If you suffer from depression, just want to know more about it, or someone you love suffers from it, please READ THIS BOOK. Most of the time, in anthologies and even some \\"memoirs,\\" I think: this person has no idea what they are talking about, I can't relate. Not here. This book is accessible and, I truly believe, helpful to anyone who reads it. Do yourself a favor and read this book. It is an asset to the field. And, subject not withstanding, it's a good book on its own. In other words, as a memoir it is interesting, entertaining, and you'll slow down your reading just to make it last longer (and to me, that's often the mark of a good book and an excellent storyteller). Best of luck to the author. And for anyone who reads this book because they \\"need\\" it, I get it. More importantly, so does the author. Good luck, then, to all of us."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"Felt like while reading this that the character of Thomas -she was completely to the end blind to the fact that he was an extraordinarily abusive man who caused her to have an emotional blindness to what he did to her. I feel he prolonged and intensified her depression and for whatever reason reading this book she fails to acknowledge and made excuses for him thru out. Her problems ran deeper than depression. I suffer from severe depression and anxiety amongst other conditions and am a male and feel she could have made this book a whole lot better if that was something she recognized and dealt with instead of sugar coating an obvious situation. I wish her well."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"This is a great book about a personal struggle with depression and it might help those who love someone with this disease understand just a bit about the daily struggle and battle with the beast. It is a good title and you want to turn the page and see how things work out and you hope that it will work out, but you know that it doesn't always work out in the way in which you hope for."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"Ms. Thompson's book literally took my breath away. At last, someone's life long account of deaing with depression. I commend her for her forthright, honest account of how this illness took over her life and how she battled her way back. Depression is so difficult to describe to those who have not dealt with it on such a severe basis but Ms. Thompson describes it perfectly, especially how it creeps up then grabs hold. Society still equates depression with a weakness in character so I find it particularly brave that such a public persona would come forth with such a personal tale. I know it has given me much comfort and hope."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"Brave, honest, touching. I ordered the book based on reviews here; why hasn't my therapist ever recommended it? Should be \\"required\\" reading for anyone who enters into treatment for severe depression. Excellent scientific, nature/nurture/cultural discussion of the malady that places many in a prison for crimes we never commit."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"This book has helped me through the years during difficult periods of depression. I began reading it, put it down for a few years and picked it back up again. It has become like a friend, giving a little relief in times where depression can create a sense of isolation. I appreciate the candidness of this book."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"Thank you for your story in an honest and insightful manner.My hat's off to you...... we need more honesty like this."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"I think that Tracy does an excellent job portraying her journey through depression, and that it accurately shows how a person viewed as &quot;normal&quot; by everyone surrounding them can actually have a multitude of problems. I have also read Prozac Nation, and I feel that although both deal with the issue of depression, Tracy's portrayl seems to be the kind of depression experienced by most people, rather than Elizabeth's all-out non-functioning type of depression. I found it very easy to understand and even to relate to because I, too, suffered from depression and am aware of the fact that you can live your life, and achieve many things of which you are proud of, but you can't appreciate your accomplishments because you are always trying to do better"},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"Excellent. A thorough first person chronology and description of the internal madness and external consequences of depression. Extremely well written. Like opening Pandora's Box and seeing my own patterns of pain, self destruction, ugliness, isolation, hostility and self-pity - and facing the truth that taking the risk to be honest and look at the internal trash is the only way out with one permanent (but fatal) exception. A must read for AA and NA &quot;old timers&quot; - when working the steps and years of sobriety haven't resulted in consistent peace. Thank you Ms. Thompson for revealing your demons - now it is easier to acknowledge and conquer my own."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"I ordered this book along with 2 others, You Are Not Alone (Thorne) and On The Edge of Darkness (Cronkite) and Ms. Thompson is the only one who I felt really understood what I am feeling and have felt, living with depression almost my entire life. Her first person account of living with The Beast made me feel like I am not alone with this disease. Although I appreciated the vignette approach to &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;, it was Ms. Thompson who I felt a real connection with. I could not finish reading the Cronkite book because it seemed like these stories were the rich and famous talking about their adult onset of depression. The Beast is absolutely THE best for someone living with depression because it made me feel like someone else has been through and lived through the same horrors that I have."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"As someone just diagnosed with major depression and anxiety this was a welcomed read. I felt as if I was reading about my own life. Her personal accounts of day to day struggles, and details kept me focused--which has always been hard for me. I couldn't put it down. I just wanted more. This book gave me relief that things would get better, and that it is ok if I have setbacks. It made me feel that what I have gone through,am going through is \\"normal\\" for those diagnosed. I commend her for her courage to put herself out there."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"This is an extraordinary book which moved me deeply. Kudos to Ms. Thompson for having the courage to share her life with us, especially since there is still a stigma to having mental illness in our culture. Until I read THE BEAST I had never read a personal account of what it is like to have depression. Ms. Thompson allowed us to see her day-to-day struggles that depression causes, the affect it had on her work, and on her personal relationships. These are things no doctor can convey to a patient. Presented are the human aspects of the disease which I never read in any book or article about depression before. Everything I read on depression up till this book had been sterile, clinical, totally unemotional, totally &quot;unhuman,&quot; and hard to relate to as a patient. To hear the patient's voice, concerns and pain - a blessing! A remarkable book. Read it more than once for additional doses of strength and courage to fight your own way thru. The second book I read that told about mental illness from the patient's point of view is the incredible, but very different, journey of Kay Redfield Jamison in the exquisite &quot;An Unquiet Mind.&quot; I can not recommend this book highly enuf. Although Jamison's journey is thru manic-depression/bipolar illness, her book is for anyone braving it thru any form of mental illness too. She takes us thru the time leading up to her &quot;episode,&quot; the progression of the illness as it becomes more severe, her recognition of what she has to deal with. She too allows us to hear her internal voices, feel her pain and anguish, share her incredible ups and downs as the disease plays havoc with her. And she shares her fear of loosing her career if anyone finds out that she has the condition. And yet Dr. Jamison, yes Dr. Jamison, M.D., had no place else to go than the very people she works with every day: her fellow psychiatrists and doctors, and fellow faculty members at UCLA medical school. So here we have the patient as doctor, the doctor as patient. Even as she is able to tell us her personal history of struggle, she is also able to gently explain what has clinically happened to her; and she shares her search for, if not a cure, medical relief and a full purposeful life. Both of these books by women are truly amazing!! If you or someone you know is suffering with a mental illness, read these to find out what is happening to you or your somebody. You will not regret it I can assure you. GOOD MENTAL HEALTH to us all."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"This book is invaluable to spouses &amp; loved ones of persons suffering from depression, especially if you are just beginning on this journey with your spouse. The saying goes you never know how a person feels until you walk a mile in his shoes. This is as close as we can get to realizing what our loved ones go through. I recognized so much of my husband in this book. It has given me a better understanding of what he is dealing with. I truly feel enlightened by this book and better equiped to give the kind of support my husband will need. I think this book is especially helpful for people whose loved ones have not reached the point of success that Tracy has with her medication. It helps us to see a future full of possibility!"},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"Tracy Thompson humanizes the often-clinical subject of depression by openly sharing her proverbial skeletons in the closet.As a fellow victim of &quot;The Beast,&quot; (an all-too-accurate description of the disease,) I felt at one with her honest portrayal of a lifetime ofchallenges and frustrations manifested from this disorder. From her candid descriptions of failed relationships and struggles in her professional life, to the irrationalfears and worries that accompany depressive episodes, this book made me realize that all I felt was tangible. Thompson breaks the unspoken taboo on this illness and makes one realize that it canaffect anyone. Having previously read Elizabeth Wurtzel's &quot;Prozac Nation,&quot; I spent a great deal commparing the two and found Thompson's account of her struggle more human than Wurtzel's. While Wurtzel, too, accurately depicted thedespair and despondency of major depression, her work came off as much more whiney and self-pitying than Thompson's no-holds barred recollection of her trip down depressions long and winding road. A book well-dope and worth a read whether you share inThompson's plight or not. A real eye opener that makes you realize the extent to which one person can cope and survive."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"This book put into words the problems &amp; symptoms that people with depression encounter. If you suffer from depression, this book will help you to understand yourself. If you know someone who suffers from depression, this will help you understand that person and will help you understand that this is an actual illness not just a state of mind."},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"As both a clinician and an individual who has battled life long depression I found this book the best and most comprehensive book on depression I've found. Not only does the author truly portray the experience of depression profoundly but she also gently assists the reader in understanding the complexities of treatment. Psychodynamic, cognitive, medication are all treatments she discusses and explains so the lay person can understand. She helps one debunk the shame in suffering the medical condition of depression and allows the reader who has suffered depression to nod knowingly and see, finally, they are not alone in their experience. What a gift Ms. Thompson has given to many!"},{"Title":"The beast: A reckoning with depression","review":"In brief, I found this autobiography to be profoundly representative of my own struggles with depression. She shows that depression can hit anyone, at any age, at any education level. Her story inspires the reader to believe that there is help out there and with work, one can be happy and successful again. I encourage anyone with depression and anyone who knows someone with depression to pick up this easy to read novel."},{"Title":"Mr. and Mrs. Club","review":"Nothing much happens in Ms. Emmet's book: the Prescott family fixes up an old farm house in the mid-1950s, Liza Prescott is unhappy and almost launches into an affair with the local alienated rich boy, who has been lifted without editing from every James Dean movie ever produced, but he is killed. She finds a job and is fulfilled and they move to Cambridge.You want period detail in a historical novel and there is a lot of it here, but did people really say \\"uptight\\" and \\"looking good\\" and did women from small towns in Pennsylvania really regret that they could only buy iceberg lettuce at the local grocery store in the 1950s? Well, not in the '50s I remember, but everyone has their own memories.What hurts the book is the Liza, the protagonist. She has a loving and generous husband, a lovely house on a piece of property large for the family to raise sheep, and she is unhappy. She comes across as a spoiled brat. She doesn't particularly like children and her one daughter is more of a burden to her than a joy. Then she finds happiness by getting a job . . . as the town clerk whose primary job seems to be moving dusty file boxes around all day. She writes a local history and that gives her satisfaction.Okay, it's important for someone to earn money and it gives them a sense of selfhood, but the job she takes is menial and the book could have been written without having a job, as so many wonderful women writers in the 50s did. The Mr. and Mrs. Club would have been far more effective as a feminist novel if Liza had either gone back to school to get an M.D. or had opened a store, say a knitting shop for all that wool. To substitute domestic drudgery for paid drudgery is not much of an improvement.This is important because the feminist movement has forced a lot of women into the workplace who would have been happier outside of it. In the 1900s, the feminists of the day launched the \\"livable wage\\" movement, arguing that jobs should pay enough to allow women to stay home. Highly educated people marry other highly educated people, and if they both work, their colleagues either have to become two career couples themselves or accept an enormous decline in living standards since the two career couples bid up the cost of living and one career couples can no longer live on the same level as their two career colleagues.None of this is an argument for stay at home women and society is better off employing all of its brains rather than setting aside half of them to educate the next generation, but you have to be alert to the cost of progress and by making Liza fulfilled by taking a crummy job sweeps under the rug the millions of American women who were unwillingly forced into the marketplace by Yuppies."},{"Title":"The stress of life","review":"Hans Selye MD PHD,the discoverer of \\"biologic stress\\", the neuroendocrine response of the body to exposure to stressors, lays the foundation for mind-body medicine and takes the reader on a detailed journey of scientific discovery which impacts every human being.

Mary MacCracken has a wonderful gift with teaching and understanding children of all types (I recommend also A Circle of Children and City Kid, and if I'd ever read it, I'm sure I would also recommend Lovey) and for creating remarkable stories of her teaching experiences. I'm glad she chooses to share these gifts. Everytime I read this book I walk away with a better sense of myself and more confidence in my abilities. Just like the children in the book who think they are stupid because of their inability to learn by conventional practices, I too get carried away thinking the worst of myself because of a failure that I associate with intelligence. But MacCracken imphasizes that just because something isn't done like everyone else doesn't mean that it can't be done at all and but that it can usually be done just as well, in a different way. Even if her books are out-of-print now, I'm glad they are still available (and I'm really glad I picked them up out of curiosity at the age of 13). They've changed how I think and how I perceive the world around me."},{"Title":"The American Women's Almanac","review":"Louise Bernikow has written a light, inclusive history of the women's movement in American. She organizes her history under broad topics like Media, The Female Body, Politics, Work and Artists and Writers. She briefly tells the true stories some women we've all heard of (Eleanor Roosevelt,Sojourner Truth, and Mae West) and some that I hadn't (Barbara Seamon, Anita Loos, and Anna Mae Wong) and places them in the context of their time. The book also contains sections called Good Guys -- where Ms. Bernikow talks about men like William Lloyd Garrison who made significant contributions to the women's movement.I've had the book for about a week, and I've enjoyed thumbing through it. It's not one of those books that you read from cover to cover. I've discovered things that I didn't know about familiar women (Eleanor Roosevelt insisted the reporters who covered her be female and therefor forced major publications to hire women reporters) and learned about events left out my history books (Suffragists on hunger strikes were force fed in prison).This book is for anyone (male or female) who wants to learn about what women of all colors have contributed to this country. Like any almanac, it doesn't cover any one topic in depth. It is designed to spark interest in the reader and includes a bibliography for those who want to learn more.I think it would make an ideal Mother's Day gift or a gift for any strong woman. It contains some sexual material, but its handled with sophistication. Anyone over the age of twelve could handle it, I think."},{"Title":"The American Women's Almanac","review":"Covers a wide range of historical figures and issues not reserved &quot;just for women&quot;.

David Fessenden's book does a great job of discussing how to make use of standard Sunday school curriculum, without slavishly following every detail, nor getting so frustrated you discard it entirely.His first focus is to teach as Jesus did, with authority, based on careful Bible study, prayer, and love for your students. He emphasizes giving yourself to thorough study of the Biblical content of the lesson, to allow the Lord to make the lesson your own. His second focus is learning to recognize the overall lesson structure provided by the curriculum writer, and then logically customizing the lesson in an easily remembered format.The book provides very practical help for teachers with varied skill and experience. The format is kept lively with vignettes from the teaching experiences of three companions in a local church. As we get to know Joe, Mary and Chuck, we see how they are able to solve their teaching problems with the author's suggestions.Teaching with All Your Heart provides insight by discussing the curriculum anatomy of a typical Sunday school lesson. Fessenden provides an understanding of the various methods used in Sunday guides to reach students with different learning styles. He presents the helpful \\"three point outline\\" approach to dividing a lesson and its topics. He then gives tips on how to appropriately \\"pick and choose\\" content to suit your students. There is even an interesting chapter on developing Sunday school curriculum from scratch.This book was a pleasure to read, and has a lot of wisdom for Sunday school teachers. It is currently helping me reshape my own approach to teaching from Sunday school guidebooks.

A collection of poems and essays, &quot;Dyke Hands&quot; covers a wide range of the author's diverse interests: spirituality, eroticism, cultural politics, love, and the struggles that come with being a writer.The book is divided up into four sections: &quot;Spirituality,&quot; &quot;Race and Culture,&quot; &quot;Love, Joy, Sex, and Loss,&quot; and &quot;Selves and Selfhood.&quot; Each of the four sections begins with several poems and concludes with one of Bogus' characteristically witty and insightful essays. From a diversity of her own materials, Bogus has thus constructed a unified and satisfying whole.Bogus' poems cover a broad range of themes and poetic styles. Some standouts include &quot;The Creator's Dalliance: Psalm 3,&quot; a playfully rhyming deconstruction of gendered concepts of deity; &quot;Michael Jackson,&quot; a painful meditation on the public image of the celebrated entertainer; and &quot;Making Whoopee,&quot; a highly erotic description of a lesbian sexual encounter with another Black woman.Equally engaging are her four essays. The best of the quartet are strongly autobiographical. &quot;The First Temptation of an Arrogant Christian and a Fledgling Buddhist&quot; is a revealing memoir of the author's own spiritual journey, and of her quest to integrate her lesbian sexuality into that journey. The final essay, &quot;To My Mother's Vision,&quot; is a stunning memoir of her birth as a poet during a fertile period of African-American cultural production in the 1960s and 70s. Containing Bogus' reflections on her encounters with such important African-American literary figures as Gwendolyn Brooks, Nikki Giovanni, and Dudley Randall, this final essay is a wonderful resource for students of Black literature.&quot;Dyke Hands&quot; will be of particular interest to those interested in the art of poetry and of the essay, as well as to students of lesbian literature and African-American culture. SDiane Bogus writes, &quot;I personally advocate for the good, just, right, truthful, faithful, and an appreciation of the beautiful.&quot; With regard to that goal, &quot;Dyke Hands&quot; is a trumph."},{"Title":"Dyke Hands and Sutras Erotic Lyric","review":"I bought this because it was highly recommended in the books by Tee Corinne \`Courting Pleasure', \`The Body of Love' and \`Dreams of the Woman Who loved Sex' - I figured it was a 'not to be missed book' and so it is.Taken from the author's introduction - \`This collection of my work will offend some because it walks the line between crude and refined, reverence and disrespect, between the secular and the spiritual, sexual repression and sexual expression, but it's that very line that lesbians tightrope walk everyday of their lives'."},{"Title":"Putain (French Edition)","review":"This book created some controversy when it appeared one and a half years ago. Some wondered if the author was writing from experience. It turns out that she was, and her descriptions of prostitution as practiced from an apartment near Montreal's McGill University are realistic, hardly erotic. There is no specific reason given for her entering this life, just an alienating background: disagreeable father, semi-invalid mother, and dead sister whose name the narrator uses when doing sex work. There was also a strong religious education she had to endure when a child (being that the author is young, a bit unusual in a Qu&eacute;bec that was secularized decades ago). There is a lot of self-dislike in the book, and sometimes contemptous, possibly pitying attitude to the men she services. There is a bitter tone throughout, and this gives the work a certain monotonous quality. The book, however, is never self-indulgent and is very well-written, with excellent sentence control and language, and a rythm that can keep one turning pages.This book probably hasn't been translated into English, and would lose something if it did. It was published in France, though the author is Qu&eacute;becoise, and is the type of work the French like, with much interior thoughts and feelings. The narrator of the book lives an insular life, has no relationships other than with fellow sex workers.One gets the impression that her father jaded her opinion of men to the point she cannot relate to them other than as a prostitute."},{"Title":"Putain (French Edition)","review":"Ayant lu 'Folle', j'ai voulu lire 'putain' et je dois dire que j'ai &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;ue.

I live in Italy, so I have never seen a copy of Food &amp; Wine magazine, but I noticed the book on Amazon.com, and, after reading reviews for other \\"members of the family\\" I bought this one, because it was the cheapest on Marketplace.I got it on the day before Easter and immediately decided to try the recipe for guinea hen with plums and grapes. It is very easy, because the ingredient list is really short: Guinea hen, a little butter, salt, pepper, plums and grapes. That's it, really simple, almost too simple, it left me wondering how it would turn out. It was absolutely delicious! The grapes cooked down to a thick and chunky sauce to serve with the meat, which was really tasty and juicy... yummy! Everybody loved it.Then I tried the Deep Dark Chocolate and Coconut Cake, which was also a great success: Extremely chocolaty with a bright white coconut and condensed milk filling (it is not cloying, I can assure you).I tried one of the chicken recipes and a couple of others, but there's a lot more on my \\"things to do\\" list!The book is hard cover with glossy paper pages and many pictures. It is divided into several sections: drinks, appetizers, salads, soups, the different ones for meat and so on.I don't like the layout very much, the recipes are crammed in newspaper-like columns, but I suppose it would be impossible to give each recipe its own page. Anyways, this is a minor fault, in my opinion, since they are so fresh and original. They all carry colour-coded dots to help you identify each type of special recipe: fresh, make ahead, healthy and best new cook. They are also accompanied by a wine or beverage suggestion to help you pair your creations.Menu suggestions are scattered here and there and they all seem really appealing, but I haven't tried any so far.All of the recipes seem fairly easy and the ingredients are not too exotic, there are many meals that you would be able to cook on a week night without much fuss, but there are also dishes and menus fit for entertaining.In short, I'm really satisfied of my purchase. I loved everything I cooked so far and even the things I haven't tried yet sound yummy to me. I am actually thinking about buying some more annual cookbooks, they are a really good idea.

Every war has produced a crop of such memoirs, and the most remarkable thing about them as a group is there essential sameness. Whether the teller is an woman abducted by Indians in colonial days or a aviator shot down over Vietnam, the experience of captivity is singular.It is also a difficult genre to present well. Nothing much happens to the POW. A day-by day recitation of starvation and waiting does little to engage the reader. And since most POWs were not writers in their previous life, they lack the kind of literary skill necessary to make a the story live.That is what makes Agnes Keith's 1947 \\"Three Came Home\\" so rich. Keith was a writer before her internment by the Japanese in 1942, and used her skill to present an heartbreaking but ultimately affirming narrative of life inside a jungle prison camp.Agnes Newton Keith came to British Borneo in 1934 as a new bride. Harry Keith was Director of Agriculture for the colony, charged with making trees grow \\"where before there were none.\\" They settled in Sandakan, North Borneo, where Agnes translated her love of writing into an award-winning book, \\"Land Below the Winds.\\" In 1940, she gave birth to a son, named George.George was not yet walking when war clouds began to gather over Borneo. By late 1941, the Japanese were threatening the invasion of the entire South Pacific. Talk in Sandakan revolved around the likelihood of the Government evacuating all European women and children. Agnes, like many other women, decided to stay with her husband.Invasion came on January 19, 1942. For the next 4 1/2 months, the 80 European residents of Sandakan lived under virtual house arrest. Agnes suffered a miscarriage under the strain. On May 12, they received orders to be ready to move within the hour, They were permitted one suitcase each. Husbands were separated from their wives and children. By nightfall, Agnes and George were dumped into a leaky old Quarantine Station on Berhala Island. They would not be free again until September, 1945.While there were countless examples of selflessness, captivity did not bring out the best in all people. Some hoarded food and medicine; others told guards about smuggling operations in exchange for favors. Tempers flared, and pre-war civility fell away. Keith recalled one women telling her: \\"I hate your guts Agnes, and I'm going to tell you so. Although I'd like to be nice to you, just to keep out of that damned book of yours.\\"And Agnes was writing a book, at great peril. For the next 4 years, she wrote in microscopic letters on any blank scrap of paper she could find. These notes were then hidden in old bottles, in George's toys, sewn into the linings of their clothes. \\"Land Below the Wind\\" had been widely read in Japan before the war, so the Camp Authority frequently searched her belongings for these notes. They never found them.This running diary chronicled her stay at Berhala and their removal to the much larger Batu Lintang complex in Kuching, where she would spend the balance of the war. As with any prison narrative, food was the dominant theme. The standard ration for POWs was rice gruel, rolls, and tea. They did not always get this, and it was never enough. Eggs and bananas were rare treats. This meager diet was supplemented with pickings from the soldiers' garbage, wild greens, snails, snakes, and whatever else could be scrounged. In four years, they received one Red Cross shipment. Each of the 46 Americans was given one box. These had to be divided among 280 hungry prisoners.Two groups within the prison kept Agnes going. First were Batu Lintang's 46 children. George and the others literally grew up within the compound. Hunger and exposure was the only life they remembered. They were tough because they had to be, but they were also generous, cheerful, and uncomplaining. At the beginning, Agnes and the other young mothers committed themselves to doing whatever it took to keep their children alive. In the end, Agnes mused, \\"perhaps they brought us through alive.\\"The children, and the nuns. More than half the 280 women at Batu Lintang were Dutch or English sisters. To Agnes, a non-Catholic, these women were awe-inspiring. \\"...I met nuns as women, and sisters, and mothers, and hard workers, and my friends. Here I met them as people who sang, and laughed, and made joke and had fun.\\" Inside prison walls, the sisters held Mass and celebrated holy days. \\"They prayed for peace, believed it would come; set dates, and hours and deadlines for it--and when it didn't come they said \\"Thy will be done,\\" and prayed again.\\"The Japanese did not treat the women as badly as male POWs. Men could be killed on a whim. With the women, the guards usually contented themselves with a slap across the face. Far more frightening was the idea of sexual assault. One night late in the war, Agnes was assaulted by a guard. When she reported this attempted rape, the commandant ordered her to withdraw the charge. Falsely accusing a Japanese soldier was a death-penalty offense. Agnes refused to recant. She was promptly and severely beaten. Ultimately, the commandant decided to drop the matter, but the female prisoners suffered several weeks of reprisals from angry guards in the weeks following the incident.Completely isolated from the outside world, the POWs did not know when or if help was coming. On August 18, 1945, they received a leaflet drop saying that the British Army was on the way. It was three more weeks of agonized waiting, but the camps were eventually liberated on September 11, 1945. Agnes and George were reunited with Harry, and within a week they were on a transport ship to the United States.\\"Three Came Home\\" is a powerful narrative. Keith did not shy away from sensitive issues; she did not try to hide her anger at having a section of her life stolen from her. One caution: some modern readers may find her use of racial slurs offensive. Put in the context of the easygoing racism of the era and the indignities suffered in captivity, her derogatory comments on the Japanese become understandable, if not excusable. In any case, \\"Three Came Home\\" is a moving look at a dark chapter in the Pacific War.Settled in the States, Agnes finally told Harry about her experiences. \\"One anticipates a some emotion from a man when telling home that his wife has been attacked, kicked and beaten,\\" she wrote. \\"Subconsciously, I think I expected a little melodrama.\\" Instead, Harry was quiet and sad, but showed little other reaction. That was a prisoners' life, gender notwithstanding. \\"I saw,\\" she concluded, \\"that we had come far from our old concepts of honor and disgrace. In war, we women must fight with all ourselves.\\""},{"Title":"Three came home (Mermaid books)","review":"This book contains the wartime memoirs of Agnes Keith. In 1939, Keith published a book \\"Land Beneath the Wind,\\" describing her life as the wife of a British colonial official in Northern Borneo. She and her husband Harry were on home leave in North America in 1939 when she finished writing the book. However, Harry was called back early to Borneo from his leave because of the war clouds on the horizon. Agnes, who was pregnant, soon followed, and several months later, gave birth to their son George in Sandakan. Although there had been talk of evacuating women and children from colonial outposts in the Pacific, no orders came through for evacuation before the Japanese invasion, and Agnes refused to leave Harry behind voluntarily. Thus, when the Japanese arrived, all three Keiths were still in Sandakan, and were soon interned in prisoners' camps for the duration of the war. In this book, Keith recounts the stories of how she, George, and Harry survived life in the camps. Her tale was so remarkable that it was made into a movie shortly after the war.Readers of Keith's earlier book will be stunned at the change in tone of her writing. In Land Beneath the Wind, Keith writes with an airy, scattered-brained style, almost as if she were afraid that otherwise, she would be taken too seriously. Indeed, it was perhaps her humor itself that made her first book popular. But the light tone is gone completely from this book. The nightmare of the prison camps, where random beatings were a certainty, but food was often unattainable, and hygiene nonexistent, took away her carefree nature and matured her overnight beyond her years. For more than three years, she struggled daily to find any kind of food for George, from wormy rice to just plain worms. This woman of colonial privilege traded family heirloom jewelry for a chicken, and learned to hoard night soil for use as fertilizer.From the start, the Japanese camp leader recognized her as a special prisoner, because he had read Land Beneath the Wind. He required her to keep a journal of her camp adventures for future publication to show how \\"humane\\" the Japanese treatment of prisoners had been. So every day, after she completed her required prison work, she had to write for this commander about how wonderful camp life was. When that was finished, she secretly wrote up notes describing what life was really like, and hid them in cans buried under their huts or in the latrines. The most amazing part of her experience is not only that she and George and Harry survived at all, but that through it all, she managed to come away from the camps without blind hatred for the Japanese. She recognized that some of the prison guards were evil, but that many couldn't help but obey their superiors. The years of captivity for the Keiths robbed them of their youth, their health, and the better part of George's childhood, but Agnes finds fault not with Japanese people, but rather with the idea of war itself."},{"Title":"Three came home (Mermaid books)","review":"As much as &quot;Three Came Home&quot; is a story of war, it is a story of love. Mrs. Keith's love for her husband and son are paralleled with her hatred of internment. She balances the good in people, even the enemy, with the bad. The clear message is that war is what makes people bad. I enjoyed this book. It is beautifully written, with every sentence eliciting some kind of emotion in the reader. Mrs. Keith is an admirable woman for her literary accomplishments and her ability to share her experiences on a very personal level."},{"Title":"Three came home (Mermaid books)","review":"I read this book because I saw the movie by the same title with Claudette Coberette (spelling?) from 1950. It was a great movie that made me want to find out more about Agnes N. Keith and her family. Upon researching her, I found out she had written several books before her war experience and several books after the war.Agnes was on the island of Borneo with her husband, Harry, and toddler, George. Harry Keith was there as part of the English government's efforts. The Keiths knew the war was breaking out, but chose to stay in spite of the dangers. Agnes chose to stay with her husband. In the book she said she never regretted her choice to stay, but did wonder later on if George should have been sent out to stay with relatives.The Japanese took control of the island when WWII started. All English and Americans were rounded up and placed in prisoner of war camps. The men and the women were separated. Agnes and Harry did occasionally catch glimpses and stolen moments, but for the most part they were kept totally separated during the years.The book details the daily life of a prisoner. A lot of the book describes the harsh conditions, the lack of food and hygiene. There were a lot of children in the camp. The mothers banded together to take the best care of the children they possibly could. A group of nuns was also in the camp and helped with the children.What I found most interesting in the book was the amount of underhanded trading, bartering and smuggling which went on in the camp. The prisoners put themselves in great danger to get extra food, clothes, to send mail in and out and to meet with their spouses. They were afraid, but apparently not totally afraid. The book also details their other daily efforts to keep body and soul together. They kept gardens, picked wild berries and weeds, kept chickens under their bunk houses and other very original ways to make things better.The Japanese took a greater interest in Agnes than in her fellow prisoners because of her fame as a writer. They tried to get her to write progoganda for them. They also were concerned she was doing her own hidden writing. Agnes put herself in great danger to write a continuing journal and keep it hidden. Her effects were searched more often because of her writing.This book will be of interest to anybody who is a history or biography buff. She tells some details of the war effort. But most of the book is her own personal story.Some of the other reviews touched on the fact that her attitudes reflect the common attitudes of the 1940s and 1950s. If bigotry and racial prejudice are a big issue with you, you may not like this book at all. For the times, Agnes thinks of herself as very liberal and open minded. In a time when there was a great deal of stereotyping, she is trying to be a great human. However, when cast in our time period, she comes off as having a great deal of prejudice. She talks about race A LOT. And she says things which are very condescending and narrow minded. When she see little Black children who are adopted by White missionaries she says something like, it's clear they and their forefathers are not used to using their mental capacities and it's clear they will never be able to keep up with the other children. At the time, she was probably criticized for having Chinese, Philapino and Black friends. But now it all sounds very antiquated. Which is not bad, it makes us realize how far we have come in our attitudes.Aside from the racial things, her writing is very descriptive and flowery. She gets deep and philosophical about very odd everyday things and goes on and on like she is writing an essay for junior high. That said, she is an interesting writer able to make what was no doubt a drab ugly existence very interesting.Agnes Newton Keith also wrote a followup book &quot;The White Man Returns&quot; which details the Keiths life after the war when they returned to the same island. That book doesn't have as much interesting drama, but it is still a good read."},{"Title":"Three came home (Mermaid books)","review":"In Three Came Home, Keith tells the story of her survival in a WW11 Japanese prison camp.

Agnes Keith was married to a British government officer when the Japanese took Indonesia during the early days of World War II. Keith and her toddler son were taken to a POW camp; her husband spent the rest of the war in a men's camp under even worse conditions. Keith's memoir describes the starvation, the cruelty, the inhumane conditions, disease, torture, hard labor and the women's superhuman struggles to keep their children alive and relatively healthy. The story is not only about survival, but about the power of love. In the book an occasional racist remark, typical of the times, creeps in, but she also occasionally inserts insights into the humanity found even in some of her captors, and certainly in the Indonesian people. The book ends with little bitterness, and primarily a plea for peace. The film was remarkably faithful to the book, sanitizing and softening some details because film audiences weren't expected to see Claudette Colbert fighting rats, living in abject filth, or dropping down to 80 pounds. The film is still very powerful; the book even more so. This is a well-bound trade paperback edition."},{"Title":"Three came home (Mermaid books)","review":"I found this book in my mother's collection of old books she has read years ago and shelved to be read again sometime in the future.

Very emotional A DEFINATE MUST READ BOOK"},{"Title":"Biggles on the Home Front","review":"Just to be clear, I'm not so much reviewing these Biggles books as providing a synopsis of the story, which Amazon completely lacks - mainly because it's pretty hard to pick what each Bigles book is about based on only the title. Although I have a fairly large Biggles collection built up since I was about 10 years old, I don't own every single Biggles book myself and I've sourced some of the synopsisii from others so I don't take credit for much of the content. Hope this helps you decide whether you want this particular Biggles book or not. For myself, I classify pretty much all the WW1 Biggles stories as 5 star as these are by far the most authentic and well written, the WW2 stories as 4 star and the remaining non-WW1/WW2 Biggles adventures as either 4 star or 3 star depending on the story. May be a bit of a plot spoiler, but overall, I hope it helps you decide whether you want this particular book or not.First Published in August 1957 - 190 pagesBiggles is asked by Inspector Gaskin to help him catch a fence, that is, a handler of stolen goods. Gaskin believes this mystery person must be using an aeroplane to fly stolen goods out of the country. A fake news report of a serious theft is circulated in the papers. Biggles then goes to the Barnstable Arms in Soho, a well known watering-hole for criminals, to show off some of the proceeds and see who is interested in them. Approaching a criminal called Gus Norman and pretending to know of him through a mutual acquaintance, Biggles shows him a stolen gold mount. This leads to an approach being made to Biggles to sell it, and he does, to a mystery man wearing an RAF tie, at Victoria Station. Biggles is then approached for the stone that was set in the mount.The police, by following Norman, have trailed him to the train station at a place called Hertford. Biggles and Ginger keep watch at this station and see a black Daimler car drop Norman off. They then follow the Daimler to a large country house. Booking in to a local hotel, Biggles bumps into an old friend, Bill Reverley who is with the man in the RAF tie whom Biggles met briefly at Victoria Station. The man is introduced as Verney Laxter. Biggles bluffs his way out of the situation. Biggles and Ginger go and investigate the large country house by flying over it and taking photographs. This is the picture on the dustcover of the book. Reverley is murdered in a plane crash when sugar is put in his fuel after turning down a job with the crooks.Biggles is then offered the job that Reverley has turned down. When Biggles is taken, with Ginger, to the large country house, they find that their cover has been blown and they are exposed as police officers. They are locked in the cellar. Algy and Bertie go to investigate the house after arranging a police raid with Inspector Gaskin. Further jewellery thefts have taken place and the police raid is just in time, as the crooks are vacating the house for good, having set fire to it. The fire was meant to destroy any evidence as well as kill Biggles and Ginger locked in the cellar.Overall, rather dated."},{"Title":"Design of Fluid Thermal Systems (The Pws-Kent Series in Engineering)","review":"This book is an exceptional follow up to the fluid dynamics publication by the same author.

The rest of the book is okay but it needs to be edited again."},{"Title":"Methods of Thermodynamics","review":"For someone who really wants to understand classical thermodynamics, this book by Howard Reiss can't be beat. Reiss faces the most difficult questions in the subject head on and answers them with thoughtful clarity.He avoids the common errors that almost all texts repeat in their treatments of entropy and covers both the Kelvin/Clausius and the Caratheodory versions of the subject.He covers thermodynamic potentials in a very consistent manner that makes them much more understandable.This is the text I always come back to when I need to review a topic or sharpen my thinking in this area."},{"Title":"Methods of Thermodynamics","review":"This is an excellent book for a student of thermodynamics to read after having digested the contents of several more elementary works. It revolves around the careful use of thermodynamic potentials with Chapter 8 being the key chapter. The earlier chapters build to this chapter, and the later ones resolve from it. The focus is purely on equilibrium thermodynamics and the approach is somewhat unorthodox as the author makes heavy use of the concept of constraint in thermodynamical systems. Indeed this concept is introduced in Chapter 1 and slowly developed until Chapter 8 where its connection to thermodynamic potentials is fully elucidated.Chapter 2 reviews some of the key mathematical machinery from multivariable calculus that plays a central role in all thermodynamic derivations.Chapter 3 covers the first law. Chapter 4 covers the second law. Chapter 5 is on ideal substances and the definition and treatment of ideal solutions is the clearest I've read anywhere.Chapters 7 and 8 form the center of this book, and both are dedicated to features of equilibrium. During Chapter 8 the author makes it clear that part of his motivation for writing this book was the slipshod treatment and use of thermodynamic potentials he has seen by his peers both in textbooks and in research journals. Needless to say, his treatment is rather careful although ultimately still not rigorous.The rest of the book is dedicated to examples of the \\"proper\\" use of thermodynamic potentials when applied to a variety of situations commonly encountered in thermodynamics, and it is in these chapters that the real payoff of studying this book is realized. Situations treated include phase equilibria, osmosis, surface effects, gravitational and centrifugal fields, elastic systems, and stability of equilibria. I found the chapter on surface effects particularly valuable as this is an important subject which is seldom or poorly treated in other works. Many of the other topics here are very standard, but the fresh perspective and consistent approach are appealing.The book ends with a chapter on third law.The author takes a very pure macroscopic approach to thermodynamics, and references to the microscopic are few and far between. I like that in a thermodynamics book. Furthermore the exposition is of high quality throughout.I had only a few misgivings about this book. The first is that the typeface used is quite small throughout. I'd guess 8 point. The second is that for such a careful treatment the author occasionally makes comments that seem poorly thought out such as a comment about friction made on page 10. I also found it odd that in spite of the author stating that he was writing a book on thermodynamics that was chemistry oriented, there are very few examples from chemistry. Finally, there are no exercises.To finish, I'd like to quote from the preface of this book a paragraph the echoes my own experiences with this subject:\\"A first glance at thermodynamics leads to a false impression concering the ease with which it can be mastered. A superficial perusal reveals that the subject does not require great mathematical facility. Certain parts of it may be learned by rote, especially where repetitious techniques are employed. In contrast, the mastery of the related discipline of statistical mechanics requires greater mathematical proficiency, but the subject lends itself more easily to understanding.\\"Besides being very well said, this quote clearly establishes the audience of this book: someone who has studied both thermodynamics and statistical mechanics to a level where they have developed a degree of comfort with the methods of the former and the conceptual framework of the latter, and has then realized that thermodynamics is more subtle than it seems. And who has also realized that statistical mechanics does not replace thermodynamics. Such a reader will almost surely find this book a helpful next step.In short, a valuable book for the advancing student."},{"Title":"Methods of Thermodynamics","review":"Did you already take a thermo class? Then this book is for you. It helps reinforce key concepts without focusing too much on the process and mechanics of doing thermo problems. It's an excellent second-time-through book, showing how powerful thermodynamics can be. Reiss makes thermo seem easy, and I always put the book down feeling a bit smarter for having learned something new."},{"Title":"Methods of Thermodynamics","review":"This book is great. It did improve my overall understanding of thermodynamics. In fact, it goes really in details and made me question the subtle things that I did in my thermodynamics course. The mathematical proves are detailed and clear and do not require any advanced mathematics. In addition, there is a math chapter in the beginning of the book that covers the * non regular* math that the author will use. But, to be honest, the math chapter is not very straight forward, at least not for me. It did make me read from a lot of resources to understand what is going on. However, I can not admit but its use, I learned some mathematics and revised a lot of old math to understand that chapter. This book is not a very easy read, so be prepared for a lot of hard work ! However, it is REALLY worth it."},{"Title":"Luke 9:51-24:53","review":"Just is passionate about his subject matter, Luke's Gospel. Here in two volumes he provides not only a historical commentary on what Bible exegetes have said about this inspired text, but also adds his take: incarnational and sacramental theology.As the series exhibits in each volume, so these two provide the original language comments on grammar, textual criticism, etc. which is so vital to the pastor or advanced layperson.Then he proceeds to the actual commentary on each section showing that meal/table fellowship with the Lord is major Scriptural theme and substance of the third Gospel.I find this commentary most valuable and turn to it often to test my exegesis and find thoughtstarters for my preaching/teaching. It will most certainly be a valuable aid to both Lutheran and other confessional Christians as well. Highly recommended. Worth the investment of time and money."},{"Title":"Luke 9:51-24:53","review":"Arthur Just is a professor at Concordia Theological Seminary in Fort Wayne, Indiana with his areas of expertise being New Testament theology, liturgical history, and catechesis. This commentary is the second in his two-volume commentary on Luke's Gospel in the Concordia Commentary Series. This particular volume does not contain an introduction (as this is found in volume 1), but does begin with a table of contents, prefaces, a table of icons (see below), and a bibliography. An index of volumes one and two conclude this commentary.Arthur Just views the Gospel of Luke's primary purpose as being a book of catechesis (Christian instruction) for believers and seekers. As such, Just always comments with an eye toward teaching the fledgling Christian the basics of doctrine, identity of Jesus, and the role of the post-ascension Church. He also holds basic theological assumptions concerning the text. Namely, that St. Luke wrote the text, that his original writing is an infallible work inspired by God the Holy Spirit himself, that sacraments are important, and that Luke structured his Gospel in such a way so as to draw out certain theological emphases.For each pericope, Just provides his own translation, provides extensive comments on theological insights gained from the original Greek text, writes a general comment covering the entire pericope, then comments on the various verses and details. In the outer margins of the commentary, icons are provided to alert the reader to certain recurring themes in Scripture (e.g. one icon alerts the reader to comments on Eschatology, another icon alerts the reader to comments related to the Temple, etc.). Just finds chiastic structure fairly often in the various pericopes and shows how such a draws out overlooked Scriptural statements. Just also places a focus on the unity and interconnectedness of Luke's Gospel as a whole. He often shows the continuation of a Lukan theme and/or how Christ sets a pattern early on in Luke then continues to fulfill that pattern.Of particular importance for Just is the account of the Last Supper and the account of Jesus appearing on the road to Emmaus. When the Last Supper is introduced in Luke 22:14-23, Just slows down his commentary significantly as he places the meal in its historical context, analyzes the grammar, shows the early Church's understanding and use of Holy Communion, and shows what Holy Communion means for the Church today. He concludes that in the Last Supper/Holy Communion, Christ has made himself the fulfillment of the Old Testament Passover and remains present with his Church as they continue to proclaim his death (and subsequent resurrection) in Commuion. Further, Just draws out the significance of Jesus post-resurrection meals with his disciples in Luke 24. Throughout the commentary, Just draws connections between the various pericopes and the Jesus post-resurrection discourse on the road to Emmaus. By proclaiming himself the fulfillment of Old Testament prophesy and through the sudden \\"opening of the eyes\\" of the Emmaus disciples, Just continually draws out Luke-Old Testament connections and also argues that there is a sudden break between the pre- and post-resurrection people of God in theological understandingThis volume contains two excurses: \\"Luke's Travel Narrative\\" and \\"The Old Testament Witness to Christ.\\" Just's work in this second excurses is to be particularly commended as he analyzes Luke (and Jesus') use of the Old Testament (Pentateuch, Prophets, and Psalms) to show Luke's concern for typology, fulfillment of prophesy in Christ, and continuation of the Old Testament in Jesus.Just is certainly a strong and respected scholar. His comments are well-thought-out, excellent connections are made between the various pericopes within Luke (and between Luke and the Old Testament), various scholarly arguments are presented and given respect, and the literary unity of Luke is well presented, defended, and explained. Also of special note is Just's excellent treatment of Luke 18:15-17 Yet, this side if heaven, we all want for perfection; this commentary is not without its flaws. At times, Just fails to \\"sell\\" me on his theory that Luke's primary function is catechesis; his connections between the various pericopes and the Emmaus account are hit-and-miss, and his translations tend to be wooden. Although he purposefully presents wooden translations in order to draw out Greek emphases, they are often confusing and distracting. 19:5: \\"And as he came to the place, Jesus, looking up, said to him, \`Zacchaeus, hurrying, come down, for today in your house it is necessary for me to abide.'\\" 10:25: \\"And behold, a certain lawyer stood up, putting him to the test, saying, \`Teacher, having done what shall I inherit eternal life?'\\" If you have no trouble with these, you'll have no trouble with Just's other translations.Yet these flaws are admittedly minor and the strength of Just's arguments require the discernment of each individual reader. In all, this is an excellent, well structured, Christ-centered, conservative, scholarly work that deserves wide readership. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The great Pierpont Morgan","review":"A surprisingly sympathetic biography of J.P. Morgan. He was a steadying force in the marketplace, especially in the area of the railroads where the competition was cut-throat. The author tells of cases where Morgan would re-acquire ownership of a Railroad at a loss, because Morgan thought the owner was not running it correctly. Time and again Morgan would risk money to uphold his business principals often losing money in the deal. Eventually in later years the government stepped in with their regulatory agencies and performed much the same task that Morgan was performing. The author gives some personal insights such as his style of art collecting and his lifestyle. It is very well written, interesting, and appears to be well researched, Morgan's scandals are also mentioned, but overall I am surprised at how straightforward and upright J.P. Morgan appears. I had scant knowledge of J.P. Morgan, and this is the first book I have read by this author, but the viewpoint of this book is so different from what I expected it left me a little skeptical. This book will make the reader think twice that maybe J.P. Morgan is receiving a bum wrap from the reputation he has with the average man on the street's opinion of him. Call it cynicism, but this reader can not shake the feeling that there must more to this guy."},{"Title":"Mistaken Mistress (The Australians) (Harlequin Romance)","review":"By coincidence I got another book by Ms. Way-- I get these from the 50 cent section at Half Price books or from the library. This showed some development on the part of the author. Her characters in this novel were more compelling and the plot more intricate. The secondary characters were appropriately placed and added to the story. There were still lengthy description throughout the book that were somewhat tiresome to get through. The chemistry between Eden and Lang was dazzling and made the book work for me. There were too many descriptions of jewel-toned eye and hair color for my taste, but it was considerably toned down from The Bridesmaid's Wedding. As with the other novel, the setting was Australian. I actually noted far less vernacular in this novel. The conflict seemed genuine, character-driven, and I liked the non-stereotypical interference of secondary characters in the conflict. There were familial difficulties at work that didn't involve babies. On the whole, I found this book entertaining."},{"Title":"Mistaken Mistress (The Australians) (Harlequin Romance)","review":"Lang Forsyth was shocked when he saw his business partner, Owen, dancing with a stunningly beautiful woman, a woman about half his age.

She became an obsession, a fever in his blood, one he had no intention of quenching.Eventually, Eden told Lang the truth and he was overjoyed that Owen had at last found his long lost daughter. Still, Owen is in love with a dream from his youth. His first love is now dead and Owen doesn't seem to know how to open himself up to his current wife. She remains angry and bitter.What warm-blooded male wouldn't be captured by Eden's fragile beauty and her love for adventure? Lang himself isn't immune to her charms, but he finds their romance apparently escalating at a pace that's a little too much for Eden. When she pleads for more time to get to know him better, does Lang have the strength to honor her request?Bitterness mingled with familial conflicts, and the love that often motivates them, are the crux of this story.

His chronically unhappy wife, Diana, is further distressed when Lucio loses his job at the bank. Her mental health slips until she is anxious to enter a sanitarium which seems to combine elements of mental institution and pet hospital. Lucio desperately misses his choleric mate although his misery is challenged by the attentions first of his wife's lookalike sister and later by his neighbor's wife. When Diana finally returns, she is far more agreeable than previously. Lucio likes her better this way but is unsure if he loves her. As the sliphole into the fantastic leads in ever stranger directions, Lucio must decide if his dog, also named Diana, has become the true host of his wife's spirit. In trying to solve this problem, Lucio bravely enters the sanitarium and asks indelicate questions. It is at this point, the novel becomes ever more harrowing and the path back to \\"reality\\" more difficult to discern.As with Kafka, Borges and Marquez, Bioy utilizes the fantastic to delineate the real. A Day in the Sun is a love story that explores the nature of connection and of identity. It also functions as political parable and cerebral adventure story.Lucio's stolid nature, as well as his love for his wife, is his greatest asset as he enters this strange world lying so close to our own. Critic Thomas Beltzer says of Bioy's narrators: \\"The strangeness is not just in the observed but in the observer.\\" Part of Bioy's art is to encourage the reader/observer to test the line between real and fantastic while experiencing the book. If the observer can accept and move through the small opening with the author, he will find Asleep in the Sun a rewarding fable."},{"Title":"Asleep in the Sun (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"Really excellent - captures the Argentine personality.

Portraying a man in an agony of moral conflict over his love for a woman convict yet constantly aware of the family left behind in England, The Playmaker addresses human feelings at many levels. Like so many of his books, Keneally has taken figures from history, weaving a plausible tale of the life they might have led. His examination of the mind and heart of Lieutenant Ralph Clark, during the early years of the Port Jackson [Sydney] prison colony, a is deeply moving account. Far from home, these exiled people face disturbing choices. Keneally compares the founders of the Sydney colony with space travellers, isolated in a dangerous situation with limited resources.Clark's task is the staging of a play in celebration of the king's birthday. Assembling a cast from the convicts, he's confronted with a range of personalities from house maids to forgers. Keneally's research has dredged up backgrounds of these transported felons; the thieves' guild oath is a particularly fine touch. His real talent, however, is in presenting this material through his characters . Each of his figures projects a reality surpassing other writers of historical fiction. While his descriptive narrative may make modern allusions, none of his persona are dragged out of their original time frame. Ralph Clark is particularly well drawn. Keneally has a special talent for presenting us with an 18th Century man's feelings and aspirations as much as it's possible for us to know them.That this book has been returned to the active sales list is a testament to its value. It should be read by more people. The 18th Century setting is less important than what Keneally has to say about people. Add this book to your shelves with confidence. It's worth more than a single read."},{"Title":"The Playmaker","review":"I read this book seveal years ago, before Keneally's name became so widely known as a result of the success of Schindler's List (the movie). This book stands out in my memory for the great ability to transport us to a different time, place and way of thinking. I found it to have been very skillfully written. I subsequently read other books of his as a result of the pleasure derived from this one and was not disappointed.This book deserves to be more widely known."},{"Title":"The Playmaker","review":"In 1788, the First Fleet landed in Botany Bay to establish a penal colony. In 1789, Lieutenant Ralph Clark is commissioned by H.E. (unnamed in the novel but historically Governor Arthur Phillip) to stage a play in honour of the King's birthday. George Farquhar's comedy \`The Recruiting Officer' (first performed in 1706) is the play: the fact that the colony possessed only two copies of the script was the least of the handicaps to be overcome. Lieutenant Clark selects his cast from the convicts: burglars, whores and highwaymen. Most of the convicts are illiterate, rehearsals will be challenging and costuming rudimentary.There are many levels to this novel. Staging the play - bringing British culture to the Antipodes - provides a backdrop for this period of the tentative new colony. Ralph Clark himself is torn between the family he has left behind and his feelings for a female convict who is one of the actors in the play. Woven around historical fact, this novel brings people and place to life. The play, that civilizing event, is being staged in a struggling community formed by exile.I enjoyed this novel and Mr Keneally's depiction of this period of Australia's colonial history. Thomas Keneally wrote in the epilogue: \`For yes, though they are fantastical creatures, they all lived.' Imagine that.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"The Playmaker","review":"If you enjoy the arts, colonial history,Greek mythology, drama...it's in there...Keneally weaved all these teams brilliantly to create a masterpiece in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Playmaker","review":"I don't really like starting a review with the setting - as if that's more key than the quality of characters, plot, dialogue, style etc. - but that's what I feel like I have to do with this book. The setting overwhelms the story for me, the setting is where this starts and finishes. Of course setting is absolutely crucial for many stories - but I want more. Keneally does give more, but I still think he relies more on the presumed resonance of this (to an Australian anyway) famous historical time and place than actually evoking something that resonates on its own.I felt at such a distance from most of the characters. Some of this is perhaps conscious as we see from Lieutenant Ralph Clarke's perspective, and his reserve is a key aspect of his character. However much of it felt condescending - smug tourists relishing a visit to colourful characters, smirking at their antics or being shocked at their bizarre practises, before returning to their air-conditioned hotels. The lags were so colourful - the whole \`Tawny Prince' mythology, Dabby Bryant's mysticism, queen Goose, winking at the noose, Black Ceasar - that they stopped being people. They were more their trappings than individuals.I fall back on it too often, but pretty much these days all the historical fiction I read is put up against Patrick O'Brian. Well, actually a lot of other fiction too - and that's the point: Aubrey and Maturin are such triumphs as characters: they're allowed to be different without becoming caricatures, and without losing the basic humanity that we can identify with; we don't have to dismiss them as fools or elevate them as fantastical heroes. The rich knowledge of their time and place (fairly contemporary with \`Playmaker' as it happens) integrates with rather than overwhelms the people."},{"Title":"The Playmaker","review":"The earliest days of Sydney, Australia, and the prison colony which was its first population center provide a dynamic setting for this ambitious, old-fashioned novel. With a broad scope, grand design, and sensitive treatment of universal themes, it has the weightiness of an epic, but is far more vigorous and more involving than that, with vivid, sympathetic characters who come fully to life.Transported halfway around the world to a forbidding and alien landscape, men and women prisoners share their personal struggles, providing a vitality and emotional punch one does not often find in fiction. The reader soon discovers that the prisoners are not all that different, of course, from the civil servants and Marines who administer the colony--everyone in Port Jackson (Sydney) is a prisoner in some way or another, be it physical, spiritual, or emotional.Lt. Ralph Clark's decision to produce George Farquhar's early 18th century comedy, The Recruiting Officer, with an all-prisoner cast leads to many emotional conflicts. Though the play provides the participants with a way to achieve a measure of dignity, they must still bow to the strictures of the colony off stage. Many prisoners wield cruel powers over other prisoners, while Marines and administrators exert power over both the prisoners and the aborigine inhabitants of the area. The restrictions imposed by the church, in the person of Rev. Dick Johnson, aggravate tensions by concentrating on rules of behavior rather than on the human soul.Against this backdrop of the restrictions on their lives, Keneally's characters are set in high relief, their humanity contrasting sharply with the impersonal forms of government which are imposed upon them. Meticulously depicting 18th century England, its government, its penal system, and its social structure, along with early Australia, its first western inhabitants, the decimation of the aborigine population, and the social conflicts faced by its characters, this is one of Keneally's greatest novels, a timeless story based on real journals, stunning in its effect.

Bufferd, Creating Ceremonies: Innovative Ways to Meet Adoption Challenges is an important resource for helping adoptive families cope with developmental challenges and life transitions. Each chapter includes actual scripts of rituals and ceremonies that have been used by the authors to help adopted children, parents, and professionals cope with various life-cycle phases from preadoption to leaving home. In chapter five, for example, the scripts address issues of loss and detachment. The ceremony &quot;What is Going to Happen Now?&quot; is a ritual designed to help young adopted children deal with an impending divorce. In this narrative, the parents announce their decision to divorce, encourage the child's expression of painful feelings, and make clear that the child is not at fault for the divorce. The remaining chapters address many other issues such as bolstering self-esteem, celebrating anniversaries, and ackowledging fears.I strongly recommend Creating Ceremonies for clinicians interested in working with adoptive families. Since the scripts are applicable to challenges facing families in general, this book also serves as a helpful resource for all family therapists. The scripts can be modified during sessions to fit clients' unique situations and, also, can be used as a self-help resource for adoptive families."},{"Title":"Creating Ceremonies: Innovative Ways to Meet Adoption Challenges","review":"A friend told me how helpful this book was and I decided to buy it.

Being a Religious Scientist and soon to be adoptive father I was searching for a way to honor the arrival of my boys when the day comes and they permanently become a part of my forever family.This book is well thought out and very relevant. It is simple to use and the instructions very clear.I am very much looking forward to the day that when I can put the book in use as I read the book cover to cover the day I received it. This book is really relevant for children of all ages in my opinion and either boys or girls.I would encourage any person thinking of adopting a precious soul into their families to get thisbook. I simply cannot imagine that you will be sorry that you did.I wish you all blessings from above in your adoptive journey."},{"Title":"Of virtue rare: Margaret Beaufort, matriarch of the House of Tudor","review":"As an avid reader of books about the War of the Roses and the Tudor dynasty, I found this book a trial to finish.

Unfortunately, I should have read a little more before buying it.I was hoping it would humorous and informative, but it was barely that. Bower spends more time ranting about how ugly Americans can be and expressing his own political views than he does on actually living in Mexico. I am from America, I know how ugly Americans are. Tell me more annecdotes about Mexicans and Mexico.Aside from the rants, Bowers also seemed not to have proof read his book. Not only are there numerous typos, but he even repeats an entire chapter. Chapter 41 is repeated (except with a different chapter title and number) verbatim. Come on!I am interested in moving to Mexico and was looking forward to reading this book, but I came away extremely disappointed.If you are looking for humorous travelogues, might I suggest you read the following:\\"Holy Cow: An Indian Adventure\\" by Sarah Macdonaldand also \\"The Sex Lives of Cannibals\\" and \\"Getting Stoned with Savages\\" by J. Maarten Troost.These are well written, fun, and informative.If you want to learn more about moving to Mexico, read \\"Adapter Kit: Mexico: A Traveler's Tools for Living Like a Local\\" by Ken Luboff. It's a serious guide for moving to Mexico and is much more informative than Bowers' \\"Mexican Living\\"."},{"Title":"MEXICAN LIVING Blogging It From a Third World Country","review":"I am familiar with the area of Mexico about which Mr. Bower writes. While I don't share all of his opinions, they are valid. Some articles (and remember he states this is a book created from articles he has written) are laugh-out-loud funny. Some are troubling. All are thought provoking. He has not marketed this book as containing exclusive information not available anywhere else, but his opinions are certainly his own; the result of his personal journey which none of us can totally share. But we can all enjoy it."},{"Title":"MEXICAN LIVING Blogging It From a Third World Country","review":"In the genre of memoir travel writing, Blogging South of the Border: Notes from a so-called Third-World Country debuts as a significant competitor for the Social Humor Commentary of the decade in Mexican and American relations. Author Doug Bower, an American expatriate, bobs and weaves, in and out, over and under the multitude of cultural comparisons he makes between the two cultures. He shares his observations of life in a Third World Country critically and humorously. He takes no prisoners.After a lifetime of living in the U.S., Bower and his wife of 22 years moved to Guanajuato, Mexico, to spend the rest of their days. Both are writers. Blogging South of the Border: Notes from a so-called Third-World Country, originally meant to be a column, blew up into a full-sized book. This collection of daily essays is taken from Bower's daily grind as an American expatriate.Blogging South of the Border: Notes from a so-called Third-World Country is a delightful and gentle union of humor and serious contemplation of what life is really like in Mexico. Nothing is spared--from dog poop on the sidewalks to mountains of bloodied meat sitting in the back of a truck outside your local butcher shop. Constant comparison is made between life in America and that in Mexico.Bower also constantly examines the relationship between a Mexico-ignorant America and how that works out in issues such as The Minuteman Project, The Ugly American Syndrome, NAFTA, monolingualism in America, and the Americanization of Mexico."},{"Title":"International Handbook on Chemical Weapons Proliferation","review":"Handbook is a very scholarly peice of work. The intent of the book, its audience, or possible use is not clear. It does not analyze how nations acquire CW weapons, nor details CW proliferation history.The focus is on a series of notable events involving CW weapons by the developing world (not all inclussive). Many times the points being made is the difficulty in assessing what is really happening elsewhere in the world, and the various inaccurate perceptions made at the time of events (hind-sight).So if it is not a handbook, what is it? Perhaps a scrap book of a few CW weapon events in the developing world."},{"Title":"The Golden Locket","review":"The Golden Locket will make you laugh, cry, and won't let you put the book down.

Each page is beautifully designed, and the poems and scriptures are very touching. Thomas Kinkade's artwork is stunning, as always.If you're looking for a sweet baby book, this is it!"},{"Title":"A Child's Garden of Verses Baby Book","review":"...I didn't love it.This was given to us as a gift and while it is charming and the artwork is lovely, this missed the mark for me.I felt like the main focus of this book was Kinkade's artwork. The space given for pictures of the baby, notes, keepsakes, etc., is miniscule. For example, baby's hospital bracelet, mom's hospital bracelet, newspaper announcement and birth announcement are all supposed to fit on one page that's roughly 8.5x11. There are 26 pages with Kinkade's artwork (most featuring cottages- while pretty and quaint they have nothing to do with a new baby) and even more pages with poetry and prose (all having to do with a baby- there's just too much).There is so much going on in this book- artwork, silhouettes of children, poetry and Bible verses that there just isn't enough space to focus on your new baby. I also thought it seemed a bit disjointed and jumbled in its design and layout.Incidentally, I would think twice if you're purchasing this book for a baby boy- the color scheme has a tendency to be a bit girly. In fairness though, there is nothing overtly girl about it.This book is just okay. If you're a huge fan of Thomas Kinkade, you'll probably love it. It does have everything you would expect in a baby book. I would prefer something more simplistic with more space for pictures, keepsakes and thoughts on my new baby."},{"Title":"A Child's Garden of Verses Baby Book","review":"As always Thomas Kinkade produced a magnificant history book for a child.

It demonstrates through stories how God can impact a world today through the power of prayer. If you are a teen who wants to change your world. . . If you are a teen who has been asking God for a miracle in your school, your home, your own heart. . . If you want to experience God, then this is your book.As someone who ministers to teens across the nation, my heart was stirred by Cheri's book. It wasn't written for teens by an adult, but rather expressed by teens whose heart was to run after God with a passion. I would recommend this book to any teen, and to anyone who loves teens!"},{"Title":"When Teens Pray: Powerful Stories of How God Works","review":"The testimonies of these teens is amazing.

It shows how teens CAN change the world and be changed through prayers. It also shows all we need is dedicatoin, faith, and non-stop prayers. At first I thought the book only gathered a bunch of successful stories of how prayers work, and explains a little about each content. I wasn't very satisfied. But later I tried the methods provided and suggested, I realized how real and helpful these praying guides CAN be. This book also encourages teens to get two or more reliable accompaniment praying partners. I am amazed of the unimaginable greatness of our God.

Makes a great gift."},{"Title":"Staying Sane in a Changing World: A Handbook for Work, Leadership & Life in the 21st Century","review":"This book focuses on mental health in the corporate word. More specifically, it address the fact that working life has become a nightmarish experience for the majority in salaried employment, mainly because of a radical paradigm shift that has taken place in our times.It begins by giving an excellent commentary and an in-depth analysis of what this paradigm shift is all about. In effect, moving from the machine-age world-view to the e-world view that prevails today has changed just about everything: the prevailing mind-set, the way work is organized, how people need to be treated, career path planning, even the type of education systems which are considered appropriate.Those who are caught in \\"transition sickness\\" (my term not the author's) typical of our times will find this enhanced comprehension of what they are actually going through extremely advantageous. Greater insight will generate greater adjustment and thus higher levels of mental health.The author recommends that we become convinced of one truth, viz. that it is the world that seems to have gone \\"crazy\\", not us! This would be a welcome insight which will bring much relief to those who are struggling so much in a confusing world just to keep afloat. With such a conviction in place, we are empowered to work on the strategies she recommends. These include becoming extremely clear about the meaning and purpose of our own lives - what she defines as \\"spirituality\\". With such clarity we will be able to steer our own career paths and our lives in according to what has meaning for us.She also emphasizes the need for enhanced personal development particularly in the area of self-nurture to sustain our own vitality and the ability to respond creatively to a changing world rather than to succumb to it. This includes: being in touch with our inner truths and striving to go after our own desires and preferences, ensuring our physical health, taking care of our emotional well-being by taking time and energy to cultivate strong bonds of relationships with family and friends, replacing disempowering belief systems with positive thinking, as well as acquiring wisdom as opposed to knowledge. Such wisdom includes learning that \\"The big people are those who give\\"!This book is certainly recommended reading for all those who want to live creatively in this brave new world rather than merely cope or survive. The author writes from her personal experience of the present reality and thus her book has the power to inspire and transform. It did have such an impact on me personally.I commend the author for giving us an insightful treatment of today's working world which manages to be analytical and intellectual yet touchingly human and thus credible. Read it if you want to soar to new heights of personal achievement and happiness even in such a crazy world as ours today."},{"Title":"The Spider (#12): Reign of the Silver Terror","review":"Pure slam-bang pulp adventure action here. THE SPIDER fights bad guys all across the country. The action is everywhere -- in the sky, in the capital, in the deep mines of Colorado. From a start-in-the-middle-of-the-action opening scene, until the very last page, the pace of pulp action never stops!"},{"Title":"BULLFIGHT","review":"I ordered this book because I wanted to find out what \\"bullfighting\\" is all about. The images I had seen were confusing and any explanation I had heard was decades old. This book gave me all I was looking for and a bit more.The book is written by an anthropologist as an academic work but that does not mean it is not useful to the masses. A full explanation of various taurine events, known collectively as \\"bullfighting\\" in English, occurs in the first two chapters. I am confident that having read it, I could attend one of these events and have a good idea of what is going on.The author makes a point I have heard before. These events are not sports in the way the English world thinks of them. Neither are they art as we are used to it. Instead, they are are unique type of event which draws on both. The author explains this better than I ever could.Fully half of the book is devoted to examining these taurine events in a cultural context. A person who wanted only to learn about \\"bullfights\\" could read the first half and never have a desire to go on. That person would have admirably accomplished the objective at hand but would have missed out on a wealth of more information, cultural and societal, which was fascinating. The book would have worth the price to examine either the fights themselves or the cultural context. Getting them togetehr is icing on the cake.My one critisicm of this work is that it focuses almost exclusively on these events in Spain. I think Mexico is mentioned only twice in the entire book. There is no discussion of how these events differ in Mexico and the rest of Latin America, if indeed they do. The topic is not addressed so I don't know.If you know nothing about the world of the Corrida and want to learn, this is probably your best bet."},{"Title":"BULLFIGHT","review":"Marvin's account and explanation of the bullfight is the best account of the Corrida de Toros available in English. The author draws upon his own extended experience of the bullfight first hand, as an anthropologist that arrived in Andalusia to try to understand the importance of the bullfight in this culture. In his book, Marvin explains the history, symbolism and mechanics of the bullfight with intimate detail. Do NOT make up your mind about the Spanish bullfight before trying to understand it on the terms of the culture in which it is found. Save your self time wading through other books on this cultural phenomenon that is so misunderstood by other cultures. Read &quot;Bullfight&quot; first. It may not change your opinion but it will offer you an explanation and another way of seeing!"},{"Title":"BULLFIGHT","review":"There are a lot of poorly written English-language books on bullfighting. With the sole exception of Alison Kennedy's \\"On Bullfighting\\", the other books out there are written by guys who are already pre-sold on the glamor of the matador life and write with the mawkish enthusiasm of a teenaged fan, so much so that you can't really understand what is going on, they're just gushing. This is the first book I've come across that truly tries to explain the rules, the industry, the historical trappings, what a torero is supposed to be as perceived by his community - very educational, and with minimal hype and minimal gushing. Although his viewpoint is as an anthropologist/sociologist, this book isn't as dry as other academic treatises on the subject. Suitable for the lay reader or the tourist. Read this first, before you read everything else (read this before Hemingway!) if you want to really understand the details and find out what it's all about."},{"Title":"Grace","review":"This book was a little difficult to get into at first. I think it started out a little slow then picked up after a few chapters. The author does a wonderful job of bringing the characters and settings to life. However, I found the end to be somewhat of a anti climax. It was almost as though the author was rushing to put a finish to it and wasn't sure how things should end up. The story line between Grace and the soldier, although romantic, left me feeling a little confused. Although it was obvious John was not the right man for her, the way Grace ended up with the soldier left me feeling as though I'd missed a chapter or two somewhere. Not a bad read but a slightly weak ending. Still I gave it four stars for pulling me into the story and keeping me there."},{"Title":"Grace","review":"This book was difficult to \\"get into\\" for the first 80 pages, and then I couldn't put it down.

They seem to admire her yet they avoid her as if she has a contagious disease. Her spouse simply left her without a word of explanation. Her widower neighbor shared a glorious evening with her, but never followed up with even a visit. Teenager Bobby Moore, who wants to join the army, and his father both have desired Grace, but try to hide those feelings especially from the senior's wacky Yankee spouse. Even a sergeant she meets on a train heading east finds he cannot resist the lure of Grace.Perhaps, the males find the amazing teacher just a bit too flaky for them almost as if she is a flame and they are moths. She daringly reads poetry to her students. Who knows what other wild ideas she might unleash on an unsuspecting man? As the war draws closer to an end, which lucky male will earn Grace's love?GRACE is a fabulous period piece that brings home life in a small Texas town during World War II. Though the story line centers on Grace, it contains several intriguing subplots that allow the audience a better understanding of her admirers and their need for distance. The key cast members are fully developed either through their respective relationship with Grace or with their own family members. Still, this is Grace's novel and she shines throughout just as much as author Jane Roberts Wood does.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Grace","review":"Grace the novel, centers on Grace Gillian, an English teacher in her 30's, living in a small, Texas town, Cold Springs. Grace's husband has recently left her, headed for NYC, and Grace has been left to deal with life on her own. We also meet several other members of the Cold Springs community, Bobby a highschool senior, who deeply desires to be a part of the war effort, the apple of his eye, Dixie, Bobby's family, and a few other side characters. Wood has a real gift for writing, her descriptions are excellent-you can picture each scene perfectly in your mind. Through Grace, we learn how the effects of the war turn life upside down in this small, close-knit community. As you follow the character's lives, you will see what their motivations and deepest desires are, how they all want to be accepted and understood in different forms and different ways. The story was entertaining, but not something that left much of an impression on me. To the author's credit, the writing was excellent (5 stars)."},{"Title":"Grace","review":"Well, I'm not sure what to make of this book. I thought it was pretty good, but I'd say about 70% of the book was about Bobby Moore and his family and friends, not so much about Grace. I kept wanting to know more about Grace and Bucy and what lead to his leaving her...but no detail was really given, and his response to her asking why was pretty lame.In fact, almost every problem in this book was solved with a simple answer and a wave of the hand. I wanted more detail about some issues that truley could have been more entertaining had they been a little more in depth.As for the ending, I don't know how I feel about it. Part of me says...'Well, it COULD have happened that way...I guess'...the other part says...'What the heck?!?!? What kind of ending was THAT! Could she have wrapped it up any quicker?' I don't know, I like the book, it made for a pleasant and thoughtless read just to pass time, but I don't know that I'd really recommend this to anyone I know."},{"Title":"Grace","review":"&quot;Grace&quot; follows the lives of four households living on the same block in the small Texas town of Cold Springs during the final years of World WarII. Grace Gillian, english teacher at the local high school, sparks passion for learning and exploration in her students. She presence is unsettling for the town, married later, only to have her husband abandon her, head filled with dreams and impractical things. This woman is a catalyst of sorts in the other households. John Appleby, enlisting in the service after his wife's death, looks to her with confusion and longing. Young Bobby Moore V, drawn by the passion Grace displays as his teacher, and her unselfconscious beauty. His home has currents of its own, his yankee mother snubbed( and not at all bothered)by local woman, befriends the family maid, struggles with the interference of family in her daughter's life. Bobby is drawn to Dixie baldridge, a young beauty with a troubled family life. Her father drinks and her mother is scarred by past trauma that has left her unable to cope. The US is drawn into the war and local young men leave the comforting confines of Cold Springs, life is turned upside down. While this book seems to wander a bit,it is a wonderful book that captures the upheavel in small town life that marked the mid 1940s. The realization that change would impose itself upon life, no matter how careful one was. Each family must face its own and intertwined challenges,closing the doors on hurts and refinding love and figuring out where they fit in Cold Springs"},{"Title":"Grace","review":"In a departure from her gentle Texas triology, Ms. Woods takes the reader on a passionate and lusty exploration of a sleepy little East Texas town and the final year of WWII. In the four homes on a single block, every household is an entirely different world of mannerisms, of history, of hopes and of dreams. This glimpse into the past provides more than just insight into the times, but also into the thoughts and minds of the individual people and truly a feeling of being there. My only disappointment? That there wasn't a CD in the back cover of the book, with a collection of the music that floats through this memorable story."},{"Title":"Grace","review":"Came across this book when a friend recommended it, and like many previous reviewers, I enjoyed it.It is the story of Grace, a 30ish English teacher in a small Texas town during WWII. The writing has a lovely, bittersweet quality as most of the characters find out that what they were looking for was perhaps not really what they wanted from life. And of course, being set in WWII time period, the war is a constant presence in the characters lives, motivating, changing, and devastating some of them. Perhaps that's why the author chose her ending - to leave the story on an upbeat note.Overall, an enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Grace","review":"I thought Grace was a hard book to get into until about chapter four. Then I really enjoyed until the end. I don't understand or like how she was obsessed with one guy through the whole book and then goes off and marries another man in the end. There just wasn't enough conclusion in this book. Otherwise the writing is well done. You really get to know each character because Jane wrote in third person. Jane has a unique writing style that is hard to get used to at first, but after a while is enjoyable."},{"Title":"Grace","review":"I did enjoy the book. I read it for a book club, but might have read it on my own. My biggest problem was the way I met Grace. In the first chapter she has already slept with a man who isn't her husband and on the night of his wife's death. It just put a bad taste in my mouth. I never grew to like Grace Gillian, but I did grow to tolerate her, because I enjoyed the story."},{"Title":"Grace","review":"It's been several years since the reading world was &quot;graced&quot; with a work by Jane Roberts Wood.

It starts with an essay on Lange by Robert Coles. Then it moves into her photographs and her own words. Her work is beautiful on its own, but to have the photographs and her philosophy side by side is an enriching experience. The photographs fill the entire book so it's a great read and a nice coffee table book. The images are primarily from her depression photos, but there are also pictures from around the world, her family and her early portraits. I also like that they included photographs of her and her oak trees. Dorothea Lange was a woman with such a unique perspective on life. I feel that this book does an excellent job of presenting her work."},{"Title":"Dorothea Lange: Photographs of a Lifetime","review":"This anthology is a well-packaged, heart-warmingly first-person annoted retrospective of Lange's career. Enlighening glimpses into Lange's personal point-of view are offered here, showcasing her stark Depression-era WPA migration shots alongside her later vignettes of the American western plains and western coastal dwellers captured in their every day routines. Therein lies this collection's strength and weakness: while her Americana movement captured a rural slice of America which later mediums still struggle to duplicate, that subject matter still did not match the sheer horror and power of her WPA work, which captured the raw strength of the human spirit during life-threatening crises. The diversity of this collection makes it an essential introductory volume, however."},{"Title":"Dorothea Lange: Photographs of a Lifetime","review":"This is a beautiful collection of this outstanding photographer's work, with a special emphasis on her Depression-era work.

It's not the most thorough and it's not the most helpful, but it certainly is the most fun. The cover, a snapshot from the movie &quot;Good Fellas&quot; shows Catherine Scorsese (as Tommy's mother) sitting at a table having just served three gangsters a midnight snack; the gangsters are Joe Pesci (Tommy), Robert DeNiro (who, Catherine claims, thinks she makes the best pizza in the world), and Ray Liota. This book is filled with simple Italian-American recipes handed down through the years on both the Scorsese side and the Cappa side (Catherine's family). The most famous of these recipes is the first--tomato sauce with meat--and meatballs--which every good Italian American knows is consumed on Sundays--that's the tradition. There are veal recipes and recipes for soups (Catherine's lentil soup is the best--I've made it). And of course there's the previously mentioned pizza (sausage or pepperoni) about which Robert DeNiro raves. There are also several dessert recipes--the Sicilian Cake, with ricotta cheese and heavy cream providing the center--being the best. There are transcripts included from Scorsese's documentary--&quot;Italianamerican&quot;--from which the title of this book comes. Catherine and her husband Charlie reminisce about life in New York's Little Italy on Mulberry, Mott, and Elizabeth Streets. There are several charming black and white photos of the family through the years--the Scorseses, with little &quot;Marty,&quot; standing beside the Christmas tree which the old folks &quot;didn't go for.&quot; The anecdotes are sometimes hilarious; Catherine and her sister-in-law, for example, laugh about how they'd go to DiPalo's deli and make fun of the way customers pronounced such words as &quot;ricotta&quot;--it's rigotta--and &quot;capicole&quot;--it's capicoli. The praise on the back of the book, from Francis Ford Coppola, summs it up: &quot;I am very happy that Katie's recipes are being published, so that I can immediately start trying them out.&quot; In fact, in Coppola's restaurant in Belize, there is the famous dish, &quot;Mrs. Scorsese's Lemon Chicken.&quot;This book makes a lovely contribution to any cookbook collection. In fact, it's the one guests always seem to pull from the shelf and thumb through. My copy, of course, is stained from years of use. There are tomato sauce stains and cheese smudges. The pages are as tasy as the actual dishes themselves.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Italianamerican: The Scorsese family cookbook","review":"Finally!

There are no categories. However, information is offered for stir-ins and supplements. In addition, there is a section called \\"Let's get started\\", which provides basic information to get anyone making smoothies. There is also a nice index at the end of the book that lists ingredients. This would be very helpful if you wanted to make a particular smoothie from something you had on hand. The degree of difficulty of these recipes is minimal. Most, if not all, of the smoothies could be made from ingredients you probably already have in your kitchen. They utilize sherbet, fruits, juices and yogurt. There are no recipes that include tofu or soy milk, though you could make your own substitutions. All can be made in minutes with no preparation required ahead of time. Finally, if you like pictures, this is the book for you. Every drink is showcased in glasses from around the world.

This prevailing theme appears and reappears throughout the entire series; sometimes subtly. Reader beware, however, as the real cause for the scorpions coil is revealed in &quot;A Division of the Spoils.&quot;Indians coil at English oppression as demonstrated by Hari Kumar's silence over the rape of the white woman he loves; Hindus coil at Muslim antagonism, and Susan, an English woman coils up again and again, in fear of life itself. Scott uses this theme to capture the essence of the strife between England and India, and between the Muslims and the Hindu's.While part one of the Jewel in the crown puts the focus on Hindu culture, Scott leads the reader to understand the Muslim perspective in &quot;The Day of the Scorpion.&quot; Perhaps Paul Scott, in the Raj Quartet, can bring the reader to more fully understand the dynamics of human nature, morality and culture better than any writer of this century. The thoughts and ideas that prevail throughout the series are applicable to many international situations. This truely makes &quot;The Day of the Scorpion&quot; a cross cultural work of art."},{"Title":"The Day of the Scorpion","review":"The four volumes of the Raj Quartet overlap and complement one another, while at the same time forwarding the main storyline of the slow twilight of the British ascendancy in India, always with the rape of a white girl by Indian men as the central lodestone everpresent in the background, the nightmare which is seldom mentioned but which none can drive from their minds. Events occur, are discussed, witnessed as newspaper reports, court documents, interviews, vague recollections from years later, or perceived directly by the main characters. Then the next volume will take two or three steps back into previous events, and these same events will be perceived from another angle, perhaps only as a vague report heard far away across the Indian plain, or witnessed directly by another character, or discussed in detail long after their occurrence over drinks on a verandah. This may at times seem like rehashing, indeed as one reads the four volumes one will be subjected to the account of the rape in the Bibighar Gardens many times over; but what will also become apparent is that additional details, sometimes minor variations in interpretation and sometimes crucial facts, are being added slowly to the events discussed, as though the window to the past were being progressively wiped cleaner and cleaner with successive strokes of Scott's pen. In this way he draws the picture of the last days of the Raj not in a conventional linear fashion, but recursively, and from multiple angles. One gets the clear impression of life in India during the first half of the 20th century as similar in nature: Fragmented, multifaceted, largely dependent upon perspective and experience and never perceived whole or all at once.Book 2 introduces what is going to be the main storyline of the tetralogy, although the rape in the Bibighar Gardens will remain in the back of everyone's mind, and sometimes at the front, throughout. First of all there is Mohammed Ali Kasim, a respected Indian Congressman arrested by the British as a matter of course when Congress finalizes its \\"Quit India\\" resolution; and his son Ahmed, the dissolute intellectual who spends his time in one of the remaining Princely States of India. Second, the Layton family is introduced, a typical example of the British military in India. Sarah Layton, the elder of the two daughters, is exquisitely rendered and will become one of the series' most familiar and constant characters. Ronald Merrick, the police officer who victimized Hari Kumar during the Bibighar Gardens affair, slouches back into the story as the best man at Susan Layton's wedding, only to be made into an unlikely hero and martyr at the end of the novel."},{"Title":"The Day of the Scorpion","review":"THE DAY OF THE SCORPION continues Paul Scott's very long story (total of 2000 pages) of the last days of British colonial rule in India. SCORPION is book 2 in the so-called Raj Quartet. These books are not about the external events per se as much as they are about the effects of these external events on the lives of several individuals, most prominently, Hari Kumar, Sarah Layton, and later in book 4 Guy Perron. In SCORPION, several new characters are introduced to the series, including members of the Layton and Kasim families.In book 1, JEWEL IN THE CROWN, Hari Kumar was wrongfully jailed by the wicked Ronald Merrick for the rape of Daphne Manners Hari's secret love. When Daphne refused to press charges Hari was detained as a political prisoner. In JEWEL, the story of Hari's life was told from the court proceedings and other second hand accounts. JEWEL covers a period of about fifty years.In SCORPION, Hari tells the story of his life up to 1942. A large section of this 500 page volume reads like a court proceeding since Hari shares his story with Captain Rowan, who has been ordered by the Governor to interview Kumar in prison.Lady Manners, Daphne aunt, is a secret witness to the interview. It is Lady Manners who has persuaded the British authorities to revisit the reasons for Hari's imprisonment. During the proceedings, Hari is told Daphne is dead. &quot;Twin rivulets gleamed on his prison cheeks, and then the image became blurred and she felt a corresponding wetness on her own...&quot;I think it would be extremely hard to follow this book without having first read JEWEL IN THE CROWN. A large part of SCORPION is used to elaborate and further the plot introduced in JEWEL. Dipping into SCORPION without having first read JEWEL would be like trying to watch a serial after missing a few critical episodes.In addition, the introduction of the Laytons and the Kasims might also seem disjointed unless one knows SCORPION is not a &quot;stand alone&quot; novel. In spite of these limitations, SCORPION is a wonderful book, and thus I have given it 5 stars.In SCORPION, Sarah Layton takes on the central role. Sarah is the only Layton to have had contact with Lady Manners and be concerned about the events in Mayapore. Sarah has two long exchanges with Ronald Merrick, Hari Kumar's nemesis. Sarah meets Captain Rowan Hari's liberator. Sarah is struggling with her own issues surrounding the lives of the English in India. Sarah is the one to watch. And Sarah is an Aries. Her sister Susan is the Scorpio."},{"Title":"The Day of the Scorpion","review":"it is really not possible to review the quartet seperately because each volume centers around two incidents that occur in the first volume. new insights and characters are introduced as the story progresses and the incidents gather more clarity. i have never in all my years of reading, encountered a more complex and insideous evil than that of the character merrick. he is even better at being evil than iago. also, scott is so good at describing the end of empire in india, the isolation of the colonialists from each other, india, england and their own sense of self. on the part of the indians, to find their selves as separate from what they have had to become over years of domination and humiliation. the history of division between muslim and hindu and the indian arguments for non-participation in the war with japan and the way that plays into the whole idea of loyalty (to whom) was fascinating. i was sorry when i finally came to the end of the last volume. it was great reading!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Day of the Scorpion","review":"In this second book of the Raj Quartet, Paul Scott begins to develop his characters more as opposed to the Indian landscape, and that makes this book a lot more readable than the first one.Scott continues to have 'lapses' into long-winded paragraphs with descriptive detail, but this time, a much larger human element creeps in. Instead of the Indian countryside and endless narrations about the changing Indian political landscape, Scott focuses on how these changes are impacting the British - in particular, the Layton family.Somehow, this brings alive the demise of the British Imperialism in India. No longer is it facts and stats, its not only the British rule collapsing, its the disintegration of British society and class structures. Everyone is fighting valiantly to preserve a dream which no longer exists.This book overlaps slightly with the first book but goes a lot further to explain what happened to Daphne Manners in the first book. It also opens our eyes to the aforementioned collapse of British society in India as experienced by the Layton sisters.All in all, this book was quite enjoyable. It's just a shame you have to read the first book to know where this book is heading..."},{"Title":"The Day of the Scorpion","review":"Just as history can't be undone, innocence, once lost, can't be retrieved. If history would allow, I would dearly love to read Paul Scott's The Day Of The Scorpion without having first read The Jewel In The Crown. Scorpion is very much a continuation of the Crown and I am not convinced that a reader coming cold to the book as a stand-alone work would cope with the multiple references to what came before. Like the characters in Paul Scott's novels, I can't undo history and can only thus reflect on another time through this forensic tale of war-torn colonial India as someone who did the Crown first.The incidents that formed the backbone of The Jewel In The Crown are still to the fore. There are implications and consequences. But time and people have moved on. Not all have survived. There is a child called Parvati who figures large in the tale but hardly ever appears. Ronald Merrick, however, the policeman from Mayapore who was only seen from afar and through others' eyes in The Jewel In The Crown is now very much at the centre of things. His character, that of a self-made man, grammar school educated, middle, not upper class, provides the perfect contrast to the stiff upper lip fossilized Britishness of the military types. Merrick is no less British, no less confident in his prejudices. In fact he is arguably more aggressive in his need to assert a removed superiority, but his need is personal and antagonistic, containing neither the patronising nor the paternalistic tendencies of those born to rule. Racially he assumes superiority, whereas professionally he must earn it, because, unlike the upper classes, he was not born to it.The Laytons are such an upper class colonial family. Daddy is a prisoner of war in Europe. Mildred is at home in India - if home it can be - silently stewing at the indignity of not being able to live in the larger house her status deserves. She has taken to the bottle. Susan, the younger daughter, is about to be married to a suitably stationed officer and, despite war, civil unrest, threats of political change in Britain and now fragile colonialism, expects a fairytale family future plucked straight from the pages of some glossy magazine. Sarah, her sister, is more down to earth, is perhaps both more phlegmatic and sceptical, certainly more conscious of her responsibilities and role and the fragility of life.Both sisters remember a childhood experience when a gardener made a ring of fire and dropped a live scorpion into its midst. Thus surrounded by threat, it did for itself, or at least that's how it looked. How would people react if conflagration surrounded them? They would have to get on with their lives, of course. But for some, the process might prove tougher than for others.And what if you are a local ruler, a Nawab, for instance, a British puppet popping around a little kingdom claiming it's a law unto itself? What to do if your chief minister has been imprisoned by your masters without trial, along with all others who share his opposition to the people who keep you in power? Where then should your loyalties lie?Though The Day Of The Scorpion is primarily a novel about women, it's the military side of the book that provides everyone involved with the ring of challenges they must face. With politicians in jail and Mr Ghandi's advocacy of non-violence, how does anyone relate to those Indians who have joined the Indian National Army to fight alongside the Japanese? If your mindset has been tutored on notions of paternalism and the white man's burden, how is possible that such people can exist? How can they reject what you have offered? But exist they do and their ammunition is live. And it's not only the British who cannot cope with such concepts.The Day Of The Scorpion has many more themes than these. It is an episodic novel of quite remarkable complexity. The characters are beautifully drawn, rounded individuals, each presented with personal, social and political dilemmas. Not least among them is Hari Kumar, still imprisoned, whose loyalty is repeatedly tested, and whose resolve to protect remains unbreakable.Paul Scott's novel recreates a complete world, a complete history via the experiences of individuals who, given the chance, are more than willing to explain their positions and dilemmas at length. But it is the detail of their stories that describes the pressures that now surround them. You cannot skip a word."},{"Title":"The Day of the Scorpion","review":"Part two of the Raj Quartet explores WWII-era India from two perspectives. Hari Kumar, back from an English upbringing, languishes in prison after his arrest for the rape of his lover, Daphne Manners, who died at the end of \\"The Jewel in the Crown.\\" Their baby's fate remains rather open, while Sarah Layton meets it as the sequel opens. She provides the central consciousness, filtered again by an omniscient narrator, into the British response to the rape trial and its prisoners.Captain Merrick, who played a leading role in the interrogations, now looms as a possible swain for Sarah, but his own injury on the front fighting the Japanese and their Indian allies-- in a dramatically paced episode-- makes their courtship more oblique than direct. She does lose her virginity to an enlisted cad in a late scene that reveals Scott's powers of description: \\"She closed her eyes, exploring the illusion of possession which such an adoration might create between two people and was then aware that her hands were no longer held except by the desire to explore. Her own head was taken. For a while they stayed so, enacting the tenderness of silent lovers, and then slowly bending her head she allowed him to deal with the old maid's hook and eye.\\" (946; Everyman edition)Combining compassion and distance, Scott's voice registers throughout this lengthy novel memorably. This will place demands on the reader, and while some of the passages defy it seems the normal pauses and silences and bathroom breaks that in real life might make for less sustained and elegant recollection, the literary artifice of the narrative brings instead of brute realism its own shimmering and dreadful beauties. The very long interrogation of Hari, the reveries of Sarah, and the machinations of Count Bronowsky, the Pandit, and other military officials add verisimilitude and interest to this story.Still, as before with \\"Jewel,\\" this remains the story of the British reaction to India. Sarah muses: \\"They did not transplant well. Temperate plants, in the hot-house they were brought out too quickly and faded fast, and the life they lived, when the heat had dried them out and left only the aggressive husk, was artificial. Among them, occasionally, you would find a freak in whom the sap still ran.\\" (629)Later at her sister Susan's wedding: \\"She had a fleeting image of them all as dolls dressed and positioned for a play that moved mechanically but uncertainly again and again to a point of climax, but then shifted in ground, avoiding a direct confrontation. Each shift was marked by just such a pause, and the wonder perhaps was that the play continued. But the wind blew, nudging her through the creamy thinness of peach-coloured slipper satin and she and they were reanimated, prodded into speech and new positions.\\" (667)Such artificiality permeates their Indian presence. Loneliness dominates. \\"Why we are like fireflies too, she told herself, travelling with our own built-in illumination, a myriad portable candles lighting windows against some lost wanderer's return.\\" (716) Miss Manners, aunt of Daphne, when witnessing Hari's interrogation, reflects on them as \\"lovers who could never be described as star-crossed because they had no stars. For them heaven had drawn an implacable band of dark across its constellations and the dark was lit by nothing except the trust they had had in each other not to tell the truth because the truth had seemed too dangerous to tell.\\" (793)Near the end, Sarah sees her sister's reaction to her new husband's death, after Merrick had tried to save them both on the front. Susan, as did Daphne, brings another long narrative to a close with a mix of horror and poignancy, and another child is born by a disturbed British woman into this troubled land. \\"We sense from the darkness in you the darkness in ourselves, a darkness and a death wish. Neither is admissible. We chase the illusion of perpetual light. But there's no such thing. What light there is, when it comes, comes harshly and unexpectedly and in it we look extraordinarily ugly and incapable.\\" (988) No plucky heroism or stiff upper lips here.This disturbs the reader. Less than its predecessor, which spread the narrative among different voices and registers, Sarah's tone darkens this installment. Even when she retreats, the ominous detachment dominates. Sometimes an eerie Orientalism arises between the British and the Indians, a doomed inevitability. Hari, the embodiment of British and Indian in one troubled soul, tells his captors about Merrick's stress on \\"enactment\\" of actions which are negative themselves, but fall between earlier actions as a consequence and before others as a prelude. History adds up to situations in which no significance can be seen until the actions are finished, or abandoned for fear of responsibility by their actors, \\"and so in a curious way the situations did become part of a general drift of events.\\" (797) This combined fatalism and control drifts over the events that Hari has acted in, but determines to stand apart from as he asserts his right to silence about the night he and Daphne became lovers, and that same night he was arrested for her gang-rape.Few will survive this pressure. Miss Manners watches Hari's testimony and feels that she's \\"driving to my grave.\\" \\"Why and so you are, a voice told her. She recognized it from other occasions. Old people talked to themselves. From a certain age. No. Always. Throughout life. But in old age the voice took on a detached ironical tone. Passion had this determination to outlive its prison of flesh and brittle bone. As it made arrangements to survive it grew away, like a child from its favourite parent, impatient for the moment of total severance and the long dark voyage of intimate self-discovery. And so you are, her voice said. Driving to your grave. The parting of our ways. A release for both of us. One to oblivion, one to eternal life so unintelligible it ranks as oblivion too. And already our commitment to each other is worked out and nearly over. Momentum will carry you through what motions are left to you to show your grasp of situations and responsibilities.\\" (807)Among these, little Parvati Manners, child of imprisoned Hari and the dead Daphne, must be cared for by the elderly Lady M. Meanwhile, Sarah lingers in her own aftermath of her brief passion, and within such fragile lives, Anglo-India prepares to meet its own demise. Surrounded as the title indicates by their enemies, the colonials will attack back, symbolized by the scorpion stinging itself to death when circled by a ring of fire by those who seek its destruction."},{"Title":"The Day of the Scorpion","review":"I have read Paul Scott's Raj Quartet (or actually Quintet as there is a coda in the form of Staying On) many times.

If you are a fan of hot rods, custom cars, drag racing, or American muscle cars, even one too young to have experienced that time in American history, this book is a delightful chronicle of the early-postwar period in the car hobby. To read this book is to understand an important part of the ancestry of cars like the Chevrolet Corvette, Pontiac GTO or the Dodge Charger because, had it not been for the hot rodders of the So-Cal Speed Shop period, the Corvette might have never made it past the 1955 model year and the GTO and the Charger might never have been.In Fall of 1946, on the day he was discharged from the Army Air Force, Alex Xydias, former B-29 mechanic, hot rodder and entrapneurial spirit, opened what was then a new kind of business, a \\"speed shop\\" where car enthusiasts could purchase aftermarket performance parts for their hot rods. Xydias' \\"So-Cal Speedshop\\" was not the first to sell parts to rodders and racers but it pioneered some business practices the performance aftermarket still uses today. Xydias was also the first to see the value of using professional race team, with well-built cars, sharp looking crews and winning achievements to market the So-Cal Speedshop's products, enhance its reputation and attract national attention to hot rodding as a business and a credible motorsport. The So-Cal racing team, headlined for a time by the famed \\"So-Cal Speedshop Special\\" streamliner, set countless records and was on the cover of Hot Rod magazine five times between 1950 to 1953.The original So-Cal Speedshop closed in 1961 but, in it's 15 years, it had a phenomenal influence on the hot rod movement. Mark Christensen's &lt;u>SO-CAL Speed Shop&lt;/u> is a book, rich in imagery, both actual pictures and what perception Christensen's prose creates with the reader. It explains in what it was like to have been a hot rod enthusiasts, dry lakes racer and Bonneville competitor in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The reader is left with a clear understanding of the events which drove some of the circumstances by which the Corvette, as we know it today-a high-performance sports car powered by the most powerful production V8 engine in any car in its class-came to be.I really enjoyed reading this book! &lt;u>SO-CAL Speed Shop&lt;/u> is a great read and belongs in the book collection of any Corvette enthusiast who wants to both correctly understand the car's ancestry and enjoy a story about a wonderful time in the car hobby."},{"Title":"SO-CAL Speed Shop: The Fast Tale of the California Racers Who Made Hot Rod History","review":"A great book on the So.

Those reviews that say this is the \`best' translation or \`accurate' translation must be kidding. This is not a translation, but a serious transgression in the Quran. It is far from being accurate rendition of actual Arabic, it is verbose, it is full of interpolation. Interpolation does not mean adding new concept or theories, but if new words are added then it is interpolation. In the acknowledgment section, the translator wrote that the work was checked \`word for word\\". In reality the translator filled up pages with too many foreign words suggesting these are equivalent of \`revealed text'. I quote his own translation (although inaccurate) of verse 2:79 \\"But woe to them who fake the Scriptures and say : This is from God. So that they may earn some profit thereby; and woe to them for what they fake, and woe to them for what they earn from it.\\"Take any page from this translation, any verse at random, and most likely that a knowledgeable reader will find a verbose, inaccurate translation!

I can't say whether this particular title is any better or worse than any other English rendition of the Qur'an, nor will I find out. I confirmed some of the hearsay that I get from ignorant Christians, while being surprised at some of what I read. Although there are similarities between Christianity and Islam, there is also a wide gap. In my opinion, this book does not teach or instruct much at all, but is a book of warnings. The Surah's (Chapters) are very redundant and contradictory. Paraphrased Bible stories are rampant often leaving out significant details.

There is simply no substitute for the scholar. Even the most literal translation will never be precise enough.But to read the Qur'an and be impacted by its message, one only needs a faithful translation. The English of this translation is the best. Having read many translations of the Qur'an, this is my favorite. While reading this Qur'an, I find it possible to forget that it is a foreign book. I find myself reading the Qur'an because I enjoy it. With other translations I had to force myself to read out of a sense of duty.One note of caution. The English of this book is scholarly. This is not a translation for young children. A well read adult will find it a pleasure to read. A middle school child may need to have an English dictionary nearby.Another review attacked this translation for not being literal enough. I find this attack groundless.

Now, thanks to Ahmed Ali, we have it in good English."},{"Title":"Al-Qur'an: A Contemporary Translation","review":"Those who know Arabic, and who can read the Qur'an in Arabic, should simply read Qur'an in Arabic, as all Muslims know there is no substitute for Al-Qur'an. However, the millions of readers who know no Arabic at all will likely find this to be the most readable, insightful, and hopefully inspiring English translation of The Holy Qur'an. Personally, as I unfortunately seem to have no facility whatsoever for other languages besides English, Ahmed Ali's translation has served me well as a guide to a greater and deeper understanding of a faith and way of life of which I would otherwise know virtually nothing. As the best translators know, absolute accuracy of translation is irrelevant if the end product is clumsy and unnecessarily difficult.

In comparing his translation with Asad's, as well as Maurice Beaucaille's 'The Bible, The Qur'an and Science', I found a parity within their translations that made sense to me, personally. This translation does not satisfy 'mystics', in that it clearly explains certain 'miracles' and 'inexplicable phenomena' with rational and logical meanings attached to the Arabic verses.

I have never come across a translation that retains the rythm and harmony of the original and at the same time retains accuracy of meaning.

This is especially difficult with poetry. Astonishingly, Mr. Ahmed Ali has managed to accomplish this almost impossible task with every verse in the Quran. Literal translations like those of Yusuf Ali and Pikthall actually lose the meaning and completely lose the beauty of the Quran.

The author doesn't seem to know where the nonlinearity lies in &quot;Nonlinear Pricing&quot;. He sees it &quot;everywhere&quot;. One wonders whether he even knows the difference between a linear and a nonlinear function, and if so why he seems to think that a Gaussian distribution pertains to &quot;linear&quot;, and anything else to nonlinear. It is clear that his understanding of mathematics is at best vague; unfortunately not even his concepts bear much merit. &quot;Genetic&quot;, &quot;Fuzzy&quot;, &quot;Non-equilibrium&quot; are simply used as buzzwords to create the air of being mathematically-sophisticated (the mathematical community knows that &quot;genetic algorithms&quot; are essentially a characterization of &quot;stabbing in the dark&quot; in the absence of a better search procedure, or often, of knowledge). He even dares to toy with concepts from physics which he can't even start to fathom.I see some readers fairly impressed with the book. If you don't have much understanding of math and the fundamental sciences, you might be. But you'll also be left with no understanding at the end of the day ( you might attribute the lack of understanding to your background in &quot;humanities&quot;, but it will really be because the book has no substance ).With his writing style, the author could perhaps have given Deepak Chopra a run for his money had he concentrated more on the religious part and had he sounded less cocky. Only religion/metaphysics would marvel at the unsubstantiated rhetoric one finds in this book. However, this is scientific ground he is attempting to tread on.Just read Mandelbrot's original book ..."},{"Title":"Nonlinear Pricing: Theory & Applications (Wiley Trading)","review":"The book can be summarized in 11 words: &quot;Genetic fractal neural fuzzy chaotic nonlinear stuff good. Traditional finance bad.&quot;There is no real information in the book. There are unsupported anecdotes and a myriad of quotes from non-financial sources. The lack of substance in the text leads one to suspect that the author himself doesn't understand the underlying mathematics himself.For a better source, Chapter 12 of Econometrics of Financial Markets by Campbell, Lo and MacKinlay has more information on nonlinear modelling than the whole of this book (and it has a couple hundred pages on traditional financial economics.)"},{"Title":"Nonlinear Pricing: Theory & Applications (Wiley Trading)","review":"If you're looking for a good primer in fractal economics, do not waste your money, or worse, time with this book. You can get more information and less noise from E. Peters's &quot;Chaos and Order in the Capital Markets&quot;. The most useful information you'll get from this book is a description of the Hurst exponent; the rest is, well...I don't mind random musings with an articulate friend after dinner, but please don't do it in a pedagogical-sounding, inflated tome. Let the quotes describe themselves:&quot;... this chapter will present a challenge because it exists at a rarified level of understanding.&quot;&quot;I maintain, as any good scientist does, that the theory must fit the facts&quot;.&quot;The mathematics in this chapter may be complex to the financial economics professional&quot; (I found the series summation as the most complex math in that chapter.)Errors and carelessness are so prevalent, this book really brings down my opinion of the JW editors. Concepts of dependent and independent variables are mixed up, atrocious-looking graphs of normal and Levy distributions are shown, notations like &quot;m2&quot; are printed instead of &quot;m(superscript)2&quot; to mean m-squared, etc.Most of the time is spent waxing philosophical connections among shallowly described concepts like Fourier transform, superstrings, the scriptures, Brownian motion, Socratic logic, etc. To be fair, if this sort of shooting-the-breeze provides a relaxing read for you, this book might fit the bill.The author breathlessly describes &quot;original concepts&quot; like fixing risk for varying returns in security portfolios: this is already done with instruments like mortgage securities.Perhaps the author's own quotation of Occam's Razor should have been heeded, &quot;That which is not needed should not be included&quot;.I did find the Bloomberg KAOS screen description on page 128 useful.

He also clearly has applied these approaches because the book includes numerous insightful comments and observations. I recognize that nonlinear math can be very difficult and that many valuable insights can be obtained without a detailed understanding of the math.

At the same time, it is more or less obvious that the author either doesn't fully understand nonlinear dynamics or didn't know how to explain this subject in a more rigorous way.

I might even have settled on a few unproved practical pricing applications!To add insult to injury, this book was poorly edited: papers were discussed as if well-known, then introduced five paragraphs later; whole paragraphs were repeated several times, as if the book had been a series of independent pamphlets stapled together; anecdotal musings ran on for pages with no purpose apparent other than to impress the reader with the author's erudition; typographical errors peppered the few mathematical expressions.I have similar complaints with Edgar Peters' books, but at least Peters understands nonlinearity sufficiently to have applied some famous techniques to problems in financial valuation.

He describes how the tools available and the ways of thinking that are used are all linear - and this is not how the world works. The analogy he uses is with the shift from Newton to Einstein. We used to believe the world was like clockwork, and relationships were stable. But Einstein showed that this is only true in some cases - the theory of relativity gives far more possible outcomes of any situation.He goes on to look at theories of evolution and new ways of approaching the mathematics of change - complex systems and dynamics. With this as background, May turns to the financial markets themselves and how to go beyond linear systems in practice. Here his frustration with the system comes over loud and clear. He can show how the standard models fail - and does so in the book. But standard analysis dies hard and his sense of loneliness in the effort to move on is patent.He develops and explains one particular non-linear tool of analysis in detail. It is a way of identifying the elements in the movements in a stock price which take it outside the classical analysis and measures the extent to which there are long run movements which depend on previous movements. It is the Hurst exponent, named after someone who noticed this phenomenon in records of the Nile's floods. May has convinced Bloomberg to put this measure up on their system.But he also explains that this is only one possible way of getting at non-linearity in financial systems. He believes that there is still a long way to go in getting at the heart of understanding stock price movements. Even so, this is a step in the right direction and gives a good feel for the way that financial economics needs to go to improve its performance.I particularly liked the mix between the hard stuff (and some may be hard to those without any background in the math) and the nitty gritty from someone with the hands on experience in the markets. If you want to know what it feels like to be developing new stuff in a sceptical world and at the same time, improve your knowledge on the investment front - read this book.Other books that would also flesh out the issues here, both for financial markets and in economics are by Ed Peters and by Paul Ormerod."},{"Title":"Nonlinear Pricing: Theory & Applications (Wiley Trading)","review":"Nonlinear Pricing challanges conventional wisdom about much of what is believed in theoretical financial-economics and realated practical applications.

The result is Nonlinear Pricing, that is a modern approach to asset price dynamics in financial markets not using the usual normal and linear approximations of asset prices.One of the general merits of the book is that it introduces the reader to all these topics in a historical prospective. Then the author has his own contribution to fractal market theory contained in a specialized Bloomberg system screen.Of course there is more in nonlinear pricing than this but the author lays enough good philosophical concepts to help further work cementing a financial markets theory where regressions are not just linear, returns are not log-normal etc. The book is written very intuitively and for a text of this complexity it choses the right approach to stay at the surface and integrate !

And Christopher May's Nonlinear Pricing will simply be one of many books heralding the coming of this new view of reality. Count among them The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science, E.A. Burtt (1924); Holism and Evolution, Jan Smuts (1926); New Metaphysical Foundations of Science, Willis Harman (1994); The Evolving Self, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (1993); The Web of Life, Fritjof Capra (1997); any of the work on desertification and range management by Alan Savory and on medicine and prayer by Larry Dossey, M.D. The list goes on and on, including the many works cited in May's book. Why so many titles over so many years by so many authors in so many different fields? Why so little general knowledge of nonlinearity? Why so many ruffled feathers among the reviewers of May's book? (The true believers question his understanding of the component parts of nonlinearity. The nonbelievers question his sanity, writing him straight - as in linear - off. The solution seekers want to know where's the beef, the silver bullet, the keys to the kingdom, and are mighty mad when no answer is forthcoming.) Go back and read Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolution (1962) for answers to the questions and a complete justification for the importance of May's book. Paradigm shifts - the insight that made Kuhn famous - are nonlinear, providing one more case of anecdotal evidence for the validity of May's thesis. Kuhn started as a physicist and became a historian of science when he noticed that the real story of scientific discovery is hardly additive (that linear word again). Rather, science is a random piecing together of a bit of information here, another bit there, until - like the self-organizing button and thread web described in Stuart Kauffman's At Home in the Universe (1995) - a nonlinearly ordered system emerges from randomness. I expect Kuhn would have called a paradigm shift &quot;emergent order&quot; characteristic of everyday nonlinearity had he had the vocabulary. But he didn't. Instead, Kuhn invented his own terms - just as May notes George Soros had to in his equivalently nonlinear description of the markets in The Alchemy of Finance (1987). For Kuhn the terms of science are black and white. Post-paradigm shift, science is merely a matter of filling in the pieces of the newly organized nonlinear puzzle. Pre-paradigm shift, science is a mishmash of publications hinting at the same subject whose authors seem to spend more time on backbiting than research. Sound familiar? Christopher May is to be applauded for nudging along the metaphysical paradigm shift from linearity to nonlinearity. He greatly expands the scope of the nonlinear connections through his extensive citations and explication. What he has to say is hardly the last word on the subject and may be a difficult read for many, but it is worth the effort. I run a fund management company and a venture capital fund based on the tenets of nonlinearity and I welcome every author who helps advance the cause. I make this comment not to be self-serving but to be of service. The world is not flat nor is it round. It is nonlinear"},{"Title":"Nonlinear Pricing: Theory & Applications (Wiley Trading)","review":"If ever there were a book that was tough to title this would be it. Nominally, Nonlinear Pricing should be a dry treatise on macro economics or perhaps something in the micro field where marginal whatsits converge with incremental voodoo hoodies.We have, instead, a tour through a spectrum of old world and new ideas with explanations that will bring the interested observer to the conclusion that a lot is happening in this world.If the book titled Genius about Richard Feinman is quite compelling, then perhaps this book should be called the plural. Geniuses could be the working title to this book because, at a very minimum, it is about the birth and early stages of the Chaos movement and all the bright lights who had and continue to have a hand in the early days of a new and quite exciting approach to the world. We get a whole lot more than the book by Gleick either for Chaos or Feinman. But in a very real sense, this book is as delicious as either one of those two.The title really does not do the book justice. While ostensibly a tale about the theory and applications of non-linear pricing mechanisms, it really goes beyond the title to introduce the reader to the foundation of the notion of practical applications of Chaos. Once the reader is even preliminarily introduced to the author's tale, one can see applications of the issue at hand to a broad range of potential other applications. Quite reallistically, the whole notion of one's basic beliefs and others appreciation of the theory of science and daily applications of such things as where one's medicines, energy and news comes from can be radically altered by letting one's mind wander from the rest while topic and embrace the opportunities that are contained therein. While it is beyond the capabilities of this reviewer to apply the concepts contained herein, it is not beyond the appreciation of the casual observer to consider other domains for the utility of the concepts and smile with satisfaction that indeed a brave new world is just around the corner.The author is a ploymath who is quite adept at covering the waterfront for ideas. He manages to incorporate such a wide variety of modern thinkers as Madelaine L'Engle, Albert Einstein, and has references to Vedic Mathematics, A Wrinkle in Time, Murry Gell-Man and a whole panoply of thinkers and doers. All the while, he introduces concepts to us, he weaves a whole tapestry that, at least to this reviewer, gives cause for optimism for the new millenium.Full disclosure requires divulging the standing invitation to the author for dinner at his convenience. If anyone wants to imagine a dinner party where conversation will endure long after dessert is served, then that is this reviewer's intent.

I think one reason I loved it so much is because of its perspective of a woman who disguises herself as a man to fight in the Civil War - I am a reenactor, and I play a male soldier, albeit an infantryman rather than a wealthy cavalryman.

I wasn't entirely in love with the Mary Sue-ish Geneva, but I did relate to her conflicting feelings and especially to the way she actually felt more at home in a male role than in the traditional female role of the time, even though it caused conflict with what - and who - she thought she wanted and loved. I also really liked Lutie, especially as she overcame her \\"proper\\" upbringing and frustrations with her place in society, and rose above it to serve as a nurse - I particularly liked it after the war when she:::::SPOILER ALERT:::::married someone who could have been seen as far below her station::::::END SPOILER ALERT:::::and ended up far happier than she'd been as a wealthy plantation owner prewar.I only had one teeny-tiny fact checker quibble, I always seem to have these with RMB books (if you need a new researcher/fact checker, Rita, I have experience, excellent references, and am currently available, not that you are reading reviews of books you wrote over 20 years ago, nor would you want to hire someone who's trashed your previous work). Geneva is supposed to have been absent from her regiment between mid-August and mid-November of 1862, yet she mentions seeing a wounded soldier at Sharpsburg. That battle, also known as Antietam, took place in September of 1862. Anyway, there, I said it, I'm over it. Apart from that one sentence, I flat-out loved the rest of the book."},{"Title":"High Hearts (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"High Hearts is an admirable introduction to war and its effects on the men and women involved whether on the home front or on the battlefront. It's a treasure because it contains viewpoints of many different characters and lots of information in a very readable work of historical fiction that does not shy away from horrors of war. Having been to Richmond before, I will be more intrigued than ever with the role it played in the Civil War and in the various locations mentioned in the book. Chimborazo has always been a favorite place to visit; this book examines the critical nursing and support role of women in the \\"shadow army.\\" I have recently decided to give up reading the Sneaky Pie Brown series; I'm so glad that didn't keep me from reading this earlier work of Rita Mae Brown.

Everyone in the south was impacted by the Civil War and indeed many women fought on the battle field but even more fought to protect their homes and families. This is one womans story that I personnally would love to see turned into a WE or Lifetime movie."},{"Title":"High Hearts (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Rita Mae Brown book, High Hearts was a thrilling read from cover to cover. It was a look back in time to a woman who goes to war, the Civil War as a man, so that she can be with her new husband. More than a romance, but with more substance than an adventure tale, I could read this book over and over. I never knew about the phenomenon this book was based on, but apparently, there were several women who did in fact, pass for men, in order to go to war. Not complicated, or hard to follow, this book is enjoyable with some thought provoking aspects as well."},{"Title":"High Hearts (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book is very unusual for Rita Mae Brown and I consider it her best work! It's all in one: A love story, a history book (American Civial War & Slavery), a feminist novel, funny, serious, ironic, and critical of society. The reader experiences the war through the eyes of captivating characters you just have to fall in love with!"},{"Title":"High Hearts (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"One of the best written by Rita Mae Brown. Gives a different perspective on the Civil War. Should be more like it showing the losers side.I highly recommend this book. I have given it as gifts to friends."},{"Title":"High Hearts (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"What a shocking book. The toll of the our most bloody war has never been so real. The descriptions of the battles and aftermath made me want to put the book down and yet never put it down. It made me want to read more about the war.All of Rita Mae's characters are real, with their fears and flaws. Even though the central charater is Geneva, the depth of each character and their role in the dynamics of the politics of the time is brought forth. There is no minor character in this tale. Everyone, as in the war, has a story and a purpose. WONDERFUL."},{"Title":"High Hearts (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Not only breaking out of the stereotype that cast her as only being able to write lesbian novels, but also showing her mettle as a historical researcher, Brown, delivers a story with a twist -- war loving female and her poetry loving husband who is in but can't stand war. A good behind-the-battle-lines (Southern battle lines) civil war book that nonetheless escapes the usual one-side bias of American writers. The ending is a bit too convenient though."},{"Title":"High Hearts (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This author has proven in many of her books that she will know her subject well before writing about it. The book shows the horrors of the War Between the States from a different viewpoint: a newly married woman whose husband tries to help his southern community in one of this country's worst moments. Ms. Brown's research into the lives of the different people that constituted a southern plantation, gives the reader a new perspective on the relationships between owners, slaves, overseers and the other participants in southern life. Lest this review seem too focused on the educational view of High Hearts, the book is thoroughly enjoyable as a story and easy reading. Rita Mae Brown at her superb best."},{"Title":"High Hearts (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book is beautifully written, thrilling, entertaining and heart warming. Set during the Civil war, it is filled with love, honor, courage and fine horsemanship. The characters are people you want to know more about. It brings the reader into the unbelievable horrors of the Civil War as the characters find our what they are made of and what is important in life. This book is both romantic and exciting as well as filled with philosophic treasures. It is one of the few books I have read twice!"},{"Title":"High Hearts (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"High Hearts is a captivating book about the Civil War. It takes place in Albermarle, Virginia in 1861. It is about a young woman named Geneva Chatfield who lately marries Nash Hart. Only a few days after there marriage he goes off to fight on the Confederate side. Geneva decides to cut her hair and become a soldier so that she can be with Nash. This book is about courage and true love. It is also about finding your true self. I reccomend this book because it makes you understand that the war caused an immense amount of grief to both sides."},{"Title":"High Hearts (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"There were uncounted women who cut their hair, lowered their voices and took up arms on both sides of The Civil War. Rita Mae Brown does a wonderful job crafting a fictional story using this truth as her premise. The characters are richly drawn (I actually preferred the evolution of Geneva's mother, Lutie, to Geneva herself), and the story layered and interesting.Geneva can't bear to be away from her husband when he enlists as soon as the guns fire on Fort Sumter. She joins him as a soldier, and learns some unpleasant truths about him and about war. She finds that she has a talent for fighting and that she and her husband aren't as compatible as they might have been had they not rejected their \\"traditional\\" roles.Rita Mae Brown's interesting Foreword and endnotes provide context and explanation for her literary choices, and greatly enrich the experience. I give this book four stars instead of five because at the end, there are several characters whose final stories are only alluded to, as in, \\"this happened, but that's a story for another day.\\" I wanted to know what happened for these folks, and this abrupt ending felt like laziness, as if Miss Brown just didn't feel like writing any further. Unfortunate, as it left a bad taste after the novel had been so interesting up to that point."},{"Title":"High Hearts (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Well, I read &quot;Rubyfruit Jungle&quot; and loved it, and rated it &quot;5 stars&quot;. Now I've read another Rita Mae Brown book, and it's even better, so I suppose it goes without saying that it's also a five star effort.&quot;Rubyfruit Jungle&quot; was five stars purely on the basis of a fascinating main character; the plot was nothing to get excited about, and the supporting cast was mediocre. This book, while it does not have a character as marvellous as Molly Bolt, (sorry, Geneva) nonetheless is strongly character-driven; it has a dozen characters more interesting and memorable than the second-best character in &quot;Rubyfruit Jungle&quot;. More, it has a significantly more interesting plot, and just as much to say about life and how to live it.A must-read for anyone who has enjoyed anything written by Rita Mae Brown, anyone who enjoys stories about strong female characters, and anyone who enjoys historical novels set during the civil war."},{"Title":"High Hearts (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"A marvelous book. I've replaced my copy several times because I keep giving it away as a gift! Based upon the fact that women were known to have disguised themselves as men to fight in the American Civil war, Ms. Brown's fleshing out of this idea involves rich characters and an absorbing portrait of a vanished way of life."},{"Title":"High Hearts (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Somewhat of a new take on a familiar subject, Brown obviously is intimate with southern history and its unique culture, manners,myths, and mores."},{"Title":"High Hearts (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I throughly enjoyed this novel! Unlike most books on the Civil War this one is from the women's point of view. How did the war affect everyday life for all the levels of Southern society? Women in the military, not as \\"comp followers\\", which is the usual point of view but as soldiers fighting on the front lines. Women in the hospitals working under extreme conditions and performing duties thought of,at that time,as very \\"unwomanly\\" nothing that a well bred female should even be contemplating. Geneva Chatfield Hart, the main charactor, is a strong, intelligent very capable woman. Lutie Chatfield, Geneva's mother, is another strong woman who finds her strength in the trials and hardships of war time. Sin-Sin & Ernie June,slaves on Geneva's VA home planatation, both strong and powerful women. The depictions of both the rural(plantation) and urban( Richmond,VA) lifestyles are rich and full bodied. This book is a good read so sit back and enjoy yourself."},{"Title":"Justice League of America: Another Nail (Elseworlds)","review":"The events of The Nail are a year in the past and the world has been adjusting to the changes. But what really led to the war between New Genesis and Apokolips? Why was a boom tube being opened to Earth in the first place? Well, this sequel offers us a chance to see what else was going on.With a little more involvement from Darkseid and company, we learn about some of Darkseid's long-term goals and how Earth is involved in them. But as with the Generations books, Another Nail takes the opportunity to bring in as much of the DC universe as possible. Just about everyone gets involved in this one. We even see Jonah Hex and OMAC. Unlike with many sequels, this one manages to be almost as good as the original.True to the Elseworlds idea, characters may get used up or sent in radically different directions. Like with the OMAC mini-series, I am not sure that Jack Kirby would completely approve of what happens to some of his characters but if he understood Elseworlds I think he would approve of the grandness of this story's scale.While there is a decent rehash of the original The Nail at the start, I would not recommend reading this one without reading The Nail first."},{"Title":"Justice League of America: Another Nail (Elseworlds)","review":"In the follow up to the brilliant \\"The Nail\\", Alan Davis further explores this world. He recounts a massive war between New Genesis and Apocalypse that took place during the same time as the Super Jimmy incident explored in The Nail. Now, a year after both those events, a new set of circumstances is enveloping this entire reality.A great many more characters are given a chance to show their talents in Another Nail, more than The Nail by far. Some of the retellings are very faithful to current continuity, and some are radical departures. One example of the departures from cannon (what is DC cannon anymore, anyway?) is Mister Miracle and Big Barda. I cannot reveal what is different about them without giving away a big chunk of the plot, and I'm not about spoilers.I think this story is greatly enriched by having first read \\"The Nail\\". If you have read this book, more of the plots and subplots of \\"Another Nail\\" are better enjoyed. However, if you haven't read \\"The Nail,\\" don't despair. Many of the huge plot points are recounted and well enough that it is not absolutely necessary to read one before the other.I highly recommend both books to any lover of comic books, but especially fans of the DC heroes. Any DC fan will find delightful details in this strong Elseworlds offering. As a personal note I will say both \\"the Nail\\" and \\"Another Nail\\" are my favorite Elseworlds stories besides the infamous \\"Kingdom Come\\"."},{"Title":"Justice League of America: Another Nail (Elseworlds)","review":"In JUSTICE LEAGUE: THE NAIL, writer/artist Alan Davis treated us to a DC Universe without a Superman. By the end of the story, that obviously wasn't quite the case, but for some odd reason, Davis wishes to continue the story in JUSTICE LEAGUE: ANOTHER NAIL. This time around, the New Gods are at war, demons are attacking the Earth, and characters from almost every period of DC history are in existence at once - in short, the DCU is going wacko. The Justice League, with the help of the Outsiders, the Metal Men, and the Doom Patrol, among others, must solve the mysteries and save the day.Alan Davis' art for this story is absolutely beautiful, and I can't help but feel that he took on this project primarily to have the opportunity to draw as many different and obscure characters as possible, with the story being secondary. While it does get off to a good start, it quickly began to confuse me as it zigged and zagged all over the place. Soooo much happens, but I was hoping that Davis could somehow tie it all together. Well, he really let me down with a conclusion that was too simple for such a huge set-up. The heroes undergo some very interesting changes, and the tension is pretty good, but in the end, I was left wondering what the point of the story was. While there is a \\"nail\\" of sorts, it is nothing like the focus of the previous book. In short, what I am left with is a book full of pretty pictures and interesting situations, but ultimately, nothing very satisfying."},{"Title":"Justice League of America: Another Nail (Elseworlds)","review":"I loved this book.

Although her essays were written for the magazine of the Adirondack Mountain Club, the plants she discusses are found throughout the northeastern U.S. (and southeastern Canada.)Over half the book is devoted to the ephemeral flowers of spring--from skunk cabbage to bunchberry--explaining their relationship to other plants and insects, how they grow, why their flowers are shaped as they are. For the other seasons, she branches out to flowers of sunny openings, roadsides and wetlands--mullein, jewel weed, pokeweed--and other topics--fungi, even Christmas trees. Schott's descriptions combine scientific detail, folklore, and her own field observations, in a friendly, conversational style. Clem Habetler's line drawings are charming and informative."},{"Title":"Globalize Liberation: How to Uproot the System and Build a Better World","review":"Enhanced for the reader with more than 180 black-and-white illustrations, Globalize Liberation: How To Uproot The System And Build A Better World is an anthology of thirty-three essays by an immense variety of community organizers, edited by social activist David Solnit. The common theme of all the topics is how to contribute what one can to making the world a better place, especially in the postmodern era. From identifying global problems of class struggle, racism, discrimination, and extreme concentration of power, to putting ideas in action whether in America, Argentenia, Scotland, or other nations around the world, Globalize Liberation offers a crucial glimpse into what is needed to shape the future of humanity for the better."},{"Title":"Globalize Liberation: How to Uproot the System and Build a Better World","review":"GLOBALIZE LIBERATION is a fine compendium of writings by and for global justice activists, or just activists generally. With 488 pages and 33 chapters, full of great black & white photos and drawings, it is a veritable encyclopedia. The book is divided into 3 sections:1) What's the problem? (political analysis)2) How to change things (tactics and strategies for change), and3) Ideas in action (examples of various movements).The editor, David Solnit, is a Bay Area activist with long years of experience, going back to the Bay Area Peace Test of the late 1980s. He was a key organizer of the successful nonviolent shutdown of the WTO (World Trade Organization) meeting in Seattle in November/December, 1999. Solnit works as a carpenter in Oakland, enough to keep him on the frontlines of a constant stream of NVA (nonviolent direct action) campaigns. In his editor's note, he says:\\"As a carpenter, I have packed this book like a toolbelt, with the most useful and practical tools: ideas and understandings of how to uproot the system causing our problems and build a better world... ...This book is a resource, but does not offer a repeatable blueprint, roadmap or recipe for the changes our planet so desperately needs.\\"Of course if it did offer The Answer, you can bet that it would be VERY hard to find, and that everyone who desires progressive change would be circulating bootleg copies! But GLOBALIZE LIBERATION offers plenty of insight into making radical change from people who've been trying to make it. Most of the authors are unsung grassroots activists, but there are contributions from Walden Bello, Starhawk, Naomi Klein, George Lakey, and Elizabeth Martinez, all of whom are widely published and well-known in progressive circles. (No Rage Against the Machine, though, Amazon description to the contrary!)The book makes no claim to represent the entire global justice movement -- certainly there are no contributions from conservative opponents of globalization such as Pat Buchanan. But neither are there contributions from the AFL-CIO, or such leading organizations as Public Citizen, the Institute for Policy Studies, or any of the Big 10 environmental groups. Solnit and his contributors basically fall into two categories -- anarchist/antiauthoritarians, and grassroots/populist organizers. The word anarchism, oddly enough, is not used overly much by the contributors -- but the basic approach is clear enough from the Introduction. Solnit says \\"[t]he new radicalism is a movement of movements, a network of networks, not merely intent on changing the world, but -- as the Zapatistas describe -- making a new one in which many worlds will fit.\\" He goes on to distinguish this radicalism from the hierarchical/authoritarian Left of the 20th century -- I'll leave it to you to judge whether the movements of GLOBALIZE LIBERATION are really \\"beyond left and right,\\" as he suggests, or are best thought of as an antiauthoritarian left. Here are the common principles Solnit sees in the new radicalism:\\"...the commitment to uprooting the system that is the cause of our social and ecological problems; doing it ourselves with people power and direct action; making change without taking power; practicing direct democracy in our resistance and in the world we create; and making our efforts a laboratory of resistance, creating new language and new forms of struggle.\\"So the vision, while loose and diverse, is basically a vision of direct democracy and nonviolent direct action -- as Solnit says, \\"[a] common theme within the new radicalism is the practice of letting the means determine the ends.\\" Groups like Public Citizen and the IPS, which are liberal or social democratic in orientation, are tactical allies of \\"the new radicalism,\\" but ultimately have different aims. There are examples in the book from various protests, many in the U.S., but also elsewhere, including the U.K., Italy, Argentina, Mexico (of course, the Zapatistas), and Serbia. The book avoids any lengthy debate over the tactical issue (where exactly is the boundary on nonviolent action?), but stakes out a clear position in favor of NVA, particularly notable with the inclusion of Lakey, a long-time proponent of Gandhian nonviolent strategy. Lakey was an influential voice in the successful movement to remove Milosevich from power in Serbia, and the book includes his account of Otpor, the student movement which used creative non-cooperation tactics. The fact that the CIA & U.S. Endowment for Democrcy also backed Otpor is not addressed, though apparently the Otpor leaders minimize this and say the U.S. intel support was not critical, nor did it guide their objectives (this is from Lakey via the editor).GLOBALIZE LIBERATION is an excellent, up-to-date primer on \\"the new radicalism.\\" It isn't the only one, though -- see my \\"Tools for Activists Against Global Capital\\" for more. The 4 that are most similar to the present volume are WE ARE EVERYWHERE, CONFRONTING CAPITALISM, ANTI-CAPITALISM, and A MOVEMENT OF MOVEMENTS.Given the crisis we face -- and I personally am most concerned about the ecological crisis, and the fact that the oil is running out without any concerted plan for a transition to renewable energy -- the activism of GLOBALIZE LIBERATION is a source of hope. And the most hopeful thing is that it will spark more activism!"},{"Title":"First Corinthians (Interpretation Bible Studies)","review":"Very highly recommended for students of New Testament Christianity, First Corinthians is the latest volume in the outstanding Geneva Press &quot;Interpretation Bible Studies&quot; series. Paul was writing to a troubled church at Corinth, urging its members to live a life distinct from the ways of the dominant culture, by being governed by laws of love, while affirming the tenets of the Christian faith. Paul's direct commentaries on the Corinthian's shortcomings give today's reader a &quot;window in time&quot; to observe daily church life in the first century. First Corinthians also showcases what any church can become by the grace of God. Bruce Fisk (Assistant Professor of New Testament at Westmont College, Santa Barbara, California) shows that this important New Testament book is not just a scandalous expose set out to reveal where the church had gone wrong, it is also a challenging invitation for the church and the community of faith to get things right."},{"Title":"The big ditch;: Small stories of the Ohio canals (Jim Baker's historical handbook series)","review":"Actually a chapbook with little to reccommend it.

I found it refreshing as it presents views from across the pond, quite different from the sprawling natural wood kitchens typically shown in American magazines. Most of these kitchens are quite compact and do not have islands, and very few can take advantage of full picture windows or features such as exposed ceiling rafters. So if you're working with a large kitchen space (say from an addition), you might not have much use for this book. What these kitchens offer is creativity in the selection and coordination of color, texture, materials, and pattern, in many different styles (contemporary, Shaker, etc), all narrated expertly by Ms. Savill.

It is one of the most remarkable expressions about and by an artist in any genre that I have ever seen.Before going further, let me caution those who are offended by all forms of nudity that this book contains many female nudes. These are all tastefully done, and will not offend those who look with a desire to see the essence of beauty.Alfred Stieglitz was a seminal figure in 20th century art. One of the foremost photographers in the century, he also helped other photographers define what the aesthetic means in photography. He also was a champion for many of the best known photographers, and seriously boosted their careers. In painting, he was an early advocate of important 20th century artists like Arthur Dove and Georgia O'Keeffe. In addition, he published two influential journals about photography, and exhibited art in his famous gallery in New York. Clearly, though, photography was his first love. &quot;I have all but killed myself for Photography.&quot;This book focuses on his central vision of photography (&quot;search for objective truth and pure form&quot;) which increasingly was about &quot;antiphotographs&quot; or images that move beyond simple representation. This concept is examined both in 73 of his best images and through numerous excerpts from his voluminous writings on the subject (over 200 essays).This book is based on the famous 1983 show of Stieglitz's work, and has been reproduced with amazing care and quality. The images are produced in tritone to give more texture and detail. The paper is of archival quality. Most people's diplomas are not on paper this good or this thick. There is a luxurious feeling to just hold the pages.The 73 images were selected by Ms. O'Keeffe, Juan Hamilton (her friend and assistant), and curator Sarah Grenough from approximately 1600 images in the collection of the National Gallery of Art. Ms. Grenough selected the writings to be used, and wrote the wonderful introduction.From looking at these remarkable images, I came away with the impression that Stieglitz was at his best (for my taste) when he was doing portraits, abstractions, and cityscapes. Those subjects seemed to allow him to strip away the unessential better than the others he used. My favorite images in the book are:Sun Rays -- Paula, Berlin, 1889From the Back-Window -- 291, 1915 Self-Portrait, 1907Marie Rapp, 1916Arthur G. Dove, 1911-1912Charles Demuth, 1915Hodge Kirnon, 1917Marcel Duchamp, 1923Georgia O'Keeffe, 1918 (3)Margaret Treadwell, 1921Waldo Frank, 1920Dancing Trees, 1922Music -- A Sequence of Ten Cloud Photographs, VIII, 1922Equivalent, 1931His writings are as rewarding as his photographs. I was particularly interested in his ideas about how humans make progress. &quot;Progress has been accomplished only by reason of the fanatical enthusiasm of the revolutionist . . . .&quot; &quot;Experts . . . are the result of hard work.&quot;After you have finished enjoying this astonishingly revealing volume, I suggest that you think about how you like to express truth and beauty in your life. How can you be more direct and simple in this expression?Be sure to live a life of &quot;constant experimenting&quot; like Stieglitz did!"},{"Title":"Alfred Stieglitz: Photographs & Writings","review":"This is far more than a picture book; it contains 73 high-quality plates and its real treasures can be found is the twenty page introduction and the fifty pages of selections from his writings about his work and views on photography.

If you have lost sight of why you shoot pictures, try this as a reminder of clearer moments."},{"Title":"Alfred Stieglitz: Photographs & Writings","review":"The photography and the text of this book has been described in other reviews, but I want to add that this is now one of the most beautiful books that I own.

My main grievance against the book is that it perpetuates bad stereotypes about equestrians, and that too many horse crazy people will read it just because it mentions a horse, which is a far greater disservice than being a bad novel (which it is). Good \\"horse\\" books are difficult to find, which is why I tend not to read many. I only read Death by Dressage because many of my literate \\"horsey\\" friends mentioned how irritating the novel was. As I am the most difficult to irritate, they felt I would be a good test case. I was irritated.Simpering, insipid, vapid, and inane were going through my mind as I read the novel. I would like to have put a DNR (Do not resuscitate) order on the character of Robin Vaughn so that unsuspecting readers would not be subject to sequels. Alas, sequels followed, but I exercised my right as a reader to avoid them.Ms. Banks bludgeons the reader with tedious lectures on horses and all things horsey, with an air of superiority, so one has to wonder what she likes about the sport. The final insult to the reader is the &quot;deus ex machina&quot; ending, as Ms. Banks wrote herself into a corner and couldn't get out.Side pass right past these books."},{"Title":"Death by Dressage","review":"With a title like &quot;Death By Dressage,&quot; I had to read this book. It's not the best mystery I've ever read but the character is believably insane on the subject of horses and I do like the flippant narration. There's probably more horse lore than story in this one, but the horse lore is pretty much right-on and I really, really enjoyed the description of the clinic. The method of murder is ingenious, although I am a little confused about exactly when the narrator figured it all out -- it's pretty clear what happened quite a while before the narrator cries &quot;Eureka!&quot;I like the ditzy, screwball heroine. I like her patient husband and her cranky mare, Plum. You can almost smell the horses, and the descriptions of their movement and bearing bring them right into focus.Maybe not the best horse novel ever written, but excellent reading when you're soaking in a bubble bath after a ride on a cold day!"},{"Title":"Death by Dressage","review":"I am a dressage rider and had heard good things about this book but was very disappointed.

Some of the dialogue is truly funny which is to be expected since the book features an extremely dense heroine. The horse information is well realized and the small equine world the writer creates is a fine place to visit. Although other writers can perhaps do both the writing and the mystery better, it is still a very entertaining read.

His writing on Primo Levi for example, shows tremendous insight."},{"Title":"The Establishment Clause: Religion and the First Amendment","review":"With attempts by our current President to allow federal funds to go to religious charities, a better understanding of the history and meaning of the First Amendment is desparately needed. One could hardly be better qualified to give us such an education than Leonard W. Levy in his book on the Establishment Clause.In his book, Levy refutes the nonpreferentialists' claim that the First Amendment clause, &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,&quot; merely prohibits Congress from providing preferential aid to one church. If &quot;an establishment of religion&quot; meant only single-church establishments, Congress would only be prohibited from exclusively benefiting one church but not prohibited from aiding religion impartially. But, as Levy points out, history does not support the nonpreferentialists' interpretation.Although the five southern colonies did have exclusive Anglical establishments, the colonies of New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire came to have multiple religious establishments, and, indeed, the colonies of Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey never had establishments of any kind. After the Revolution, opposition to establishments increased, resulting in states having to replace their exclusive or dual establishments or even ending their establishments altogether. Thus, the historical fact of multiple establishments of religion contradicts the nonpreferentialists' interpretation that &quot;an establishment of religion&quot; referred only to single-church establishments, and, therefore, does not support their claim that the establishment clause only prohibits Congress from making laws preferring one church. Nor is their interpretation supported by the debates between the Federalists and Anti-federalists.Anti-federalists feared loss of liberty and pressured Federalists to accept recommendations for amendments to the new Constitution, which included protection of religious liberty. But Federalists countered that such amendments were superfluous because, as Levy succinctly restates the argument, &quot;[T]he unamended Constitution vests no power over religion.&quot; Moreover, Madison stated in an October 17, 1788 letter to Jefferson that these amendments ought to be &quot;so framed as not to imply powers not meant to be included in the enumeration.&quot; Thus, Levy concludes, &quot;To argue, as the nonpreferentialists do, that the establishment clause should be construed to permit nondiscriminatory aid to religion leads to the impossible conclusion that the First Amendment added to the powers of Congress even though it was framed to restrict Congress. It is not only an impossible conclusion; it is ridiculous.&quot;From his demolition of the nonpreferentialists' interpretation of the establishment clause and his statement in the Preface that his &quot;sympathies are clearly with the separationists,&quot; one might conclude that Levy is a strict advocate of an impregnable wall of separation between church and state. However, he is not. Of zealous separationists who interpret every crack in the wall as disaster, Levy says, &quot;[They are] like Chicken Little, screaming, 'The wall is falling, the wall is falling.' It really is not and will not, so long as it leaks just a little at the seams. If it did not leak a little, pressure on the wall might generate enough force to break it.&quot;Examples of leaks which Levy feels need not be repaired are the Supreme Court beginning its sessions with &quot;God save this honorable Court,&quot; the money motto &quot;In God We Trust,&quot; the words &quot;under God&quot; in the Pledge of Allegiance, tax-supported chaplains for military and legislative bodies, etc. Although Levy is aware of the concern of separationists that &quot;big oaks grow from small acorns,&quot; he invokes for &quot;trivial&quot; leaks an aphorism which was also advocated by Madison: &quot;De minimis non curat lex&quot; (&quot;The law does not bother with trifles&quot;). A more controversial leak, however, is Levy's advocacy of tax aid for parochial schools.Although he agrees that the &quot;claim of 'double taxation' is a misnomer,&quot; he asserts that the Supreme Court &quot;ought to relieve the burden of so called double taxation on those who pay to send their children to private school.&quot; He also says, &quot;If proper restraints exist on the funds for parochial schools so that tax monies are not spent for religious purposes, and the aid rendered is comparable to the value of the secular education provided by the schools, fairness seems to be on the accomodationist side.&quot; To say the least, Levy's leaky wall is problematic. It is impossible that parochial school aid would not set free additional dollars for sectarian indoctrination, and the idea that, with &quot;proper restraints,&quot; taxpayers' dollars could be secure from misuse is too good to be true.In the course of discussing establishment-clause cases, Levy amuses his reader with some pot shots at the High Court. He says, for example, that &quot;the Court has managed to unite those who stand at polar opposites on the results that the Court reaches: a strict separationist and zealous accommodationist are likely to agree that the Supreme Court would not recognize an establishment of religion if it took life and bit the Justices.&quot;Levy obviously writes with passion, and his scholarship is as good as his views are controversial. Notwithstanding my disagreement with him over parochial school aid, I found his book both provoking and educational."},{"Title":"The Establishment Clause: Religion and the First Amendment","review":"This is a relatively short book by the noted legal historian and constitutional scholar Leonard Levy. Somewhat polemical in nature, this book is concerned primarily with rebutting the 'original intention' approach to the establishment clause of the First Amendment. Written originally in response to Reagan era claims that the establishment clause permitted non-preferential aid to religion, this book maintains its relevance as this claims continue to be made by a variety of conservative politicians and legal theorists. The non-preferentialist approach states that the establishment clause authorizes federal aid to religion so long as it is not preferential and specifically avoids a single church. The opposite, separationist approach, advocates the so-called \\"wall\\" between church and state with the federal government prohibited from aiding religion. Levy systemically examines the nature of religous establishments at the time of the formulation of the constitution, the attitudes of the Framers towards separation, the rationale for seperation, and the basic logic of the Bill of Rights (a subject on which Levy is an established authority). The result is a devastating critique of non-preferentialism based on original intent. Levy shows well that religous establishments in several colonies/states were plural in nature, so establishment can't refer just to favoring one religion. In line with a great deal of other scholarship, he shows that the framers were definitely separationist in orientation. With other scholars, Levy stresses that separationism was advocated by a coaltion of relatively secular intellectuals like Madison and Jefferson and a group of devout churchmen like the Baptists Isaac Backus and John Leland, all of whom felt that separation was necessary to safeguard religion. Finally, he scornfully but correctly exposes the basic weakness of arguing that the establishment clause authorizes non-preferential aid by pointing out that the basic thrust of the Bill of Rights is to constrain Federal power, not to enumerate its powers. Levy's arguments are presented well and are convincing. While non-preferentialism may one day be a viable policy, its advocates will have to search elsewhere for a constitutional justification.The last couple of chapters of the book are devoted to related topics. Levy has an effective chapter on the inconsistencies of Supreme Court rulings on the establishment clause. He characterizes well the confusion engendered by these often unclear rulings and makes a very good point that the contradictory rulings and often poorly argued decisions are contributing factors to social discord on this issue. Part of this chapter, however, is a bit confusing because Levy wanders into a general discussion of originalist interpretation. This prefigures one of his later books but is not strictly germane to the topic of this book.Levy also has some interesting comments on his attitude towards separation. While the logic of his arguments leads to strict separationism, he reveals himself to be a modest accomodationist with considerable respect for religion and its important place in American life."},{"Title":"The Establishment Clause: Religion and the First Amendment","review":"The confrontation between religious and secular values is one of the hottest issues that will confront the Supreme Court in the twenty-first century. Surprisingly, few Americans are schooled in the origins of the First Amendment and the thinking of James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and other founding founders in including this clause as part of the Bill of Rights. A good portion of the volume discusses this extremely relevant topic. We learn that Madison was instrumental in the passage of the Establishment Clause. He saw it as a limitation on the power of Congress to coerce individuals to worship God in any manner inconsistent with their conscience, indeed to enact any law that involved religious topics.The book continues its discussion of efforts to promote prayer and religious doctrine through government backing by examining leading 19th and 20th century Supreme Court cases. I learned that the celebrated liberal Justice William O. Douglas wrote opinions that weakened the wall of separation; he authored conservative decisions that called for the encouragement of religion by the state...(I expected the opposite).

Studies are summarised of the characteristics of the ablated material. In some ways, ablation can be considered the inverse process to deposition.One attraction of the deposition methods is to apply these in the construction of high temperature superconducting films. Typically, these are complex oxides, of 4 or more elements. The commercial viability of these materials depends in no small part on being able to manufacture them cheaply.

Very emotional A DEFINATE MUST READ BOOK"},{"Title":"Three came home","review":"The captive narrative is a standby in American literature. Every war has produced a crop of such memoirs, and the most remarkable thing about them as a group is there essential sameness. Whether the teller is an woman abducted by Indians in colonial days or a aviator shot down over Vietnam, the experience of captivity is singular.It is also a difficult genre to present well. Nothing much happens to the POW. A day-by day recitation of starvation and waiting does little to engage the reader. And since most POWs were not writers in their previous life, they lack the kind of literary skill necessary to make a the story live.That is what makes Agnes Keith's 1947 \\"Three Came Home\\" so rich. Keith was a writer before her internment by the Japanese in 1942, and used her skill to present an heartbreaking but ultimately affirming narrative of life inside a jungle prison camp.Agnes Newton Keith came to British Borneo in 1934 as a new bride. Harry Keith was Director of Agriculture for the colony, charged with making trees grow \\"where before there were none.\\" They settled in Sandakan, North Borneo, where Agnes translated her love of writing into an award-winning book, \\"Land Below the Winds.\\" In 1940, she gave birth to a son, named George.George was not yet walking when war clouds began to gather over Borneo. By late 1941, the Japanese were threatening the invasion of the entire South Pacific. Talk in Sandakan revolved around the likelihood of the Government evacuating all European women and children. Agnes, like many other women, decided to stay with her husband.Invasion came on January 19, 1942. For the next 4 1/2 months, the 80 European residents of Sandakan lived under virtual house arrest. Agnes suffered a miscarriage under the strain. On May 12, they received orders to be ready to move within the hour, They were permitted one suitcase each. Husbands were separated from their wives and children. By nightfall, Agnes and George were dumped into a leaky old Quarantine Station on Berhala Island. They would not be free again until September, 1945.While there were countless examples of selflessness, captivity did not bring out the best in all people. Some hoarded food and medicine; others told guards about smuggling operations in exchange for favors. Tempers flared, and pre-war civility fell away. Keith recalled one women telling her: \\"I hate your guts Agnes, and I'm going to tell you so. Although I'd like to be nice to you, just to keep out of that damned book of yours.\\"And Agnes was writing a book, at great peril. For the next 4 years, she wrote in microscopic letters on any blank scrap of paper she could find. These notes were then hidden in old bottles, in George's toys, sewn into the linings of their clothes. \\"Land Below the Wind\\" had been widely read in Japan before the war, so the Camp Authority frequently searched her belongings for these notes. They never found them.This running diary chronicled her stay at Berhala and their removal to the much larger Batu Lintang complex in Kuching, where she would spend the balance of the war. As with any prison narrative, food was the dominant theme. The standard ration for POWs was rice gruel, rolls, and tea. They did not always get this, and it was never enough. Eggs and bananas were rare treats. This meager diet was supplemented with pickings from the soldiers' garbage, wild greens, snails, snakes, and whatever else could be scrounged. In four years, they received one Red Cross shipment. Each of the 46 Americans was given one box. These had to be divided among 280 hungry prisoners.Two groups within the prison kept Agnes going. First were Batu Lintang's 46 children. George and the others literally grew up within the compound. Hunger and exposure was the only life they remembered. They were tough because they had to be, but they were also generous, cheerful, and uncomplaining. At the beginning, Agnes and the other young mothers committed themselves to doing whatever it took to keep their children alive. In the end, Agnes mused, \\"perhaps they brought us through alive.\\"The children, and the nuns. More than half the 280 women at Batu Lintang were Dutch or English sisters. To Agnes, a non-Catholic, these women were awe-inspiring. \\"...I met nuns as women, and sisters, and mothers, and hard workers, and my friends. Here I met them as people who sang, and laughed, and made joke and had fun.\\" Inside prison walls, the sisters held Mass and celebrated holy days. \\"They prayed for peace, believed it would come; set dates, and hours and deadlines for it--and when it didn't come they said \\"Thy will be done,\\" and prayed again.\\"The Japanese did not treat the women as badly as male POWs. Men could be killed on a whim. With the women, the guards usually contented themselves with a slap across the face. Far more frightening was the idea of sexual assault. One night late in the war, Agnes was assaulted by a guard. When she reported this attempted rape, the commandant ordered her to withdraw the charge. Falsely accusing a Japanese soldier was a death-penalty offense. Agnes refused to recant. She was promptly and severely beaten. Ultimately, the commandant decided to drop the matter, but the female prisoners suffered several weeks of reprisals from angry guards in the weeks following the incident.Completely isolated from the outside world, the POWs did not know when or if help was coming. On August 18, 1945, they received a leaflet drop saying that the British Army was on the way. It was three more weeks of agonized waiting, but the camps were eventually liberated on September 11, 1945. Agnes and George were reunited with Harry, and within a week they were on a transport ship to the United States.\\"Three Came Home\\" is a powerful narrative. Keith did not shy away from sensitive issues; she did not try to hide her anger at having a section of her life stolen from her. One caution: some modern readers may find her use of racial slurs offensive. Put in the context of the easygoing racism of the era and the indignities suffered in captivity, her derogatory comments on the Japanese become understandable, if not excusable. In any case, \\"Three Came Home\\" is a moving look at a dark chapter in the Pacific War.Settled in the States, Agnes finally told Harry about her experiences. \\"One anticipates a some emotion from a man when telling home that his wife has been attacked, kicked and beaten,\\" she wrote. \\"Subconsciously, I think I expected a little melodrama.\\" Instead, Harry was quiet and sad, but showed little other reaction. That was a prisoners' life, gender notwithstanding. \\"I saw,\\" she concluded, \\"that we had come far from our old concepts of honor and disgrace. In war, we women must fight with all ourselves.\\""},{"Title":"Three came home","review":"This book contains the wartime memoirs of Agnes Keith. In 1939, Keith published a book \\"Land Beneath the Wind,\\" describing her life as the wife of a British colonial official in Northern Borneo. She and her husband Harry were on home leave in North America in 1939 when she finished writing the book. However, Harry was called back early to Borneo from his leave because of the war clouds on the horizon. Agnes, who was pregnant, soon followed, and several months later, gave birth to their son George in Sandakan. Although there had been talk of evacuating women and children from colonial outposts in the Pacific, no orders came through for evacuation before the Japanese invasion, and Agnes refused to leave Harry behind voluntarily. Thus, when the Japanese arrived, all three Keiths were still in Sandakan, and were soon interned in prisoners' camps for the duration of the war. In this book, Keith recounts the stories of how she, George, and Harry survived life in the camps. Her tale was so remarkable that it was made into a movie shortly after the war.Readers of Keith's earlier book will be stunned at the change in tone of her writing. In Land Beneath the Wind, Keith writes with an airy, scattered-brained style, almost as if she were afraid that otherwise, she would be taken too seriously. Indeed, it was perhaps her humor itself that made her first book popular. But the light tone is gone completely from this book. The nightmare of the prison camps, where random beatings were a certainty, but food was often unattainable, and hygiene nonexistent, took away her carefree nature and matured her overnight beyond her years. For more than three years, she struggled daily to find any kind of food for George, from wormy rice to just plain worms. This woman of colonial privilege traded family heirloom jewelry for a chicken, and learned to hoard night soil for use as fertilizer.From the start, the Japanese camp leader recognized her as a special prisoner, because he had read Land Beneath the Wind. He required her to keep a journal of her camp adventures for future publication to show how \\"humane\\" the Japanese treatment of prisoners had been. So every day, after she completed her required prison work, she had to write for this commander about how wonderful camp life was. When that was finished, she secretly wrote up notes describing what life was really like, and hid them in cans buried under their huts or in the latrines. The most amazing part of her experience is not only that she and George and Harry survived at all, but that through it all, she managed to come away from the camps without blind hatred for the Japanese. She recognized that some of the prison guards were evil, but that many couldn't help but obey their superiors. The years of captivity for the Keiths robbed them of their youth, their health, and the better part of George's childhood, but Agnes finds fault not with Japanese people, but rather with the idea of war itself."},{"Title":"Three came home","review":"As much as &quot;Three Came Home&quot; is a story of war, it is a story of love. Mrs. Keith's love for her husband and son are paralleled with her hatred of internment. She balances the good in people, even the enemy, with the bad. The clear message is that war is what makes people bad. I enjoyed this book. It is beautifully written, with every sentence eliciting some kind of emotion in the reader. Mrs. Keith is an admirable woman for her literary accomplishments and her ability to share her experiences on a very personal level."},{"Title":"Three came home","review":"I read this book because I saw the movie by the same title with Claudette Coberette (spelling?) from 1950. It was a great movie that made me want to find out more about Agnes N. Keith and her family. Upon researching her, I found out she had written several books before her war experience and several books after the war.Agnes was on the island of Borneo with her husband, Harry, and toddler, George. Harry Keith was there as part of the English government's efforts. The Keiths knew the war was breaking out, but chose to stay in spite of the dangers. Agnes chose to stay with her husband. In the book she said she never regretted her choice to stay, but did wonder later on if George should have been sent out to stay with relatives.The Japanese took control of the island when WWII started. All English and Americans were rounded up and placed in prisoner of war camps. The men and the women were separated. Agnes and Harry did occasionally catch glimpses and stolen moments, but for the most part they were kept totally separated during the years.The book details the daily life of a prisoner. A lot of the book describes the harsh conditions, the lack of food and hygiene. There were a lot of children in the camp. The mothers banded together to take the best care of the children they possibly could. A group of nuns was also in the camp and helped with the children.What I found most interesting in the book was the amount of underhanded trading, bartering and smuggling which went on in the camp. The prisoners put themselves in great danger to get extra food, clothes, to send mail in and out and to meet with their spouses. They were afraid, but apparently not totally afraid. The book also details their other daily efforts to keep body and soul together. They kept gardens, picked wild berries and weeds, kept chickens under their bunk houses and other very original ways to make things better.The Japanese took a greater interest in Agnes than in her fellow prisoners because of her fame as a writer. They tried to get her to write progoganda for them. They also were concerned she was doing her own hidden writing. Agnes put herself in great danger to write a continuing journal and keep it hidden. Her effects were searched more often because of her writing.This book will be of interest to anybody who is a history or biography buff. She tells some details of the war effort. But most of the book is her own personal story.Some of the other reviews touched on the fact that her attitudes reflect the common attitudes of the 1940s and 1950s. If bigotry and racial prejudice are a big issue with you, you may not like this book at all. For the times, Agnes thinks of herself as very liberal and open minded. In a time when there was a great deal of stereotyping, she is trying to be a great human. However, when cast in our time period, she comes off as having a great deal of prejudice. She talks about race A LOT. And she says things which are very condescending and narrow minded. When she see little Black children who are adopted by White missionaries she says something like, it's clear they and their forefathers are not used to using their mental capacities and it's clear they will never be able to keep up with the other children. At the time, she was probably criticized for having Chinese, Philapino and Black friends. But now it all sounds very antiquated. Which is not bad, it makes us realize how far we have come in our attitudes.Aside from the racial things, her writing is very descriptive and flowery. She gets deep and philosophical about very odd everyday things and goes on and on like she is writing an essay for junior high. That said, she is an interesting writer able to make what was no doubt a drab ugly existence very interesting.Agnes Newton Keith also wrote a followup book &quot;The White Man Returns&quot; which details the Keiths life after the war when they returned to the same island. That book doesn't have as much interesting drama, but it is still a good read."},{"Title":"Three came home","review":"In Three Came Home, Keith tells the story of her survival in a WW11 Japanese prison camp. The book is full of insight, fairness, humor, and wisdom. She does not wear the reader out with moralizing. She leaves out the unwanted detail, but answers the questions that we might want to ask if we'd been there at the time. We are with her in the book: the day to day living with filth and disease, the tyranny, the hopes deferred, th inspiration that comes to her in numerous ways. Then, of course, the release to freedom in Sept. l945"},{"Title":"Three came home","review":"Three Came Home is a well-written, true story of a woman and her son's internment in a Japanese prisoner of war camp in Borneo during WWII. Agnes Newton Keith creates a vivid portrait of the conditions under which the prisoners lived and of their day to day lives. She also makes it clear that people are not inherently good or bad; they are often victims of circumstances. Her love for her son and hope that they will be reunited with her husband keep her going and morally-centred. An absolutely excellent book!"},{"Title":"Three came home","review":"Keith, UC Berkeley grad in 1930s, writes of the world of Java, Bali, Borneo as a witty, charming American mother of a new baby -- suddenly out of her $100 1938 evening gowns and lifestyle as successful author of prewar bestseller &quot;Land Below the Wind&quot; and into POW camp. Sketches in my 1946 batik-bound original published book are adorable; spiritual message for world without war or race-hatred vivid and memorable."},{"Title":"Three came home","review":"After seeing the 1950 Claudette Colbert film version of this book, I was interested in reading the memoir on which the film was based. Agnes Keith was married to a British government officer when the Japanese took Indonesia during the early days of World War II. Keith and her toddler son were taken to a POW camp; her husband spent the rest of the war in a men's camp under even worse conditions. Keith's memoir describes the starvation, the cruelty, the inhumane conditions, disease, torture, hard labor and the women's superhuman struggles to keep their children alive and relatively healthy. The story is not only about survival, but about the power of love. In the book an occasional racist remark, typical of the times, creeps in, but she also occasionally inserts insights into the humanity found even in some of her captors, and certainly in the Indonesian people. The book ends with little bitterness, and primarily a plea for peace. The film was remarkably faithful to the book, sanitizing and softening some details because film audiences weren't expected to see Claudette Colbert fighting rats, living in abject filth, or dropping down to 80 pounds. The film is still very powerful; the book even more so. This is a well-bound trade paperback edition."},{"Title":"Three came home","review":"I found this book in my mother's collection of old books she has read years ago and shelved to be read again sometime in the future. As a 47 year old, I cannot relate to world war II, let alone being in a prison camp. Agnes writes with tongue-in-cheek humor and very real human emotions. I was inspired by her accounts of the depth of human suffering, and the heights of human kindness. I am such a fan that I have contined to search for and find her other books and have read the next two that were written in chronological order. These books are such that I want my 19 year old daughter to read them so she can learn from real history the lessons of perseverence, faith and hope. For me, this book was more than just an account of a horrendous experience, it gave me hope in the indomitable spirit of decency in mankind. It actually changed me."},{"Title":"Three came home","review":"This is a fine copy of a great historical novel; Wonderful to read, and lovingly used.

I do not follow the BL diet, but only want the inspirational aspect of it. Watching the contestants struggle, moan, groan, scream and cry makes me realize that if these folks are brave enough to do it all on TV, then certainly I can get off my duff and get going!The book serves its purpose for that. I've read it, got inspired by the casts hard work, determination and self-discoveries and even got some helpful hints on it.That being said, I did find it to be lacking a bit. For someone looking for a complete \\"how to\\" weight loss book, there are others that seem to be more complete. For example, I did not read anywhere in here about drinking a healthy amount of water. In my experience,( and I know this myth was de-bunked at some point) drinking water is a key factor in weight loss- at least in my experience its been a huge factor. I know on the show the cast/contestants constantly have water with them, so it surprised me that they do not mention it at all.The other thing was the calories they mention- seems pretty low, but again, there are like 10,000 different myths out there on what's healthy, so maybe its sound advice, maybe not?This is very basic, I supposed one who's never attempted weight loss before would find it helpful. The information is helpful, but not as thorough as it could be, in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser: The Weight Loss Program to Transform Your Body, Health, and Life--Adapted from NBC's Hit Show!","review":"I ordered this book to look at the diet recommended.

Well worth the money."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser: The Weight Loss Program to Transform Your Body, Health, and Life--Adapted from NBC's Hit Show!","review":"I love this book because all the recipes are so easy and a lot of them are not time consuming.

If you want to follow it step by step and word for word you need to prepare a lot of the food ahead of time. So make sure when you start this program you do the prep work, otherwise is gets too time consuming and you lose the motivation.

And I consider these diet menus excellent, am yet to embark on this exercise regimen and will adjust that to my own capability as we all should, and looking forward to it.

It did a great job of laying out an easy to follow eating and exercising plan."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser: The Weight Loss Program to Transform Your Body, Health, and Life--Adapted from NBC's Hit Show!","review":"If you really like the show and can't wait for each new segment to air, you'll also want a copy of the book. It reveals more about the contestents and their struggles.If you want a specific diet and exercise program that reflects what the contestents went through, you may or may not find that here. I say \\"may\\" because it wasn't uncommon for those on the show to do 3 hours of exercise a day (sometimes more) to achieve the kind of weight loss that showed on the scale each week.Are YOU up to that kind of challenge? If you are, you can take the info in this book and go for the burn. If not, you can still follow the plan and lose weight - but be aware that you may not see the same dramatic weight loss as the contestents on the show without exerting maximum effort.I really enjoyed reading this book and actually like it BETTER than the show (and I confess I really didn't like the show much with its humiliating climax, where one contestent would be voted off the show per week). Within the context of a book, the personal stories are engaging and much of the book is inspirational, just the type of material that might compel you to stick to your exercise and diet plan.There is plenty of useful info here although I can't say it hasn't been covered in other books. What sets this one apart are the personal accounts and I can never get enough of those. When someone starts at 300 pounds plus and manages to get to goal weight, it becomes pretty clear that nearly anyone can get there, with enough willpower and motivation. This book could be one more motivational aid."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser: The Weight Loss Program to Transform Your Body, Health, and Life--Adapted from NBC's Hit Show!","review":"'The Biggest Loser' book is filled with stimulating stories of personal triumph over weight from the popular television show's contestants.If you're one of the millions of fans of the hit NBC television reality weight loss show \\"The Biggest Loser,\\" then undoubtedly you have become personally acquainted with names like Ryan, Kelly, Mo, Dave, and Drea from Season One as well as Matt, Dr. Jeff, Suzanne, and Suzy from Season Two, just to name a few.You probably feel like you know these people intimately because you have watched them work so very hard on your television sets each week to tackle a commond problem -- what to do about their obesity. Their commitment to doing something positive and permanent about their weight is indeed inspiring and educational for a home viewing audience, two-thirds of whom have a weight problem of their own that they need to deal with and don't know what to do about it.That's where The Biggest Loser book steps in. This book is based on the popular television show and allows you to read more about the contestants from the show to learn how they have been able to be victorious over their battle of the bulge while also communicating important principles to apply in your own life to help get that fat monkey off your own back for good.The Biggest Loser is a beautifully crafted book full of colorful pictures, personal stories from cast members, advice from the show's trainers Bob Harper and Jillian Michaels, a thorough explanation of \\"The Biggest Loser\\" diet plan, a 12-week exercise routine, scrumptuous recipes including personal favorites from the contestants, motivational remarks from those who went through the most dramatic weight loss change, and the secret tips about how to make weight loss and healthy eating a permanent part of your life.Cheering you on to become the \\"biggest loser\\" that you can possibly be, The Biggest Loser book asks the simple question, \\"Wouldn't it be wonderful to have the body you want -- slender, toned, fit, and healthy -- and have it for life?\\" Who among us who has struggled with weight loss would respond back with anything but a thunderous YEAH BABY?!!! This dream can become a reality when the steps outlined in The Biggest Loser book are applied.Read about the struggles that each contestant had with weight prior to their television experience and how \\"The Biggest Loser\\" show literally changed their lives forever. As someone who has lost over 180 pounds, I can certainly relate with their stories of heartache and frustration about what to do about being overweight. It's not a fun experience and you just feel so hopeless. But once you read The Biggest Loser, you will find that while it won't be an easy road to restore your health, there is definitely a way to rise to the occasion and gain victory over weight problems once and for all!There's a unique section in The Biggest Loser book called \\"From Reasons to Resolutions\\" which will get you to visualize and think about why you want to lose weight and what will happen if and when weight loss occurs. Getting your mind in the right frame of reference will get you started off right and make your eventual success that much more likely to happen.In a nutshell, \\"The Biggest Loser\\" diet consists of limiting your caloric intake to seven times your body weight. For example, when I weighed 410 pounds in January 2004, I could eat 2,870 calories according to this plan. At my current body weight of 225, that number of calories per day drops down to 1,575, which is probably a little bit less than what I consume on my low-carb lifestyle but not too far off. There's a creative \\"4-3-2-1 Biggest Loser Pyramid\\" which shows you which foods you should eat and in what quanties, including fruits and vegetables, proteins, whole grains, and \\"extras.\\" Guess which one you eat the least of?You also are encouraged to drink lots of water, use artificial sweeteners sparingly, eat 4-6 planned meals, portion-size your foods to avoid overeating, read labels like a hawk (there even a neat \\"translation\\" guide to help you figure out what certain terms mean on a nutrition label), and steer clear from certain appetite-stimulating foods. It's all explained in great detail in The Biggest Loser book.I really enjoyed the \\"Take A Cue\\" blurbs at the bottom of the pages which feature one- or two-sentence words of wisdom from the cast of \\"The Biggest Loser.\\" You really feel like they're talking directly to you and rooting for you as you turn page after page of The Biggest Loser book. I also was attracted to the recipes section towards the back of the book, which included some excellent low-carb ones including Dave's chicken salad, Ryan's portabello pizza, Suzanne's grilled salmon burgers, and Drea's turkey wrap. My mouth is watering just thinking about all these delicious recipes.As a 180+ pound low-carb weight loss success story I don't personally adhere to all of the advice provided in The Biggest Loser book, but I am encouraged to see many of the contestants giving superb advice to would-be losers: stay away from sugar, get more water consumption, eat often enough to ward off hunger, skip the dinner bread and eat a salad first at a restaurant, replace television watching with exercise (except to watch \\"The Biggest Loser,\\" of course!), eat healthy carbs found in fruits and vegetables, and much more. You can really learn a lot about good basic habits that you can incorporate to make weight control a long-term part of your life.There is also a section in the book which urges local communities to conduct their own \\"Biggest Loser\\" challenges to help people deal with this very real problem. They include step-by-step instructions about how to organize it and replicate what so many have seen on television, including stunts and races to give the contestants an incentive to continue on. Applying these recommendations will make your local \\"Biggest Loser\\" challenge a huge success.A special \\"where are they now\\" section gives an update on all 26 contestants who became winners by becoming big losers thanks to \\"The Biggest Loser.\\" You will be amazed by how far these contestants have come and how their lives have been literally turned upside down for the better. I can relate and hope and pray many will be uplifted and have a fire lit within them to lose weight and keep it off for good after reading The Biggest Loser."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser: The Weight Loss Program to Transform Your Body, Health, and Life--Adapted from NBC's Hit Show!","review":"I really wanted to love this book... but it seems as if the producers rushed it to print. There are very little before/after photos... and very little in-depth profiles of the contestants. All you get is blurbs from them... and a recipe, which may/may not be their creation. The caloric recommendations... 1050 kcal for people below 150 pounds... are too low...especially for the amount of exercise prescribed. Rarely these days do any experts advise going below 1400 kcal for an active woman, with 1200 be the absolute minimum. Even with such minimal caloric requirements, no mention is made of vitamin supplementation. In the recipe section, they often refer to agave nectar/syrup... yet they do nothing to explain it, its benefits, or where to buy it. (It's a low-GI sweetener from a plant in Mexico.)

Although the Biggest Loser book is not the most informative, as a fan of the show I enjoyed the read."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser: The Weight Loss Program to Transform Your Body, Health, and Life--Adapted from NBC's Hit Show!","review":"I liked this book because I enjoy watching the show. I admire and respect all those contestants/dieters who go through all that \\"struggle and hard work\\" to lose weight and feel better about themselves.Personally, I feel that reading the book is not motivation enough for people who are tremendously overweight. They need the one-on-one like the wonderful people on the TV show receive.So if you're thinking of buying this book to lose weight, save your money. However, if you just want to hear more about the show and the participants, you may want to have this book.I liked it ... but didn't loooooooove it."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser: The Weight Loss Program to Transform Your Body, Health, and Life--Adapted from NBC's Hit Show!","review":"I laugh when I see all the reviews from people who complain about the calorie intake requirements. The calorie requirements within the book are the \\"net\\" calorie requirements. (i.e. Calories consumed (what you eat) - Calories burned (exercise)). These readers just skip to the chapter on diet looking for that \\"silver bullet\\" to slay the weight lost beast. Bottom line: This book will not turn you into the biggest loser. It will not make you lose weight or a millionaire. It is not a quick fix book. If you want to lose weight, eat right and work out. If you want be be a millionaire, make money and spend less than you make. Read this book for inspiration and know that there are people out there who struggle with weight and self discipline problems like us \\"normal\\" people. If they can do it, you can do it. It may take months and even years to reach your goals but be: Consistent, use proper form and remember its a marthon and not a sprint. If you are 40 and plan to live until you are eighty, you will have 40 years of workouts ahead of you. So have fun! I loved the stories! Good job Matt, Seth, Mark, Pete, Ryan, Andrea and Suzy!

I too was under the impression that Bob and Jillian may have colaborated more in this book. If you watched the show, then you learned about as much as the book details in reference to the contestants, I feel. Also, the book also has a crazy suggestion in reference to calorie consumption, as previously mentioned. The recipes would be the only reason I would purchase the book and I can just check it out at the library for that and the recipes I like, I put them on cards. Someone had mentioned Jillians book, Winning By Losing, earlier. I too highly suggest this book.

What little information it does provide in the way of diet and exercise is overly simplified and generic. At the end of the day, it was interesting to read the contestants anecdotes, but dissapointing as a source of information."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser: The Weight Loss Program to Transform Your Body, Health, and Life--Adapted from NBC's Hit Show!","review":"Ok...so most people who know me know I have a slight obsession with this show....and I was surprised to note when I was getting the synopsis for this post, one reviewer didn't think that the diet was covered adequately...and in some respects I agree...because the diets for each person on the show is individualized with the help of a dietitian...so they can't really say *all* of the contestants did X, Y & Z and had X results. What the book does give you are some parameters as to what the best choices are and instructs you to go out with that information and make choices based on your own personal preferences and staying within the caloric guidelines. Since I've already begun my own \\"healthy living\\" adventure, I already had some firm ideas on what I wanted to do and I found that the book complimented what I already had planned and allowed me to expand the scope a bit. The version of the food pyramid printed in this book is surely more in line with what I think is proper and realistic, so it gets big kudos from me in that respect. The exercise program was brief in my opinion...but again, these were tailored to the specific contestants by professional trainers and they certainly don't' want t-o give away all their secrets either...but the info is good and I suspect you can get more out of it if your willing to buy the exercise DVD that goes with it (I'm renting from Netflix first...to see if it's worth spending the dollars on first). The bulk of the book was personal snippets about the contestants (which I could have lived without...but perhaps necessary for those who didn't watch the show, but are curious about it). There is a selection of recipes at the end which there are about 7-10 that I will try...they all look quite good and are not bad with the fat and calories...so for the price I paid for this book (12.89) I'd say it was definitely worth it...but for those looking for a set in stone, do X, Y & Z diet and exercise plan...this is not going to make you happy, you may want to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser: The Weight Loss Program to Transform Your Body, Health, and Life--Adapted from NBC's Hit Show!","review":"inspiring and motivating. wouldn't think twice in recommending this book to others who want to change their lives."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser: The Weight Loss Program to Transform Your Body, Health, and Life--Adapted from NBC's Hit Show!","review":"While this wasn't a terrible book for the price the recipes and meals aren't very helpful.

For a 200 pound person that means 1400 calories a day. This might be OK for an average weight but I am not sure if the formula is proper for very heavy or very light people. So, from that point of view I find this book not very scientific. On the other hand the exercise plan suggested in the book is pretty reasonable. There are also a lot of other good advice that will help you take a long term control of you weight and will result in a good health: stay away from sugar (except for natural sugars contained in fruits), eat salad before each meal, exercise, and so on. For much more comprehensive advice on adopting healthy lifestyle, resulting in permanent weight loss I rather recommend Can We Live 150? by M. Tombak. A lot of free excerpts from Tombak's book can be found at the author's website."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser: The Weight Loss Program to Transform Your Body, Health, and Life--Adapted from NBC's Hit Show!","review":"very easy to follow instructions.

Read it and loved it! It is both informative and inspiring. I've gone through many diet books and haven't found any that has suited or motivated me like The Biggest Loser. I've already started implementing what I've learned. What's great about this book is that it's real--the diet tips/plans are manageable. I was actually very skeptical at first--convinced that the book will probably just be about the contestants/show, sprinkled with a couple of diet tips and recipes, but I was wrong. Without a doubt, it is truly a book with\\"The Weight Loss Program to Transform Your Body, Health, and Life\\"."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser: The Weight Loss Program to Transform Your Body, Health, and Life--Adapted from NBC's Hit Show!","review":"I bought this book looking for information on how to lose weight and also because I am a Bob Harper fan. Sadly this book is full of half hearted anecdotes with no real weight loss information at all and sports a meager 2 page forward by Bob. That's the total extent of his involvment in this book! Alas, I will continue to wait for Bob's book to come out, but meantime I recommend Jillian Michaels book Winning By Losing, it is the real deal."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser: The Weight Loss Program to Transform Your Body, Health, and Life--Adapted from NBC's Hit Show!","review":"I had heard about the drastic calorie cut the Biggest Loser recommends but did not want to believe it but the book lays this out. It recommends a 7 times body weight formula but the contestants actually use a 6 times formula to hasten weight loss.It is therefore not a valid recommendation for anyone wanting to lose a few vanity pounds or even up to 20 lbs.I will give you an example. I weigh 117 pounds but according to my height and gender, I can lose 7 more pounds and go down to 110. Both are slim and in the normal range and I have 17.5% body fat-considered athletic for women, although not elite athlete level -just amateur.This formula says that I should be eating about 700-800 calories a day, depending on which factor you choose.I have the body bug and from that I can tell you that my average burn per day is about 2300, sometimes going up to 2800 sometimes down to 2050 or so.I do P90x-twice graduate-plus add in 30 min to an hour of extra cardio.I tried limiting my intake to 1250-1300 for 10 days. My blood sugar crashed twice and I nearly blacked out. and no I am a young and healthy individual-no health problems and I have been an avid exerciser for about a decade.Also guess what? I lost maybe a lb or two in the first 6 days, and then nothing in the final 5 days. And I had all the signs of overtraining-irritability, mood swings, extreme fatigue, insomnia, muscle aches and cramps.As the Harris Benedict equation as well as numerous sites will tell you, creating a 1000 deficit is the maximum recommended for most but those in the healthy BMI range and with little body fat are less likely to tolerate such deficits and within those days I was creating at least a 1000-1300 deficit. Another equation takes into account lean body mass and contends that in order to optimize my results-burn mostly fat and minimize muscle loss, I should not go over a 650 deficit. That would mean that I eat around 1700-1800.From my experience I can tell you that I do lose on 1700-I experimented with the drastic cut merely to speed up my results-it backfired.So do you really think I could go on a 4 month diet, exercising 3 hours a day (in which case I'd burn approximately 2800 on average) and eating only 700 calories? I would be creating about a 2000 calorie deficit per day*7=14000/3500, meaning over 3 lb loss a week.This is what the math tells you . HOwever, as anyone who knows anything about weight loss and nutrition will tell you that such drastic cuts will result in 1) loss of LBM 2) starvation mode and plateau. 3) further metabolism slowdown as a result of 1.Also another equation recommends that one lose 1.1 % of body weight a week-this recommends that I lose 1.17 lbs a week and of course this amount will slightly go down per week.Oh and I am almost an expert on the topic so I was eating a balanced 45 carb, 40 protein, 15 fat type diet, limiting sodium and getting enough calcium etc. eating high quality whey and supplementing and despite all of that, I crashed."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser: The Weight Loss Program to Transform Your Body, Health, and Life--Adapted from NBC's Hit Show!","review":"This book is a piece of fluff.

It got me back on track and I have lost 21 lbs in 30 days, by doing the exercises and eating properly. I'm even back to drinking 8-10 glasses of water, just like my track days in high school. I liked the illustrations and photos, the 'before' and 'after' shots, and the recipes. Millions of people watch the NBC show and I can see why.

With the best seller list constantly filled with the latest quick-fix diet gimmicks, this book was refreshing. I will keep it on my bookshelf always as a reminder of what hard work and discipline can do for those interested in being healthy."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser: The Weight Loss Program to Transform Your Body, Health, and Life--Adapted from NBC's Hit Show!","review":"This book is great if you are a fan of the show \\"The Biggest Loser.\\" It has lots of photos and quotes from both season's contestants and the trainers. As for the person complaining it wasn't written by Bob Harper, the blue team's trainer--it says right on the cover of the book that he only wrote the foreword.Most of the nutrition information is pretty sound. They explain things like food labels and how many servings of which food group you should eat every day. They recommend a diet that is: low fat, low sugar, high fiber, and protein adequate.I do not, however, agree that the caloric intake formula is safe. According to the formula, you multiply your current weight by 7 and that's how many calories you need to lose weight. So, following this theory I would only need to consume 875 calories per day. NOT HEALTHY OR SAFE!!Most nutritionists and doctors will tell you never to go below 1200 calories per day, or else your body will go into \\"survival\\" mode because it thinks (rightfully so) that you are starving it. I would say, to figure out how many calories you need for weight loss you are better off multiplying your current weight by 10 or 11(as long as the total is not below 1200).The exercise plan they have in the book is pretty reasonable. They cover things such as doing intervals in your cardio workouts, strength training, and how often to do each.Overall, I would say it is a good book. Very easy to read, and lots of pictures. But, if you are looking for a nutrition plan, try Denise Austin's book:\\"Eat Carbs, Lose Weight\\" instead."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser: The Weight Loss Program to Transform Your Body, Health, and Life--Adapted from NBC's Hit Show!","review":"My husband and I are hooked on the show and decided to have a little competition of our own.

I missed seeing it, but could relate to the many reasons the LOSERS struggled with their eating and weight.Most of the info about losing weight wasn't new to me. It's probably the equivalent of reading 5 or 6 \\"women's\\" magazines. The amount of advice on exercise, nutrition, recipes and inspirational success stories probably equals that.One section did tell how to organize your own Losers group in a neighborhood, school, church or family.

In fact I'd been slacking off big time and was looking for something to make it fun again, or at the very least interesting enough to motivate me again.My girlfriend and I are big fans of the show and are very impressed by the trainers so I bought the book to see what it had to offer. I started doing the circuit training routine as explained in the book, and love it! It's extremely quick - about 15 minutes, 3 days a week - and is also very challenging. After doing it for the first time I immediately could see why my usual combination of cardio and moderate weight training were not getting much results anymore. I'd never felt so worked out and also exhiliarated after exercising!In addition to the 12-week circuit training routine the book explains it's 12-week cardio routine which starts you out at 4 days a week on top of the 3 days of circuit. The chapter on food and diet is outstanding and I've learned a lot about what to eat and how much, and what not to eat. We've changed our grocery shopping to reflect this and can feel the difference already.The bottom line: This workout rocks! I have a hard time only doing it 3 days a week because completing it feels so great!"},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser: The Weight Loss Program to Transform Your Body, Health, and Life--Adapted from NBC's Hit Show!","review":"I absolutely LOVE this book! bob is so sincere in his desire to help people take control of their lives and become healthier.

I started out my 12 week challenge at 322 pounds and am proud to say that at the end of 12 weeks i had lost an amazing 45 pounds!! i am so happy with the work that i have been able to do, i have been able to play basketball, i rode an actual bike for the first time in close to 20 years, i did a yoga class while i was in hawaii-- this program has made me believe that i can do much more than i ever thought i could. i am seeing (from my own results as well as the show) that you really can become healthier, even if you have struggled your whole life.

Two years ago, I moved back to New York from the South and I was unemployed. I was able to have the best summer because of all the museums, parks and suggestions from this book. Just recently, I spent the day in Central Park riding the carousel and watching sea lions do tricks at the park's zoo. I would never have thought of trying that if it were not for this book. It's a bit dated (1991) with mentions of the former World Trade Center but many of the suggestions are relevant. I wish the author would write another with new things to do in New York.

Their stated mission is to take a firmly entrenched belief-- that it is nicotine in tobacco that is the cause of addiction-- and then go back and look again at volumes of data that contributed to that belief. What they present, however, is somewhat shocking. Dar and Frenk suggest the the nicotine addiction hyposthesis, as it is known, is indefensible based on the scientific data they have researched and reviewed (over 700 studies, according to their counts). What is suspected, alternatively, is that other factors are in play. On the macroscopic level, they suggest strong political and social biases play a great part. On the microscopic level, the indiviudal level, they suggest that the social biases actually deceive people into believeing they are chemically addicted to nicotine, thus, paradoxically,making it more difficult to quit.Dar and Frenk's text, and their conclusions, sent a large ripple, if albeit a brief one, through the addiction research community. Most notably, there was a published correspondence between the editors of the journal \\"Addiction\\" and Dar and Frenk regarding their text. The editors at \\"Addiction\\" suspected and alleged that Dar and Frenk received funds from the tobacco industry and utlimately failed to disclose this as a conflict fo interest. Dar and Frenk, conversely argued that their position was based on a review of existing data and not novel research, and that this data was transparent to all in the scientific community. Further, they argued that other researchers failed to disclose possible conflicts of interest, such as those researchers who received funds from major pharmaceutical companies who manufacture smoking cessations products. If this collegial quibbling reveals anything, it supports Dar and Frenk's position that scientific research- at least social science research- is less objective than we would like to believe.This text is a great read for those interested in research, primarily, and the subject matter secondly. The controversial nature of the subject, though, makes it worth reading (if the subject were something less controversial, it could be read as very dry). Since the text was written with the scientific community in mind, it of course will not appeal to a broad audience, which is unfortuante, since the claims that are made are of great social importance with regard to the chasm between what science says, what is true, and how the public tells the difference between the two."},{"Title":"A Critique of Nicotine Addiction (Neurobiological Foundation of Aberrant Behaviors)","review":"This book shows that nicotine is not addictive in spite of what government agencies and prominent scientists have been telling the public for years.

Kipling's original Jungle Book is full of amazing stories of the life of Mowgli as he grows up in the jungle with his animal friends, Baloo (the bear), Bagheera (the panther), and Kaa (the python). Mowgli, whose name means frog, was raised by a family of wolves who teach him the way of the jungle. This is a great set of stories that will be enjoyable by kids and adults alike. A must read."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"The sender kept the book looking very nice and looks brand new.

It is said to be incomplete in this version. If you have not read it that will not bother you. Like me you can buy the full book. I will."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"There were some things I didn't like in the Jungle Book and that was that some people discrimanted at Mowgli because he was a human and not an animal. For example, the big elephants always didn't like Mowgli because he was a human but the little elephant always stayed his friend no matter what. I like the part that the little elephant was his friend but what about the others. His friends see whats on the inside and not what's on the outside.Also we see how the bad guy wants to get the good guy. But it's not only in Jungle Book it's always. This book shows the ignorance of people towards animals. We see how different things show new things in life. For example, you can't be plain and boring all the time, you have to try new things in life to explore. But it's not only about life but also other things.It's sad to notice that sometimes in life, people take advantage of you and in the Jungle Book that is clearly stated. You can see the love between animals and humans and that is what I think is the most important part of the book. The monkeys say thier Mowgli's friend but they aren't there when he needs them only the bear, Baloo is. And I think kids should be read this book becuase, It shows that if you try anything can be overcame. I loved this book, it was one of the most exciting and interesting books I have read in a while."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"This book was many short stories in it; most of the stories are about Mowgli and a few of them are about other animals and their adventures. My favorite one was Rikki-Tikki-Tavi.Since this book is mostly about Mowgli, I should say something about it. Mowgli is a boy who was adopted by wolves and grew up to live with them all his life. He can speak their language and they love him. But Mowgli has one enemy, a lame tiger named Shere Kan. The Mother wolf had saved Mowgli from the evil tiger so Shere Kan hates him. Of course, there's a battle at the end. It is a pretty interesting story or, more like, pretty interesting stories.My favorite story, like I said before, was Rikki-Tikki-Tavi. Rikki, the mongoose who is washed out by a heavy rain and is found by a human boy named Teddy. Rikki is cared for and soon becomes healthy and fit again. One day, Rikki goes out to the large and rather uncultivated garden when he hears two birds chirping sadly. Rikki asks what had happened and one of the birds, named Darzee, tells him that one of their eggs had fallen out and was eaten by the black cobra Nag. At that moment, Nag comes out and tries to kill Rikki by making him pay attention to him while Nagfs wife, Nagaina, creeps up on Rikki. At the last moment, Rikki notices that Nagaina is behind him and he runs away.After that incident, Rikki vows to kill the two evil cobras. One day, Rikki overhears Nag and Nagaina discussing on how to kill him. They plan to break into the house, kill the humans with their deadly bite, and then, kill Rikki. Rikki quickly runs back to the house and waits till nightfall. Soon, he hears a drainpipe rattling and sees Nagfs hooded head creeping towards him with Nagaina right behind him. Rikki hides and waits till Nag comes out. When Nag turns his head towards the beds, Rikki pounces and bites Nagfs head. Rikki is nearly killed then, but the master of the house, Teddyfs father, wakes up from all the noise and shoots Nag.Nagaina, seeing all this, slinks back to her nest. While Rikki regains his strength, he finds out that Nagaina has eggs in her nest and starts searching for her with the aid of Darzeefs wife. When Rikki finds her, Darzeefs wife pretends that her wing is broken and hops around Nagaina. Nagaina moves to kill Darzeefs wife when Rikki runs from behind and takes one of the eggs away. Nagaina turns and tries to strike out at Rikki but Rikki breaks all of the eggs but keeps only one egg unbroken. Rikki threatens Nagaina to get away and Nagaina obeys him. As soon as Nagaina moved away, Rikki breaks the last of the eggs. Rikki and Nagaina battle, both finally falling into Nag and Nagainafs hole.Will Rikki win? Will he survive Nagaina's terrible strenght? If Nagaina wins and is still alive, would she marry again with another black cobra and lay eggs? You'll have to read the book to find out.....This story was sooo fun and exciting. That is mainly my reason for liking this story better than the others. But I'm not saying that the other stories are not fun. Those other stories were really interesting, especially &quot;The White Seal&quot;. This is a book you have to read!"},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"The Jungle Book is the Jewel in the Crown of Kiplings prodigious career.

Namely \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\" and even \\"The White Seal\\"(the latter I didn't know was within \\"The Jungle Book\\"). Chuck Jones really did these stories more justice than even Disney and he should have been given the right to redo the entire collection but, I digress...

My guess is that it's about fifty-fifty. What I'm certain of is that they are worth reading, and they will remain worth reading.However, I prefer the edition in which all the Mowgli stories are in one book and all the other stories are in a second book. The stories not involving Mowgli have no particular order in which they should be read, whereas the Mowgli stories should be read in order, with no other stories between them.When I was five years old, my grandfather died. Among the things he left us was a complete set of Kipling. Where we lived there was no library, and my parents could afford very few books, though they managed to get us the old red Childcraft (it was new then) and Uncle Arthur's Bedtime Stories. But the main result was that from the time I was five until my mother gave the books to a library when I was twelve, I read Kipling constantly. The Jungle Books were among my favorites, even more so than the Just-So Stories. I think all children should be exposed to these stories, and I despise the Disney version which makes the dignified Baloo a clown.I love these books."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"This is a beautiful edition of the wonderful childhood classic.

It is a very special addition to anyone's collection."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"If your only experience with Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book is through the Disney version put that completely out of your head. Besides the title of the book and the name and species of the animals the two have almost nothing in common. Disney took the very kernel of the story and then bled the heart and soul out of it. At least they didn't give Mowgli a cute but endearing sidekick.The Jungle Book is the story of a young Indian boy raised from infancy by the animals of the Asian jungle. The concept shares similarities with Tarzan of the Apes but preceded the Edgar Rice Burroughs classic by nearly 20 years. They differ in that Tarzan was fully an adult and not able to hold full conversations with the animals. Mowgli is capable of having sophisticated discussions with his panther friend Bagheera and bear Baloo about the laws of the Jungle. Kipling doesn't shy away from violence as this is the jungle but even the human characters see more than a few deaths. In the one scene in the Disney version that actually semi relates to the book Mowgli is kidnapped by the Bandar-log (monkeys). In the movie he's rescued by Bagheera and Baloo who bop the Monkey's and send them scampering on their way. In the book Bagheera, Baloo and Kaa the python (yes, in the book Mowgli and Kaa are good friends) slaughter the monkeys. At the end of the fight Kaa utilizes his hypnotic powers, influencing the Monkey's into walking straight into his gapping mouth. It's a rather horrifying scene and the only time where he uses this hypnotic talent.The Jungle Books is a classic that lives up to the name classic. Kipling has a wonderful poetic style that seems to be lost on today's writers. Only about half the stories concern Mowgli but almost all feature conversations between animals. These aren't technically talking animals since they cannot communicate with humans other than Mowgli but they can communicate amongst themselves. In one short story that I particularly enjoyed various domesticated animals in the British military discuss their roles, trying to promote their own importance while diminishing others. Some stories take place outside of India including several in the arctic. The Jungle Books also contains the story of Rikki-Tikki-Tavi which was animated by Chuck Jones. Kipling excels at setting moods and creating compelling dialogue. Mowgli's stories both begin and end the collection of short stories and by the end of the book I was saddened to leave his jungle home. The Jungle Books is classified as for young adults but the beauty and sophistication of the writing would keep just about any adult satisfied. Just make sure you get the actual Kipling book and not a watered down adaptation."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"Rudyard Kipling's mastery of the English language is wound throughout the pages of this book. He takes the reader to another world- the world of a jungle where a jungle boy lives his life amongst the animals found therein. Shere Khan the terrifying tiger, the chatting monkeys, the village people who work in harmony with the animals, the elephants who do as the jungle boy beckons,the beautiful village girl who win's the jungle boy's heart.

If you haven't read this book before you will get confused with the setup of the book on the kindle, especially when you go from chapter to chapter, for example: the author starts the second chapter \\"Hunting-Song of the Seeonee Pack\\" with a poem, the title of the chapter is inserted as though it were part of the story in the first chapter and the poem is formatted like a text without commas or dashes to separate lines.The Story: I re-read this book after about 10 years and was pretty disappointed. The story really wasn't that well written. I feel like the story was very jumpy and did not flow from one idea, sentence or chapter very well. It's interesting to read in comparison to the fluffy Disney adaptation but that is really all I found this useful for. I appreciate that the author continually noted man's follies through the book by making Mowgli extremely hard headed and naive through his youth while commenting on the childish nature of humans in general. If this book was intended as a child's tale when it was written I think it is now out of it's era and the disney version is more up to par.

I had purchased one of Calla Editions' classics (Poe's Tales of Mystery and Imagination)to satisfy my impulse to revisit some of my other childhood reading, and when I saw this edition of Jungle Book among Calla's newer publications, I couldn't resist. I'm glad I didn't. Rikki didn't disappoint my memory of him(though the story seemed a lot shorter with the passage of years). What knocked me out are the incredible color plates by two Edwardian-era brothers--Edward and Maurice Detmold. A little Googling informed me that they'd worked together for a relatively short time before one committed suicide in his twenties; the other followed suit later on. What tragedies! The Detmolds' artistry is stunning. Mowgli is depicted as he always should have been--nude and without shame among his animal protectors, and Mowgli's antagonists--Sher Kan the tiger and Kaa the python are sinister in the Detmolds' potrayal of them. Calla has elected to run some of the color plates across two pages, which adds to their impact. Somebody at Calla must love the look of fine, old hardcover books, because they're making them available at prices within reach--and with the look and feel of the originals."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"I grew up reading and re-reading theses stories.

While the Disney interpretation is fun and enchanting, it makes a dramatic departure from the actual stories and takes considerable creative license in telling just a part of the Kipling stories. Even what we get from Disney falls considerably short of the applicable parts of Kipling's original that Disney used. What? Kaa, the snake, as Mowgli's friend and powerful ally? What? A deeper story of Mowgli's experience as a wolf and his relationships with Mother wolf and Father wolf? Oh yes, much, much more.Kipling's original masterpiece also includes several other wonderful chapters about the continuing adventures of Mowgli and also adds the marvelous tale of \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,\\" the heroic mongoose whose battles with wicked cobras in an Indian garden easily matches Mowgli's showdowns with Shere Khan.The book also includes the tale of \\"The White Seal.\\" This short chapter of \\"The Jungle Book(s)\\" provides a wonderful commentary, in the form of animal parable, on human society, competition, male ego and human pride. Our hero, Kotick, the white seal, through his fearless explorations and his willingness to fight for a dream, changes the minds of his parents, his peers and his society for the better. The invitation to each of us is very clear to find and free the white seal that exists in all of us.Don't get balled up in the notion that \\"The Jungle Book\\" is just for kids. A look beneath Kipling's wonderful prose reveals, like most great children's classics, that the author is using the unintimidating forum of children's literature to speak to kids of all ages with the hope that somehow we'll all finally get it.Buy the book, read it, read it to the kids you know and learn the lesson.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"This is a beautifully designed book and the quality is excellent. Dover seems to have corrected the earlier problem they had with a few of the books in this series, where the text quality was faded and inconsistent in spots. This book has sharp and consistent text and photographs."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"If you were to ask anyone to describe \\"The Jungle Book\\", they would probably take their cue from the widely knownDisney film, and say that it was about a young boy who was raised by wolves in the jungle, mentored by a bear and a panther, and who eventually kills a dangerous tiger. In this they'd be right, but they'd only be describing the first three chapters.The rest of the book is a series of unrelated short-stories about other animals, and which are not necessarily set in the jungle either. I was surprised at this, as although I knew that Disney had extensively reshaped the story, I had no idea that Mowgli's story was such a comparatively small part of the book. To my knowledge, Rudyard Kipling's characters have also featured in an anime series and alive-action film, and in both cases there has been no indication that the source material involved anything other than a boy called Mowgli and his adventures growing up in the jungle.Though I had known that Disney had extensively reworked Kipling's book (as Disney is always accustomed to do with its film adaptations) it was surprising to find out the real scope and beauty of the original collection of stories, and just how deeply the film had permeated public awareness of what the story involved. Here Mowgli's story doesn't end when he rejoins the man-village, Kaa the snake is not an enemy but an ally, Shere Khan is not defeated with fire, but with a well-strategized buffalo stampede, and there are no vultures that sound like The Beatles (though you probably had that figured out on your own). If there's one thing that especially stands out, it's that Mowgli in this story is much more likeable and intelligent than the loathsome little brat of the film.After Mowgli's father is killed in the jungle, he is raised by a wolf-pack as one of their own, called \\"the frog\\" on account of his gangly limbs, and tutored by Baloo the bear and Bagheera the panther in the ways of the Jungle Law: the fair but sometimes harsh edicts that make up life among the animals. Having escaped captivity at an early age, Bagheera in particular is serious about Mowgli's education, hoping that when he finally returns to his own people, he can take knowledge of the Jungle Law with him to teach his fellow man.Yet Mowgli is not easily accepted by either beast or man. Not only are the young wolves threatened by their inability to look him in the eye, but Shere Khan the tiger considers Mowgli his rightful prey. Likewise, the men and women of the village find the boy disconcerting in his habits and strange upbringing, making Mowgli quite a tragic figure in his inability to find a true home among either animals or mankind.The first three chapters of \\"The Jungle Book\\" revolve around Mowgli's story: his upbringing in the first chapter and defeat of Shere Khan in the third, leaving the second (rather oddly, considering it's out of chronological order) to deal with his kidnapping at the hands of the Bandar-log: the Monkey People. Kipling is wonderful at capturing the mystery and atmosphere of the jungle, as well as the fundamental character traits of the animals (the thoughtless monkeys, the malevolent jackal, the wise panther, the complex wolf-pack dynamics). He introduces concepts such as the Jungle Law and the Red Flower, the animal etiquette used in the sharing of hunting grounds and the way in which they address each other, and each species' unique customs and idioms. It's all fascinating stuff, carefully strewn throughout the story to provide a rich background to the world that Mowgli inhabits.The stories that follow are not quite as memorable, but still hold up well, and a couple have been published separately as their own books (\\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\" and \\"Toomai of the Elephants.\\")\\"The White Seal\\" involves the birth of a strange white seal called Kotick who - after witnessing the mass slaughter of his fellows at the hands of sealers - takes it upon himself to traverse the seas in search of a safe beach that has not been discovered by man. It takes several years and a visitation with the mysterious sea-cows before he can finally return to his people and tell them of his discoveries. It's at this point that a certain sense of values dissonance kicks in. Does Kotick convince his fellow seals to follow him to the promised land through his strong leadership and rousing speeches? No, he beats them all to a bloody pulp and insists on them following him once they've all been defeated.Outside of Mowgli's chapters, \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\" is probably the most famous of Kipling's short stories. A mongoose is adopted into the home of an English family living in the jungles of Sugauli cantonment, where it soon learns that a cobra and its mate are planning to kill the little boy in the attempt to drive the family away and reclaim the bungalow for themselves. Aided by other animals in the house and garden, Rikki-Tikki-Tavi prepares to defend his home and family against the snakes with a series of ambushes, tricks and his instinctive fighting abilities. This is definitely the most appealing of the stand-alone stories.\\"Toomai of the Elephants\\" concerns a young Indian boy who works with his father in the rounding-up and breaking-in of elephants for the Indian government. Having grown up among them, he has no fear of the elephants that he can control with simple words and hand gestures. Though his father prefers camp life, it is Toomai's greatest ambition to go hunting for the elephants in the jungle, though he is told that this will only occur when he \\"sees the elephants dance\\" (that is, never).But one night Kala Nag and the other trained elephants are acting strangely, and when several manage to break free of their pickets, Toomai climbs aboard Kala and is taken to mysterious clearing where elephants from miles around have indeed come to dance...In many ways \\"Her Majesty's Servants\\" feels like the odd one out in this collection. More for adults than children (who may find it rather incomprehensible) Kipling provides a first-person narrative account of a British soldier who eavesdrops on a number of animals in service to the army. As each one tries to explain, justify and comprehend their roles in the service of mankind, the listener is struck by the differences between each one, and their understanding of the world they inhabit.Up until this story, Kipling has managed to steer surprisingly clear of imperialism and unfortunate implications; here however, there is mention of \\"savage men and savage horses from somewhere at the back of Asia\\" and \\"a wild king of a very wild country,\\" as well as ending the story on a note of British superiority over the disorganization of its colonies. For these reasons, \\"Her Majesty's Servants\\" doesn't hold up as well as the other stories.As well as the seven short-stories, the book also contains several poems, songs and chants, usually said to be performed by the animals themselves.Just as many readers are unaware thatLittle Womenis composed of two books (Little Women and Good Wives) and that most of Alice's famous adventures took place in the sequelBehind The Looking Glass, it's a relatively little known fact that there was a sequel to the Jungle Book. Known simply asThe Second Jungle Book, Kipling includes several more Mowgli adventures in it, as well as other stand-alone stories and poems. Many editions of \\"The Jungle Book\\" combine both the first and second book into one volume, though it's difficult to tell which is which considering Amazon.com has grouped all the reviews together, regardless of what edition is being discussed. It's hard to know exactly what you'll be getting when you make the order, so keep in mind that it's easy to miss out on the sequel. There is also the risk of buying an abridged version that cuts out stories or tampers with Kipling's use of language (his use of the archaic terms \\"thee\\" and \\"thou\\" in discussions among the animals), so please be careful in deciding which edition to purchase.All in all, \\"The Jungle Book\\" is still a rich and intriguing read, with only a few dated passages. At the very least, it's worth reading in order to get an understanding of the source material as it was before Disney put its stamp on it."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"It's a very good book, and as far as I can tell it's very close to the original which was apparently a problem with some of the other printings."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"This is amazing.

Mowgli is raised in the jungle by the animals and is educated in the laws and ways of the various jungle dwellers. Loyalty, trust, honor, honesty, and courage are but a few of the values championed in these books. The Jungle Books also remind us that childhood doesn't last forever, and eventually we all must leave it behind to assume greater responsibility in the world. As Kaa the Python said in the book &quot;Having cast the skin, we may not creep into it afresh.&quot; These novels are pure magic."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"Classic old school story telling. Definitely aspects of this book have aged; Kipling was steeped in the age of the Great British Empire, especially the Raj (India). However in some ways that can be interesting as it provides an unintended glimpse at how attitudes and points of view have changed i.e. Kipling's unconsciously blithe racism which often comes across as patronisingly affectionate. Kipling was, after all, a product of his age. Much of the story telling is truly calssic, beautifully written and a great read (especially the Mowgli stories)."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"Got this book for my stepdaughter, i consider it a classic, so i want her to start reading an collecting this type of books... a must have in my opinion!"},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"This is a very amazing book anyone who hasnt already should definantly read it.

Children and animals are permanent companions and The Jungle Book is as fresh in the 21st century as it was in the 19th. From a human child reared in the jungle by animals to a domesticated animal who saves his people, the book brings both joy and understanding.

She liked it, so I guess its a great book."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"In the deep jungle of India there was a little boy name Mowgli. Mowgli is an Indian infant who is lost in the jungle after Shere Khan (the tiger) kills his family. Mowgli was raised by a pack of wolves and is taught the laws of life in the jungle. His closest friends were Baloo, (the bear) and Bagheera (sleek black panther). Mowgli learns how to speak to the animals his childhood seems pleasant. Shere Khan is a dangerous tiger that is seeking revenge on Mowgli. Shere Khan is the enemy and is feared among all of the animals in the jungle. Mowgli was taught there was a certain place in the jungle that he was forbidden to go to. Bagheera and Baloo are trying to teach Mowgli the Laws of the Jungle for his own good. They are having a difficult time with him because he is small and young. Bagheera is more concerned with Mowgli being on his own because he has not learned how to kill his own food. And they are worried that Shere Khan will come after Mowgli and try to kill him. Riki-tiki-tavi is a mongoose, a hunter, and a great fighter. Riki-tiki fought anything that came in his way, but when Nag and Nagaina (the cobra couple) approached him it was different. Rikki-tikki felt his eyes growing red and hot (when a mongoose's eyes grow red, he is angry), and he sat back on his tail and hind legs like a little kangaroo, and looked all round him, and chattered with rage. But Nag and Nagaina had disappeared into the grass.I really enjoyed reading The Jungle Book. Kippling had a great imagination, especially since Mowgli could talk to animals. I thought the characters were shown though their actions throughout the book. Rikki Tikki Tavi has always seemed to me to be one of the great heroes in all of literature."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"I have to say, I like Disney's version of Mowgli's story better. This story is good, and has some humor, but it is defiantly harsher, especially the second part. Just in case you didn't already relies this, this book contains many stories, including the story of the white seal, which I like better. As for the tale of Riki-Tiki-Tovi, I liked some parts of it, but as a kid especially, I didn't like all the snakes in it. Tumi of the Elephants is a bit strange but Her Majesty's Servants is much better. Being interested in armies, I found it to be fascinating as well as funny. Perhaps if you are not interested in armies you would not find it to be so good, but if you like to wonder what animals would say if they could talk then you still might. In fact, the whole book is primarily on talking animals, so if you like reading about that, this is the book for you! Even if you don't, you should probably still read it, it's being a classic. However, if you're just looking to read something by Kipling then you should read Kim instead; it's much better."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"Ms. Burns brings little dynamism to her reading.

Real life is illustrated here, not white washed Hollywood stories where nothing really dies but the interaction between predator and prey is ever present.Kipling in today's world is not something allowed in schools, more the pity.

Mowgli, a human child in India, is rescued by wolves and raised by them with wolf brothers and sisters by wolf parents, after an evil lame tiger chased away his human parents. The tiger who not only kills humans wants to control the wolf pact. He tells the wolves insistently that Mowgli belongs to him. Mowgli has many adventures among the wolves and later among humans. Once, for instance, he was captured when he was ten or eleven years old by monkeys, who are portrayed as stupid forgetful creatures in the book. He is saved during a lengthy battle by Bagheera the black panther who loves him and by Baloo the bear that is his instructor, as well as the python Kaa who respects him. Mowgli leaves the jungle and goes to live in the human village. He thinks that people act and think strangely, speak foolishly, and believe that they can change things, which Mowgli knows cannot be changed. These are just some of Mowgli's many adventures. The book also contains exploits by many different animals, such as the story of the white seal that saves other seals from being killed by men for their skins, the mongoose who rescues a family from husband and wife cobras, and a boy who sees elephants dance."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"Everyone knows this is one of the most amazing books of all time, so I'm not going to waste your time by reviewing the stories.

The book consists of 7 short stories, separated by seven poems. The first three stories involve Mowgli, but the other four stories are not part of that series, nor do they all take place in the same jungle or any jungle at all. What these stories do have in common is the anthropomorphizing of animals as characters in these stories. As with all fables, these stories impart a moral message to the reader.\\"Mowgli's Brothers\\" is the first story in the book and was originally published in January of 1894 in \\"St. Nicholas Magazine\\". The story is about Mowgli being adopted by the wolf family which then raises him. With Shere Khan hunting in their area of the jungle, the Father Wolf (Akela) and the mother (Raksha) find and take in a human baby. At the wolf council, Baloo speaks for the cub, and Bagheera buys his life with a fresh kill. As time passes, Shere Khan turns most of the wolves against Mowgli, and they plot to overthrow Akela as the leader. Mowgli is then sent away from the wolves, vowing to return with Shere Khan's hide. This story is followed by the \\"Hunting-Song of the Seeonee Pack\\".\\"Kaa's Hunting\\" is a short study from March-April of 1894. It takes place sometime during the period covered in \\"Mowgli's Brothers\\", though it isn't mentioned in that story. It is a story about Mowgli's abduction by monkees, a.k.a the Bandar-log. Baloo and Bagheera, rescue Mowgli with the aid of Kaa. This story is followed by the \\"Road Song of the Bandar-Log\\".\\"Tiger! Tiger!\\" was a short story published in February of 1894 in magazines before being published in this collection. This covers the confrontation between Mowgli and Shere Khan. Mowgli has been kicked out of the jungle and has been adopted by a couple who believe he is Nathoo, the child that they lost. Mowgli tries to fit in, but he alienates himself from the others because he doesn't accept their misconceptions about the jungle. Shere Khan returns and is plotting to kill Mowgli, but he is warned by one of his wolf friends (Grey Brother) whom he goes to visit regularly. Mowgli comes up with a plan to kill Shere Khan, but when successful he gets into an argument with Buldeo, the hunger. Buldeo tries to take Shere Khan's skin, but Mowgli refuses to give it to him, so Buldeo turns the entire village against him and Mowgli finds himself an outcast of both the jungle and the village. This story is followed by \\"Mowgli's Song\\".\\"The White Seal\\" is a short story published in August of 1893. The story is about Kotick, a rare white-furred seal who spends his life searching for a home where seals will not be hunted by humans. He is isolated from the other seals by his goal, but he finally discovers a place that the Sea Cows know which is free from man. This story is followed by \\"Lukannon\\".\\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\" is a story from November of 1893. In this story an English family save a young mongoose (Rikki Tikki) who becomes their pet. Rikki Tikki first saves the families young boy Teddy from a dust brown snakeling. Rikki Tikki takes to patrolling the house while the family sleeps, and it is during this that he is warned by Chuchundra that there are two cobras (Nag and Nagaina) that are planning to kill the family. Rikki Tikki first takes on Nag, waking the father who kills Nag. Nagaina then swears vengeance, but Rikki Tikki gets help from Darzee (a tailor bird) and locates Nagainaj's nest and then uses the eggs to distract Nagaina to save Teddy again. This story is followed by \\"Darzee's Chant\\".\\"Toomai of the Elephants\\" is a short story from the December of 1893. In this story little Toomai is told that he cannot be an elephant handler unless he sees the dance of the elephants. When the great elephant Kala Nag hears the call of the elephant from far off in the jungle, he goes to find the elephants, taking little Toomai with him. This story is followed y \\"Shiv and the Grasshopper\\".\\"Her Majesty's Servants\\" was originally published in March of 1894. This story is about the various animals used to support Her Majesty's armed forces in India. The animals discuss their roles in the army, each taking pride in the function they perform. This is followed by \\"Parade-Song of the Camp Animals\\" which closes out the book.This is a good collection of short stories, though there is a definite variability in the quality, and of course they don't all take place in the jungle. Rudyard Kipling wrote poems, short stories, and novels. Having lived in India, England, and the United States, and also spent a fair amount of time in South Africa. He drew on the rich cultural history that he enjoyed to create some wonderful tales. He remains one of the best known writers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \\"The Jungle Book\\" is one of his best known works, though most know it through films which do not accurately represent the stories within. It blends his short fiction with some of his poems, but I find it a bit too uneven to give it five-stars."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"This is the book to get-- Kipling's original.

It may be Kipling's defining juvenile book, in part because it's written for a slightly older audience thanJust So Stories, with more violence and a more mature level of language (the Mowgli stories particularly feature dialogue written in \\"the vernacular,\\" a rather formal kind of speech used by native speakers in India).Most of the 15 stories are set in the Subcontinet, where Kipling was born and to which he returned as a man; the rest (\\"The White Seal,\\" \\"Quiquern\\") take place in the Far North. Eight feature Mowgli (Hindi for \\"frog\\"), a gypsy child whose parents were frightened off by Shere Khan, the lame tiger, leaving him to be rescued and adopted by a pair of wolves. He is raised in the jungle (\\"Mowgli's Brothers,\\" \\"Kaa's Hunting,\\" \\"How Fear Came\\"), learning its laws and speaking the languages of its creatures, until at the age of 10 he is caught up in a sort of palace coup engineered by the tiger and forced to leave his pack. He stays among humans for four months, kills Shere Khan (\\"Tiger! Tiger!\\"), is driven out by the villagers and ultimately pays them back in spades (\\"Letting in the Jungle\\"), then returns to the wolves, has various further adventures (\\"The King's Ankus\\"), and ultimately saves the pack from invading dholes (\\"Red Dog\\") before his human instincts at last him force him back to his own kind (\\"The Spring Running,\\" which invaribaly makes me tear up). (If you want to find out what happened to him afterward, read \\"In the Rukh,\\" which can be found inMany Inventions..) Featuring such creatures as Mother and Father Wolf, Gray Brother (the oldest of their pups), Baghera the Black Panther, Baloo the brown bear, Kaa the Rock Python, Hathi the elephant, Chil the kite, and Akela, the Lone Wolf who leads Mowgli's pack for years, these stories are about as far from the Disney version as anything you can imagine, and to my mind far superior. (I wish some studio would take them up as Harry Potter was, and do them accurately: the animatronics and CGI that gave us such caracters as the ice-bears inThe Golden Compass (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)and the farm animals inMist: The Tale of a Sheepdog PuppyandBabe (Widescreen Special Edition)would bring them to life as never before.)\\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\" tells the story of a young mongoose taken into a human home and how he fights a pair of cobras in the garden. \\"Toomai of the Elephants\\" features Little Toomai, whose forebears for three generations have been the mahouts of Kala Nag, the great work elephant, and how his friendship with the pachyderm leads him to see \\"the sight that never man saw,\\" the elephants' dance. \\"The Miracle of Purun Baghat\\" is about a high-ranking native official who forsakes position and honors to become a mendicant holy man, and how he saves a tiny hill village from a catastrophic landslide. In \\"The Undertakers,\\" a man-eating crocodile, a jackal, and an adjutant-stork discuss the vagaries of humanity on a sandbar. \\"Her Majesty's Servants,\\" a story particularly suitable for reading in a multicultural society like that of the U.S., eavesdrops on the conversation between a troop-horse, two mules, a baggage-camel, and a pair of gun-bullocks on the night before a great troop review. In \\"The White Seal,\\" Kotick, a fur-seal born snow-white, sets out on a quest to find a place where his kind will be safe from human fur-hunters. \\"Quiquern\\" tells of a young Inuit hunter and how he and his dog save his people in a time of starvation.These stories should probably be read aloud first, since their rather formal language will make them difficult for the younger independent reader to follow, particularly in these days of dumbed-down readers (although the homeschooled may not have as much trouble). Kids of 11 or 12 should be able to read them alone. Despite Kipling's occasional imperialistic chauvinism (hardly unique to him in that time and place), he had a real knowledge of India, its creatures, and its people, and he loved them all, with an intensity that comes through in every tale; and his language, as well as his characters', often approaches the poetic (he was, after all, a noted and prolific poet aswell as a fictioneer). No English-speaking child should reach his teens without coming to know the book."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"This is a classic tale of course, the thing I like about this copy is the quality for the price. Nice cover, not a lot of illustrations, but a few line drawings and they are nice - I plan to buy other classics from this publisher."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"This book is great! If you are looking for the Disney version of the book ,you won't find it here, but this is alot better!"},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"No this is not your Disney movie - Kipling wrote a fantastic series of short stories, only a few of which include Mowgli. Baloo is not a lazy idiot, Kaa is not a bad guy, SherKahn is killed rather then run off, the wolves are not always the noble good guys... this is VERY different then our cotton candy Disney film. And so much more enjoyable for it.Also included are the tales of Rikki Tikki Tavi, the Elephant Dance, and the White Seal. I would have to say that my favorite is Rikki Tikki Tavi, he's just so loveable and wonderful. There is a sense of magic in Kiplings animals, every reader will find themselves dreaming of being raised by wolves and taught the law of the jungle by Baloo.I know that this was written as a children's book - but I have a hard time believing that my 11 year old son would be able to read and enjoy it, the beauty of the language will be lost on many of the younger readers who are used to the forward speaking newer YA books. But I would assume that by middle school they should be able to fully enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"Though Walt Disney and Enid Blyton are my fav picks for children, The Jungle Book is a nicer read. Mowgli is just a loving character and as an Indian version of the Jungle Book is a fav among kids in Hindi, this is a sure pick for all children. Rudyard Kipling takes kids for a ride to an adventure with thrills and fantasies - it all depends on the taste and choice of read. However, I recommend this book as this is fun read and kids in my library too, love to read and watch The Jungle Book.

Of course this is a great story, but the original Kipling version is very hard to understand for younger readers (or listeners in this case). I found myself having to go back and explain each paragraph or page to make sure my son (who is fairly bright) was following along. For an adult to read for her/his self, I am sure it would be great.

I've read many of these stories to my daughter, so I know the difficulty of catching Kipling's rhythm and phrasing. Flo Gibson does an excellent job, with clear diction, well paced delivery and competent \\"acting\\" of the various characters. She pronounces the character's names as attributed to Kipling in the notes of my faithful Penguin edition. Even then, my 10 year old daughter had difficulty with some of the phrasing, and we paused the CD's as we drove across the country to discuss and clarify. However, I attribute this difficulty to the richness of Kipling's text, which my daughter is not used to - yet.In short, Flo Gibson uses her talents to deliver Kipling's wonderful stories. I recommend this unabridged audio edition."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"Each one of my two wonderful late husbands had the highest moral character and had highly successful careers.

It was one of the first books I read when I graduated to chapter books and even today it remains a favorite. I liked it then, as I like it now, because unlike so many modern children's books it doesn't water down the story or dumb down the plotline. I felt as if I wasn't being talked down to like in so many other children's/young adult books and to me that was important. It's somewhat misanthropic (when Mowgli is thrown out of the village) but I think it does have more redeeming values then most. I am proud to have a copy of these stories sitting eloquently on a book shelf where no other Children's/Young Adult books keep it company. I think even if you're an adult, if you've never read this book it's a must! The Disney movie made loosely, extremely loosely, on Mowgli's adventures always makes me want to scream. It's horribly tepid and completely butchered but I guess that's where I learned movies rarely live up to the grandness of books."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"I recently bought this book while browsing a bookstore. For the past two weeks my 4-year old son and I have sat snuggled up reading one or two chapters at bedtime (we're on our second time through now). Although I read to him daily, this is the first \\"chapter book\\" that I've read to him. He has been fully engaged and followed the story, asking questions about the jungle, and learning words he's never heard before. He's asked questions about Mowgli and Baloo during breakfast and played like a panther at preschool. The drawings are simple and I think having one picture for every page of text has been helpful in holding his attention.While I love this book, it is very condensed from the original and lacks the vivid descriptions and insight to the characters that the original provides. But that is also part of why I purchased this version... my son isn't old enough to understand much of Kipling's old English grammar and complex thought. In a few years, when my son is older, I'll read the original with him but for now, this is perfect for his attention span and level of understanding."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"This book was good because it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.

I like the way Rudyard Kipling has the animals talk. The main character in the story is a boy named Mowgli. Mowgli was abandoned by his mother and father and raised by wolves. I thinkMowgli is the perfect character for the story because he is brave, smart, and kind.The part I disliked the most in the story is when they keep going to the council rock.

The most familiar are the Mowgli tales, basis for the very good Disney movie. Mowgli is an Indian infant who is lost in the jungle after Shere Khan (the tiger) kills his family. Bagheera (the black panther) places him with a wolf family that has a newborn litter. Mowgli's new &quot;parents&quot; and Bagheera and Baloo (the brown bear) sponsor him for membership in the Wolf Pack and, much to Shere Khan's chagrin, he is admitted. Mowgli is raised according to Jungle Law, but all the while Shere Khan is plotting his revenge and ingratiating himself with the younger wolves. Eventually, he leads a rebellion against Akela, the pack's aging leader and attacks Mowgli, who beats him away with a burning firebrand. In these and the several other Mowgli stories--there are some prequels--Kipling strikes a nice balance between anthropomorphizing the animals and understanding Mowgli's natural superiority.Also appearing in this collection is a story I've loved since I first saw the Classic Cartoon version--Rikki Tikki Tavi. It tells the story of an intrepid young mongoose and his life or death battle to protect an Indian villa from a couple of particularly unpleasant cobras. Rikki Tikki Tavi has always seemed to me to be one of the great heroes in all of literature.These are great stories for young and old. For folks who worry about Kipling's potentially imperialist, racist or racialist overtones (see review), rest assured, these tales are free of such themes. They offer an excellent opportunity to introduce kids to the work of a true master storyteller.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"I have never seen The Jungle Book movie, I just wanted to understand a bit of what might have captured the imagination of people 100 years ago (and how they might have written stories). The Jungle Book is not a happy story about people bopping around in the jungle, it is about life and death and honour and character and discipline in a pitiless world. Because it is written in a dense style by Rudyard Kipling almost 120 years ago, it is not easy to follow, but it does tell in eight chapters and eight poems interesting tales of the deep jungle. First of all it tells the tale of Mowgli, how he's rescued from Shere Khan the tiger by Mother Wolf, and championed by Akela, and then it goes into his education, his abduction by the lawless monkey tribes, his confrontation with the Jungle council, his re-emergence into human society, and his final revenge on Shere Khan. The story continues on The Jungle Book 2, but we also have non-Mowgli stories: the amazing tale of Riki-Tiki-Tavi (which I saw once on TV as a non-Mowgli Jungle Book animation), as well as a really wonderful story of a white seal trying to save his seal-mates from perpetual exploitation and hunting from the nearby Russian communities.Some of the stories are not so great - I didn't really understand the point of \\"Toomai of the Elephants\\" or \\"Her Majesty's Servants\\", but on the whole it was a great, if somewhat incomprehensible, book."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"Free is good but some quality control would have been nice.As it is, chapters and even complete stories flow over in each other without any non-literal clue."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"The Jungle Book is a classic we all know, however Robert Ingpen's illustrations bring this book alive.

I recommend this to any parent looking for a good book to read to their children or to have their kids read. Kipling is a great author and after doing a report on him and reading some of his other works I recommend those as well, especially A White Man's Burden.

Alas, Dover hasn't manufactured paperbacks that way in years, but this clothbound edition looks every bit as durable as it is beautiful. Many will find it an attractive alternative to the Borzoi Book (Everyman's Library) published by Knopf; the paper is finer, and the illustrations (by the Detmold brothers) are reproduced in full color. This book is not, however, a facsimile reprint of the Macmillan edition of 1908. As the publisher's note explains, the plates have been \\"reproduced from an extremely scarce, original portfolio of watercolors, and have never before appeared on this scale in book form.\\" From these remarks one gathers that the illustrations are larger here than in the 1908 edition, some of them spread across two pages. Unfortunately, the binding (unlike that of the Knopf edition) is too firm for the open book to lie flat, so several of these two-page presentations (notably that of Kaa on pages 64-65) are spoiled by the heavy fold down the center. Moreover, in spite of the \\"elegant new type design and many additional decorative elements,\\" it is annoying to find Kipling's verses centered line by line instead of systematically indented according to their rhyme schemes. One final note: the text appears to be that of the first American edition, not the more established English edition."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"Am vazut in copilarie filmul de desene animate, pe urma am citit carte tradusa in limba romana, si acum ma bucur citind cartea in limba engleza.

The stories are a wonderful length for read alouds. The Jungle Book is, of course, a classic and not in need of a review; however, if your only exposure to the Jungle Book is Disney, please give this a try. I wanted to commend Sterling Publishers on making a quality, affordable edition of this and other classics. The paper quality was nice, not thin or translucent.

Over the years I have purchased many copies of each as presents. Both can be difficult to find in versions unaltered from the original. I have found this to be particularly true in the case of The Jungle Book. Some folks just don't seem to get that Kipling had a pretty good handle on what he was doing. One does not tamper with a Masterpiece.This version is the real thing. It reads word for word the same as the tattered, 40-year-old copy that I first read when I was eight years old. Add illustrations by Robert Ingpen that faithfully capture the emotion of the story and you have a real winner.

I like everything about it, the font type, the illustrations, and the writing is, well... Rudyard Kipling. Beautiful, rich, provocative language that unleashes a child's imagination. My son and I devoured it in a few nights and after we were done it led to a really deep discussion on the differences with the Disney's version. It was a welcomed reminder that we can understimate both our children's capacity to digest the classics and their appeal to them."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"This is undoubtedly a beautiful book, but it should definitely be noted that it only contains the first half of Mowgli's story (i.e., through Shere Khan chapter only) - the text seems unabridged that far, but parts of both Jungle Books are missing - which I for one was misled about from other review(s)."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"Legends are made from legends. Rudyard Kipling dug deep into the tales of the jungle from his years living in India, and drew from them the kinds of stories that live forever.\\"The Jungle Book\\" is more than how Mowgli, the man cub, learns to live and survive amongst enemies like Shere Khan. The intense mongoose vs cobra \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,\\" also well-known, is here, as are several lesser-known and unrelated adventures.Richly written, with details and contexts unfamiliar to Western readers, \\"The Jungle Book\\" lifts imagination and language beautifully. Poetic, and written in a literary style, it shines above most modern prose.This is the stuff of afternoon stories read to older boys and girls. Young teens will while away rainy evenings, unwilling to part until finished. Sometimes scary and always exciting, Kipling also uses the book to teach lessons much greater than a jungle in India.When chapters were first read to me many years ago, I listened gawk-eyed, listening intently for as long as my mother would read. I read it with different eyes now, but no less a young boy as I worry how Baloo will handle the Bandar-Log monkeys.It isn't perfect. A few scientific details are fudged (wolf pack breeding structure, for example), but nothing that matters in the big picture. Kipling will have you in the palm of his hand, even though it was first published over 100 years ago.May \\"The Jungle Book\\" by Rudyard Kipling be as amazing to you as it has been to me.--Brockeim"},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"I own several titles in the Calla Editions' series of books, i.e.East of the Sun and West of the Moon: Old Tales from the North (Calla Editions),Tales of Mystery and Imagination (Calla Editions),Stories from Hans Christian Andersen (Calla Editions), andThe Knave of Hearts (Calla Editions). They are all of superior quality in terms of binding, paper, as well as illustrations. The book is larger than a regular hardcover, and this particular title \\"The Jungle Book\\" weighs about two pounds. This 2010 Calla edition is a republication of the edition originally published by Macmillan and Co. in 1908. The paper is of heavy stock, one can literally feel the heft of each page! The color of the paper is ivory (or something close to it), and it is bound in pearl linen. The font used is Kennerley Old Style and Michelangelo, and apart from decorative borders on the pages, the highlight of this book is the 16 color plates, some in two-page spreads by twin brother artists Edward and Maurice Detmold.According to the information provided within the book, these illustrations are \\"reproduced from an extremely scarce, original portfolio of watercolors, and have never before appeared on this scale in book form.\\" I believe it! They are truly beautiful and exquisite, and incredibly detailed, almost life-like. There is one illustration featuring an unclothed Mowgli standing alongside the Lone Wolf, and the rich earthy tones in the picture are brilliantly depicted. There's another illustration (two-page spread) titled The \\"Council Rock\\" which has a magnificent Bagheera and I swear the glint in his eye appears very real!The depiction of Kaa the Python is also stunning.

I am reading the ORIGINALtext JB to my eight year old son (for over a week now),and he's not once indicated that the language puzzleshim.

These stories are great reads, enjoyable by all ages.Fans of the movie will find a more complex work here -- not \\"darker,\\" but more ambiguous; the three stories from this collection that have generally been adapted into other media, and that most readers think of when they think of \\"The Jungle Book\\", focus on outcast human infant, Mowgli, who is abandoned as an infant in the jungle and raised by wolves, and primarily tell the story of his search for a \\"place\\" within the wolf pack, the Jungle, and the human world, and his outsider status in all three realms. Perhaps because they focus almost entirely on the Indian jungle, or perhaps because they're aimed at children, these stories are also largely free of the undertone (overtone?) of imperialism that runs through much of Kipling's work for adults.It has, of course, been massively influential on later writers, from Edgar Rice Burrough's _Tarzan_ to Neil Gaiman's _The Graveyard Book_. The various morals contained within the \\"Mowgli\\" stories were also taken as a motivational book within the Scouting movement (reading this helped me understand why I had to memorize \\"Akela\\" when I was a cub scout).While only three stories in this collection focus on Mowgli, Kipling did write a second collection, \\"The Second Jungle Book,\\" which is almost entirely comprised of Mowgli stories, and which I would highly recommend if you like these tales. If you want to read more of Kipling's work for adults, I'd recommend either \\"The Man Who Would be King\\" or the short story collection \\"Plain Tales from the Hills,\\" both of which should be available for free online.As to formatting of this kindle edition: there are blocks of Kipling's poetry in between the stories, some of which was difficult to read as the formatting had not carried over well to this Kindle edition. Not a critical issue, but Kipling's poetry is excellent and the formatting errors were annoying."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"I evaluated three series of abridged/paraphrased classics: Great Illustrated Classics, Stepping Stones, and Classic Starts. I specifically read Treasure Island in all three versions, but also evaluated the Jungle Book and other stories in at least two of the versions.The Classic Starts version of the Jungle Book and other stories is the most complex in language and sentence structure. It's not as easy for a beginning reader to read as Stepping Stones or Great Illustrated Classics, but offers a much better story by virtue of more adjectives, adverbs and clauses in the sentence structure.With these paraphrased versions, there is always the dilemma one faces: whether to wait until the genuine, original story is accessible or risk turning the reader off with a poor paraphrase that lacks the vibrancy of the real thing, but possibly gain the enjoyment of a classic gem much earlier than the original text would afford. In the case of the Jungle Book in particular, you also have the movie. I imagine it would be hard to follow the real story after the movie. I'm glad my kids will have heard Kiplings version before Disney's.Personally, I bought the books intending to read to my kingergarten age children, rather than have them read. We found the Classic Starts to have by far the best versions of the stories, notwithstanding the originals which are just too long for us, in language that is hard to be understood. Since I am reading them aloud, we've forgone the simplest versions which are perhaps a bit too butchered to really stand out as the excellent stories the originals gained a reputation for. I feel that the Classic Starts are rich enough that they easily match original versions of simpler tales like The Little House on the Prarie or Charlotte's Web.So far, with the children, we finished Call of the Wild, are half-way through the Jungle Book, and started Treasure Island. Then we're on to The Odyssey, Moby Dick and Tom Sawyer. Move over Pippi Longstockings and Amelia Bedelia! Previously we've read books like those of Beverly Cleary, the Little House series, Milne's Pooh, and Horrible Harry, besides hundreds of basically picture books (think Virginia Lee Burton, H. A. Rey etc.) The classics have a little bolder story lines, and these abridged series make them more accessible."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"Legends are made from legends. Rudyard Kipling dug deep into the tales of the jungle from his years living in India, and drew from them the kinds of stories that live forever.\\"The Jungle Book\\" is more than how Mowgli, the man cub, learns to live and survive amongst enemies like Shere Khan. The intense mongoose vs cobra \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,\\" also well-known, is here, as are several lesser-known and unrelated adventures.Richly written, with details and contexts unfamiliar to Western readers, \\"The Jungle Book\\" lifts imagination and language beautifully. Poetic, and written in a literary style, it shines above most modern prose.This is the stuff of afternoon stories read to older boys and girls. Young teens will while away rainy evenings, unwilling to part until finished. Sometimes scary and always exciting, Kipling also uses the book to teach lessons much greater than a jungle in India.When chapters were first read to me many years ago, I listened gawk-eyed, listening intently for as long as my mother would read. I read it with different eyes now, but no less a young boy as I worry how Baloo will handle the Bandar-Log monkeys.It isn't perfect. A few scientific details are fudged (wolf pack breeding structure, for example), but nothing that matters in the big picture. Kipling will have you in the palm of his hand, even though it was first published over 100 years ago.May \\"The Jungle Book\\" by Rudyard Kipling be as amazing to you as it has been to me.--Brockeim"},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"I bought this as a gift for my daughter to part of a set for her birthday.

But one animal that hates him is a tiger; because he thinks some day he will be hunter. After the tiger tries to kill the boy the boy goes and live with humans.

It is about an Indian infant called Mowgli who is lost in the jungle, but then was placed in a wolf family. He grows up in the jungle therefore having no manners or any sense of human life. The Jungle Book show how friends can always be mad but then they come around. And they will always be there for you no matter what, if not then they aren't true friends. There is great ambition in Mowgli.His story is great for all ages. A lot of the characters are explained in detail and you grow to actually love the animals. I think all kids should have read the book rather than see the movie becuase the book is much better.Some of the values showed in this book are loyalty, trust honor, and courage. This book is valued by many children and it should be read to them as young kids to also expand their imagination. I think that this book was better than a lot of the books that Kipling has written before like &quot;Rikki-tikki-tavi&quot; or &quot;Kim&quot;.

But for the older people, I think you should read this book."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"I looked foward to reading the Jungle Book, after reading Kim and seeing how well Kipling wrote. And in the Jungle Book I found absolutely nothing, besides what I venture to mention, that slights my opinion of the quality of Rudyard Kipling's writing. I felt that in this book Kiplng was trying to exercise a mode of writing that was supposed to be at an elementary level, and therefor more suitable for children. I claim the same excuse for the length of the book. Yet I feel that Kipling's mode was not the best that could have been chosen. Instead, the book seemed to have a choppy quality, let me explain myself by saying that one chapter was used on a small event in Mowgli's life, and then several years were skipped, so the contents of the next chapter forced you to use an element of brain power for comprehension. I do not know the reader's, nor the general public's, feelings toward this use of brain power, I only know mine, which are that this usage distracts my from the story, and slightly takes me away from the spell any good book ought to have. I do not for one minute say that any of the contents of the book, extracting to the very singular word, were not put down without great thought, creativity, and originality, which all together produce a degree of brilliance. That degree, however, may alter, and I feel that although the brilliance is most definately there, it is not at it's utmost level. I find no fault of that with the author, except that of Kipling's trying to overtake a goal so difficult even he, with all his brilliance, was not able to peform to allow it to be rated as high as five stars. I do, though, sincerely applaud Rudyard Kipling's, original and, absolutely, in every possible way, amazing work, although I feel it to contain too many small faults to call it equal to its extroadinary reputation. I place the fault of it's too high reputaton sincerely upon those who read the book without knowlegde of it beforehand."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"It depicted the culture and feelings of different animals standing on their sides.

While their message is important, the same quality writing found with the previously was lacking in the rest. Kipling is a great author and I look forward to reading more, but hope they are more along the lines of Mowgli's adventures and less from seals looking for safety from humans."},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","review":"While I admire Disney's animation (and am looking forward to their Hamlet-ish The Lion King), I usually gripe about the changes they make in their movies from their source material. All one has to do is read the original Pinocchio, Peter Pan, or, supposedly, Bambi, to berate them for destroying classics. I probably should be bothered as well by their Jungle Book, except that I think that it was one of the cases where the marriage of animation, story and music achieves more than the original. Without the source material, it would be nothing, of course, but the wonderful songs (who can forget \\"Bare Necessities,\\" \\"Trust in Me,\\" or \\"I Wanna Be Like You\\"?) and the structure that turned Kipling's short tales into a two-hour movie create a gestalt that I'm not sure Kipling's tales do by themselves. This is probably sacrilege to the ears of the true Kipling fan, but I'm nothing if not opinionated.The stories that make up the Jungle Book aren't solely about Mowgli, though, and it's the others, especially \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,\\" that make this a definate must have."},{"Title":"Approaching Poetry: Perspectives and Responses","review":"I've been writing poetry for almost ten years. But I really shouldn't count the years before I was taught with this book, mainly because what I wrote then was preconceived, melodramatic, first-draft garbage. The text systemically breaks down poetry into the smallest unit of sound, while also holistically analyzing it with examples and questions that really allow the student to reflect on the material. The end result is liberation, and not what someone might expect from a book that \\"teaches\\" you. No longer will you set out to write the greatest poem ever. You will simply write, and if you learned anything from the book, your writing will automatically be astounding, especially if you compare it to your previous works.I've read many introductory books on poetry.

This is not to say that the word is incorrect, but as I am from a Castillian Spanish background, it would not be my first choice... The only other \\"negative\\" is that if you are familiar with the English version, you will question why the Spanish version has chosen the equivalent of \\"Awake\\" and \\"Asleep\\" in the text, rather than \\"Day\\" and \\"Night\\" (my son is so familiar with the English version that when we first came to that page in the Spanish version, he immediatedly said, \\"Day\\" and \\"Night\\" - I had to explain that the picture could be interpreted to mean both things!).Overall I would recommend this book for those people interested in having their preschoolers learn some Spanish."},{"Title":"Opuestos (Opposites) (Spanish Edition)","review":"This is WONDERFUL.

In \\"Edge of the Sea\\" she describes seashores, the environment and how it defines the animals and plants that a visitor will see. She concentrates on America's East Coast. The text left me with a longing to be there. Where modern writers would use pictures, Carson uses words. This book would be good (4 stars) for anyone who enjoys written imagery. If you already love the sea then it deserves 5."},{"Title":"The Edge of the Sea","review":"Having never heard of Rachel Carson except in relation to &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, I was pleasantly surprised on first reading her writing in this book by the masterly and near-poetic elegance of her prose. Written in the 1950s, before nature documentaries allowed most of us to see the wonders of marine life with our own eyes, Carson's ability to introduce those wonders to us through evocatively-written description alone (with occasional illustrations) remains truly amazing. The problem is that a generation raised on visual stimuli would probably find it quite difficult to sustain enough patience to go through the whole book, since it does make substantial demands on one's sense of imagination. I found myself struggling by the time I had finished two chapters - even though each chapter is generally about a different kind of seashore (rock, sand, or coral reef), trying to visualise one fascinating organism after another just got rather tedious and confusing. My recommendation to other readers would be to maximise your enjoyment of this book by reading it at the seaside, or in conjunction with a relevant documentary on the Discovery Channel."},{"Title":"The Edge of the Sea","review":"I have the 1955 edition of this book and it is on a small list of books that I read at least every 2 years.

Some of the science is obviously a bit out of date - we've learned a lot in the past half century, but the beauty of Rachel's writings continues to thrill.

Some of the characters are a bit too broad -- so evil you can barely look at them as real -- and the ending is just so OUT THERE is almost takes away from the rest of the book. I get the idea that a sequel was intended, and the book doesn't quite stand on its own.

This revolutionary work fused burgeoning studies in comparative philology of the English language with the rich tradition of literary history and language found in Johnson's earlier efforts.Murray, an autodidact from a rich tradition of self-taught scholarship in the Border counties of Scotland, proved to be the perfect man for the gargantuan task of editing the OED. He devoted 40 years of his life to the effort after achieving remarkable personal and academic success in English and Scottish philology.This is a charming, learned and very readable biography about a man and a masterpiece created to chronical the English language.

It is inspiring to read about people back in those days who really devoted their lives to invention and intellectual pursuits. Once you read the description of the scriptorium and how Murray farmed out assignments to literally thousands of readers, you'll appreciate why the OED is such an important reference work.

Both are lovingly told. It's a must read for anyone interested in dictionaries or linguistics."},{"Title":"Caught in the Web of Words.","review":"James Murray was a prodigy. He learned languages, geography, botany at an early age. He lived in Scotland. He was intrigued that his border language was identical to that of Northumberland and so that the English-Scots boundary had no linguistic significance. He was always learning, always collecting knowledge.In two years at school he learned four languages. After school he was tutored in two more by a family friend, Italian and German. His family did not send him to grammar school at Melrose because there were other boys to educate. He became an assistant master when he was seventeen. By 1857 he was developing an interest in philology. Seeing Anglo-Saxon put him into a high state of excitement. He moved to London and started to work at Russian. He wrote THE DIALECT OF THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES OF SCOTLAND.James Murray was respected by Morris, Ellis, Sweat, Skeat--men instrumental in revolutionizing the science of etymology. In 1868 at the Philological Society Murray encountered Frederick Furnivall. Furnivall was an inveterate founder of organizations for the study of English. Murray became an editor of the dictionary project of the Philological Society after the first editor, Herbert Coleridge, died. Borrowing the method of work from the Germans, Coleridge had started in 1860 with fifty four pigeon-holes. James Murray was named editor in 1877.Ultimately there were sixteen thousand pages of the OED. Murray died in July 1915. The last portion of the dictionary appeared in 1928. Supplements to the dictionary were issued in 1933 and 1972. There are two appendices, notes, and an index in this very good book."},{"Title":"Caught in the Web of Words.","review":"To my mind, James Murray was a model of what scholars should be about: individuals who combine broad love of learning with single-minded concentration on the task at hand, who know their minds well enough to stand on principle but who are humble enough to retain a simple faith in God.The task of Murray's granddaughter, K. M. Elisabeth Murray (1909-1998), in writing this now classic biography was made the easier by the fact that Murray was a genuinely good man, a man who loved his large family and who was, in turn, revered by them. Although Elisabeth Murray does not ignore her ancestor's occasional excitability and depression or his attempts to over-dramatize and exaggerate his plight as editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, she rarely has to apologize for any of his specific actions. James Murray tried desperately to take the ethical high road. In the words of the psalmist, he was a person who \\"swears to his own hurt and does not change.\\"Wonderfully readable, the book seems to bog down only where the bog appears necessary, the \\"slough of despond\\" that too often bounded repeated negotiations for producing a dictionary so mammoth that even the experienced Murray seriously misjudged its final size. Otherwise, this book is the model life of a model scholar, a self-made man who ennobled both lexicography and his descendants with his determination to bend his life's energy toward a worthy goal."},{"Title":"Caught in the Web of Words.","review":"Elisabeth Murray writes a wonderful and highly detailed biography of her grandfather, James Murray. Simon Winchester reintroduced many in this country to Mr. Murray in his book The Professor and the Madman, which told the story of Murray and an American living in an English asylum named W. C. Minor. This book was highly readable, but not comprehensive as a true biography of Murray.James Murray, the first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, was a gentle man of words who dedicated his life to the study of the English Language. His efforts are best understood in this book by the descriptions Elisabeth gives of his scriptorum, where Murray spent the majority of his life, and where Elisabeth worked as a young lady.In reading about this man's life and the effort that was required to undertake the construction of this dictionary, one really gets a sense of the vastness and complexity of the English Language, the historical richness and the regional diversity. One also sees in florid detail the life of one of the great late-Victorian pedants."},{"Title":"Caught in the Web of Words.","review":"James Murray begins like a Tom Sawyer; moves along like a delightful story teller and wizard who captured the old and young in his desire to examine and inform. Becomes a work horse for other driving souls in language and nature taking on tasks as thrown his way and performing with a high level of integraty and completeness. Essentially a scientist in his desire for the basic data which he found more precious than spectulation. Then left a bank job in London to teach young people At Mill Hill and from their was chosen by the elete of Oxford for his proven capacity for excellent work in the discovery of the history and meaning of words. Read it and get the joy of his love life with Ada and the raising of their ten children. A crown he enjoyed as much as the thirteen volumns of the Oxford English Dictionary.Warren L. Dahlstrom Sr. Fairfax, Virginia"},{"Title":"Ma Cuisine","review":"The dust jacket of this book proudly proclaims: \\"written with the average housewife in mind\\". Well, not exactly.Escoffier authored Le Guide Culinaire, the big Kahuna of professional reference books on proper haute cuisine. On the down side, it contained many sophisticated, hard to do assembly dishes requiring teams of talented chefs that even world class restaurants that charge $500+ per person would find hard to accomplish correctly. This book, Ma Cuisine, has simply left out these difficult and expensive recipes (what used to be called the \\"piece de resistance\\").Simply leaving out the complicated recipes does not make a home kitchen friendly cookbook. Most of the recipes, even the simple ones that are within reach of the typical home cook, consist of a couple of terse sentences of instructions. It is something like the instructions a head chef would give to a veteran sous chef or prep cook. If this is your skill level, then this book is for you (if you are a foodservice professional, you should obtain a copy immediately, and let the learning begin). For the rest of us workaday home cooks, better to avoid this book. On the good side, it is a complete cookbook covering all subjects you are ever likely to want to do. It is illuminating to see how the great master chef of all times treats rather simple recipes that are so often thoughtlessly executed by poorly paid kitchen staff even in expensive hotels and prestigious restaurants charging a c-note or more per diner.If you have even a modicum of cooking skill, this book is actually rather valuable. In today's parlance, most of the recipes in this book would be classified as bistro cooking. True, many recipes are either too complicated or too expensive to do, but many others are wonderful, simple recipes describing how something should be properly done (this is particularly true of basic recipes like cooking vegetables or dealing with fruit based desserts, or cooking and serving various proteins). Problem is, you need to have enough skill to recognize which is which just by reading the recipe on the printed page. Most recipes assume a vast experience of cooking, like how to make meringue or cook en cocotte; this cookbook supplies none of the ancillary directions. Many recipes use relentless portions of truffle, pate, meat glaze (glace de viande), demi-glace and its array of secondary sauces. None of the recipes specify specific stove flame strengths, or oven temperatures. Proper cooking times are usually not listed, nor how to tell when something is done; it assumes you already know these things, especially vexing if you are not that experienced and are trying to follow a seafood, poultry, or meat recipe that simply says \\"cook in the usual manner\\".Typical example: \\"Sauce au Chocolat\\".8 oz. chocolatepint (U.S. 1 7/8 cups) water1 tablespoon vanilla sugar3 tablespoons creambutter\\"Dissolve the chocolate in water. Add sugar and cook over low heat for 20 - 25 minutes. Add cream and a piece of butter the size of a walnut.\\" Several questions come to mind: is he referring to regular eating chocolate, cocoa powder, or unsweetened bitter chocolate? Is the water cold, room temp, hot, or boiling? Is the translation \\"dissolve\\" really what Escoffier meant to imply? In this case, this is what I conclude: he is referring to regular semisweet chocolate (since the additional sugar is only I T, the chocolate must already be sweet). It does not sound like he is referring to cocoa powder (although cooking for almost a half hour and additional fat in the form of butter argues for cocoa powder, but again it does not contain the necessary sugar, unless he is referring to hot chocolate mix; besides, current hot fudge sauces usually call for added butter, arguing for the bar chocolate again). And, the water must be hot or boiling, or the bar chocolate will not melt. Also, a teaspoon of vanilla extract plus regular sugar supplies the necessary seasoning in place of vanilla sugar, and the extract would have to be added at the end after the heat is turned off. And, does the cream and butter require additional heating, or can you just turn off the flame, add then stir them in? This is actually one of the better chocolate dessert sauces I have made, but doing the recipe correctly requires a bit of previous culinary skill that Escoffier does not supply.One important complaint is the virtually non-existent table of contents. Typical example: the Fish and Shellfish chapter is thoughtfully arranged by the author according to type of seafood, but the TOC simply lists the chapter title and none of the subsections. So, you are obligated to flip through 90 pages to find what you want.The index in back is not a big help: it has a curious structure that can be frustrating to use, especially if you know exactly what you are looking for, but not sure what the translator lists it under. The recipes are listed either by French or English titles, sometimes both, sometimes one and not the other, and sometimes not at all. Some recipes are listed only under the type of dish it is, sometimes the recipe title, sometimes both, sometimes neither. Plus, the English translation of the French is often not literal, meaning you have to second guess how the authors have translated a particular French title. Many classic French recipes are present, but not under the title you might expect. In summary, you must rely upon the index for your primary look up tool, but it is inconsistent and difficult to use."},{"Title":"Ma Cuisine","review":"As far as cook books go this is a fantastic book to opt for. It ranges from delicate sauces to the most complex of deserts. This book has only two flaws which in a sense are not real flaws. The first is that this book is definately designed for the experienced cook. Though it offers an explantion of many of the complicated tasks in its recipes, there is a lot of knowledge it takes for granted. So while this book is definately not for the rank amateur, with a combination of other books this could be a fantastic referece book to own. As for the second flaw, the ingredients required are not always the easiest to find. Some of the things neccessary for the recipes can not be found in your everyday super-market. But if you have access to some specialized markets you will be cooking like a professional in no time at all."},{"Title":"Ma Cuisine","review":"Bearing in mind that this book was written in the era of Mrs. Beaton, when home cooks knew how to cook and when an author could use words like \\"veloute\\" without wondering if his audience would understand them, this is a fantastic cookbook. Yes, the recipes are a bit more complex than Betty Crocker, but the rewards are vast for the educated, refined palate. The recipes are antiquated, as they are aimed at the tastes of the 1930's, and, as such, they are not daily fare, but they will be valuable additions to a well rounded repertoire of cuisine."},{"Title":"Ma Cuisine","review":"I think this book is a treasure. Absolutely classic recipes and techniques for the serious cook. If you're tired of the fare served up by self~impressed Food Network stars, most of whom probably don't even know how to properly poach an egg, buy this book. It's a fantastic companion to &#34;Mastering the Art of French Cooking&#34;."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"Make no mistake, this is a contemporary erotic romance. Think Lisa Marie Rice on laughing gas. The love scenes are both graphic and erotic (not necessarily the same thing). While there are many, they occur naturally in progression with the story. The heroine was wonderful. I felt her deafness added depth to her character and felt authentic. The hero was over-the-top alpha (which I love in a romance, especially an erotic one); the villain and other secondary characters well-drawn. The story was plausible as were the romantic conflicts. A fun, light read I would highly recommend to those who enjoy this genre."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"This was my first book by Erin McCarthy and I'm ready to buy all of the rest of her books. I loved this story and the characters. I laughed out loud a few times. The sex scenes were reallllllly good. I love when an author can combine love,humor,and steamy sex all in one book. I look forward to reading other titles by Erin McCarthy."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"I'm so glad that I tried a new author, Erin McCarthy. Mouth to Mouth was a sweet, sexy and touching story with some mild intrigue in the background. She has a smooth writing style that delivered a contempory romance with some of the most believable characters that I have read in a long time. While this book was not as sexy as Shannon McKenna, Lucy Monroe or Lori Foster's books, it definitely had its moments. I will read more from this author."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"Detectives Russ Evans and Jerry Anders are working on a case that involves bringing down swindler Trevor Dean. He preys on the hearts unsuspecting women by getting them to fall head-over-heels in love with him before he takes them for all they're worth.Dean's most recent target comes by way of Laurel Wilkins, the gorgeous and much too kind-hearted woman who is a far cry from his usual \\"plain Jane\\" victims.It all starts when Dean tricks Laurel into meeting him at a nearby coffee shop. Always ten steps ahead of the game, the two detectives stakeout in front of the store waiting for criminal to make his move. In the meantime, Russ decides to grab a cup of coffee and gets the surprise of his life when he hears Laurel call him by his name, mistaking him for Trevor Dean.Laurel, who is deaf, clarifies to Russ that she only became caught up with Trevor because she wanted some excitement in her otherwise boring, goody-two-shoes life.This brings them to the matter really at hand - Russ having to explain Dean's cons - and they embark on the task of setting Dean up. This situations brings about a steamy love affair and feelings that neither one of them knew they were capable of having.I thought this book was entertaining and full of loveable personalities. As an extra special treat, we find tons of affection for secondary characters as well, each bestowing on us their own touching story lines."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"Had I seen the saucy mass-paperback cover of this book, I probably would not have bought it. The one I bought was the larger paperback that had a more generic cover and it seemed like it might be interesting. A little mystery, a little romance. I had read Bit the Jackpot by his author and liked it, so I thought I would give it a shot. So glad I did.What a wonderful story and with great characters. What I liked about this book is that it focused on about a half a dozen characters that were developed very well and very believable. Laurel is a strong character and also happens to be deaf. Never viewed as a disability but the author does a great job of exploring some of the things that come with being deaf, but also trying to find her place in life. Russ is a good guy dealing with the loss of his parents and taking care of his good-hearted but problematic teenage brother.They meet by chance because of a crime that Russ is investigating. (he's a detective). Not planning on becoming too involved, they start up a fling which turns into more. Certainly some hot, steamy scenes in this one and I have to say, the author has a knack for doing that well also.A really heart-warming story with a few surprises along the way. I found myself laughing along the way. Truly a nice story and I plan on checking out more from this author."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"I have quite a few of her books, she has become a favorite author, I love her lighthearted style, her books make me laugh and smile. Great romance."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"Lots of steamy love scenes and sensual tension to get your heart racing and a hero you'll fall in love with. I thought the hero-jealousy was hot and was glad the mystery/suspense was not the main plot.The only things that bothered me were the heroine's TSTL moments and the too TOO convenient mystery sub-plot. The ending wrapped up too easily.Overall a very good read and one I would recommend."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"Erin McCarthy has done it again with Mouth to Mouth. Her latest book was so good that I didn't want it to end. It was witty, sexy and with a heroine who even though she has a disability, doesn't let that defer her from having a life and love. And the hero thinks he belongs on the dredges of society, that is until he meets the wonderful heroine and beings to feel worthy.Laurel, is deaf and lives with her mother. She doesn't date much because of her disability and decides to use on-line dating to find a man to have sex with. What she doesn't know is that she was being conned by a man who uses women for sex and takes all their money.Russ Evans is the cop investigating the con and he comes in contact with Laurel. Soon Russ can't get her out of his mind and keeps coming to her house and when Laurel says she only wants a man to have sex with, well Russ is more than willing to help her out.Laurel and Russ are adorable together. They become more than lovers and he becomes very protective of her because that nasty con is out there stalking her.There is also Russ's little brother who has a major attitude because of the death of their parents and along with another cast of characters that show up to add to the story.Even though Laurel may look and act innocent, when she is with Russ she lets loose and those scenes between her and Russ and very spicy and hot. There is even one scene were they use pixie sticks in very inventive ways because Laurel works in a candy store and Russ adores candy and using it with Laurel.For an overall funny, loopy read with great love scenes to boot, Mouth to Mouth is one book to pick up!Katiebabs"},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"Erin McCarthy trully knows how to make you believe in love. i loved it!"},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"Warning! If you require romance and well drawn characters in your books, this isn't it! McCarthy dives right in from the get go into a steamy affair between a deaf rich girl and the cop looking for the man who's milking women out of their money. There's plenty of love scenes, written very well btw, but the book lacks from little character development. Then again, this isn't heavy emotional reading.I really liked this book, but I wasn't expecting McNaught. Laurel and Russ are very likeable. The scenes between Russ and his little brother he's raising can be touching and Laurel's mother is a cute character -definitly a contemporary woman.My favorite is Jerry (Russ's cop partner) and Cat (Laurel's co-worker friend). Their relationship is hilarious, because she's a goth and well, he's a cop! I wish McCarthy wrote more about them.I would definitly get this one if you've read any of McCarthy's anthologies and liked them. Her style is similar to Foster's and Gibson's.Pick this one up if you want mega-steamy love scenes without a heavy emotional read. Perfect fluff."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"I just loved this book! I'm a huge fan of Ms McCarthy's books and I think this is her best yet! Russ is tough but sweet - just a real nice guy. Laurel is strong and determined and just plain hugable.Russ Evans is a cop trying to bust con man Trevor Dean who specializes in \\"romancing\\" plain women then stealing their money. But there is something off about his latest mark. She's certainly NOT plain and it bothers Russ that Dean would change tactics with her. He decides to get a closer look and is shocked to discover that this woman knows his name! What the heck is going on here?Laurel Wilkins has decided to finally break out of her shell and live a little and she's decided to start with a man she met online named Russ Evans. But she quickly learns that the man she has been chatting with online is NOT Russ, but a con man posing as Russ! The real Russ is a cop who is on Dean's trail but he refuses to let Laurel help to bust him much as she wants to. Especially when he figures out that she is deaf (she's a really good lip-reader). The more he talks to her, the more clear Dean's motives become. She lives in a wealthy neighborhood, a big, expensive house and has a trust fund. Add to that the vulnerability of being deaf and she's a great mark. All of which really makes Laurel mad. Just because she's deaf does not mean that she's stupid. She knows that she has brought out all of Russ' protective instincts but she doesn't want that. She wants him - to have a sexual relationship with him. After years of living with her mother, staying in her safety zone, she is determined to break out and live a little - especially since her mom is out of town! And so she and Russ enter into what they expect to be a casual sexual relationship.Which is fine by Russ as he has enough on his plate with his teenaged brother Sean to look after since the death of their parents. Sean is really having a hard time adjusting to Russ selling their parent's home, to changing schools and to living with Russ. Adding a serious romance into the mix would just tip his life totally off kilter. But there is something about Laurel that he just finds irresistible. She's so sweet and nice and cute and sexy - he just can't stay away from her. And as the investigation continues and they become more and more intertwined in each other's lives, what happened to that casual sexual relationship? And will they ever have enough evidence to bust Dean? Is he still a threat to Laurel?What an enjoyable read! Russ and Laurel are a really great couple who bring out the best in one another. Their sexual relationship is really steamy. Though I'm not one for cute nicknames, I loved how he called her \\"Bunny\\". I know it sounds kind of nauseating but is was really sweet. And he tries really hard to step back and let Laurel do what she wants and live her life without hovering which she really appreciates. And I really enjoyed the romance between Russ's partner Jerry and Laurel's co-worker Cat - talk about opposites attracting! Another great read from Ms McCarthy!"},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"Laurel Wilkins wants to spice up her life a little. She's in her mid-twenties and ready to do something more than work in a candy store and share a home with her mother. Laurel has been deaf for most of her life, but she has adapted just fine. It's really not a handicap as far as she's concerned. Laurel is a bit naive and sheltered, but she's definitely not stupid and she knows what she wants. And she wants gorgeous cop Russ Evans. Laurel thought she met Russ online in a chat room through a friend, but it turns out she'd been chatting with a sleazy con-man named Trevor Dean who was impersonating Russ. But the real Russ is definitely drool-worthy. She was ready to have a wild affair with the man she thought was Russ, so why not go for the real thing?Russ isn't about to stand idly by while Trevor Dean uses his name to pick up women. Dean normally gets close to plain women, then fleeces them. Adorable and sexy Laurel is far from plain and definitely not Dean's usual victim, which made Russ suspicious of her at first. He quickly realizes she's innocent and wants to protect her from the slimy Dean. But his feelings for her aren't just protective. He's falling for her, hard. Russ is rasing his teenage brother and wouldn't have time for a relationship even if he wanted one. Which he doesn't. Or does he? No woman has ever gotten under his skin this way before.MOUTH TO MOUTH is a great combination of steam, humor and suspense. I'll never think of candy the same way again ;-) Also, I love the way Erin McCarthy handles Laurel and her deafness. It isn't ignored, it's just a part of who Laurel is. Russ is a little overprotective but he'd probably be that way around Laurel anyway, deaf or not. Great book!"},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"It's official. I love Erin McCarthy. You are guaranteed a hot steamy romance with great characters everytime you pick up one of her stories. Her latest effort \\"Mouth to Mouth\\" not only offers a great story but this time her character's are not \\"perfect\\" and as a result the reader will probably identify with them more.Laurel Watkins is done playing it safe. She wants to live life and so after making that decision she begins an internet relationship with a man who calls himself Russ. She makes a date with him and waits in a coffee shop patiently waiting for her destiny to walk through the door. Well, he does but he's not what she expected or was waiting for. You see the real Russ is a police detective and he's working on a case involving fraud and his suspect is named Trevor. He doesn't know what to make of Laurel. She has turned his head and fast. She is pretty, sweet and can you spell the word naive? Once he realizes that she is Trevor's next victim he does what any good police officer would do. Warn her off of any dangerous Internet interaction. You just never know what you'll meet online.Laurel can't take a lecture from the yummy Russ and she is tired of playing it safe...so what does our bold new lass do...offers to have a flaming hot romance with Russ. Well, that gets the good detectives attention and quick. Now with the green flag will these two different people find more than just a good time? And more importantly will Trevor turn out to be a bigger threat than they think he will be?Again, this was a very fast paced read that entertained this reader up until the final page. Although Laurel is deaf this in no way detracts from the storyline or from the romance. If anything it makes it better. Secondary characters and their storylines are essential to this story as well as entertaining. I highly recommend this author and story if you love a little spice with your romance.Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com"},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"Too much sex, too little emotional development between the characters. I bought all of McCarthy's work in one go and this was the first one I read. I think she's a refreshing author with her own voice so for that alone she gets my respect.Halfway through the book I had to put it down for a bit and I didn't really understand why - I was enjoying the read but then I realised I was on a sex train that only occasionally took character development pit stops. My brain was tired of the sex and as a result, I lost my connection with the characters or rather, my connection forged at the beginning of the novel wasn't allowed to grow.I mark this a 2/5 but I really mean 2.5 - and this is only because this author writes so much better (the proof is in her other titles) that in comparison to the others, it can't get higher than that."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"I agree with Bee Smith's review that the protagonists of MOUTH TO MOUTH are a couple of shallow, sex-starved people. In this novel, Erin McCarthy failed with her character development. I wasn't emotionally involved in this story and could care less when Russ and Laurel screwed each other senseless while trying to catch a con man out on the loose. The sex scenes were overrated--explicit but NOT erotic. Although the mistaken choking scene with Russ and his younger brother was quite amusing, everything else was bland. I skimmed thru much of this novel and bottom line: Non-compelling characters + insipid romance + lackluster plot = one heck of a boring romance novel!Save your cash. There are far better romance novels out there."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"When I read the description of the book about Russ - a cop with too much on his plate and Laurel - a hearing impaired potential victim in his current case, I thought it sounded like such a good read, but unfortunately it wasn't.The book had potential, but the writing didn't follow through with character development. Sure there was steamy sex, but when you can't care about the characters, you lose interest. It becomes just reading the words with no emotional pull. If I don't become involved in the story there isn't much point to it. This is a book I could put down, in fact it took 3 days to get through it. I hope the writer takes more care with the characters in her next book."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"This was no romance novel, it was more like a detailed screenplay for a romantic-sex-filled-comedy soon to be released in a theatre near you!The character development was abysmal for both Laurel and Russ-the heroine and hero,and I do believe that that was the downfall of the book, not to mention the gratuitous sex scenes that dominated most of the novel.Otherwise McCarthy had good solid material to write an exceptional romantic novel: a deaf rich heroine who was starting to question her stable but boring decisions she had made during the course of her young life, a sexy and troubled cop who's trying to raise his teen brother after his parents suddenly died in a car crash, a rich plot that involves an amateur con artist who targets Laurel as his next victim, as well as funny and interesting side characters.However, the over-abundant sex and the abysmally lacking characterization just demolished any potential the novel had had. For someone who usually loves passion and sex in her romance novels, I was even shocked by my reaction every time Russ and Laurel heated up the sheets (which was all the bloody time): I just did not care, kept rolling my eyes and couldn't wait to finish the story already.Skip this novel if you are looking for a deep, meaningful, and passionate romance. But if you don't mind endless sex, shallow characters, and a somewhat interesting storyline Mouth to Mouth is definitely for you."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"This book reminded me of a porn movie; lots of sex but no plot and no character development. How did these two decide that they loved each other anyway? All they really seemed to know about each other was how to make the other climax. This was a real disappointment.

The back cover of the description did not really say anything. What the heck? Just buy it and read...Honestly, reading the book was in awe to me. I could never believe SEX is the only thing talked about in the book. As the other reviewer had said, the sex scene starts at p.60 and all the way until almost P.300. Every page is about sex. To me, the characters are not really in love with each other. They are just \\"sex-starved\\". After they've seen each other for 30 seconds, they ripped off their clothes and had sex. This is really exaggerating the reality. Consider they just met each other at a coffee shop without really knowing/talking to each other. I don't think people nowadays do this. They were both described as innocent girl and good guy... come on, give me a break. They both sound like hookers. I don't feel this is a romance novel, but more like a sex stories. Moreover, the storyline is very weak. They \\"fall in love\\" not with each other, but with each other's body only. I guess people like it just because of the sex scenes. If you are serious, you could even have an orgasm while reading. I admit the author really writes exotic and hot scenes.

If you like Lori Foster, you will like this author as well."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"This was a delightful book. so much so that I went and bought the other books by the author. The characters are adorable and it is an easy to read not too complicated but definitely not boring."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"This is my first book by Erin McCarthy. Won't be the last! What a talented, sensitive writer. In this day where romance is dominated by \`perfect people' I applauded the writer who recreates less than perfect characters and reminds us love comes in all forms and all walks of life. The heroine is deaf, hearing-impaired to be more politically correct. I have had two friends with hearing problems and knowing the frustrations they have put up with people's mishandling of them, it immediately put in with complete sympathy with McCarthy's heroine.Laurel Watkins is fed up with playing safe in her life. She wanting some adventure, especially romance. So she takes the plunge and makes a date On-line with a man called Russ. She's excited meeting him in a coffee shop for their first date. Only, things don't go the way she planned.Russ is really a special operative on the track of a man called Trevor Dean. Trevor seeks out plain women that are nave, then robs them blind, stealing all their savings. So when Russ makes the date with Laurel he is on the job. Russ is taken with Laurel. She is pretty, smart and doesn't let the hearing problem slow her down one bit. She doesn't see it as a handicap and resents people who do. Russ politely explains about Trevor, warns her from meeting men on the Internet. Laurel, being a thoroughly modern woman, says fine. She will stay off the Net provided he has a hot affair with her. Naturally, Russ if floored!Russ wants to protect Laurel because he feels she's Trevor's next victim, but he is soon way past that, falling hard. He soon has a sweet tooth for the lady who works in the candy store.McCarthy deals with Laurel deafness with forthright fashion, which has the reader applauding and cheering Laurel instead of giving her sympathy. It's presented as this is a part of Laurel...so what? It's great to see someone strike out against the stereotypical heroine, and with banners flying, gives you a steamy romance, great heart-stealing characters and one great read! Mouth-to-Mouth gives you a great touchy romance with a smile."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"I won't post the blurb or summary since others have done that, but Wow, Laurel and Russ were so a beautiful couple for MOUTH TO MOUTH by Erin McCarthy. With Laurel being a heroine who is deaf, I also being deaf, could so connect with empathy and understanding with Laurel. This author did an outstanding job both portraying Laurel's independence but too showing those times too that we do depend on others but it doesn't make us dependent, it makes us even stronger for it. Russ was not just a yummy hero, but so a natural one! He learned through getting to know Laurel, her culture and ways and you couldn't help smiling so many times at the two of them as they learned together. And I love Russ cuz he loves candy! That was so perfect and sizzling in the story. That's a hint that this is a delicious contemporary romance not to miss! Its the best I read of the contemporary of McCarthy and her others were A's for me too!"},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"I won't post the blurb or summary since others have done that, but Wow, Laurel and Russ were so a beautiful couple for MOUTH TO MOUTH by Erin McCarthy.

There's lots of passion and lots of loving too. I was a little conflicted though about how to rate this novel and it mostly stems from the opening chapters.Sweet Laurel Watkins has met a man via the internet and is awaiting her first meeting with her chat room lover. She is excited when Russ Evans walks into the Starbucks. He is very handsome and she is awestruck also he is perfect for her because according to his e-mails he is interested in just a physical relationship. Yep, that's what sheltered Laurel wants a hot lover with no emotions.Russ is actually a cop investigating a con man who preys on lonely women. He knows that Laurel is his next target and is surprised that she rushes to him calling him by name. He discovers that this con man is using his name on the internet when he is communicating with Laurel. (He just randomly picked Russ's name from all the police officers in Cleveland and Russ just happens to be assigned this case.) Russ gently clears up any confusion Laurel has and explains that she needs to contact the police if her mystery man e-mails her again.Laurel is embarrassed and quite nave. She is very trusting of people and feeling a bit disappointed that her cyberman has stood her up, within a few minutes she propositions Russ for noncommittal sex. Yep, Laurel is not going to let anything dissuade her from her goal. Russ, being a red blooded, modern rake agrees to this plan and viola the two are engaged in some passionate encounters. Admittedly it was difficult to get past Laurel's brazen invitation sent to two different men. This was a stark contrast to the inexperienced girl still living at home with her mother.The book does improve greatly by the middle portion because the leads communicate their feelings. Surprisingly, Ms McCarthy has written Russ as more than the gruff self centered cop one expects from the first chapter. He is honest, caring and longs to be more than just a casual partner for Laurel. For me, he is the more interesting character due in large part to his unique ability to communicate his many feelings whether it is his frustration with his younger brother or his real fear for Laurel's welfare.Laurel is deaf but the author has skillfully written about a character who is defined more by what she desires rather than what she cannot hear. Laurel's biggest problem is she is so trusting and so intent on proving herself that she throws caution out the window at times. Case in point, she propositions Russ within their first meeting. He could have had a steady girlfriend, or even been engaged but she does not stop to consider this or how very forward her actions are. Also she was not as dynamic as Russ and she really needed more character development.Still, this book has a certain romantic air. The leads like each other. There are no big misunderstandings other than their own insecurities about how they will fit into each other's lives. Even though, the first chapters of this novel are a bit rocky I am rounding this novel up to a four star read due to the unexpected sweetness of the lead's romance."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"Laurel Wilkins is deaf and she's tired of living a boring life. She's ready for adventure and sets out to meet a man on the internet. What she doesn't know is that it's a con artist wanting her money, using someone else's name to chat with her online. Russ Evans is the detective trying to catch the thief and finds out it's his name that the con artist is using online. Laurel wants to help catch the thief, Russ wants her as far away from the investigation as she can get. Two strong willed people collide and it's with hilarious results. Add Russ's kid brother and his partner into the mix and it creates a great story. Erin McCarthy hooked me with the first page, the relationship between Russ and his partner got me laughing and I never stopped throughout the book. I haven't read anything of Erin's I didn't like and this is no exception."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"I was recommended this author by Amazon (thank you, Amazon!) and I couldn't be more thrilled. I devoured this book from the beginning to end. I first read \\"Houston, We Have a Problem,\\" which was very good, but \\"Mouth to Mouth\\" was nothing short of great! It was my favorite kind of book -- engaging, romantic, sensual and intelligent.It was very risky writing a character who was deaf, but McCarthy has risen to the challenge and written a wonderfully entertaining story. Laurel in no way is to be pitied and the deafness defines her personality as this author explores her struggles to find herself.Russ and Laurel are opposites that develop a true love based on mutual trust and respect and yes, mind-blowing lust. He's rough around the edges, she's soft and beautiful -- and experiencing the emotional walls surrounding each of them melt away was a joy to read. The characters are finely drawn and one can feel them fall in love as the story progresses. I cannot recommend this book enough. Her writing is phenomenal.I read Ms. McCarthy's bio on the last page which said she'd been writing for just two years at the time of publication. Lucky us that we have many more years of fabulous stories from this extremely talented author."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"I am in awe of Erin McCarthy - she is a fairly new author on the scene but she's managed to crank out a bunch of books, and from what I've read so far, she keeps hitting the mark every time.I really liked Russ and Laurel. She's a deaf girl who hasn't let her disability really get in her way too much, but she longs for a little more adventure, a little excitement, and a lot of meaningless sex in her life. So, she tries on-line dating (yipes!). She starts up a dialogue with a guy called Russ. They arrange to meet. Russ shows up and is blown away by the very pretty Laurel. Thing is, he's not the Russ who's been e-mailing Laurel. Turns out it was a con man who's been hosing other women and has now set his sights on the wealthy Laurel. However, this ballsy con man - imagine, using the name of a cop in order to swindle someone! - bails on the meet and Laurel comes face to face with the real Russ - and she likes what she sees.One thing leads to another and Laurel tells Russ that what she really wants is a casual affair. Russ, who is very attracted to her, thinks this is a pretty cool idea since he's got enough on his plate without adding a serious relationship to his life, so he agrees to this. Of course, they each find themselves falling into something neither one expected out of this deal. My favorite scene in the book is when Russ tells Laurel he loves her. It's the way he does it that just melted my heart. My other favorite part was the twist near the end. I won't spoil it by telling what that twist is, but it came as an unexpected surprise. There is also a secondary plot about Russ' partner and Laurel's co-worker that I wasn't expecting and which is rather funny considering the two of them can't stand the sight of each other when they first meet.Erin McCarthy writes fun, breezy novels with interesting characters, great dialogue, sweet, tender moments, and hot, jump-off-the-page sex. What more do you need to have an entertaining read? She's great at writing the perfect I-don't-want-to-have-to-think-about-this-too-hard book! \\"Mouth to Mouth\\" is a sweet book - the only bad thing about it is the cover (who thought that up, anyway? It's got nothing to do with the story - at least I don't think it does - and it's even worse than the cover to \\"The Pregnancy Test.\\" That cover was pretty bad too, although it was more relevant to the story.) Get this book and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was not as predictable as a lot of romances tend to be. I loved that the main character was deaf and that the male character was dealing with a teenage brother. Recommend it."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"Mouth to Mouth was a great book. I loved when authors have characters that aren't typical and I loved that fact that the heroine was deaf.

Sassy. Sexy. Steamy. Humorous"},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"The book \\"Mouth to Mouth\\" had to be another one of Erin McCarthy's masterpieces. For some reason, I love that a lot of her books' scenes take place in Ohio. As a Cleveland, Ohio resident - it was funny how some of the places she mentioned were known locations to me and made the book come alive. I was originally drawn to the book after reading the reviews that our heroine, Laurel is deaf. I'm by no means a mystery/crime fan so the first chapter didn't grab me until Russ meets Laurel. At first I thought it was a little chauvinistic how Russ thought he was the only man who could protect Laurel, but after reading those hot love scenes...it was worth it. I will never look at pixy powder the same way again (wink wink). And I absolutely fell in love with Laurel's determination to embrace life regardless of being deaf. And of course, McCarthy does an amazing job of making her main male character sexy & rugged and Russ did not disappoint. The chemistry Laurel and Russ have is amazing. It made the book all the more enjoyable. There were also some other entertaining characters in the books that actually made you laugh out loud with their comical situations. This was one of my favorite McCarthy books and I recommend it to anyone. I could not put this book down until I finished it. After writing this review, I plan on rereading this book again and purchasing a new McCarthy book soon. If you like tons of love scenes, an admirable female heroine, a sexy cop with a heart of gold then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"I could not wait for this book to be released. So far, Erin McCarthy has not disapointed me yet. I pre-ordered it so I would get it ASAP. And I was NOT disapointed! I read this book in less than 10 hours, and not because it was \\"an easy read\\". I loved everything about this book. The characters are wonderful and the plot keeps the story moving. The heroine's disability made me see the world from her eyes and I realized how much we take for granted. And the attraction/love between the 2 main characters is real, easy to believe and it makes you really care about them.If I could give this book more than 5 stars, I would."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"This story had great potential, but the characters were so shallow and poorly written that I found it wasn't worth the struggle to even finish the book. The 'plot' follows the standard McCarthy formula: one character is sex-starved and the other has more than enough skills and stamina to deal with the situation. In this case it's the deaf girl and the cop. She's in the mood for casual sex, and he's more than happy to oblige. The problem with the cop character is that he acts a lot like a horny teenager and nothing like the seasoned veteran cop that he's supposed to be. In one scene, he and his partner follow Laurel (the deaf girl) to a bar and witness a guy putting a date-rape drug into her drink. Does he grab the guy, cuff him and hand him over to his partner? No. Does he arrest the perp, grab the drink and have the crime lab verify the type of drug? No. Instead, he grabs the girl, throws her over his shoulder, takes her to his car so they can have sex in public. In the meantime, his partner is left to deal with a woman he can't stand, but not to worry... they go back to her place and have sex in private. And the crime that they are not trying very hard to solve may not be a crime after all, so what's the point? The point is that it's all about the sex. Hot, heavy, and horny and by the way, she likes it rough. The story continued to deteriorate, and I finally gave up. The explicit sex didn't bother me, the fact that it was the only thing that the characters had in common did. If you're into mindless, meaningless escapism, this might be for you. Just not for me."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"Mouth To Mouth is a hysterically funny, sexy, tender book by Erin McCarthy.Detective Russ Evans sees the woman of his dreams on night on a stakeout.

This is in the top 10 percent of them all. You'll love Russ and Laurel. The characters were fleshed-out perfectly - not too much and certainly not too little. I'd highly recommend it and I now plan to look into further books that Erin McCarthy has written. She's that good a writer!"},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"Erin McCarthy once again has a hit with Mouth to Mouth. Her book blends humor, family responsibilities, the heroine's being deaf, a little suspense, more humor, and of course romance. The heroine, Laurel, has been deaf since childhood and is ready to break out of her protective shell, while Russ, a detective, is trying to catch a con artist preying on women, with Laurel as his next target. Russ knows he's the only man to help Laurel get over her shyness and fears, and Laurel is just bold enough to want Russ to help her. Russ's brother, Sean, is a secondary character and I would love to read his story one day. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys romance mixed with humor and some suspense. I can't wait for Ms. McCarthy's next release. An auto-buy author for sure."},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"A con man brought them together...Laurel and Russ were both waiting for the same person, only for different reasons. Laurel was waiting to find romance, while Russ was looking for a fraud.Laurel was determined to find some excitement in her life, so why not start by actually meeting face to face with the charming man she's been chatting with on-line?Russ was just as determined to arrest the con man who's been romancing lonely women in order to steal from them. Laurel seemed to be his next target, however she didn't fit the normal profile. Instead of a plain, desperate woman waiting in that coffee shop, he meets sexy yet innocent Laurel, who gets his blood racing, and seems to think HE is the one she's looking for.Russ is drawn to Laurel, admires her pluck and sassiness, and wants to take care of her, despite the fact he's not the marrying kind. Laurel is attracted to the sexy cop but has no intention of letting him take over her life. Neither one is looking for love, but sometimes life has a funny way of giving you not what you ask for, but rather for what you need.Oh my gosh, Mouth to Mouth is one of those sexy reads that constantly rewards you with delightful moments of laughter and tenderness. Erin McCarthy's inventive love scenes and poignant emotion never overwhelm the more serious issues, but rather enhance the romantic journey Russ & Laurel find themselves taking. A secondary romance lends humor and additional sexual tension, yet doesn't distract from the main characters.

As soon as I was done reading it the first time, I wanted to go back to the beginning and read it all over again! Erin McCarthy does a wonderful job at mixing luscious sensuality with lots of humor and very likable characters. I enjoyed the little bit of mystery that was mixed in with the romance. Russ is a sweet, caring and very sexy hero that I could fall in love with. Russ is a wonderful combination of everything I like in a hero! Laurel is a very cute, fun and likable heroine who has been a bit naive in the past, but is ready to take charge of her life and takes steps to get what she wants. And oh boy, the sparks sure did fly between Russ and Laurel! The love scenes were extremely hot and very satisfying! I really thought Ms. McCarthy handled Laurel's deafness with sensitivity but didn't make a huge deal out of it. It was part of who Laurel was and I can't see her as being any other way.

His policeman's lifestyle, the young brother he was bringing up, wasn't ideal for her, and there was still that guy out there trying to rob unsuspecting women, including Laurel, but Russ felt he wanted her for himself, not just sexually.

Trevor selects lonely plain looking females as his marks, but the woman working at Starbucks is beautiful. When Trevor fails to show up, the two cops wonder if Laurel Wilkins is Trevor's girlfriend. Russ enters the coffee shop, but is stunned when Laurel hugs him like they have known each other forever. They soon realize that probably Trevor was impersonating him over a chat line and that Laurel is most likely his next victim.Russ thinks Laurel is a \\"cute fuzzy bunny\\", but he does not go out with sweet women as all he wants is casual sex. However, she shocks him when she mentions casual sex as that seems so out of character for her. He wonders if she is diverting him from capturing Trevor. Still he cannot get enough of Laurel although that breaks the rules of his personal and professional lives even as he detests that he must use the woman he loves as a pawn in the cat and mouse game with Trevor.This erotic police procedural romance grips the audience from the moment a bewildered Russ pays for coffee at a quarter a sip until the final altercation with Trevor threatening his beloved Laurel. The lead couple is an endearing pair with Laurel's deafness deftly intertwined into the strong plot as her impairment is overcome with little courtesies like lip reading. Though Trevor is an odious predator taking advantage of the lonely, fans will appreciate Erin McCarthy's strong tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Mouth To Mouth","review":"I enjoy this writer.

At one level it is an absorbing story of a man who compiled all that was known about sex. At another level it is a psychological thriller-study and at yet another level it is a commentary on the sexuality and culture. I usually read thrillers/bestsellers or Dick Francis interspersed with Anita Booker and Margaret Atwood etc and this book was paced bang in the middle. Not too fast, not too slow.

The most useful and timely section is the English expression section-- what the State Department is looking for in written communication doesn't change much.However, much of the rest of the book is outdated, and useful only in identifying broad study areas. The section on the oral exam is particularly outdated, as the oral exam changes format and focus every few years, and the book has failed to change with it. Today, the oral exam is so different that I wondered if ARCO was even writing about the same exam. However, given changes in the formation of policy and the role of foreign service officers, even the written exam is much different than the one presented in this book.There are only two factors saving this book from a single star: the fact that it can be useful in determining what areas you are weak in and need to focus study on, and that it is the only book out dealing with this exam.

To get more info, you should also splurge for the ETS test preparation guide also (about $11.00). It's another practice exam, like the ones in this book. More info can be found at the State Dept. website. Other than that, ARCO's book is necessary, but less than adequate.

Both Professional or housewife. Its a good reference book. The recipes are authentic and unique to the region."},{"Title":"Cocina Criolla","review":"This book has lived with me for 30+ years, ever since I left home to join the Marines. It has kept me sane and helped me to feed my family great PR dishes over the years. It's the one and only reason why I love to cook. Good instructions, and remains applicable and current to this day. I met Mr. Valdejuli once. I think the PR House and Senate should honor this woman and her husband with a statue in front of the Capitol."},{"Title":"Cocina Criolla","review":"My mother who is now 94 years old used this book in her kitchen for as long as I can remember. I grew up eating food prepared from the recipes in this book. I am a 64 year old man who now has to cook for him-self if he wants to eat Puerto Rican food. I recently bought this book as a replacement for the worn out copy I bought years ago to replace the copy my mother gave me when she got to old to cook anymore. I cook other kinds of foods too, but I would be lost without this book so I can prepare my favorite Puerto Rican dishes every once in a while."},{"Title":"Cocina Criolla","review":"The book is fantastic. After being in USA for so many years, I forgot how to make certains spanish dishes. I recommend you to buy it and enjoy the delicious recipes."},{"Title":"Cocina Criolla","review":"I love this cookbook because it has very traditional recipes. However, the recipes are high in fat. I would love to add to my library a 'light' version of this book."},{"Title":"Cocina Criolla","review":"I actually forgot I once owned Puertorican Cookery. I thought it was just eh and gave the book to a cousin- she really liked it. This particular version is the same- eh. I bought it because it said it was an updated version of the recipes, and because of al the great reviews. But what I found is that it was all the same-o-same-o. I honestly don't understand what it is that is so great about this book. It's just ok. I'll be wrapping this up and gifting it away..."},{"Title":"Cocina Criolla","review":"My mom has this book and I was always experimenting in the kitchen with recipes from this book.

I did very little cooking until I got this book. I tried recipe after recipe and really learned how to make good puertorican food. I highly recommend this book if you want the real flavors. I have since modified some of the recipes to make it more in tune with today's dietary restrictions like replacing vegetable oils for lard.If you want to explore puertorican cuisine, this is the book to try. It also comes in English."},{"Title":"Cocina Criolla","review":"This is one of the best cookbooks - period. Not just the best cookbook for Puerto Rican cuisine, it is also practical and every recipe is terrific. I am not hispanic, but I love great food. I don't always love to cook, however. Over the past 15+ years, these recipes have inspired me even when I wasn't in the mood to cook! This cookbook has provided both great recipes and inspiration. Steps are easy to follow; most ingredients are readily available in local stores; results are amazing. Highly recommend whether you're Puerto Rican or Gringa!"},{"Title":"Cocina Criolla","review":"Carmen Valldejuli's Cocina Criolla is perhaps the best and most informative Puerto Rican cook book in the market.The selection of the recipes found in the book is superb.I highly recomend it to any lover of good food.I've been entertaining friends from all over the world and these recipes have been a total success."},{"Title":"Cocina Criolla","review":"I love it, you can find any recipes that your Gradma uses to made.

El &uacute;nico otro que se le acerca es Cocine Conmigo, de Dora Romano, y que hasta cierta medida podr&iacute;a complementar &eacute;ste.Es tan bueno, que a veces me siento a leerlo sin tener intenciones de cocinar. En estos tiempos de comodidad y apuro, la autora no s&oacute;lo nos pide leche de coco, sino que nos dice c&oacute;mo partir el fruto y extraer la sustancia, sin mencionar para nada el producto enlatado de f&aacute;cil uso pero poca poes&iacute;a.Quiz&aacute;s lo m&aacute;s que me gusta es descubrir recetas ya olvidadas por la memoria colectiva y poder rescatarlas y ofrec&eacute;rselas a otros con la esperanza de que tomen nuevos vuelos y se vuelvan otra vez populares.En resumen, recomendaci&oacute;n total."},{"Title":"Cocina Criolla","review":"Excellent book I couldn't wait to get it and now that I got it I can not put it down.

He has even done some himself and feels like a great chef. Everything on that book tastes as good as it sounds or better. It is the BEST of all. I will pass this on to my children when the time comes."},{"Title":"Cocina Criolla","review":"WOW!!! The book is so wonderful. It makes me remember my grandmother's cooking. She would prepare us dishes from this great cookbook. She would let me read out the ingredients and help. I love the \\"Pasteles\\", \\"Brazo Gitano\\" & \\"Bacalaitos\\"I never thought it would still be around. I was so amazed to find on Amazon that I had to buy immediately.

Sabor Boricua!!!"},{"Title":"Cocina Criolla","review":"An excellent source of Puerto Rican cuisine. I have been using this book since 1963. It was a gift from my mother in law who was a fantastic cook and whom I kept pestering for receipes as a new bride.

My grandma owns this book. All of my great aunts own it as well. And now that I'm getting married I just had to buy it. This is the bible of old school Puerto Rican cooking. It has an great amount of recipes from all skill levels. But beware, this was written in 1954, so you won't get pictures, and the recipes are all one after the other, so the layout is not as great as in some modern cookbooks. However, it has become a staple of Puerto Rican culture."},{"Title":"Cocina Criolla","review":"The best Hispanic cooking book, I lost this book and I bough it again. It is a tradition in my house, it helps me cook something new."},{"Title":"Cocina Criolla","review":"No importa a que parte del mundo vaya, disfruto de su comida y sus costumbres, pero, no hay comida como la de mi isla. Y este libro encierra ese encanto de la sabrosura de la comida puertorriquena, ese aroma que de nuestras abuelas y nuestras madres llevamos en nuestros recuerdos. Me encanta el libro, y me hace re&iacute;r el hecho de que t&iacute;as, vecinas, ten&iacute;an su \\"especialidad\\", y al hojear el libro me encuentro que esos platillos \\"secretos\\" no son tan secretos...salen de este libro. Lo recomiendo al que guste de la buena comida, al puertorriqueno que se sienta orgulloso de sus ra&iacute;ces y que aunque lejos, quiera pasarlo a futuras generaciones que crecen fuera de la tradici&oacute;n de la buena cocina puertorriquena."},{"Title":"Cocina Criolla","review":"I love this book. I reference it many times. It is very traditional. I personally have only used the seasoning chart for poultry and it came out GREAT. I have not used the book as my main cookbook because it requires time to gather all the ingredients and I personally don't have the time to chop all of that. I have to be able to throw things together quickly. My evenings are too short. But if I were a stay at home mom this is THE bible to go by.Buen Provecho!"},{"Title":"Cocina Criolla","review":"This book is excellent. I use it everytime to impress people and it works.

The recipes are still excellent and now our daughters, a new generation, continues the tradition."},{"Title":"Cocina Criolla","review":"I may be repeating what others have said ... but I became familiar with this book when I was growing up. I remember making Tembleque using this book as a kid, and it came out wonderful.My mom used this book as her main cookbook -- and when she gave it away instead of giving it to my sister and I we got really angry (because we wanted the book)! I'm planning to replace it as soon as I get a chance.The cookbook definitely has traditional puerto rican cooking. The recipes are great."},{"Title":"that which is crooked","review":"This is the best book I've ever read. Period. The poetry is simultaneously sarcastic and emotional, humble and commanding, wandering and powerful. Highly recommended to anyone who loves written words of any sort."},{"Title":"Bad Habits","review":"Ms. Lucretzia Crum has a veritable potpourri of bad habits, including (but no doubt not limited to) burping, farting, spitting, yelling &amp; screaming. Of course, because she can get away with all of these bad habits, she is the envy of her classmates to do their best to emulate her (one page shows Ms. Crum at school where, among other things, a well dressed boy is releasing a large cloud from his nether end-complete with the word &quot;poop!&quot;-and a frustrated, thoughtful teacher with green apple bouncing off her head).Her father is, of course, a mad scientist who invents fantastically rediculous inventions to keep her under control, like the &quot;burp-bung&quot; (a plunger-like invention placed over the mouth), the &quot;thief-proof pullover&quot; (sweater with long sleeves tied to bricks), and the &quot;Blowfart Inhaler Suit&quot; (consisting of a rather overinflated astronaut suit complete with hose attaching the hind end of the suit to the fishbowl helmet).The illustrations are amusingly preposterous and have a frenetic feel to them, which suits a main character that destroys everything in her path. When Ms. Crum's birthday party rolls around and some REAL monsters enter, a whole LOT of destruction takes place!! Enough to scare Lucretzia right into being good! Especially when it is revealed that these monsters used to be children who ran amok just like you-know-who...As an educator, I can see how Bad Habits! would thrill some children to the marrow-especially those who have a taste for bathroom humor. While I can see the slapstick of the Blowfart Inhaler Suit, I have to report that the book is too over-the-top for my professional and personal life (the pink monster with the giant buttocks instead of a head who is constantly &quot;blowing off steam&quot; as it were is, for me, a bit more than I'd like to expose my own child to).Is it a GOOD book?? Yes, and most children 4-8 would enjoy it. However, my fear is that they would begin to EMULATE it as well. Also, I have some difficulty with the subtext: how did Ms. Crum get to be so OLD without any discipline?? And is the correct response to excessive intestinal gas a plunger or a &quot;fartsuit&quot;?? Amusing, perhaps, but not the sort of book I would recommend without some serious forethought."},{"Title":"Bad Habits","review":"We ordered this one and found it to be funny and entertaining ! The Dad's inventions were a hoot! We have well mannered children, and they delighted in Lucretzia Crum becoming an ANGEL and giggled about her bad behavior, knowing right from wrong is one thing. Having light hearted fun is another. Any of Babettes Coles Books can be a fun entertaining experience. Lighten up.... It is a fun Read!"},{"Title":"Bad Habits","review":"We adults sometimes put way to much thought into what is a simple, funny book for a child. Kids need humor sometimes to see what is wrong with certain behaivors and the goal is to have them want to read anyway! If it is funny and entertaining they will. A sanitized version of lessons in behaivor is not only boring but it is also lost on the young learner. I say buy it and have a good laugh with your kids!"},{"Title":"Bad Habits","review":"You can't take this book too seriously it is FUN and silly and a good way to START to talk to your kids about manners. It's in no way intended to be a serious life lesson. Have fun with it, it's a riot :) Great illustrations, my kids giggled over and over from this one! All I have to do now is say the words 'blowfart inhaler suit' and it's an instant pick me up for my kids :)"},{"Title":"Bad Habits","review":"This is absolutely the worst book I have ever read.The words used in this book are rude. The habitsin this book are horrible. Children should not eventhink about being so disrespectful to their teachers,parents, and other adults. This book was a bad write.Spend your time and money reading other books ofbetter quality."},{"Title":"Bad Habits","review":"I have just recently read through this book and as an early childhood educator I find this book inappropriate to say the least. I know the importance of having books that children can relate to and to have books that teach them how to handle things correctly but, showing a little girl passing gas and monsters shaped like buttocks...I think not. I would love to know if this author has ever sat down in an early childhood classroom and tried reading this book to young children??? Children emulate what they see and hear. Can't we give them something a little more concrete to go on then a father who make his little girl smell her own gas???"},{"Title":"Fear of Wine: An Introductory Guide to the Grape","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed (and continue to enjoy) this book. I am very new to wine and this book did an excellent job of destroying the fear everyone has regarding the subject. There are cartoons throughout the book that help to illustrate how silly it really is to be intimidated by the subject. This is not an in-depth or comprehensive guide to wine, and I certainly don't think the authors intended it to be one. What is has done for me is it taught me a little bit about the making of wine, the various grapes and regions, the labeling, matching with food and then basically told me that if I wanted to learn more, I should continue exploring other books and magazines. And that is what I'm beginning to do now. So this book will not teach you all you want or need to know, but it does a great job as an introductory course and continues to be a resource that I will refer back to again and again."},{"Title":"Fear of Wine: An Introductory Guide to the Grape","review":"I received this book while shopping for suits at one of my favorite stores when I lived in Washington, DC. I had, by coincidence, become very interested in wines and had been hanging out at Clevland Partk Wine &amp; Liquor (the BEST wine shop in DC if you are ever there). I began flipping through the book and before long was having intelligent conversations with anyone who would listen about wine. Even now as a (some what) more experienced wine lover, I constantly go back to this book over others that I have acquired since. Fear of Wine is fantastic for anyone, whether they actually do still have a fear of the wine list or are just looking for more information about why the French have such a screwy rating sytem. Interested in wine? GET THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Fear of Wine: An Introductory Guide to the Grape","review":"A friend recommended Fear of Wine to me, since he knew I had recently become interested in the subject. What he told me was true: the book manages to make learning about wine really fun. The author is an anti-snob, and I found her no-nonsense approach to be very appealing; and unlike with the Idiot's and Dummies books, I didn't feel I was being talked down to. (I'm not a moron, are you?) Although I thought the book was great all the way through, the sections on ordering wine in restaurants and buying wine for home were particularly strong. Also, as a person who was only familiar with California wines, and especially Chardonnay and Merlot, the book was terrific at untangling French, Italian, and other European wines, opening up a whole new world to me, and also introducing me to other American varieties. And it seems the book isn't only great for beginners--I gave it as a gift to a friend who actually knows quite a bit about wine, and she can't stop raving about it either!"},{"Title":"Fear of Wine: An Introductory Guide to the Grape","review":"This book has a good overview of many subjects, but tends to try to answer so many questions too quickly. The early section on making wine is good, but I felt like I was taking a 3-hour tour of San Francisco. Granted that the subtitle is &quot;an introductory guide to the grape&quot;, it could have been less rushed and used the same amount of space. The sections on the different AVAs are excellent -- some of the best informative condensed coverage that I have read. The list of preferred producers of each type is very good, without tying down to specific prices or vintages. The brief list of 10-bottle and 20-bottle starter collections at the back is very helpful (and very similar to what I started with!). Good book. The informative casual cartoons convinced me to change it from four stars to five stars."},{"Title":"Fear of Wine: An Introductory Guide to the Grape","review":"This book gives a great overview of all types of wine, going methodically from grape to grape, region to region. It also gives practical advice for every situation, from wine tasting to shopping for wines to ordering in restaurants to matching with food. But the best part is the approach: It completely dispels the mythology surrounding wine and brings it back down to the simple fact that it's fermented grape juice. It is completely devoid of pretention or pomposity. At the same time, it makes very clear that wine is thoroughly enjoyable and can improve your life. I constantly refer to it, and each time I open it up I learn something."},{"Title":"Fear of Wine: An Introductory Guide to the Grape","review":"Similar in approach to the &quot;dummies&quot; books, this one brings a more adult approach without sliding into dullness or snobbery. Lightened by Teague's cartoons, it offers a noteworthy introduction to the wine hobby"},{"Title":"Fear of Wine: An Introductory Guide to the Grape","review":"This is perfect as a &quot;first wine book.&quot; It is funny, reasurring yet packed with information. I have read it over and over many times and given it to friends who have asked how I became &quot;so knowlegable about wine&quot;. If you have ever enjoyed a glass of wine and wanted to know more but were afraid to ask this book is for you"},{"Title":"Fear of Wine: An Introductory Guide to the Grape","review":"This book is very informative and entertaining -- so much so that an update would be much appreciated! Much has happened in California wine country and other U.S. wine-producing areas since the book was originally published in 1995. I ask the author to consider updating the book."},{"Title":"Fear of Wine: An Introductory Guide to the Grape","review":"A friend of mine gave this book about 9 years ago, I enjoyed it then and I still go back and read it now, it has been one the best wine books I have, easy to read and very helpful, it sure gave the information I needed to star my wine cellar."},{"Title":"Fear of Wine: An Introductory Guide to the Grape","review":"This is a wonderful book. It's accurate and EASY to READ. You will not get overwhelmed or confused while reading this material. The illustrations help a LOT. Best introductory wine book out there. A must buy for beginners!"},{"Title":"Fear of Wine: An Introductory Guide to the Grape","review":"I'm a wine person anyday, but I've been separated for a year or so from my wine-loving family, and suddenly I'm going crazy to learn more about the divine juice I grew up with. I checked this book out from the library because it was the only wine book they had; I thought the title was silly and I didn't expect to get much out of it.Maybe I was starting to turn into a wine snob; this book is fun! The title refers to a cultural phenomenon: wine is chic now, so those \\"in the know\\" are revered by those who want to be, and the wannabes spend their time around wine worrying about how wine-smart they are instead of enjoying their wine.With this is mind, the book is devoted to teaching anyone who wants to know enough to feel comfortable making decisions about wine, tasting it in public, and enjoying the hell out of it. I'm not exactly a novice -- nor am I an expert -- and I learned a lot! Better: I really enjoyed the read.There are little cartoons every other page; they're silly, but they can be cute, too, and they serve as mnemonics for those of us who need a little help remembering all that info.There's only one thing \\"wrong\\" with FEAR OF WINE: it needs to be updated!"},{"Title":"Writing: A Fact and Fun Book","review":"If you are a teacher or parent of children from age 7 up (or an adult!), and love to learn through hands-on projects...this book is an absolute MUST. I have been recommending it to my teachers (and using it myself) since the ink was first dry---many years ago. I have not found a book even to compare with this one in content, approach, or style. It not only gives the HISTORY of writing, there are a zillion hands-on projects! You want to make your own paper? Write your own book? MAKE your own book?

As Professor Joyce Malcom describes, robbery, burglary, assault and motor vehical theft in England have risen far higer (per 1000 population) than in the United States since the mid 1990s. This in spite of the fact that to minimize this shocking increase in violent crime, the British government has re-ordered the way crime statistics are collected. Car thefts are no longer investigated by Police; you call them to report a theft; they give you a report number for the insurance company. (A man called the police to report he was witnessing his car being stolen, and if they hurried over, they could catch the theft. They were \\"too busy.\\")What is most fascinating about Prof. Malcolm's book is what you can read between the lines. The wilful blindness of anti-gun people has become so overwhelming, that it induces the most bizarre behavior in these otherwise intelligent people. As she amply demonstrates, it is just not possible to find ANY statistics put out by the anti-gunners that are not flawed, misleading, or just plain false. This strange behavior has become an unquestioned religion to many, and opposition is not simply a difference of opinion, it is heresey. Malcom relates how in 1966 a thug shot 3 policemen with a handgun, causing the British Home Secretary Jenkins to slap on the public a new ban--on shotguns!! (Handguns were already illeagal.)The book is rather long detailing the history of gun use in Great Britan, but the second half paints a surprising picture of the rapid decline of public safety in almost perfect sync with a draconian reversal of previously liberal gun laws. Malcom makes an interesting effort to compare US crime statistics with those of England, but, given our culture--where more than half the population owns guns--this is often a stretch. Nevertheless, this book will certainly be the other shoe to the rancorous gun debate going on in the US, and should do much to buttress the fact that more guns do seem to result in less crime."},{"Title":"Stephen King's Dark Tower: The Gunslinger Born #3 (Marvel Comics)","review":"I really enjoyed this work of art.

The successful simulation of the pre-biotic milieu, and the identification of the building blocks of life in a 'primordial broth' ... have led us to believe that we have a firm handle to unravel this enigma.... While buoyed by these staggering discoveries, we must introduce an element of cautious restraint into our optimism that a solution is near at hand.\\"His general position is that \\"The hypothesis of chemical evolution states that the molecules necessary for life could have been formed from various energy forces acting upon the raw material which was in the earth's primordal atmosphere. It has been tacitly assumed that if similar conditions prevailed elsewhere in the universe, the same sequence of events would have taken place.\\" (Pg. 163)Concerning the theory of panspermia (e.g.,Life Itself (Touchstone Books (Paperback))), he says \\"it only removes the problem one stage further. It still leaves unanswered the question of how life began on the other planetary body from which the spores originated.\\" (pg. 13) Later on, however, he notes, \\"If ... the life we discover on Mars is very similar to life on earth, we will be faced once again with the question of whether life arose on the earth or whether it was brought to earth from another source. The hypothesis of panspermia suggested by Arrhenius might receive a new lease on life.\\" (Pg. 185)"},{"Title":"Diving Deep And Surfacing - Women Writers On Spiritual Quest, Second Edition","review":"Great book.

This (somewhat dark) fantasy romance follows Randrik and Perian, two souls who haven't quite discovered themselves yet. Randrik is a petty street con-artist and thief, making his living off of the trust and pity of others. Perian is a lost orphan who has joined the local temple in an effort to find her place in the world. Both are thrown together when Randrik realizes Perian is being used by the temple and decides to help her escape. As they make their way away from the temple guards and towards Perian's homeland, they both discover secrets about themselves and the world they thought they knew. As their mutual respect and understanding of one another grows, they learn that their part in an impending darkness is much more important than either of them could imagine. When it boils down to it, Dreams of Darkness is a tale of a flawed heroine and a somewhat conceited hero who both learn to swallow their pride and take on the responsibility left to them. A very entertaining read for those looking for a little romance, a little danger and a deep look into the main characters' emotions."},{"Title":"DREAMS OF DARKNESS: The Everdark Wars, book 1","review":"Randrik and Perian. -- Two young people. For him, Talent, good looks, and vitality itself have allowed a frivolous indulgence. For her, life and life's power have been stifled, leaving her in fear of her own vitality and, with all too much reason, resentful. Yet both have a basic integrity. And Elizabeth K. Burton has created characters and a world that come credibly to life. This is the first book of a trilogy. At its conclusion, Randrik and Perian must grow beyond the personal -- his indulgence in a life of trivial pleasure, her clinging to her fear of life, to become what their world needs of them. A pleasure to read, and my chief response at the end of this volume is to want to read the rest of the story.I also say, chalk one up here for independent publishing. I am bored by a lot of what I see from commercial publishers. In Dreams of Darkness, from Zumaya Publishing, Elizabeth K.

The fact is, it is fatal for the Drevnya to repress their emotions, and Perian's inhibitions could eventually kill her.Arrogant and devilishly handsome Randrik alt Harbinnen has a very unusual mission. He must seduce Perian in order to unleash her powers, for only Perian holds the key to destroying the imminent evil that threatens to devastate their world. There's only one problem... Falling in love with Perian was never in his plans.Written in her lavishly poetic, silkenly sensuous style, Elizabeth K. Burton has created much more than just a simple fantasy story. This is a rich unforgettable tale, filled with dazzling scenes, strong dialogue and vivid personalities. Good vs. evil, old-fashioned adventure and, at the core of it all, a heart-stopping, spine-tingling romance.

However, he prefers to use them for his own enrichment, rather than joining the Temple. His aunt, the Prime Seeker, knows this and tries to respect his decision. So he is surprised when she comes to him for help, and even more surprised at what she wants him to do. His task is to seduce one of the Temple Adepts.Perian is a Nomad who was orphaned when very young. All of her people are born with Power. But her treatment by the people who raised her has caused her to suppress her nature. If she doesn't find a way to get beyond this, she will die. The Temple hopes that Randrik will be able to do this.Randrik is reluctant to take advantage of her in this way. But the Temple is determined to follow through with their plan, and will use somebody else if he is unwilling. So he decides to take Perian from the Temple and return her to her own people. He hopes that they will be able to help her. They head for the forest, avoiding the people searching for them, and fighting the attraction between them. Will they finally admit to the bonds growing between them?I enjoyed this book very much. Randrik and Perian were very likable characters.

You are pulled into this well crafted landscape like a moth unable to avoid a naked flame.Randrik alt Harbinnen is a bit of a rouge, more interested in fighting and having a good time with women than settling down. He finds himself reluctantly thrust into the role of hero, but what is so endearing is that he tries so hard not to be heroic, that his actions are a lot more realistic. Under orders to try and seduce, Perian, a young adept at the Temple of Light, he has no idea what challenges await him.Perian is a Drevnya, a race of people with powers such as healing. She was brought up by human parents, who tried to inhibit her powers by instilling in her that they were immoral and evil. How were they to know that her powers would manifest anyway, no matter how much they tried to prevent it?Someone else has noticed Perian, Azdrefel the souleater and the creator of their world.

The pieces cover a wide variety of topics, ranging from appraisals of the works of Twain, Joyce, and Hemingway, through the rewriting of the Bible, to the decline and fall of the English language. One theme, however, is paramount throughout: the influence of Mass Culture on High Culture. Although Macdonald sees this conflict stretching back for two centuries, it greatly intensified during the 1950s. (One can only imagine how he would perceive the situation today.) No longer were art and thought the exclusive province of an educated minority. As the masses became more and more educated, prosperous, and politically aware, they also became increasingly involved with the cultural scene. That, unfortunately, resulted in a vulgarization of the traditional (high) culture.The Mass Culture (\\"Masscult\\" is his term) is not really culture at all. It is a parody of High Culture, a commodity created especially for the marketplace. It is not simply unsuccessful or bad art. Rather, it is non-art, even anti-art. Masscult offers its customers \\"neither an emotional catharsis nor an aesthetic experience.&quot; It asks nothing of its audience and it gives nothing to them. Its goal is not even entertainment, but merely distraction.Macdonald draws his distinctions between High Culture and Masscult along subtle, yet easily understood lines. The works of James Joyce, for instance, were High Culture; the works of James Michener, Masscult. Chaplin and Welles were proprietors of High Culture; Wyler and DeMille were Lords of Kitsch. Picasso, as opposed to Norman Rockwell. Early-Hemingway versus Late-Hemingway. Rogers and Hart versus Rogers and Hammerstein. Stravinski versus Elvis. Masscult is impersonal and ignorant of standards, \\"totally subjected to the spectator.\\" High culture is \\"an expression of feelings, ideals, tastes, visions that are idiosyncratic and the audience similarly responds to them as individuals.\\" High culture is the expression of a singular, unique vision; the creation of an artist.Since this conflict between High Culture and Masscult had been in existence for over two hundred years, why did it become a pressing issue during the Fifties? Macdonald sees this time as a period of increasing sophistication. \\"The West has been won, the immigrants melted down, the factories and railroads built to such effect that...the problem has [become one of] consumption rather than production.\\" The work week had shrunk, real wages had risen, college enrollment had skyrocketed, and the country was enjoying an unprecedented standard of living. Money, leisure, and knowledge-\\"the prerequisites for culture\\"-were more abundant and widespread than ever before. Consequently, the average person (Ortega y Gasset's \\"mass man\\") had the ability and the inclination to partake of culture. Unfortunately, the traditional High Culture, the avant-garde, was beyond both the ken and the taste of the mass man. He turned instead to something that was more palatable and easily digestible, something that he could appreciate, and even understand, with a minimum of exertion: Masscult. This rise of the mass man coincided with the rise of television (the altar of Masscult), the spread of the inexpensive, quality paperback book, and the long-playing record, all of which slaved to bring Masscult to a vast audience thirsting for kitsch.Macdonald believes the solution to the problem of the spread of Masscult is an attempt to define two cultures, one for the masses and one for the classes. (By \\"classes\\" he means not a social or economic elite, but an intellectual one.) He believes that there already exists a dichotomy between two cultures and it is in our interest to keep them separate. There cannot be a broadly democratic culture on a high level, not because the elite forcibly exclude the masses, but rather the great majority of people have never cared enough about such things to make them an important part of their lives. That is as it should be. \\"Let the masses have their Masscult [and] let the few who care about good writing, painting, music, architecture, philosophy, etc., have their High Culture.\\" A truly elegant, if arrogant, solution."},{"Title":"Against the American grain","review":"There's not much I can add to David Montgomery's review -- an excellent one -- about the intellectual assumptions and findings of this book. Macdonald is an elitist, and if that bothers you, then you might as well pass on this collection. What I think David Montgomery failed to mention, however, is Macdonald's superlative style. He's the most entertaining of the 'New York Intellectuals' -- more fun than Irving Howe, less stuffy than Philip Rahv, less egotistical than Mary McCarthy. (A good indication of Macdonald's openness to the opinions of others is his printing of George Plimpton's dissent on Hemingway.) I suppose the tension between High Culture and Masscult, which so occupies Macdonald in these pages, is still apparent today, although I think he might argue that Masscult has completely overrun High Culture; but what makes these essays appealing now, forty years after some of them appeared, is the felicity of Macdonald's style and the fecundity of his wit. A collection of Macdonald's best essays, put together by a sympathetic editor, might help restore his fading reputation."},{"Title":"Against the American grain","review":"I recall this tome from my youth to today's readers primarily for the first essay in the book, \\"Masscult & Midcult,\\" which first appeared in Partisan Review in 1960. MacDonald, who was on the staff of the New Yorker magazine for many years, sees Masscult as \\"a parody of High Culture.\\" He identifies \\"the enormous output of such new media as the radio, television and the movies\\" as \\"almost entirely Masscult.\\" (p. 3) The idea is that the product which is fed to the masses is not art at all but instead a kind of ersatz denaturing of art similar to bleached white flour. \\"Masscult offers its customers neither an emotional catharsis nor an aesthetic experience.... The production line grinds out a uniform product whose humble aim is not even entertainment...but merely distraction. It may be stimulating or narcotic, but it must be easy to assimilate.\\" (pp. 4-5)Curiously MacDonald was right in the same way that Marshall McLuhan was right in his Understanding Media (1964) in which he famously wrote that \\"the medium is the message\\" and in a later work, \\"the medium is the massage.\\" Masscult massages the couch potato, deadens the critical faculties of the mass mind and renders the average person fit for compliance with the needs of the corporation and the power structure. MacDonald and McLuhan predicted the world of today some 45 years ago. They foresaw the rise of the tabloids, the consolidation of the \\"news\\" into a product for the masses as a means of controlling them through a whitewash of political unreality in which attention is focused on the lives of celebrities and their antics along with lurid crime stories and fictions about what our government is doing here and abroad--all designed to serve the interests of the ruling class.What to do with the unwashed masses has always been a problem for the powerful. In ancient Egypt they were enslaved and made to build pyramids. It is not easy to rebel or even to think when you are physically exhausted. In today's society the masses are overstuffed with Big Macs and super sized with Big Gulps and reruns of \\"Friends\\" and reshowings of Masscult movies like Rocky and Meg Ryan comedies or the latest MOW from Lifetime television.But where MacDonald was wrong is in his highbrow discrimination about what is art and what isn't. True Norman Rockwell, whom he dismisses as kitsch in the same way we dismiss Thomas Kinkade, is not art--or at least not yet. But perhaps Norman Rockwell will be art someday. Shakespeare was not art to Christopher Marlowe or Francis Bacon. Shakespeare played to the mass mind of the time with tales of kings and queens and heroic princes. He provided titillations in his bawdy humor and in his comedies. Yet there can be no question of the artistic quality of his work.The point is that it is nearly impossible for critics to objectively critique and evaluate their own culture, the culture in which they are currently immersed. We have no real objectivity. It is like history can only be written by historians after the fact of the events. To write a history of current events is to write from a position of extreme prejudice because we have no perspective upon which to judge those events partly because we do not know where those events will lead.The same is true of artistic endeavors. MacDonald dismisses not just Norman Rockwell but the musical South Pacific, rock and roll, and the works of James Michener as \\"ephemera.\\" Clearly there is room for disagreement, but even today we cannot be sure which products of our culture will be remembered and appreciated by future generations and considered art. Rock and roll may become like classical music in that it is no longer popular but is still played and improvised upon, listened to and appreciated by millions. Someday rap may be considered something more than ghetto noise.I guess what delighted me as a young man about MacDonald was his ability to satirize the culture. Here is an insightful passage: \\"Life is a typical homogenized magazine, appearing on the mahogany library tables of the rich, the glass cocktail tables of the middle class, and the oilcloth kitchen tables of the poor. Its contents are as thoroughly homogenized as its circulation. The same issue will present a serious exposition of atomic energy followed by a disquisition on Rita Hayworth's love life; photos of starving children picking garbage in Calcutta and of sleek models wearing adhesive brassieres; an editorial hailing Bertrand Russell's eightieth birthday (A GREAT MIND IS STILL ANNOYING AND ADORNING OUR AGE) across from a full-page photo of a matron arguing with a baseball umpire (MOM GETS THUMB); nine color pages of Renoir paintings followed by a picture of a roller-skating horse...\\" (p. 12)Midcult fares a little better with MacDonald. He identifies writers like John Steinbeck, Pearl Buck, Irwin Shaw, Herman Wouk and John Hersey as its typical purveyors. He includes \\"the Revised Standard Version of the Bible\\" as Midcult, adding that it destroyed \\"our greatest monument of English prose, the King James Version.\\" (p. 38) Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea and Thornton Wilder's Our Town are singled out for special Midcult recognition and analysis. The irony of course is that it is Dwight MacDonald himself who is nearly forgotten while Hemingway and Wilder live on. But were MacDonald alive today he would no doubt note that ours is still a mass and midbrow culture, and so that is to be expected.The book also contains essays on Mark Twain, James Joyce, James Agee, on \\"The Decline and Fall of English,\\" \\"Howtoism,\\" and what MacDonald calls \\"The Triumph of the Fact.\\"Recommended reading for aspiring critics and students of culture."},{"Title":"CPA Review: Financial","review":"Two decades ago, I passed the Uniform CPA Examination.

Now, at the ripe old age of twenty-nine, I sometimes flip through the whenever I'm back in the waiting room and I find that my opinion has changed drastically. The stories are quite cute and many of the values are universal, but as a non-Christian I feel uncomfortable reading some of them. I'm particularly concerned by Maxwell's apparent belief (implied in a story about a broken radio) that one cannot be a good person if one is not a practising Christian. Also in the same story he tells his young audience that Jesus would \\"have to get rid\\" of those who had not opened their hearts to him. I take this to mean that those who are not Christians are doomed to hell. I realize that this is religious doctrine and that the stories were written with a certain audience in mind, but all the same I would not feel comfortable knowing that this book was being used in my child's school (particularly in a city as diverse as Toronto.) There are other ways to teach moral values without giving the impression that one group of people is better than another."},{"Title":"Uncle Arthur's bedtime stories","review":"If you have ever doubted that God takes a hand directly in the lives of children, or that he tramples out the grapes of wrath among them, or that punishment for greed and vanity is swift, sure, inevitable and irrevocable, or that compassion is like a great, warm mother, read Uncle Arthur. His stories have the power to rivet children to the spot. They know he is talking about them. Each story is a moral or Biblical lesson entire. For example, Johann is driven out of the house into the snow on Christmas Eve by \\"an angry and brutal stepfather.\\" Turned away from fine, large houses, where do you think he finds unquestioning and loving mercy? The cottage of a poor old woman. \\"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My chldren...\\""},{"Title":"Uncle Arthur's bedtime stories","review":"If you are Christian, this set of books is a wonderful way of providing an excellent example of good, moral behavior. My 3 year old son listens to them most nights before bed. It is amazing what he takes away from them - not least of which is a deep abiding faith. One day, while playing baseball, he lost his ball. I was in the garden and had no idea where it went. He looked and looked and couldn't find it. I was amazed to see him then get on his knees and pray - \\"God, please help me find my baseball\\". Unbelievable as it may be, within seconds, he found his ball. One mightthink that is a small, silly thing BUT it is one of many things that has had a profound, positive impact on my son's belief in God. My only negative comment is that if the stories are read to the very young, such as my son, the reader needs to carefully select as some of the stories illustrate rather graphically, severe consequences. My final comment is that one of the previous reviewer's complained about the Christian doctrine in the book. True. It is Christian. I too get upset by the harsh tone of some of the doctrine - however - the book is intended for bedtime as is stated in the title. Since I don't know of too many public schools where children sleep, I am not overly concerned. I believe the positive values of honesty, self-reliance, obedience and earnestness far outweigh the occasional lapses into harsh Christian doctrine."},{"Title":"Uncle Arthur's bedtime stories","review":"I'd rate these stories very high for storytelling, but also very high for their horror content. I know that the author meant well, but as a very young boy many of them were disturbingly scary and horrifying.For example, the \\"A mother's love\\" theme. In one story, a mountain climber is buried under untold tons of rock from a landslide. His mother steadfastly stands by for as long as it takes workers to uncover his body from the huge pile of rubble. And by the end of the story, the workers had hardly made a dent in that pile of rubble. The message was supposed to show the steadfast dedication of a mother. But for me, I had nightmares about being buried alive with no hope of timely rescue for many years afterwords.In another story on this theme, we read about a dirt-poor mother with a sick baby, a cat, and a lone oil lamp to provide light. She leaves her house to get medicine for her sick baby, but leaves the baby, cat, and oil lamp behind. (She'd be charged with child neglect today, but Uncle Arthur thought of her as devoted and loving.) The cat, of course, knocks over the lamp and starts the house ablaze. The mother returns to see her home a blazing inferno. Her love gives her the strength to push the firemen aside and rush into the house. Her body was found wrapped lovingly around her baby, but both had burned to death in the blaze.There are others that try to illustrate love, dedication, and devotion but for me they only caused horrific and recurring nightmares for years afterword. I dimly recall many other stories that were indeed uplifting and educational. But beware. Tales of burning to death in a blazing fire, being crushed to death under tons of jagged boulders, and other horrific scenarios might very well illuminate the moral for an adult. However, impressionable young children with active imaginations might find them illuminating their deepest and most horrifying fears instead."},{"Title":"Uncle Arthur's bedtime stories","review":"Tired of wasting that important bedtime story time reading stories devoid of moral values, life lessons, or reality? The you need these books. They are a refreshing breath of fresh air in an area where the mass media teaches parents to be freinds instead of parents. Backbone values like telling the truth, kindness, hard work, obedience to parents, turning the other cheek, timeliness, respect for authority, faith in God, and kindness to animals, humility, responsibility and honor are taught through real life stories. My kids still beg to be read these stories. I didn't think they had that much effect until I overheard them planning to do a \\"secret package company\\" (do a good deed for somebody in need anonymously) and to react to a nasty kid at school by \\"heaping coals of fire onto him\\". (being sincerely nice to him anyway) Boy was I proud...Two caveats: These were written in the thirties. The politically \\"correct\\" may not like some of the generalizations that were the norm in the day these were written. (Didn't bother me - I explained this to the kids) Second, these are real stories, not \\"superheros\\" or purple dinosaurs. The stories are of everday life. They reflect reality. Some modern parents try to protect thier kids from learning about reality. (People lose jobs, some are hungry, pets and people die, some people are uncaring, that sort of thing) Again, I think it's important for kids to learn about reality.More parents should read Uncle Arthur books to thier kids."},{"Title":"Uncle Arthur's bedtime stories","review":"I read the comments here with fascination. The Bedtime Stories never gave me nightmares, but it is true that some of the harsher aspects of life were dealt with -- abusive parents, death and dying, danger, war, poverty, loss. They were written in the days before \\"political correctness\\" was a watchword, and parenting was harsher even in good families. The stories are basically Victorian in tone -- emotional, intense, and disciplined. Uncle Arthur was a peer of my grandparents' generation and the way he speaks and the stories he tells and the conclusions he draws show him to be a man of his time, as well as a man of his particular belief system. Place him in context, and the way he tells his stories is appropriate.As a child, I liked his stories because they were about real people in real life crises, just like the real life happening around me. Through it all, there was the belief that the characters were not alone in their trials. His characters were interesting little people who weren't a bit perfect, but who still learned and grew and became better people. He taught that life wasn't easy but that prayer could get you through.Some Bedtimes Stories have stuck with me to the point that I recall their titles:Unlucky Jim -- A poor boy has a chance to choose a Christmas gift for himself, and is laughed at when he chooses a doll for his sick sister instead of the train that he wants.Teresina -- Two girls give up their beloved doll to a girl they dislike after she save their baby brother from being run over by a car.Through Fire and Water -- A brother and sister, left home alone, quarrel over a train set until they accidentally set the house on fire. The boy rethinks his relationship with his sister after she courageously fights the flames.Brave Bella -- Bella didn't want to babysit, but performs an act of heroism when her baby brother's carriage is ripped out of her hands on a windy jetty.As you can see by the descriptions, one has to look at these stories in the time frame in which they were written. Children were sometimes home alone, or out on their own, faced with decisions that an adult should have taken care of, but their belief in God helped them find their way to the better choice. That was always the underlying message in Maxwell's writings -- that through prayer, one can find the way.Debra Anne Wintsmith, Author of Precious Jewels, A Seventh-Day Adventist Family Saga"},{"Title":"Uncle Arthur's bedtime stories","review":"Like it was all roses and blossoms??

In one story, a mother has her little girl hide behind the sofa during a visit from the pastor's wife and daughter because the mother is ashamed of the girl for getting dirty while playing. She uses shame and comparison to tell her she should be more like the nice little girl who visited.In another story, Christmas is totally ruined because a domineering mother with a martyr-complex follows the poor judgment of her husband and goes out in icy weather to deliver a couple packages her \\"naughty, bad boy\\" forgot to deliver. Of course she returns with a broken arm and the son carries the guilt the rest of his life.In a third story, a woman calls a little girl an ungrateful wretch and swears to never give a child a gift again because Gertie forgets to thank her for the candy she bought. The woman happens to die shortly after and Uncle Arthur makes the point that no-one should be like \\"Ungrateful Gertie\\" who is guilty of making this woman's last thoughts terrible.This man is twisted and we cannot believe these books have been so widely used. These lessons have nothing to do with the grace of God. In fact, God and the bible are rarely mentioned. These stories are legalistic, moralistic and shaming.

However, the language is not too technical and it doesn't give you a headache to read it. Theres just a lot of information to learn, and no matter what text book you use, you'll still have to synthesize all this material. I think that all in all Lodish did a good job.

This is sometimes the case with books that have multiple authors.Another reviewer pointed out the over abundance of yeast molecular biology contained in he book. I again agree with this person. I realize yeast is where we learned a lot about eukaryotic molecular biology. But I wish the book focused less on yeast and more mammalian cell biology.

It starts from the very basics of chemistry and protein, and ends with a very clear molecular description of cell cycles and cancer. I wouldn't recommend it as a textbook for someone who's just learning the basics, especially if it is for a class, since the amount of information is sometimes too much to handle.Pros:1- Extensive coverage of most major topics in cell biology.2- Impressive level of detail, down to the function of the secondary structures in proteins.3- Very interesting explanations about how things were discovered.4- Each chapter section is divided into points. The authors show you how every point was proved. For example, to tell you vesicles need this protein to bind to other membranes, they tell you that some biologist created mutants that were lacking this protein and noticed that the vesicles were formed but were unable to bind, and a reference is present at the end of the chapter.5- Small summaries at the end of each section.6- Kept really up to date. Current articles in Nature & Science magazine usually take over where this book left off.Cons:1- There are some exercises at the end of each chapter, but they're too simple to be of any value to you except reviewing the high level concepts. There is only one \\"Analyzing the Data\\" exercise which brings some value. If you haven't memorized every single protein, you can always flip back a few pages and read off the name that you're looking for. The study guide that comes with it also doesn't have very much information. You can look at their website online but will only find multiple choice questions. The Alberts book + study guide on the other hand, does give you about 100 exercises per chapter, and that really helped me understand certain concepts.2- The book is nearly a thousand pages long and it is presented in two-column, small font mode. I found that it took me several hours to read through a single chapter.3- Somewhat inconsistent writing. Some chapters adopt a very narrative description that is smooth and easy to read. Other chapters just name every single protein involved and through a disordered approach expect you to put things together.

THE ONLY MEDIUM IS BOOKS SO I WANT ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANICA"},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"I have always believed that the First World War ranks as one of mankind's most tragic and unnecessary mistakes. This book does a fine job explaining at least a portion of how this tragedy came about, at least from the naval angle and perspective. This book has enough detail to satisfy experts, but is written in a fashion that the more casual reader with an interest in history will both enjoy and benefit from reading. This is indeed a fascinating look at an underexamined subject.Mr. Massie's basic thesis is that Germany's construction of a great war fleet (the misnamed &quot;High Seas Fleet&quot;) was a disaster for the country. Kaiser Wilhelm appears to have caused his country to build this fleet for reasons of prestige and national pride. But to Britain the existence of the High Seas Fleet was a challenge to Britain's national survival, for Britain's domination of the seas, and prevention thereof by any possible hostile power, was not merely a matter of prestige or pride. It was life and death. By building a huge fleet at immense cost, Germany produced a dagger aimed at England's heart. As someone observed, without domination of the seas, England was finished as a power, but without domination of the seas, Germany remained the foremost European power by virtue of its army and position on the European continent. The existence of the German fleet at the onset of hostilities essentially guaranteed and necessitated England's entry into the Great War on the allied side. Once Germany began waging the war at sea--a war it did not really need to fight--this guaranteed eventual American entry into the war, which in turn inevitably tipped the balance against her. Seen from this perspective, the construction of her fleet was a strategic disaster for Germany.The book is interesting for both its narrative and insight into the famous sea battles of the war, as well as for its discussion of great naval leaders. The reader will learn about admirals Jellicoe and Beatty, men who became legends in their own lifetimes. While most of us are familiar with Winston Churchill's later career as Britain's great war leader in the Second World War, many readers will be delighted to learn about Churchill's pivotal role in the First World War. The author's insights here are fascinating and controversial, but to me ring true.Although this book has perhaps more detail than non-specialists necessarily want or need, it is a relatively easy read due to the author's clear, crisp style of writing, and his interesting look at not just the facts, but also the personalities, of the naval aspect of the great war. For readers interested in learning about both the causes of the great war, and the battles at sea that comprised it, this is the book to read."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Castles of Steel follows on from Massie's previous book on Naval politics and warfare \\"Dreadnought\\", which was a narrative primarily of the German and British Naval race in the years before World War One. \\"Dreadnought\\" finished at the eve of the war, and \\"Castles of Steel\\" picks up the thread from there. I thought Dreadnought was a superb book, and held high hopes for \\"Castles of Steel\\". I'm pleased to say that I was not disappointed, although I had a few reservations.I have always enjoyed Massie's writing style, and he is true to form here. All the main players from Churchill to Jellicoe, from the Kaiser to Hipper, are portrayed in vivid character sketches which is something Massie does particularly well. Beattie in particular comes off as a love-struck pompous individual! As always his words flow very easily, which is always helpful when reading a book of this size; nearly 850 pages! Massie, as in \\"Dreadnought\\", deals with all the complex political intrigues very nicely from both the British and German perspective. The Naval actions are vividly described and make for riveting reading. I particularly enjoyed reading of the Falklands and Coronel engagement for as a WWI novice I had not known of either action.There are 6 maps produced, but the one for Jutland, which was the largest Naval engagement of the war, was relatively large scale showing the general approach of the two opposing fleets rather than individual ships. I would like to have seen a few more images, but what is reproduced are very nice pictures of the main characters and ships.I was a little disappointed that the book seemed to tail off after 1916; after Jutland, the prime focus seems to be the U-Boat war. The surface fleet is neglected after this time, but that could be that there were no significant or even minor actions taken by either side after this time; I'm not a Naval scholar so I don't know. To me, Massie does'nt seem quite as enthused when writing about the U-Boats and the counter actions by the British, but none the less, it is still very interesting. \\"Castles of Steel\\" is definitely highly recommended to all Naval and WWI historians and European political history buffs."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Robert K. Massie presents us in this book with his account of the confrontation between the British and German Fleets in the Great War. As could be expected from the author, the style of the book makes it a pleasure to read. Nevertheless, it must be considered less succesful than his previous masterpiece Dreadnought by two reasons: first, the technical and tactical details of naval war do not lend themselves easily to the human portraiture and anecdote on which Mr. Massie excels; and second, the story has been told so many times that most of the details are already known to any moderately knowledgeable person in military or naval history. This said, there are still many little known facts, for instance about the strenuous efforts of German Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg to refrain his admirals and avoid confrontation with the United States, that are very instructive in refuting the simplistic vision of a monolithic, militaristic Germany. It is also very funny in a certain sense the tale of the Jutland battle: although gunfire was exchanged between the British and German fleets, the true battle was fought, for many years afterwards, between the two British admirals John Jellicoe and David Beatty. From Massie's account, as indeed from most recent analyses (notably Andrew Gordon's exceptional The Rules of the Game), Jellicoe emerges as a far more likable figure than the bombastic and self-serving Beatty. In summary, although this book does not reach the heights of Dreadnought, no person interested in history can go wrong in reading it."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"As a rule of thumb, the usual justification for a new history book is that it either introduces important new evidence or puts forward a striking new interpretation of the events it covers. Those that do not have a habit of swiftly being relegated to the remaindered shelves.However, this book is one of those rare books that fails both these tests and yet is still very well worth reading -- and worth buying. There are two reasons for this; first, Massey's writing is of a very high standard; second, it fulfils the need for a handy account of the first world war at sea.Among Massey's many strengths are his light touch and refreshingly non-partisan approach, which allow him both to steer clear of wartime propaganda and avoid taking sides in such tedious debates as the post-Jutland controversy.While coverage of the war is not exhaustive, with Britain taking centre-stage and a number of more minor developments being omitted -- eg Souchon's exploits in the Black Sea and the events in the Adriatic -- the book makes no pretence to be either exhaustive or an academic history, and so this is not a serious fault. What it does do is to provide the reader with the main outlines, and do it well.In particular, Massey has been very successful in melding developments at the strategic level with compelling eyewitness accounts that really bring events to life. The result is that the reader is left both with a good idea of what each side was trying to achieve, and what things were like at the sharp end.Inevitably in a work like this, there are weaknesses, many of which could have been picked up by more knowledgeable editors. For example, one might well imagine that Lion was a twin screw vessel when in fact she had four; elsewhere the Hindenburg is wrongly described as having 15-inch guns. Another flaw is the relative lack of maps; while too many can often confuse the general reader, Massey has gone too far the other way.All in all, a pretty fair book, which while having wide appeal to the non-specialist, will also be read with profit by those with a more serious interest in naval matters."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"The logical conclusion to Robert Massie's Dreadnought, which chronicled the Anglo-German naval arms race, a proximate cause of WWI. Here, the navies built for such an unimaginable conflict now stalk each other, and although the book focuses on the British and German parts of the war it still is valuable for those interested in history or in vivid historical writing. Particularly valuable are the little-known but critical clashes outside Europe, notably the battles off Chile and Argentina that aren't well-remembered today -- Coronel and the Falklands -- but which were important at the time. (Indeed, Coronel was the first fleet action that Britain had lost in a century). Indeed, the end result of the naval war was the victory that the stalemated land war never achieved: the siege-by-sea that threatened both Britain and Germany with starvation, the latter breaking first, a collapse signaled by the German navy's revolt. The book does not neglect an important postscript: the post-war scuttling of the German fleet at the British naval base at Scapa Flow.Very worthwhile."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Massie's book on the naval struggle in the first world war is a highly comprehensive account of politics, strategy and tactics.He gives useful insights to the characters of importance, showing why some opinions carried more weight than others.There is a very useful level of analysis as to why a single capital ship with 15 inch guns was such a danger. The hunt for the Goeben in the early days of the war made the British look like cowards. But the days of Nelson were over, and a captain could now do wrong by putting his ship up against the enemy. Quite simply, a large enemy ship could sink a squadron of cruisers before they ever came within firing range.Jellicoe, as commander of the high seas fleet, realised that he was the only man alive who could lose the war for Great Britain in a single day. He entered the war without a secure base for his fleet, which quickly came under attack from submarines and mines.Captains were no longer in sole command of affairs at sea. The invention of the radio allowed shore based admirals and the First Lord himself to barrage captains at sea with suggestions and orders, which complicated reporting lines, and confused the situation for captains.Massie traces the resultant developments in strategy from these salient points, leading to the climactic Battle of Jutland, and the effective end of the surface war at sea.A brilliant piece of work, and a fantastic piece of naval history writing. While the book is large, it is surprisingly easy to digest, and makes for easy reading."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"After reading Dreadnaught and Peter the Great by Massie, I did not think he could write another book of such high quality, but I was mistaken. Castles of Steel is almost part two of his &quot;Dreadnaught&quot; and covers the fleet action of the Btitish fleet that was missing from &quot;Dreadnaught.&quot; Coverage of battles -- mostly in the North Sea and in the Bosphorus is as exciting as only Massie can make it. But the other virtue that Massie has is making his characters come alive -- from Churchill to the various fleet admirals -- by providing background information so intimate that the characters Massie creates become unforgettable to the reader. None of the dry biographical stuff, but the explicit good and bad of each character. Excellent descriptions of battles and battle situations, excellent description of those involved, and -- the only eye-glazing point I encountered, excellent but boring detailed parliamentary accounts, which are probably necessary to make the book whole and complete. Overall: 800 plus pages that fly by pretty fast. &quot;Castles of Steel&quot; is, and will be, the best book to describe this period to the average reader."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"I'll have to begin by agreeing with the prior reviewer, who termed this book &quot;thoroughly magnificent.&quot; It is all that and more. As a WWII buff, I'd always meant to read more about the prior war but didn't do so until a review of CASTLES OF STEEL caught my eye. It's author has a writing style that makes reading easy and enjoyable. This is what I call a &quot;fireplace book&quot; because one can just sit and read for hours on end. The only other historian to have that effect on me is William Manchester. I probably should've read DREADNOUGHT first but I'm definitely going to read it now."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"You'll have to commit yourself to reading this prolix (almost 800 pp. in hardcover), but it's worth every page, paragraph and line.Massie manages to weave an engrossing and comprehensive story of the naval war of 1914-1918, rescuing it from the shadow of the trenches that define that Great War. At the heart of Massie's book is the struggle between the two grand fleets of Britain and Germany. Massie weaves the many threads of this tale, from the Pacific to the Dardanelles, in such a way that it neither neglects the side stories nor veers away from his main thesis-the centrality of the dreadnaught v. dreadnaught race between Britain and Germany.A masterful story-teller, Massie's prose easily takes the reader in and makes it hard to set this book down."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"There is no doubt that Mr. Massie is the greatest non-fiction writer today. This volume and his Peter the Great (which I read last year) are just marvelous examples of a writer at the top of his game. I have not read his book, \\"Dreadnought\\" and although Castles of Steel is a sequel of sorts I found it a great stand-alone history. But with Massie, you get more than history. He does an excellent job of personalizing each of the participants, from the British Winston Churchill, Admirals Jellicoe and Beatty to the German Kaiser William, and Admirals Scheer and Hipper. Each chapter is like a short story well constructed to give the reader an overall perspective of events in both personal and global terms. The German's on again; off again use of submarines is presented extremely well. Even the first humorous and ineffective submarine counter offensive by the British finds a home in this history. The British, it appears, assigned teams to small boats who attempted to find German periscopes and then tried to paint the class black, or haplessly tried putting a satchel over the scope, or finally attempted to pound out the scopes glass with a hammer. Churchill we learn had a plan where he spent millions of pounds to create imitation battle ships that were ineffective because they could not keep up with the fleet. Amazing details are presented; such as how just a few knots speed advantage won specific battles. This is truly a fascinating and compelling history with both a global and personal reach. Having just read Diana Preston's wonderful \\"Lusitania\\" this volume, Castles of Steel, was a great way to put the Lusitania sinking into even an even wider historic context. I recommend Mr. Massie's monumental achievement to you, even if you are not at all interested in military history. This is history as high adventure."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Castles of Steel should be read withDreadnought.Though clearly related, Dreadnought and Castles of Steel address different times and very different themes.Castles of Steel takes one into the great naval battles of WW I and gives the best description I have yet read of the Battle of Jutland. I am reading it a second time.Dreadnought spends some time on the development of HMS Dreadnought, but for the most part is a collection of biographies woven into the events that led to the Great War.It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Germany, and particularly the kaiser, brought the war on and bear the chief responsibility for the catastrophes that flowed from it. If the kaiser's father had not died of cancer early in life and had still been ruling in the first decades of the 20th Century it seems very likely there would have been no war. He was a very different man than his excitable and immature son, Kaiser William.Reading Massie, one is struck by the remarkable degree that individual personalities played a role in events leading to the war. We constantly hear the balderdash about laws of history and economics and power, but fail to recognize that all of those are given real world consequences by individuals, some of whom are sagacious while others are reckless.In this context, it is frightening to see how accidents and the blundering of a few juvenile, stupid, or dangerous people could ignite Armageddon even when a sophisticated political class saw the danger and could not avoid it despite their best efforts. For them it must have been a little like riding in the back seat of a car driven by an intoxicated teenage boy who floors the accelerator believing it is safe to pass on blind corners. He actually gets away with it a few times.In the present, unfortunately, our political class is so degraded it seems everything is run by juveniles and none of the adults can be found. Given the lessons of WW I, that should not give reason for much optimism."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"The author's earlier book DREADNOUGHT was a great pleasure to read just as this was also. Massie is able to identify and bring to life the primary characters who were the main movers and shakers of the events and developments under study. I came away from both books with what I would like to think of as an 'understanding' of what was being written about; or at least, let me say that my curiousities of these areas of history were satisfied.A few little (or big?) qualitifers: firstly, there is an anglophilia that runs consistently in these. Not overly apparent, but something I sensed in the emphasis and depth of areas and personalities covered. Massie is still very fair, I think, in covering matters, i.e. there is no rampant Germanophobia that one unfortunately sees in other works. And to his credit, he states the facts as to how the Great War began without assigning blame to any one nation.Secondly, I was disappointed in his coverage of the so-called 'Q-ships' employed by Britain. He regales the reader with their various exploits and quite fairly assesses their effectiveness. But he does not adequately convey their political effect or discuss their relationship to international law and practice of the time. U-boats were expected to surface and challenge maritime shipping within the war zones and for years they did exactly that. Britain came to develop 'Q-ships' as armed ships disguised as unarmed and helpless merchant ships but once the U-boat was surfaced nearby they could easily suddenly open fire and sink it.My point here is that this was a very major factor in pressing the German leadership to shift towards unrestricted submarine warfare as the alternative was to sink far fewer merchant ships while losing a great many submarines - and thus lose the war. Massie, in my view, should have emphasized the causation and effect here. Instead, he talks about the German 'blunder' in going this route when in actuality it was not a matter of choice really and in fact should have been adopted at the very beginning of the conflict. Of course it would likely bring America into the war, but it was ALREADY in the war in that it was supplying most of Britains war needs. One may add that other nations used unrestricted submarine warfare - especially the United States itself during the later war, the Soviet Union, etc.I could add that he does not place enough emphasis on the issues of American etc. ships carrying absolute contraband to Britain while also carrying civilian passengers - especially American ones, i.e. the fact that the Germans had not just the right, but the DUTY, to sink these ships and that civilian passengers should never have climbed abord.America was never a truly neutral nation during the initial years of the Great War, and its developing involvement as a major supplier of one belligerent - Britain - was all about the making of money. America entering the war - to help Britain win it and thus get the loans etc. paid to America - prolonged the war by at least a year or eighteen months and led to many hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths. Massie could have, but didn't, point any of this out.All in all though, a great book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Very knowledgible and knows how to explain events in detail. I had to keep my atlas handy to see where all of these events took place. An example, I had heard of Scapa Flow from previous readings, but when this author was explaining the need for a secure base close to the North Sea, I had to search to see how it all connected. Very lengthy book, but I loved it."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"A very detailed book, sometimes more than one wants to know, but the insight into both governments as well as the ships themselves made for fine reading. A lot of effort went into this book."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Great book! It is more about the geo political situation in Europe, an the European Leader's personalities, than technical stuff about warships. I really liked how the author explains ow each leader personality and personal history influenced the decisions he took.The book is well written and easy to read. It is almost as a novel.I would really recommend this book to people who like history and want a better understanding about Europe between 1850 and 1915."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Massie is the author of Dreadnought and this book essentially picks up where the last ended, with the beginning of the Great War. I had at first hesitated to jump into this book because I had read other naval histories of WW1 and didn't expect this to be much different. Yet surprisingly the book is very engrossing and readable and full of details often not covered in conventional histories. Massie explores the personalities of the political and naval leaders of Great Britain and Germany and shows how the naval movements and battles that occurred where often the outcome of conflicts between leaders of the same nation. Politics, ambition and personality quirks were often as influential as intelligence reports and naval doctrine.Recommended for those who enjoy some fascinating history in narrative form, even if you don't really have any great interest in naval warfare."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Almost as much about navalism as just the Great War at sea.

It's a big book, over 750 dense pages. Even after I read (and loved) the prequel, Dreadnought, it still took me a long time to muster up the energy to tackle this. Probably I'm lazier than average. But once I did pick it up, I was awfully glad I did. Castles of Steel is a completely satisfying book -- first-rate writing, an engaging story, compelling battle scenes, balanced and fair coverage and judgments, helpful photos and maps. A year or two after reading it, the men and the ships at the center of the story are still vividly in my mind. Like many reading this, I've read dozens of books on naval history, and this easily ranks up with the best of them. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Having read this book a year ago I am still unsure what to think of it. The book is well written. It is very readible and its grammar is sound. Massie also adds to the dry facts by giving good descriptions of the various characters that played a part in the period. This makes the text lively and easy to get through. It reads more like a novel than a history book.Massie also manages to place the military decisions in their proper political context. Especially the part on how the Germans came to their decision to wage an unrestricted u-boat war, and how this gave Woodrow Wilson his reasons to involve the United States are insightful.However, there are a few things the reader must consider before buying the book. If you are looking for an account of naval warfare during WW 1, then this book is not it. It concentrates on the fight between Germany and the United Kingdom, but it does not deal with the naval war in the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic or the Black Sea. It also seems to 'stop' after Jutland. That battle took place in 1916 and it is as if the HSF and Royal Navy then fast forwarded to 1918. The first 2,5 years of the war take up nearly 80% of the book's pages.Last but not least the book is written very much from the English point of view. The number of pages describing the German point of view are about 1 for every 2 pages on the British point of view. So, one is left with a good view from the British side, but that view is lacking from the German side (and also the French, American, Italian, Russian, Turkish, Japanese and Austro-Hungarian side). Of course this is understandable to some extend. Massie chooses depth over breadth so choices on topics need to be made to avoid this becoming a multi-volume work.So, all in all a very good, detailed and readible book. But not the last word on naval warfare during the Great War."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"\\"Castles of Steel\\" is a term used by Winston Churchill to describe the dreadnoughts of the Royal Navy. In typical Churchillian style, it was very apt term. These ships were, indeed, castles of steel.Robert Massie's work covers World War I from just prior to the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo to the scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow in 1919. It is a majestic work that is a fitting sequel to his earlier masterpiece, \\"Dreadnought\\".It would be very easy to provide a chronology of events. Massie's wok is much more than a chronology. It is exquisitely written and moves at a brisk pace. Although it is a large work of some 800 pages, it is a joy to read. Massie deserves all the accolades that he receives.Massie cleverly reveals the personality of the main players. The reader is introduced to Churchill who as First Lord of the Admiralty would have the same role at the commencement of World War II. What a delicious quirk of fate! We are also given extensive insights to Jacky Fischer, Jellicoe and Beatty. We see all their strengths and weaknesses as well as their foibles. Similarly, we are introduced to the key German players; namely, Scheer, Hipper and the often absurd Kaiser William who, as grandson to Queen Victoria, came to lead his country of birth against his country of heritage. Sweet irony!Perhaps some readers may be put off by the thought of an 800 page history book. This would be a mistake. Massie has produced a wonderfully readable book that is most accessible. To understand World War I which, arguably, was the most important single event of the 20th century, one can do little better than read \\"Castles of Steel\\"."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Massie's latest work is a superbly crafted balance of naval strategy, personality profile and narrative description. Intricate battle scenes come to life and the reader is transported to the engaged warships and can taste the North Sea mist. This is history as an art form. Richly rewarding."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"It is seldom that one completes a work of and history. sits back and says with pleasure: &quot;Why, that was just like Baby Bear's porridge just right!&quot; But so it was with Robert K. Massie's excellent Castles of Steel, Castles of Steel is a brilliant work showing the marks of meticulous research, careful, thoughtful, and thorough analysis, and bearing the marks of professional authorship throughout.In Castles of Steel, Massie quite properly focuses on the Royal Navy and German Navy as those elements of the naval war that demonstrated the effect of sea power and influenced the outcome of the war,. He resists diversion to those theaters and incident that, while glamorous and interesting had no real influence on his theme. The book is subtitled: &quot;Britain, Germany and the Winning of the Great War at Sea:&quot; it is exactly that.The descriptions of the leaders on both sides is particlarly vivid with characterizations being expertly drawn and appropriately supported with anecdotal material. These characterizations add life and reality to the accounts and are well chosen to show the effect of personality upon events.Castles of Steel in endnoted in the modern way with no indication of reference notes where they apply. Expository notes--those which add information not suitable for inclusion in the text--are marked with asteriks and appear on the same page. This system should satisfy both those who study the book and those that read it.Both the money to buy this book and the time to read it are well spent."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Robert Masie has written an excellent follow-up to his history of the pre-World War I Naval Race. His account is more than fair to the major players, and I believe is absolutely right in singling out Admiral Jellicoe as the hero of both Jutland and the War at Sea. Jellicoe described by Churchill as the &quot;only man who could have lost the war in an afternoon&quot; served as the German fleets &quot;jailer,&quot; knowing that by keeping the fleet bottled up in German home waters he could guarantee British superiority. One story missing from the book is the battle of Zeebruge -- the commando raid on the German sub base in German-occupied Belgium. A good read."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"There is a really nifty description of a naval warfare tactic in this book that is so specific to the Dreadnought era. If two ships are battling on the open ocean when it is almost sundown, then if the ship due west has an important advantage, because the sun is in its opponent's eyes. The gunners on the latter have trouble discerning where their shells land, relative to the target. But suppose the sun now sets? Then the situation reverses totally. The east ship is now in shadow. But there is enough residual sunlight, from over the horizon, to highlight the west ship against it. It is obvious once you think about it, but how many of us have? Very nice - how the tactical situation can complete reverse in minutes, and due to the geometry of a sphere. Plus it is something that is true only of naval battles. On land, even on plains, there is usually some terrain folding to obviate this.Also, this tactic only really held true when Dreadnoughts ruled. Prior, there were sailing ships. But the cannons mounted on those had much shorter range (a few hundred meters). So it was far easier for either ship to see where its shells landed, irrespective of the sun's position. And by the end of World War 2, ships could use radar, instead of direct visuals, to aim, and also use ship-launched missiles, which could hit over the horizon."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Robert Kinloch Massie, along with David McCullough, Edmund Morris, and Doris Kearns-Goodwin, will go down as one of the finest historians in our modern era.Massie's book is so meticulously researched and detailed, it reads like a first person account of the naval battles of World War I.The reader is not only treated to non-stop action, he/she is also given an insight into the personalities that shaped the naval doctrine of the two belligerents, naval doctrine itself, tactics, and even the individual characteristics of the ships themselves.The insight into the personalities of John Jellicoe, Beatty, Kit Craddock, the Kaiser, Maximillian von Spee, Churchill, and the iconoclastic Jacky Fisher (to name a few) are the highlights of this opus magnum.This book is a fitting sequel to Dreadnaught; well worth the wait. After reading Dreadnaught's account of the naval arms race between Britain and Germany, I was left with the feeling that Massie had more to write on the subject. Little did I know that this sequel was in the works. This was both a surprise and a pleasure as Massie does this subject justice, and, as a consequence, has made a major contribution, a vital one, to the body of literature on \\"The Great War.\\""},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"I use that subject as a disclaimer, not a criticism. Some other reviewers have been upset that some portion of the naval war was not covered in this book, but this was clearly not intended as a bow-to-stern history of the naval aspects of WWI. The combination of the book's title and subtitle give it away: this book is mostly about the battleship fleets of Britain and Germany. Any other topics are covered only to the extent that they tie back to the main storyline.I was myself taken aback by the lengthy, even tedious, description of the German East Asia Squadron's trek across the Pacific, particularly when the related story of the Emden is covered in a few paragraphs. Even Massie admits in the book that the Emden story is very interesting, but I presume that since it was really a story of commerce raiding and not of battlegroups slugging it out, it was largely omitted.I had one other source of difficulty in reading this book: the lack of maps. I suppose that authors - and perhaps talented ones such as Mr. Massie particularly - feel that their prose describes any scene adequately, but Jutland could have used better graphical aids.It sounds like I didn't like the book upon reviewing the above, but I was engrossed throughout and would heartily recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Some years ago I wrote a review of the author's book Dreadnought, and quipped that his last name should be Massive, not Massie, as his books are so dang long. This one isn't as hefty as Dreadnought, but at just under 800 pages of text it's not exactly a lightweight either. There is a lot of material, here, though, and the author works very hard to make the book interesting and the characters memorable, while all the time recounting the events he's interested in.World War I at sea was dominated by a few events: the battles off South America at the start of the war, a few skirmishes in the North Sea, Gallipoli, the Goeben fiasco, and finally the Battle of Jutland. The author suitably spends a good deal of time on each of these episodes: the recounting of Spee's journey across the Pacific to the Battle of Coronel and finally to destruction at the Falklands takes a hundred pages, and Jutland takes a little more than that. There's much about the various characters involved, some of them rather obscure. Most notable is British Admiral David Beatty's wife, who turns out to have been the heiress to the Marshall Field fortune, and what the English would call an ugly American. The passage where she tries to browbeat Winston Churchill, of all people, into reassigning her husband's ship to suit her social schedule, is frankly priceless.The book's prose is wonderful, and everything is very accessible, so why only four stars? Well, there are some shortcomings in the book, too. First there's the lack of maps. It's virtually impossible to follow a naval battle without charts showing you the positions of the various ships at particular points in the day, so that you can see why someone turned a particular direction or whatever. The book has only large-scale maps which don't help you with this at all. When you get to Jutland, if you haven't got a good working knowledge of the battle already you'll only have a dim appreciation of the course of the fighting.Second the author has some eccentricities. One of the strangest is his insistence on anglicizing the name of the Kaiser of Germany to William from Wilhelm. This is just strange, and it's the sort of thing British historians did half a century ago, but Americans haven't done it in decades. The author leaves intact virtually every one else's name, so Franz Hipper remains Franz instead of Francis, and even the ship Kronprinz Wilhelm retains its German name, but the Kaiser is William. Just weird.Second, as is usual with Massie, while he understands the personalities involved well, his knowledge of the technical stuff involved in naval warfare is weak at points. In Dreadnought, he misunderstood the flaws in British battlecruiser design: here he revisits the issue and gets it right this time, even giving you information on how the Germans prevented the sorts of disasters that plagued the British at Jutland. Apparently one of the German ships (Seydlitz) almost blew up to a magazine explosion at Dogger Bank, and they took measures afterwards. But he gets the sinking of the Lusitania wrong, repeating the old story that the ship was packed with explosives which probably sunk it. Robert Ballard went down and looked at the wreck: the hold that supposedly had the explosives in it was intact and empty, and evidence in the wreck at least implies the explosion was caused by coal dust.These shortcomings aside, this is a wonderfully written book and well worth the effort if takes to read it, if you're interested in the subject, of course."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Just like his book Dreadnought, Massie's Castle of Steel is a well written narative of the British and German navies in World War I. While he has very little that is new, he takes the record and describes and explains the sequences of events in an entertaining and informative manner. Well worth the read!"},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"One of Robert Massie's best works (all of which are outstanding). Sets the top bar for best description/analysis of WWI Naval strategies and battles."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Robert K. Massie has done it again with this magisterial work. The account of Jutland is the best I have ever read. Compelling, and thoughtful, it describes the madness of building such a large surface fleet, only to live in fear of using it. Even though the Germans had tactical success, they were unable to dislodge the Grand Fleet.The personalities of Jellicoe and Beatty come through as well. I also liked the detail of the naval action in the Dardanelles. If you have read anything else by Massie, including Dreadnought, the precursor to this book, you know you are in for a treat. If you haven't just peruse the other reviewers, they will tell you how good his truly is.If you like stories about naval warfare, this book is a great primer."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"If you're ready to learn what it takes to draft a national defense budget, then \\"Castles of Steel\\" will be a good, initial orientation. No, the book is not about the impact of national debt on national security. It is about the war on the waves between Germany and England before and through the long years of World War I. It will draw you away from the mud, the trenches, and the stalemate on the ground that is so often associated with the Great War. More important, it will certainly reveal the struggles that go on in the halls of governments as war envelopes nations and leads them to wholly new conclusions about the real costs of national security, those hidden but painful expenditures that involve flesh,blood, and the fleeting days of our lives on earth. The descriptions of the actual engagements would provide Hollywood with endless source material for splended movies. Massie is a diligent and able historian. He describes and documents well how it was in the halls of govenment as well as giving insight into life in the passageways deep inside the great ships. The interplay between the services is there, the army, navy and even the air forces. Obsolescene, pride, daring, and national costs make a great mix to engage the reader."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"I purchased this book after scouring Amazon and Barnes & Noble for a good book on the Battle of Jutland for weeks. Based on previous reviews on Amazon, I settled on \\"Castles of Steel.\\" I didn't pay attention to the length of the book. When I got the book, I was a bit displeased to see it was so big. I read A LOT, but I had purchased a lot of books and figured I'd have several books wasting away for a long time on my shelf while I trudged through this book... I was wrong.\\"Castles of Steel,\\" despite it's length, is a very quick read. I found myself blazing through pages thanks to Mr. Massie's very engaging style. I loved how the book setup the political and military situations behind the naval engagements, strategies, and actions of The Great War. This isn't just a book on sea battles; it is a fairly good history of the war itself (with the notable exception that it barely touches on the ground war, which is understandable since it is, after all, billed as a book about the naval war). Mr. Massie uses a plethora of direct, first-person sources such as letters between major personalities deeply involved in the war; the bibliography and references sections take up tens of pages. This book was clearly well researched, well written, and deserves all the praise it gets.If I had one complaint about the book, it would be that the first few months of the war take up probably 50% of the book while most of 1915 all the way through the summer of 1919 takes up the rest of the book. It felt weighted poorly in that respect. However, I understand how this was probably necessary given how, post-Jutland, the naval war became very quiet in terms of traditional naval warfare. Another small criticism is that more maps and illustrations might have helped. Many of the chapters describe naval battles in painstaking detail, but without maps, it is hard to keep track of the disposition of ships. Only in the battle of Jutland chapters is there a decent map that shows movement during battle rather than simply the course of battle groups in the time leading up to the actual engagements.It's rare for me to re-read nonfiction books, especially one as long as \\"Castles of Steel,\\" but I foresee myself keeping this on an open shelf and diving back into this sometime down the road.I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in World War I or naval history. I am strongly considering purchasing some of Mr. Massie's other books, namely \\"Dreadnought,\\" as he says in the acknowledgments that \\"Dreadnought\\" and \\"Castles of Steel\\" can be placed together, with \\"Dreadnought\\" covering naval warfare innovation and how it influenced European history up to the start of The Great War while \\"Castles of Steel\\" picks up in the summer of 1914 and takes readers through the summer of 1919 and the sinking of the German fleet in Scapa Flow."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"If any lesson emerges from the naval war of 1914-1918 it's that the best laid plans can and do go awry. Add to that the comparatively new weapons of this period and virtually anything was bound to happen. Massie is a skilled master at showing the whole picture along with fascinating details, ranging from Britain's early, desperate attempts to deal with U-boat warfare (even attempting to train seagulls to defecate on periscopes) to the amazing breaking of the German naval code. All in all, an exciting description of man's devastating success in destroying others of his own kind."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"The Dreadnought, also by Massie, describes the transformation of the English and German navies just prior to WWI. Massie realizes that the personalities of the leaders and the governments matter as much to the results as the technological changes and does a masterful and suspenseful job of informing the reader of both but ends thebook at the outbreak of the war. Castles of Steel continues the drama starting with the chase of German ship Goeben by the English through the Mediterranean and up to the Dardanelles. It follows the legendary Admiral von Spee in his voyage from Japan to the western coast of South America then around the Cape to the battle near the Falklands and the tragic efforts of Admiral Craddock to stop the threat. (Even with the modern Falklands battle, I had not realized that the islands off Argentina were the only south Atlantic outpost for the English navy.) The scene moves to the North Sea, the outlet for both navies from their home port and the most likely battleground. Three battles comprised the North Sea war: Dogger Bank, Heliogland Bight and the titanic Jutland. The disastrous Gallipolli attack (with a fascinating footnote about Rupert Murdock)that ended Churchill's rise in government for years is chilling. The rise of submarines and the major combatant's ambivalence, for reasons of both political and traditional behavior, about their use is worth a book of its own.There are two terrific strengths to this book: understanding the people and the battles. Massie continues the biographies started in The Dreadnought that illustrate both navies and their governments. Jacky Fisher (First Sea Lord) was the author of the modern English navy, touting technological change and modern battle technique. Young, brash Winston Churchill, First Lord and impetuous leader is Fisher's boss and, for a while, friend. Fisher ends his career in a series of childlike rages and resignations, putting his career and reputation on line time and again, often for a paltry reason. Churchill fares a little better -- but not much -- failing to realize the depth of the military effort necessary to achieve his ends. The crucial players, though, are the admirals. Massie launches a strong and detailed defense of John Jellicoe, the mild and thoughtful commander in chief of the English. He presents Jellicoe's second in command, the jaunty and handsome David Beatty, in a much less flattering light. There clearly is a battle between the naval historians regarding the roles of each commander. Covered in less partisanship but equal detail are the German admirals: commander in chief Scheer, young (in his 50s)and smart and foiled by his Emperor; Hipper (who seems more lucky than brilliant, Tirpitz, the father of the German modern navy, and Von Spee. The governing figures are covered: the loyal Louis of Battenburg, sidelined by prejudice, the prime ministers Asquith and Lloyd George (a footnote alone makes me want to read a full biography of this bad boy), Kaiser Wilhelm, Germany's immature and ambivalent leader, Hindenburg the figurehead who waslead around by his subordinate, Ludendorff--and many more. It is not possible to understand history without understanding the moving personalities behind it, and Massie does a wonderful job of both fact and color that aid the reader.The second strength is the description of the battles. These are complicated movements of hundreds of ships. I found the descriptions of gun size, weight and displacement a bit technical for my interest levels but have to concede they are critical to understanding the reasoning of admirals and outcomes of the skirmishes that comprise the battles. Unspoken, but clear, is the odd mix of new technologies (diesel engines are rare and coal smoke both advertised position and obscured the battlefield; ships are now heavily armored but communications are by hard to see flags). Both navies have one foot in the 1800s both in their chains of commands and decision processes (submarines are \\"ungentlemanly and undignified\\"). The battle descriptions are fairly clear even for a non-military historian as I am, and at times the spray and smoke and noise envelopes the reader. Chaos is a factor in a win nearly as much as caliber; the human losses and the ways they died are horrifying. The maneuverability of the ships, the distances over which battles are fought and the difficulty of effectively commanding the squadrons is well illustrated as is the need for just plain guessing in tactical decisions. Massie describes battles well complete with why the win occurred and liberally dotted with the anecdotes that may be irrelevant but are certainly interesting (a Maori shaman gave the captain of the New Zealand charms against disaster that made the captain look a trifle odd, but seemed to work).Castles of Steel is a very good book, if not quite up to The Dreadnought (perhaps because it is more military and tactical history than its predecessor, and thus less to my taste). It remains clear, and as well written as always. I would read anything written by Massie. The two books make me feel well served in a detailed overview of the naval WWI and they are easy to recommend highly.[Dreadnought"},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Robert Massie's approach to understanding World War I through the naval battles is original and thought provoking. It is one of the best he has ever written and the prefect accompaniment to his book Dreadnought. The book tracks how the German and British navies reacted during the war and the strategies employed by both. Whether it is the chasing of cruisers around South America or the battles between the Grand Fleet (Great Britain) and the High Seas Fleet (Germany) the detail and analysis is top notch. One of the more interesting side stories that Massie pursues is the invasion of the Turkish straights. This British naval disaster is captured perfectly by Massie and its overall importance in the war done well. Through his book you see a crystallization of British strategy that explains many of their actions in World War I as well as what will occur in World War II. Wireless telegraphy being new allows the First Sea Lord Winston Churchill to personally move ships which will become his method of operation in World War II.The battle of Jutland is obviously a major focus of the book and done very well. The basic fleet movements are captured as well as the implications of strategy and the realities of command in World War I. The new development of Room 40 which was decoding German dispatches and relaying them to the British fleet proved pivotal over the course of the war. The British were not sure what to make of these initially and only used them sparingly. Following Jutland the book does an excellent job of showing how America was able to enter the war through the defeat of the German U-boats via the convoy. Overall the book is excellent and an amazing read for those who want to understand the aspects of naval warfare and World War I."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Castles of Steel is a spellbinding account of the British and German navies in World War I. Thoroughly researched and engagingly written, it brings to life the ships and the personalities who sailed in them. It also displays Massie's customary command of the political figures who ordered the navies to sea. A fine read that will be enjoyed even by those who do not focus on military history."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"I quite liked the aspects of this book that dealt with the personalities of people like Jellicoe. While the sections on the politics of the Sea War tended to drag a little overall the book is an excellent summary of the major battles at sea during WWI. I rather hoped the sections on the submarines would be longer but the focus of the book was more on the dreadnoughts and battlecruisers."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Where was the Great War won? Massie makes a convincing argument that the answer to this question is for a great part on the high seas.This seems like a strange position given that the clear and decisive naval battle in the mold of Trafalgar of which both sides ultimately dreamed never occurred and for months on end the battle fleets rode at anchor. But ultimately it was the grand fleets blockade of which strangled Germany of much needed war materials and supplies, and lead to the decision to reply with unrestricted submarine warfare which resulted in the American intervention.The ability to maintain this blockade was due largely to the focus and control of the Grand Fleet by Admiral John Jellicoe, a man who was aware of many unsavory truths about his large powerful fleet such as the inferior gunnery of the British sailors and the weakness of the design of the British ships which had sacrificed armour for improved firepower and developed a strategy of preserving his fleet and only giving battle when he could bring his superior numbers to the battle.Upon this background Massie paints a picture of incredible bravery such as Craddock leading his outgunned force to defeat at Coronel, missed opportunities which could have lead to disaster to both fleets, muddled strategies from the highest command leading to futile campaigns such as the Dardanelles.Overall a fascinating and engaging history of Great War at sea"},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Massie is indeed a worthy member of that class of historians that, like Barbara. Tuchman, knows how to blend scholarship with great style, colourfull life and even entertaiment. In this case Massie deliver a full frescoe of the sea side of WWI. Petty and great men, big plans and microscopic decisions, madness and skill, folly and intelligence, all goes toguether and give to us a complete, detailed and at the same time overarching vision of that fateful but aparently second rate and often even quiet theater that was sea fight in the Great War.The degree of detail of sometimes the most minute details -how may shells were expeded by that ship in that battle- will satisfy Psycho historians buff as me, but also a more casual -or theoretical- reader will meet the great line of the facts, the big picture, the big men.Being a big book, I read it, nevertheless, in three days. It has been one of the most pleasant readings I have made since years."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"I read this book because Dreadnought was excellent. I read Dreadnought because Nicholas &amp; Alexandra was excellent. I read Nicholas &amp; Alexandra because Peter the Great was excellent. None of these were historical periods I was particularly interested in, but Massie makes them interesting. He brings these people to life. Now I REALLY understand what Churchill meant when he said &quot;Jellicoe was the only man who could lose the war in an afternoon&quot;. And then there is German Chancellor Bethman-Hollweg, not merely a mouthpiece for the German military, but a man who seemed to be the only one in Berlin who understood the consequences of unrestricted submarine warfare. If you have only a casual interest in World War I and you've never hear of either of these men, read this book. One more thing: Castles of Steel stands alone. It's been years since I read Dreadnought. You need not read the latter to enjoy the former, but enjoying the former will probably lead to reading the latter."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"This book is a good read and a fine overview of the Dreadnought era and the politics and societies of the time. However, I find it sometimes digresses a bit too much on the genealogies of various noble families for my taste. Also, it has a large number of small mistakes. Just 3 exemples from the first 50 pages, the Kongo had 8 main guns, not 10, the Warrior did not blow up at Jutland, she foundered, the cruiser C&ouml;ln was not spelled K&ouml;ln. I know, little things, but when I spot these things I wonder what else is wrong that I don't spot?There are also a number of sweeping statements that are more or less groundless. For example, at the end of the Jutland chapter, it says that this was the last time German dreadnoughts went into the attack! The expression \\"go into the attack\\" is of course vague, but the statement is wrong even if seen in a narrow Anglo - German perspective. German dreadnoughts were out on offensive sweeps the fall of 1916, and German dreadnoughts fired on British ones in the 2d Battle of Heligoland in 1918.All in all, a readable book, useful as a general introduction to the era or WW1 naval warfare, but readers should beware that it contains a number of errors in details and is prone to sweeping generalizations. I would recommend Halpern for a general history, or Campbell for details."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"The naval companion to The Guns of August.Massey's Castles of Steel is a concise history of the First World War at sea focusing on the Dreadnaught showdown between the British and German Empires as well as some peripheral topics such as the Dardanelle Campaign, and the German U-Boat blockade.The book follows a dynamic narrative style that is remarkably easy to follow though at time the chronology is a bit hard to follow as the author has, for readability sake, chosen to follow specific people or units at times rather than adhering to a strict chronological format. Massey's training as a journalist is evident in the style and flow of the work. It is also a time period with which he is very familiar as his previous books have focused on the Russian Revolution.The historical sources used are many and reliable. When there are differences in his sources he generally reconciles them very well. He also uses a significant number of primary sources rather than relying on other author's work. However, he does make appropriate nods to previous historians especially when he adopts their theories or explainations. Most notably he references John Keegan often.I found the book to be a wonderful introduction to WWI at sea. I consider this book to be the naval companion to Barbara Tuchman's The Guns of August and think that any one seeking a basic yet comprehensive understanding of World War One could do far worse than reading these two books. As such I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Naval history or WWI."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"During the mid 1990's, I spent several enjoyable months reading Robert Massie's \\"Dreadnought\\". It was one of those books that I hated finishing. Every chapter brimmed with wonderful anecdotes and stellar writing. I put \\"Dreadnought\\" right up there with Barbara Tuchman's \\"The Guns of August\\" as one of the classic accounts of the Great War.At 780 pages, \\"Castles of Steel\\" requires an act of faith to pick up the book and begin reading. Fortunately, Massie delivers a well written account of the naval war between Great Britain and Germany. All of the major sea battles of the war are examined with careful but not pedantic detail. Fortunately, as a work of popular history, Massie does not need to bog down his story with the obscure details an academic history would have to include. There will probably never be a better written popular account of the Great War at Sea.Unfortunately, Robert Massie has to crowd in an awful lot of history into his 780 pages. What gets lost in his account is the well told anecdote and the rich background detail that made \\"Dreadnought\\" such a pleasure to read. There is just enough background writing to make one miss reading \\"Dreadnought\\". \\"Castles of Steel\\" would have had to push on a thousand pages to fill it with the same level of detail. To give but one example, Massie never informs his reader about simple details such as what is the difference between a light cruiser, a fast cruiser and a battle cruiser. The maps and pictures also do not do justice to the story being told.All in all this is a very good acccount of naval warfare during the Great War. I will probably never have to read another book on this subject. However, \\"Castles of Steel\\" does not rise to the level of classic like \\"Dreadnought\\" or \\"The Guns of August.\\" I would be willing to bet that in 40 years, \\"Dreadnought\\" will still be in print and \\"Castles of Steel\\" will only be found in libraries."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"I have to say this book is another success of the author.His &quot;Dreadnaught&quot; is one of the best books I've read.Anyone who is interested in the history of sea power and the world war may regard this book as one of those best on this topic.A &quot;must-have&quot;."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"&lt;u>Castles of Steel&lt;/u> is an outstanding narrative history of naval planning, engagements, successes, failures, and government in The Great War.

Massie's prose is memorable and engaging (you don't find yourself flipping back to remember what you read a few chapters before). Castles of Steel reminded me a bit of The Prize (Daniel Yeargin) -- full of anecdotes that made me laugh out loud or get goosebumps, pulling together decades of influential people, developing countries and scientific/technological progress into a lucid and easy-to-appreciate narrative.

I have enjoyed his writing and his story telling for years, and this particular book greatly.Just how exciting can a ship chasing another be? With Massie, it is an encounter of persons and an age, it is not just the ships, but the ideas that made the ships, the ideals that forged them and the men that commanded and sailed them to that moment in time when the two ships met.An amazing and enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Robert K. Massie has produced another masterpiece of narrative history, comprehensive without being dry and fascinating in every detail. In Castles of Steel he takes up the story he started with his 1991 bestseller Dreadnought: the struggle between Britain and Germany for sea mastery during the Great War.The book begins with the final days of peace in July 1914, when Europe realized that the assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand was about to trigger a major war. Massie describes the calculations of the British and German leadership as they moved toward conflict. One of Massie's greatest skills as a writer is his ability to create short but thorough biographical sketches, seen here most vividly in his treatments of Jellicoe and Beatty, the men who were to lead the British Grand Fleet. Massie also has an eye for odd humorous moments, as in his amusing description of the trick a German ship played on an unsuspecting French colony soon after war was declared.After the war actually begins Massie focusses on the manuevers of the British and German fleets as they prepare for action. Another narrative track traces the steps of the politicians like Winston Churchill and Prince Louis of Battenberg who are setting war policy. Massie's main focus is on the British, and he thoroughly analyzes successes like the Battle of Dogger Bank and disasters like the Gallipoli landings. The climax of the book is the Battle of Jutland in 1916, which was the only major clash between the two navies. Massie also documents the submarine war and details how it eventually brought the United States into the conflict. The last few pages of the book describes the scuttling of the surrendered German fleet at Scapa Flow, symbolic of the enormous waste caused by the whole conflict.Castles of Steel is a fitting companion to Dreadnought and will certainly be considered one of the most comprehensive, yet accessible, histories of the Great War."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"For those of you who have read Mr. Massie's &quot;Dreadnought,&quot; which detailed the German/British battleship &quot;arms race&quot; leading up to WWI, and who have been waiting for years for the sequel....here it is. And is it great! Fans of the author know that he is a master of narrative history. His books read like good novels, and he excels at capturing personalities with telling anecdotes. At the beginning of &quot;Castles Of Steel&quot; he explains how Kaiser William compensated for his withered left arm, and basically useless left hand, by building up his right arm. William also wore large rings on the fingers of his right hand. He would shake hands with a steel-like grip and watch with amusement as his victim winced. To quote the author &quot;...the hand shaker said merrily, 'Ha ha! The mailed fist! What!' &quot; This small episode not only tells us a lot about William's personality, but the expression he uses also reminds us of his Anglophilia (he was, after all, Queen Victoria's grandson). In a similar way, Mr. Massie conjures up the characters of other people who are important to this story. On the British side: Beatty, Jellicoe, Churchill, Jacky Fisher, David Lloyd George, etc. On the German side: Hipper, Scheer, Tirpitz, Hindenburg, Ludendorff, etc. The major pre-publication concern about this book would have been: could Mr. Massie satisfy not just the fan of narrative history but also the fan of military history. After all, unlike the author's previous books, this book was to be primarily about battles rather than personalities. It turns out that we needn't have had any worries on that score, either. In particular, the descriptions of The Battle of the Falkland Islands and of Jutland are brilliant. The author explains the events leading up to the battles, the strategy, the tactics, etc. He takes us, in a clear manner, step-by-step through the battles and the aftermath. You feel as though you are on-deck with the various admirals as they make their decisions. Mr. Massie also covers the importance of Naval Intelligence during the war - the British, early on, broke the German code and usually knew ahead of time what was planned.(Despite the fact that, seemingly by magic, the British fleet always seemed to pop up whenever the German fleet ventured out to sea, the Germans refused to believe that their codes had been compromised.) Things might have turned out very differently in the several North Seas battles if it weren't for this. Mr. Massie also covers the British blockade of Germany, the Dardanelles/Gallipoli fiasco, the U-Boat War (and the sinking of the Lusitania), the entry of the United States into the war, etc. Another big plus for this book is that it will probably generate disagreement and discussion amongst academics and serious students of the war. Mr. Massie isn't afraid to tell us about who he admires and who he doesn't much care for. Thus, he clearly thinks Jellicoe superior to Beatty (especially at Jutland)and he thinks Jellicoe was treated in a very shabby manner by the politicians - especially David Lloyd George. Mr. Massie, while admiring Churchill, thinks he made many mistakes during his tenure as First Lord (and not just during the Dardanelles/Gallipoli period), and that these mistakes were caused by Churchill's overconfidence, coupled with his total lack of any background regarding naval affairs. Setting aside Jacky Fisher's histrionics and peevish personality, Mr. Massie generally gives the First Sea Lord high marks for his perspicacity regarding military matters. After all, Fisher made the WWI British navy what it was, and he also realized the importance of submarines. The author makes a strong case that Fisher clearly knew that the Dardanelles/Gallipoli campaign, if done the way it was ultimately done, would be a huge mistake. Churchill, with his youth, energy, eloquence and misplaced (in this case) self-confidence wore down Fisher and, at least for awhile, got the First Sea Lord to shelve his doubts and get &quot;on-board&quot; regarding the scheme. Mr. Massie takes the sensible view that the German use of unrestricted submarine warfare forced a very reluctant Woodrow Wilson to commit the U.S. to the war. While American forces didn't win the war, the huge numbers of fresh troops streaming into Europe made it clear to Germany that she no longer had any realistic prospect of victory - hence, the German decision to accept an armistice. Mr. Massie wisely steers clear of counterfactuals, but it is interesting to think about what might have happened if Germany had resisted the use of unrestricted submarine warfare and the U.S. had stayed out of the war. At the very least, the one million German soldiers who were freed up for use on the Western front due to the collapse of Russia would not have been counterbalanced by the flood of American troops. A minor criticism of the book is the lack of maps. They are few and far between and some more would have been very helpful in following along during the extended battle sequences. But, hey, when a book is this good...well, you can't have everything!"},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"I would think that anyone who read and liked Robert Massie's \\"Dreadnought\\" should appreciate his new \\"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea\\". As in the earlier book, although the ships and navies of the two rival nations are always at center stage, it is the people who built those ships and directed their activities and operated them and - in this book - fought them that really make the text vivid. And what personalities! Winston Churchill, the extraordinary Jacky Fisher who was the true father of the Dreadnought-type battleships that defined the era, the glamorous Admiral David Beatty who captivated the British public, Kaiser Wilhelm, Admiral Franz von Hipper ... If anything, the narrative in \\"Castles of Steel\\" is even more compelling than that of the first book because it deals with the drama and chaos of World War One itself. Massie's narrative lucidly explains the course of the naval war from the very opening days until the German High Seas Fleet scuttled itself after the conclusion of hostilities to prevent its delivery to its enemies. Along the way, several complex, controversial episodes are examined, including the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign and the Battle of Jutland, the great clash of battle fleets towards which decades of naval technical development had been aimed. Massie does not shy away from exploring the bitter in-fighting that erupted after the guns of battle had fallen silent, and he appears to present the arguments on both sides of controversies fairly. Although his portrait of Winston Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty is as an ambitious politician whose directives sometimes seeded chaos rather than order, Massie by no means holds Churchill solely or perhaps even chiefly responsible for the Gallipoli debacle. The admirals and generals on the spot are shown to have repeatedly erred and provided London with faulty advice. With Jutland, Massie's basic sympathy is clearly with the quiet, somewhat cautious Jellicoe rather than with his flamboyant subordinate, David Beatty, who according to Massie later did much to rob Jellicoe of deserved credit while evading blame for his own errors. Although the great dreadnoughts and battle cruisers - the \\"castles of steel\\" of the title - are never far from the main narrative thrust, U-boat warfare and diplomatic maneuvering (and the politics of the British Admiralty) are given their due.Although a long book at over 800 pages, \\"Castles of Steel\\" is nonetheless a powerful, fast-moving history of naval warfare as it emerged into the modern era of steel and radio."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Dreadnought is a fantastic book. Though I am a naval history buff, I recommended this book to my family and eventually almost everybody read it and enjoyed it. After that, perhaps my expectations were too high, because when \\"Castles of Steel\\" finally arrived I was sorely disappointed.Fundamentally, it may be that Dreadnought just tells a more interesting tale. Dreadnought tells how the kaiser's naval ambitions drove Germany into conflict (seemingly unnecessary) with Great Britain thus virtually determining the origin of WWI and arguably from that much of the history of the 20th century. Along the way it draws in other bits of fundamental 20th century history, such as the start of the hunt for Middle East oil to fuel the most modern elements of the British fleet, and early parts of Winston Churchill's career.In contrast, once the war started the British had an almost insurmountable advantage and German timidity in light of that meant there was very little actual combat. Thus \\"Castles of Steel\\" may be anti-climactic simply because the events were. Massie might have been better served if he had trusted his original instincts and ended his study with the start of World War I.The best parts of the book are the biographical sketches, most memorably of Beatty, a wildly flamboyant character who would be well worth his own biography...except Massie basically has written one in the confines of this book. But no character comes across as well as Fisher and Churchill in Dreadnought. The Jutland account is well done, though not necessarily better than others (there are many, none particularly better than any other). But Corelli Barnett manages to do Jutland some justice in just four pages in his \\"The Great War\\", again illustrating how anti-climactic the story is.I hate to give this book 3 stars, because there is nothing really wrong with it. Maybe I'll just lower your expectations and you'll enjoy it all the more..."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Even a reasonably serious general reader of World War I histories is likely to be far better acquainted with the war on land than the war at sea. After all, what else is there to know besides the Battle of Jutland, the sinking of the Lusitania, the German U-boat offensive and the reactive convoy system? OK, some may have heard of Dogger Bank and recognize that Gallipoli was originally an entirely naval operation until practical difficulties turned it into the disastrous land offensive which has become synonymous with misadventures of the kind. That's it, right? Actually, no, not by a long shot. And if you want to know the &quot;rest&quot; of the WWI story, and perhaps come to agree with the view shared by Author Massie and many other historians that British sea power was the war's ultimate determinant, then this is the book for you.Another reviewer points out that the book appears to have been largely derived from secondary sources, and that may well be true. But Massie's masterful amalgamation, if you will, nonetheless produces a stunning panorama that if not entirely original in its sources, is surely an example of the very finest scholarship of the kind and an &quot;original&quot; in both its sweep and its marvelous presentation in terms of language and story-telling.I made the same &quot;secondary source&quot; comment about Winston Groom's 2002 book on the fighting in the Ypres salient, &quot;A Storm in Flanders,&quot; but there is between the two works a distinction with a considerable difference. The Ypres story has been written about with sufficient frequency over the last 90 years that any new telling runs the risk of being downright familiar to serious WWI readers, and so it is with &quot;Storm&quot;; I could have sworn that I had in hand only a slight variation of the several works on the subject I have read. Thus, my conclusion that Groom's book amounted to little more than a nicely turned out rehash. Not at all worthless, just of limited value to the serious WWI reader.Such is not the case with &quot;Castles&quot;. The book undertakes nothing less than a thorough account of the entire war at sea and succeeds like nothing else I have ever encountered. Secondary the sources might have been, but the result is indisputably first-rate. Take our &quot;five-star&quot; word for it: you will not only enjoy the read, but will forever after be comfortable that you understand and appreciate the significance of the &quot;forgotten&quot; side of the war."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Dreadnought was a masterpiece! I eagerly looked forward to Castles of Steel. I enjoyed it, but found that it fell one star short. Massie's genius is his interweaving of biography into history. Dreadnought did this brilliantly, especially with Jackie Fisher. While Castles of Steel has extensive biographical passages on the various British leaders (including a risque love verse by Beatty), it is sadly lacking in biographical information on the German leaders. The only German leader who gets much coverage is Ludendorff, a General. I cannot believe that there are no sources of biographical information on Hipper or Scheer.The other shortcoming, which is really why I deducted one star, is the paucity of maps. There were maps showing where the battles happened, and the initial tracks for Jutland, but three or four maps of the various phases of the action at Jutland would have been very helpful, given the confusion of the battle iteslf. I would also have appreciated maps of the other actions in the North Sea. The map showing the location of the sinking of the Luisitania is a waste of a page.All in all, a good, engaging read, but it could have been better."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"This book is simply the best, most extraordinary and knowledgeable account of the Great War at Sea 1914-18. No other study or similar volume compares to what Mr. Massie has done here.This book follows on his excellent account of the build up to the Great War and the development of the dreadnought. His last book on this subject (Dreadnought: Britain Germany and the coming of the great war) detailed the great naval arms race that made war 'inevitable'. This book details the actual conflict.The author argues that while the arms race made war inevitable the German high commands decision not to boldly use the navy condemned it to failure. The author tells many fascinating tales in his book. He has excellent character sketches of Churchill, Scheer and Tirpitz. He also looks at the amazing story of the 'Goeben' a German surface raider.He looks at the advent of unrestricted submarine warfare. He also looks at the battles that did take place like the River Plate(Falklands) and Dogger Bank as well as the bombardment of British coastal cities by German ships.The climax of the volume is the battle of Jutland. The author tells in stunning detail every action packed minute of this epic clash of steel on the high seas.An amazing book, sure to be THE standard on the subject for years to come. Massie's prose is beyond comparison, he writes history to make you feel it, to give you an appetite for the wide range of subjects he touches upon.

All the major battles fought between the British and Germans are clearly written and describes here as well as some of the more interesting characters of the naval scenes. The author appears to be firmly in John Jellicoe's camp. Although at first look, it might be a general history of war at sea, its not. This is more or less, a strict view from the British point of view with a few German bones tossed in. French naval activities are almost non-existence in this book.I think I read in one of the previous reviews about lack of maps. This I think is one of the major weaknesses of this book. Author is now writing military history book instead of policy oriented book of Dreadnought. In military books, you need to have maps of battles you are writing about. Somehow, I think Mr. Massie missed the ship on this one. It would have been nice if he included more photos as well, photos of men and ships that he was writing about.But overall, I found this book to be a great read and lucky of me, I do have other sources in my library that got the maps and photos. While I don't think reading Dreadnought is a mandatory thing before reading Castles of Steel, it would probably helped greatly if people did read Dreadnought first. The author provides interesting insights and the book proves to be well written and researched."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Robert Massie is a master of compelling popular history. Castles of Steel is a masterpiece. It is a retelling of the sea war during WWI, particularly from the British point of view. The sea war has always taken a back seat to horrific ground war--the astounding losses in single ground battles made the sea war seem insignificant in comparison.And so it is. But Massie has uncovered a fascinating story, in particular the standoff between the British and German fleets in the North Sea. His recounting of the Battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland make for compelling reading, as are his description the two great South American battles (the defeat of the British at Coronel and the British revenge at the Falkland Islands).He tells his story crisply. His prose is clear and exciting. And he goes below the mechanics of ship movements to introduce us to some wonderful characters: the doomed Admiral Craddock, the victorious but ultimately ill-fated Admiral Spee. Likewise the two great British admirals, the impetuous Beatty and the beloved Jellicoe.I read the book in giant gulps late into the night.Highly recommended to any lover of popular history."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Robert Massie has done it again -- another &quot;Massive&quot; tome on a topic that doesn't initially seem fascinating, but turns out to be a spellbinding narrative of central importance. Before reading &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, this book's predecessor, my understanding of the Anglo-German naval race was limited to a dry few paragraphs in general histories of World War I. Massie put the drama and all its personalities at center stage and showed how crucial Kaiser Willhelm II's vanity fleet was in provoking Britain's turn toward the Entente, an alignment which proved fatal to the Second Reich.&quot;Castles of Steel&quot; picks up the story with the outbreak of war in the summer of 1914. It is much more of a military history than its political/diplomatic precedessor, with detailed and often gripping descriptions of naval battles and pursuits. Massie neglects to offer a basic tutorial on the ships of the day, so it's up to the reader to learn on the job about the differences between battleships and battle cruisers, twelve inch guns and eight inch guns, coal and oil power, etc. But it can be done. Massie is at his best in describing the action of surface fleets. Each naval engagement of the war, from minor skirmishes and raids to epic battles like Jutland, are given microsopic treatment. Such a detailed narrative allows Massie to draw insights that might be invisible from a simplified overview. Events in war cause subtle chain reactions. One British admiral's caution in interpreting Winston Churchill's muddled orders lets a German ship escape and leads to his court martial; a few months later, on the other side of the world, one of his colleagues charges into a fatal and pointless battle to avoid the same fate. The escaped German ship is decisive in swinging Turkey into the war; within a year Churchill's career--and perhaps the war itself--is on the line in the daring and hapless Gallipoli operation to knock Turkey out. And so on.Castles of Steel will thoroughly dispell the notion that the two great fleets were largely passive throughout the war (excluding Jutland) and that the naval war was a bit of a sideshow to the real action on land. He shows how decisive even an indecisive result at sea could be--as long as Britain could maintain its blockade on Germany while avoiding strangulation of its commerce by the U-boat campaign. Massie is also strong on showing how Jutland--whatever its tactical outcome--must have been a strategic defeat for the High Seas Fleet, since it left the U-boats as Germany's only offensive option at sea. That in turn led to America's entry and Germany's certain defeat on land. Massie is not as interested in the details of the U-boat war. Although his chapter on the subject is able and informative, he does not attack it with the same passion and detail as he does the surface ships. In that he resembles his hero in this book, Admiral Jellicoe, a master of surface warfare who respects and fears these new weapons, but does not really make them his own.Like most military histories, this book could have used about ten times the maps the editors saw fit to include. Massie's narrative is masterful, but visual aids will always help to track the complex movements of hundreds of ships.I also wish that Massie had spent as much time getting inside the heads of the German commanders and sailors as he did their English counterparts. There is an inexplicable gap, for example, between the professional, courageous and highly capable High Seas Fleet at Jutland in 1916 and the demoralized, mutinous ships that failed to stir themselves from port eighteen months later to seek a final confrontation with the British. What happened to these men who had once been eager for a fight, and who claimed never to have been defeated? Massie gives us a few clues--the effects of the blockade, the deterioration of Germany's position on land, the (mostly) universal reluctance to engage in suicide missions. But this is one of the rare points on which the reader wishes for more detail.Still, Castles of Steel is a marvelous effort, and I am willing to pick up whatever Mr. Massie cares to write next and carry it straight to the cash register--that is, if I can lift it."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"I don't think I have much to add to what's been said before, other than to simply iterate alongside many other people my enjoyment of this book.I felt that this book, alongside Dreadnought (same author), gave a wonderful historical view of events that surrounded and led up to WW! (though pre-WW1 discussion is predominately found in Dreadnought, not this book).I relished the discussion of the different personalities involved. And found the apparent lack of naval battles following the arms race quite ironic!Great reading, and highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Massie's book is an apt,worthy sequel to his earlier DREADNOUGHT.I feel the former is best read in association with latter.Action opens with the escape of German battle cruisers Goeben,Breslau to Constantinople. Despite its superior fire power ,numerical preponderancethe British Mediterranean fleet failed to intercept the passage of German ships. This by no means a small achievement when one considers the fact Goeben's boiler tubes were leaking horribly which reduced steam pressure retarding its speed. Besides both German ships were powered by poor quality coal.For nearly 4 years two powerful navies in the world locked horns in a mortal combat designed to establish control over seaways. Despite all the encomiums heaped on Grand Fleet fact goes the former failed to annihilate German High Sea Fleet.Twice during the course of engagement at sea [Dogger Bank,Jutland] Admiral Scheer's fleet managed to evade destruction.This can be attributed to poor battle coordination among different units of Grand Fleet and frequent communication breakdown which resulted in faulty manoeuvres.This becomes all the more galling considering the fact Room 40 of British admiralty pierced German naval ciphers and was knowing latter's plans in advance.So great war at sea descended into a tactical stalemate.It was also due to German fleet's reluctance to come out of its den and fight.However Allies came very close to breaking deadlock at Gallipoli campaign.I feel if the British had vigorously pressed the attack on the narrows as Churchill and junior officers of Admiral de Robeck's staff wanted chances were Royal navy could have broken into Sea of Marmara.Admiral Robeck lost his nerve when two of his ships struck mines and sank.Ironically, at that point the Turkish resistance was also losing steam as she was fast depleting ammunition stocks.This crucial fact some how escaped British notice with the result allies failed to exploit opportunity. Here is where good intelligence comes very handy.Book ,it appears ,does not attach much importance to sub surface war. Though the fact goes German U boat posed most formidable threat to Britain's maritime supremacy.Allied war effort teetered on the brink due to depredations of U boats. Finding difficult to withstand the strain admiral Jellicoe pleaded for more destroyers to serve as convoy escorts. Americans obliged which partially diminishes the scale of Grand Fleet victory over German High Sea Fleet.Ultimately American intervention proved crucial ,decisive. Wheather US was truly neutral before she embroiled herself in hostilities with Imperial Germany remains debatable. I feel US was uneven its application of neutral laws.After the imposition of British maritime blockade of Imperial Germany London started seizing American vessels on specious pretexts . Though President Wilson lost patience and wanted to protect American rights, he had no will to use US naval forces to pressurise London to accept American principle of freedom of sea. Instead US drifted into a war with Germany.Let me say this a true neutral does not intervene in the quarrel of others.Here covert American support unnecessarily prolonged war which would have ended in a stalemate.Under such circumstances ,European balance of power would also have been restored which could have precluded the emergence of Hitler and his Nazi party upon the post war European political landscape.Despite the triumph of Grand Fleet,she could not savor victory.Admiral Scheer had the last laugh. British attempt to lay their hands on High Sea fleet was frustrated when Germans scuttled their ships at Scapa Flow in the Orkneys.Book's tenor in unmistakably anglophile so I liked it only in patches.For instance,author's narration of voyage of German East Asia squadron across the pacific was gripping,colourful.The squadron was intercepted destroyed in the battle of Falklands.On the whole a well-written book.. Author has again couched the text in a beautiful prose. A significant addition to growing literature on Great War at Sea."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"I am a huge fan of Robert K. Massie, and have enjoyed all of his books (&quot;Nicholas and Alexandria&quot; and &quot;Dreadnought&quot; were my favourites). This book shows all of the virtues of this very fine popular historian: fluent prose, well drawn individual portraits, absorbing anecdotes and skilful expositions of complex historical events. I particularly enjoyed his account of the naval campaign at Gallipoli, and his description of the Battle of Jutland ranks in my opinion (along with John Keegan's Jutland piece from &quot;The Price of Admiralty) as the best short account of Jutland ever written. However, readers who are new to Massie should know what to expect: the book is written almost entirely from secondary sources and what he presents is an excellent synthesis rather than an original interpretation; there is little new here. Minor quibbles: I wish the coverage of the German side had been more thorough, and perhaps Massie could have covered the Graf Spee story in fewer pages."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"My knowlege of the war at sea 1914-1918 was limited to Jutland so I read this book to instruct me in the overview.

It is an excellent book."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"As always, Massie brings us traditional narrative history in a style that actually makes the story of a horrible war &quot;fun&quot;. This is almost a novel with its focus on the characters and physical events of the naval conflict in World War I. While I enjoyed reading the book, I recommend it with some warnings.First, Massie is so enamored of the glory of the great navies of World War I, that I felt he lost the thread of what seemed to be his major premise: that the British navy won World War I for the Allies. If I am right about what he set out to show, I feel he failed; the story simply isn't integrated into the other events of the war sufficiently to establish the claim. In this regard, anyone looking for a serious analysis of the impact of the naval conflict on the war generally may be disappointed.Even for the general reader, it is somewhat bizarre that almost 700 pages of this 800 page tome are about the first half of the war and the last half gets only a cursory review. This is a result of the focus on the exciting head to head battles of the war, the Falklands, the Goeben, the Dardenelles, etc. and of course Jutland; these big events were over after Jutland and after June 1, 1916, Massie is reduced to telling about the U-Boat war and the scuttling of the fleet and Scapa Flow six months after the war ended but it is, nevertheless a little wierd. Other minor quibbles are that the maps are totally inadequate and the photo selection poor. Still, as I said, this is a &quot;fun&quot; read (if that is the right expression for a book that is relating evens in which over and over again, a thousand men disappear in an instant). Generally, those who enjoyed Dreadnought will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"I wish I could take all the five-star reviews I have written and change them to four star reviews, so that I could adequately express how great a book this is.

The accounts of the sea battles--Coronel, Falkland Islands, Helgoland Bight, Dogger Bank, Jutland,--are very well-done and make those events clearer to us than to the people who fought them. This is a sheerly stupendous work and anyone who has any interesst in World War One will be thankful he or she has lived to be able to read it. The only mistake I noted is that he refers to &quot;Senator Williams of Tennessee&quot; when he means &quot;Senator Williams of Mississippi.&quot; Other than that one mistake this is a perfect book and is I am sure the winner of my &quot;Best Book Read Award&quot; for this year."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"What factors led to the Allied victory in the First World War? This question has been answered in a variety of different ways by historians and authors since the guns fell silent in November 1918. For historian, Robert Massie the underlying cause of Allied victory was their control of the seas. In \\"Castles of Steel,\\" Massie continues the naval history that he began in \\"Dreadnaught.\\" The book begins in July 1914 just as the Kaiser is boarding his yacht to take his annual pleasure cruise around the North Sea even as the powderkeg of the Balkans is set to explode. From there the book explores every major naval action of the war - the initial attempts of the British Navy to draw the German fleet to battle, the destruction of Von Spee in the Falklands, the naval action at the Dardanelles, the rise of unrestricted submarine warfare and the final surface culmination at Jutland. Massie also brings to life the commanders of the fleets, offering biographical sketches of important personages such as Beatty, Spee, Jellicoe and Fischer. Through the telling of the naval history, Massie asserts that the Allied victory at sea can ultimately been seen as the reason that they won the war. He argues that because the wars on the continent were bogged down in the mud of France and Belgium, true victory could only be achieved at sea; and this victory was ultimately won by England. Massie argues that the British navy's successful blockage of Germany forced the Germans to resort to unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic and that it was this policy that ultimately brought the United States into the war on the side of the Allies. Massie also says that it was the sailors unrest aboard Germany's surface fleet that in 1918 broke into full scale mutiny and that this mutiny spawned more civil unrest that spread across the country and led to the government calling for an armistice.Massie has managed to write a very readable and interesting account of the naval history of WWI. His style is easy to read and makes what might have been in other hands a difficult read, interesting and enjoyable. Massie's attention to detail and the amount of research he completed is obvious. He also manages to be fair to all of the commanders involved in the actions, citing both their failures as well as their success and examining what their legacy has been. His evenhandedness in this regard is most evident when discussing the strategy of the Battle of Jutland and the legacy of that battle after the war. After the war a number of books were published attacking Jellicoe's tactics at the great naval encounter (a number of them sanctioned by Beatty himself). Massie examines each the major charges leveled against Jellicoe and determines if they can be supported by the actual historical record. The result is a more accurate look at the actual mistakes made during the battle.So what of Massie's underlying argument that it was naval power that forced the Germans to the peace table. Massie certainly presents a strong argument that British naval power forced the Germans into a series of desperate (and bad) decisions that cost them the war. I think Massie argument is almost certainly a valid one. With the Russians out of the war and the Germans having one front to deal with, 1918 should have been a time of ultimate victory for them. Instead, by the end of the year they were suing for peace. While the American troops that came to France in 1917 and 1918 were by no means superior soldiers to those of Britian or France, they were fresh; men not exhausted after four years of continuous, barbaric war. The arrival of the American troops forced the German high command to recognize the possibility that they would be facing an almost inexhaustible supply of fresh reserves if they continued the war. And American involvement in the war can be almost directly traced to a German U-boat sending torpedoes into the site of the Luisitania in 1916. And a German policy of unrestricted submarine warfare was the result of the strangling blockade that the British navy had placed around Germany and the inability of the German fleet to draw the British into a battle. So in the end Massie's argument is certainly a plausible one and makes for an interesting and informative read."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Thinking that a second of his battlecruisers had just vaporized under German shelling at the Battle of Jutland in June 1916, British Admiral David Beatty muttered: \\"There's something wrong with our bloody ships.\\" Then he ordered the ships to move in closer for another attack.This episode, apparently quite famous in Britain, sums up the great ambivalence of the British view of war at sea in World War I. On the one hand, Beatty represents the best of British naval history - the aggressive and supremely confident commander angling for the offensive that will annihilate the enemy as Nelson did at Trafalgar. On the other hand, there was something wrong with the bloody ships. Why didn't the British navy wipe out the German navy? Was this the first hint that the world had finally caught up with the British Empire?Massie picks up where he left off in \\"Dreadnought\\" to tell the tale of what happened to the great ships created in the prewar arms race. He tells the tale primarily from the British perspective, and his essential thesis is that the Brits should not be quite so ambivalent about the naval theater in World War I. The British strategy under Jellicoe, the commanding Admiral of the Grand Fleet, assumed that the German High Seas fleet in an of itself posed no threat. The goal, then, was not to take big risks in an attempt to wipe out the German fleet. Rather, the British goal was to maintain control of the seas, and if the Germans wanted to hide out in port for much of the war, that was just fine.Massie persuasively demonstrates the soundness of Jellicoe's strategy. It was this control of the seas that allowed the Allies to slowly starve the German populace and war machine and, with the assistance of tenacity of the British and French troops on the Western Front (and with the not inconsiderable help of a 4 million man American army), win the war.In addition, Massie sees the one great battle between the two full fleets, Jutland, as a great British victory. Britain lost more ships, but the Germans turn and ran when met with the superior firepower of the Grand Fleet and essentially stayed put in port thereafter. The battle is described with great vividness, and Massie can write a wonderful historical narrative.Still, while focused on the British viewpoint, Massie gives the Germans their due. Beatty, who commanded a squadron under Jellicoe, foolishly failed to consolidate his forces and was trounced by German Admiral Hipper before Beatty successfully lured the rest of the German fleet back to Jellicoe, who gave them a good shelling after choosing the precisely correct maneuver. It is also clear that German engineering of their ships gave them important advantages. To be sure, German guns were less in number and were smaller in caliber. This size difference was critical at the time - it allowed the big British ships to stay out of the German range and just pound away. But German gunnery was far superior to the British, and unlike the \\"bloody\\" British ships, German ships were built not to sink.Yet, while the Germans had begun to match Britain in naval engineering and seamanship, they could not hope to compete with the naval machine put together by the British Empire over the centuries. The Brits had ships, bases, allies, men all over the world. Thus, the German Far East squadron, when it tried to wreak havoc and return to Germany never really had a chance. The German High Seas fleet stayed in port for good reason: it takes more than a few good ships to control the seas.Massie tells the tale of the shifting of the naval war to the submarine and explains how the convoy system won the war at sea.The Gallipoli disaster is well told and Massie tends to be pro-Churchill. Churchill bears responsibility for the disaster, but not sole responsibility. As for Beatty, Massie can't help but admire him, yet, in the end, portrays him as the lesser man to Jellicoe and as a political operator who treated Jellicoe and Churchill quite shabbily.The book's focus on the personalities and thinking of the high command is a flaw. The story of war is the story of logistics, luck, and the performance of junior officers and men at critical turning points. Commanders think they are moving chess pieces, and their thinking in doing so is fascinating. But it is also frequently a delusion, and Massie would have done well to turn some of the focus away from the high command.This is a wonderfully written historical narrative and sustains its essential thesis that the big ships and overall superiority of the British navy helped win the war."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"This very long, but extremely well-written, book begins where Mr. Massie's book &quot;Dreadnought&quot; ends, the initiation of the Great War. This book, of course, does not focus on the land battles per se, but rather on the naval aspect of that conflict. Most reasonably educated people of my generation are fairly familiar with the continental battles on the Western and Eastern fronts, but the sea engagements are very much less well known. We were taught that the Battle of Jutland was, more or less, a British victory, and that was it out at sea, except for the U-boat attacks which eventually led to America's entry into the war on the side of the Aliies. This book goes into great detail concerning all of the sea engagements of the conflict, and gives the reasons behind what happened, both the England and in Imperial Germany. We see the internal conflict within the German high command over the use of subs at sea to attack neutral ships, and the eventual triumph of the hard-liners in that struggle, which did lead to the fall of the German Empire. We meet, once again, our friends Churchill and Jackie Fisher from the previous book, and learn the inside details of the Dardanelles and Gallippoli compaigns. This bok corrects the knowledge imbalance about the Great War battles, and is excellent reading for anyone interested in the whole story of that awful conflict."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Robert Massie is that rare creature - a popular historian who also does his research properly.

The steel battleship, that most splendid of boy's toys, so beloved of admirals and the public too, had an amazingly short lifetime. From the Royal Navy's Dreadnought of 1906 to their ultimate expression in World War II, battleships lived a mere forty years. World War II brought Germany's splendid Bismarck, Japan's Yamato and Musashi, and several American classes, the best of them being the mighty Iowas.But it also brought naval aviation, so that for most of the war the magnificent giants were dinosaurs, often reduced to shore bombardments. Hood vs. Bismarck, after all, lasted but three salvos; Bismarck vs. Rest of Royal Navy was hardly a match; and Japan's godzillas fell to naval aviation. The only big-gun fleet action of the war was, I think, 1944's Battle of Surigao Strait, a reasonably satisfactory demolition derby between Nishimura of Japan's Force C and our Navy's reincarnated Pearl Harbor survivors.So battleships had only World War I in which to show their stuff. Robert K. Massie's big, rich, Omaha-steak of a book tells us all about it.Much of this war has long since faded to sound bites; at sea we get the Lusitania, submarines and a spoonful of Jutland, and that's about it. Fans of naval rifles, mines and torpedoes get get much more than that from Massie. The author of &quot;Dreadnought,&quot; he knows tactics and strategy, facts and figures, winners and losers. He also knows--is master of--detail and anecdote. In his telling these distant events have the smell of cordite and remote personages come alive on their quarterdecks (and behind their desks).Garmany's High Seas Fleet was markedly smaller than the Royal Navy, but it had better ships, shells and shooting. Still, the Royal Navy had its great tradition, fighting spirit and confidence in victory while the Germans were often crippled by caution. Massie is superb at showing how the Germans finally lost and the British clumsily won.Minor events and major are all here, coherently presented. There are Coronel and Falklands; Dogger Bank and Battle of the Bight; the Scarborough Raid (Germans shelling beach resorts); the submarine war; and of course that mighty set-piece, Jutland. There the German High Seas Fleet won the silver medal tactically, giving a real smacking to the Brits, who nevertheless took the gold: At the end, the Royal Navy ruled the waves and the Germans had to run for their lives. (Oddly, it was an American newspaper that best summed-up Jutland, saying &quot;The German fleet has assaulted its jailer but it is still in jail.&quot;)Massie is especially good on the allies' attempt to force the Dardanelles with a fleet of battleships that would then steam up to Istanbul and shell Turkey out of the war. Ships usually come out second-best against fortresses, which don't sink, but here the risk was thought worthwhile: Most of the battleships involved were elderly and due for scrapping anyway. In fact the early stages went well for the allied armada, but when things began to go wrong, the allies were suddenly averse to risking their floating antiques, and the Turks managed to make them quit. (Later, embarrassment led to catastrophe: Gallipoli)The principal characters, vividly sketched, are Churchill, blundering toward political oblivion, and two admirals. One was John Jellicoe, &quot;inventor&quot; of the dreadnought or modern battleship. A cautious but decisive commander, he trained his fleet well and never used it rashly. He understood that so long as the Grand Fleet remained intact, Germany could never break the allies' strangling blockade. And although the Germans escaped at Jutland, Jellicoe did them terrific damage. The other admiral was David Beatty, head of the battlecruiser squadron. He was brave, dashing, good-looking and outgoing--just the sort of hero the media loves.Unfortunately he was also a relentless self-promoter, a jealous back-stabber and a bloody fool to boot. At the opening of Jutland he attacked at top speed, leaving his slightly slower but more heavily armed battleships behind, and his gunnery was poor, so his command was savaged by the outnumbered but hard-shooting Germans. Beatty wasn't the only fool involved. Ashore, the Admiralty bungled their intelligence work; afloat, rear elements of the Grand Fleet saw German units escaping--but didn't report to higher command, thinking someone else surely would.No, not the only fool, Beatty, but surely the worst. The British public was disappointed by Jutland; they wanted a Trafalgar and, failing, that, a scapegoat. Beatty made sure they got one--Jellicoe--whom he and the press blamed for letting the Germans get away.By two copies of this book so you can give one to a friend. What arguments you'll have!--Bill Marsano is an old devotee of naval combats, hardcover and soft."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"It's hard to imagine a 900 page book is incomplete - but it is. The narrative is well written and very engaging, but I found myself using other resources such as an Atlas with better charts and the Internet during my reading to better understand what was happening in the battles. The book could have been improved by more and better maps [especially of Jutland - showing Jellicoe's turn, the German turnabouts and the German escape through the British wake]. A few tables incorporating sinkings and outcomes, and comparing ship types would have helped. What is the difference between an armored cruiser and a battle cruiser? Finally, a short epilogue indicating the ultimate ends of the the main characters [Jellicoe, Fisher, Beatty, the German admirals] would have tied things up nicely. It would have been nice to see Jellicoe's 1914 'tactics' letter in an appendix [I found it on the 'Net], etc. Excellent writing, but a few things like this would have topped it off....."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"...but at the same time perhaps a little disappointing. This is probably the most &quot;readable&quot; account of the Royal Navy in the First World War that I have read -and I have read quite a few- but at the same time I kept feeling that something was missing. Part of me wonders if it has nothing to do with Massie &amp; the mere fact that the really important part of naval strategy in the Great War was making sure that Nothing Happened dooms any account to &quot;something missing&quot;. At the same time however I feel that Massie could have made use of a better editor in this follow-up to his really interesting first volume on the pre-war Anglo-German arms race. Here we all too often have the text of a message or letter as it was written TO someone &amp; then a few pages later we have the exact same text repeated as it is received by someone -it makes one keep thinking &quot;but wait, we already KNEW that!&quot; More than half the book is devoted to the first year of the war, and much of the rest revolves around Jutland, and while I was fascinated by the accounts of Coronel &amp; the Falklands, I wish that Massie had perhaps given more time to the smaller engagements &amp; perhaps to the sheer tedious hell of the blockade. At the same time, given that I am discussing an author who has already shown a predeliction to battleships (and who writes superbly about them) I probably shouldn't complain that very little of this book goes anywhere that a battleship or a battleship enthusiast hasn't gone. Massie touches on the personalities &amp; issues of Jellicoe vs. Beatty, Churchill vs. Fisher, and Fisher vs. Everyone, but I wanted more. I am probably just greedy, but to me an ideal Massie would have been a trilogy: pre-war (already done extraordinarily well in his DREADNOUGHT); The war's outbreak through Jutland as a Vol 2. and post-Jutland to 1942 &amp; the effective end of battleships in the South China Sea in Vol 3. Lacking that this is still a &quot;must have&quot; for any fan of the Navy, but I feel a little like Beatty must have felt when the High Seas Fleet surrendered without a fight:Well, this is glorious, but it isn't exactly what I wanted."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"This book is about World War I - how it was won and lost, and hardly ever is the awful topic of trench warfare mentioned. That's because author Massie's thesis is that World War I was decided at sea.I read this book as a sequel to Author Massie's Dreadnaught. That earlier-written book (see my review) was a history of the people and their decisions over a half-century which led to World War I. The actual ship, Dreadnaught, and naval affairs in general, were not the featured material covered in that book.Naval affairs are the only material covered in Castles of Steel. The two books are not really prequel and sequel to one another. The only common thread is the war.Author Massie starts with the basic national strategy of England - that everything was subordinate to naval power, and the basic national strategy of Germany - that naval power was purely a defensive weapon used to prevent England from using her superior sea power against Germany.Starting from these points little one would expect happened. England husbanded their strategic resource, fearful of \\"losing it in a single day\\" (Churchill's view). Germany, with a stalemated (failed) land campaign in France sought local use of their naval power in the North Sea as a way of reducing England's strategic advantage.Massie describes the Battle of Jutland in 1916 as the outcome of those two approaches - Germany sought offensive advantage and England sought to preserve. He identifies the resulting standoff as a strategic defeat for Germany because it didn't lessen the dominance of England's naval power and their blockade of German shipping.He then shifts the focus to America, and submarines. Germany, struggling to survive under England's blockade of war and civilian materials, develops a new weapon and strategy for using it. The weapon is the rechargeable submarine. The strategy is to sink some and then all cargo-carrying ships using that weapon starting with giving some and then no warning. Massie shows this might have been a winning strategy had Germany fully applied it in time. They didn't because they feared angering neutral America by sinking ships loaded and departing from their ports.Massie fills 900 pages with facts and the references to document them as so. But, there is very little speculation about \\"what ifs.\\" That's my only criticism. Castles of Steel is a recitation of history. Being so well informed, armed with the massive results of his research, author Massie could have speculated about alternatives. I would like to have read his opinions about personnel decisions (swap Jellicoe for Beatty or give von Hipper more power sooner), strategic decisions (husbanding England's fleet in Scapa Flow vs actually using it or Germany starting unrestricted submarine warfare in 1915-1916 instead of 1917-1918), or weapons (changes in the distribution of warships, cruisers vs battle cruisers vs dreadnaughts vs submarines).But that aside, this is a wonderful read - a story of how World War I was really decided vs what we were all taught. Five stars for quality!"},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"A great book. Can be considered a companion book to \\"Dreadnaught\\", by the same author. Both books are well researched, with a huge bibliography & index.

I'm sad to have finished it. Too bad DREADNOUGHT isn't available on CD so I could listen to it while running :)"},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"If this is your subject area then you will love this book. It focuses on the penultimate naval events of the era and is absolutely worth the read. It picks right up from his previous book Dreadnaught."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Castles of Steel is the \\"sequel\\" to Massie's superb Dreadnought. Dreadnought covered the unification of Germany, the establishment and massive expansion of the German Navy, which catalyzed the gradual deterioration of relations between Britain and Imperial Germany which was a prime driver of WWI as we know it. Castles of Steel takes up where Dreadnought leaves off and provides a very good history of the conflict between the Royal Navy and Kaiserliche Marine, with particular emphasis on the personalities involved, especially on the British side.This leads me to my only criticism of the book, it is very Anglo-centric. While we get lots of material on the personalities and political machinations of the major British players, Fisher, Churchill, Jellico, Beatty etc. we get much less detail for the German side of things. Although Massie faithfully reports what Pohl, Scheer, Tirpitz and the Kaiser are doing, he doesn't seem to have researched them and their interactions as thoroughly, especially on a personal level, as he did the British.Readers should also be aware that this isn't (nor is it intended to be) a comprehensive naval history of WWI. Operations in the North Sea are covered in fair detail, as are Spee's initial successes, his pursuit and eventual destruction. The U-boat war is covered concisely in a couple of chapters, as are operations in the Dardanelles. The flight of the Goeben is covered fairly thoroughly. There is little or no information on any other aspect of WWI at sea. The book is almost completely innocent of any mention of the Russian, Italian, Austrian, French or (aside from Goeben) the Turkish navies. Nor are operations in the Mediterranean (outside of the Dardanelles) covered. However, to my mind this isn't really a criticism of the book, as it was intended to be a sequel to Dreadnought, and advance that story. As such, much of the material mentioned above would be \\"out of scope\\" for such a work. But I did want to mention it.Despite these very minor shortcomings, this is really an outstanding book. I recommend it highly to anyone, especially anyone who enjoyed Dreadnought. In fact, I would go so far as to advise that this book not be attempted until the reader has finished Dreadnought. If you enjoy Dreadnought, you'll really want to read this one. If you didn't enjoy it, this is just more of the same."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Robert Massie completes his extensive history of dreadnoughts in this 2nd volume (following Dreadnought) with an exhaustive history of capital ship activities (and some relevant actions that involve smaller vessels) in WWI. Well written, he takes time to develop the story line describing both the ships and the personalities that were responsible for them. I found of particular interest his analysis of the relationship between Fisher (the father of the dreadnought concept as well as the battlecruiser)and Winston Churchill (who was First Sea Lord during much of the conflict).A must read for anyone who has an interest in Navel history.The only negative was the copy editing of the Kindle edition. Most of the paragragh breaks were missing, making it difficult to follow at times. Also hyphenation was hard coded at times, therefore depending on the font size hyphenated words would appear in the middle of lines. While I do not begrudge the price of the Kindle edition in this case, I do feel we deserve much more care in copy editing."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Trenches are undoubtedly the image that comes to mind when one thinks of World War I. But after reading Castles of Steel, one will also have to imagine massive 15-inch guns firing at ships 10 miles away and moving at 25 knots. I was happy to discover that the naval history of the Great War is quite interesting. This book brought it all to life.In COS, Massie provides the most readable historical account I've encountered. I believe other reviewers have pointed out, and I agree with them, that this readability does not come at the expense of historical rigor, either. I now have a far better understanding of how the Royal Navy defined the British Empire and how the Kaiser's High Sea's fleet threatened that order.I hoped, too, that this book would give a decent overview of World War I generally; as it was the first really in-depth book I've read on the Great War. It turned out to be a good but not great introduction, at least insofar as introductions typically offer breadth instead of depth. I hardly consider this a fault; the book was not intended to be broad. Nevertheless, I'll point out to someone with similar hopes that there is almost no discussion of armies in France or Germany other than political references to the stalemate. There is decent discussion of who was allied with whom and why, as well as who was trying to remain neutral. There was a surprising amount of ground-battle discussion as it related to Gallipoli, since that Mediterranean campaign was so intertwined with naval action. And finally, it was quite strong in its discussion of how America was drawn into the war. In that particular regard, I doubt a better introduction could be found (at least if Massie's thesis, that it was mainly a maritime matter, holds up.)But simply as naval story, the book was superb. The institutions that once were Royal Navy and Imperial Navy hold my elevated respect. It is easy, through Massie, to conjure up images of men being men, shoveling coal like beasts in an inferno, pushing ships 2, 3, 4 knots past their rated maximum. It is easy to picture those same men full of honor, giving three cheers for their admiral and for the King as they steam into epic battles against hundreds of ships.And yet, COS is far from a fairy tail. The old ways of war begin to crumble; monarchies defer to cabinets, sailors that had been gentlemen begin murdering, respect for one's enemy quickly gives way to hatred. Before the war, the Royal Navy and Imperial Navy held friendly competitions, by the end of the war, starvation blockade and unrestricted submarine warfare had taken hold.So, through the lens of naval history, we see the full transformation from gentlemen's war to the horrors of modern, democratic warfare. And at the center of this transformation is Winston Churchill, whose bungled years at the Admiralty are marked by overzealousness, close-mindedness, and overall incompetence.Ultimately, COS, though not intended to be an introduction to WW I, and certainly lacking introductory breadth, is nevertheless a unique place to start one's learning about the Great War. For whatever it lacks in breadth, it is certainly a deep recounting of the naval history, and I suspect in that depth one will find all the important human themes of the Great War which make it such a pivotal moment in time."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Having read \\"Dreadnought\\". buying this sequel was automatic on account of how well the first volume was written. \\"Castles of Steel\\" is a worthy sequel, that has an extensive bibliography, and is extremely well written. This book gives an excellent overview of the entire theater of operation, though I felt that this volume provided a bit more British than German perspectives, whereas \\"Dreadnought\\" appeared more balanced in approach. Nevertheless, the subject matter is extensive and fascinating and certainly complete in coverage. You will want to purchase books that focus on particular battles if you are looking for high detail but there is no doubt that this is just about the best narrative summary out there. This book is brimming with fascinating personalities and describes flawlessly their interactions and how these warring spirits stamped the early 20th century."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"I'm a naval history buff and greatly enjoyed how Massie fleshed out the characters involved in his history of WWI at sea. He did an excellent job portraying the men who fought the war at sea and in the war offices back home. An even-handed novel, he doesn't demonise the either side which makes for easy reading. If you want an account of Derfflinger's 'death ride' this isn't the best place to go, but for a greater understanding of how the great fleets were destined to be used, and how the men in charge got things done, this is a very excellent place!Recommended!"},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"This is one of the better books on the naval engagements during WWI. Massie's strong narrative carries you right along. I learned Churchill was a blundering fool, I came to have more appreciation for Jellicoe and what he was up against both politically and militarily, and I learned Beatty was a p*ssy-whipped prima donna.The naval battles are lovingly recreated. Massie fills the novel with anecdotes which make these historical figures seem more real than they already are. Well-written and a careful attention to detail make this one a must have for anyone who is interested in this conflict. It could have used more maps detailing the intricate movements of the fleets, but that is its only flaw."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"While I may not be able to do Castles of Steel as much justice as the reviews preceding mine, I can add my appreciation for Mr. Massie's work to the growing list of admirers. As I stated in a previous review of another Massie work, his ability to craft the text into a \\"historical story\\" is unparalleled. From brief excerpts on specific naval vessels, and their crew, to the thoroughly intimate discussions between Jacky Fischer and Winston Churchill, Mr. Massie tells a thought provoking and stirring history of the \\"War At Sea\\" during the Great War."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"I checked out this book from my local library for two reasons: one, because I love reading about the World Wars. Two, as a personal challenge to show that I can read a serious history book under my own steam. With this book, there was no chance of failure of the latter.Don't be fooled by the 800-page length; \\"Castles of Steel\\" is an easily-read, well-balanced blend of politics (the machinations that drove the First Sea Lords Prince Louis of Battenberg and John Jellicoe from office), biography (the strained and loveless marriage of Admiral David Beatty and his American wife, Ethel), and tactics (the blunders and coups of The Battle of Jutland). Massie is clearly more interested in the people, though; the personalities and tendencies that variously led to victory or defeat are never far from the fore, though I hesitate to call it a book for the \\"great man\\" theory of history. More OT: the book is user-friendly, meaning you don't have to know ships and naval terms backwards and forwards to get it, or even have more than a basic background in WW I history.The quibbles I had with the book are more matters of personal preference and interest than of any real faults; for instance, Massie continually switches between--for instance--First Sea Lord and Winston Churchill. I also would have liked to have seen a treatment of submarines equal to that given to dreadnoughts, but well--this *is* about the Grand Fleet, and the prequel of sorts *was* \\"Dreadnought\\", so YMMV.Definitely worth a read for WW I or British Navy buffs."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"It's hard to believe that the events covered here happened roughly 100 years ago. My Grandfather fought in WWI and used to tell stories about it. This book covers the WWI naval war in sweeping detail. Many war historians present naval battles beginning with the two fleets meeting in battle, this book starts with the origins of the war, what each side was trying to accomplish and why decisions were made which led to the various battles. This is a long detailed complex history. I'm rating it at four stars rather then five because at times it's hard to follow, you may find yourself having to go back to an earlier section to make sense of some of it, I think the author assumes we know more about WWI than we actually do but in general this is an excellent comprehensive history well worth reading."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Robert K. Massie, the author of Nicholas and Alexandra and other great books on Russian and WW I history has done it again. I have read several books on the naval aspects of WW I and this is clearly the best one. It is an exciting read, while not sacrificing the details of the history.This book reads more like a great novel than the thoroughly researched and detailed naval history of WWI that it is. It starts with the development of the German navy and the role of Kaiser Wilhelm II and his relations with his British cousins. It goes on to detail the internal rivalries in the British and German navies, both within the services and with their civilian leaders. One gets a clear view of Churchill's tenure as civilian head of the British navy and of what many regard as his meddling, particularly with regard to his disastrous plan for the campaign at Gallipoli. In addition to Churchill, he makes personages such as the Kaiser and Admirals Jacky Fisher, John Jellico, David Beatty, Reinhard Scheer, Franz von Hipper and Alfred von Tirpitz come alive. In addition to being the story of the men who led the fight, this book covers all of the battles in great detail and with great clarity. Massie shows how the weight of knowing that he could lose the war if he lost the fleet caused Jellico to take on a very cautious stance and how Beatty was forced into much the same posture when he succeeded him. He also shows a similar restraint on the part of the Germans, but in this case it was the Kaiser who, fearing the loss of his beloved fleet, hobbled it. This book is also more than just about the naval aspects of WW I, but also clearly shows how they influenced the war as a whole (particularly in regard to unrestricted submarine warfare and how this brought America into the war). All in all, this is sound history presented in a highly entertaining and exciting manner."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Robert Massie won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography (PETER THE GREAT: HIS LIFE AND WORLD) so there are some credentials here. He also wrote DREADNOUGHT and the curious reader may wonder what is in this book and not in DREADNOUGHT and vice-versa because much of this book is about dreadnoughts, the \\"castles of steel\\" of the title. In CASTLES OF STEEL, Mr. Massie takes us through the naval history of WW I from the hunt for the German warship Goeben in the Mediterranean to the climatic (and anticlimatic) battle of Jutland to the defeat of the U-boats. It is quite a story and covers the political events in as much detail as the naval actions. It is fascinating to learn how the Allies did finally defeat the U-boats and exactly what caused America to enter the war. The battle of Dogger Bank is described as is the Gallipoli Campaign and Room 40. The personalities and lives of the major players are related including love affairs and rivalries. President Woodrow Wilson's role in trying to broker a peace before finally throwing in the towel is recounted. With 880 some pages there is plenty of detail and you can image the research that went into writing CASTLES OF STEEL. Mr. Massie certainly knows his ships and his writing is entertaining. The only complaint I have is Mr. Massie's irritating habit of revealing the outcome of a battle before the battle is over. Spoils the suspense a bit. Still, this is a finely-written and well-researched general history about a nearly forgotten but massive conflict."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Massie is probably the finest writer of popular history in the grand manner that there is. Not for him the niceties of sociology, political nuance, cultural studies and the like, but this is no criticism. Nor indeed I suspect is there much deep consultation of primary sources.This is an excellent account of the war at sea during WW1 and a fine continuation of \\"Dreadnought\\". The book was like the war at sea, somehow a bit of an anticlimax after the build up of tension and expectations arising from the naval race before the war. The prewar race and the tensions these generated were expertly explained by Massie in \\"Dreadnought\\". Both the British and the Germans undoubtedly felt this frustration about the naval campaign. The British were frustrated in their designs by a degree of incompetence and bad luck (the escape of the Goeben, the battle of Coronel, the Dardanelles, the escape of the German battlecruisers at the battle of Dogger Bank and the miraculous escape of the High Seas Fleet at Jutland). The Germans were strategically defeated ultimately in most these actions, even if they sometimes claimed they were victories (such as at Jutland). The Dardanelles was a failure and Massie seems to subscribe to the views of many (including Keyes) who suggest that the Narrows could have been forced with more effort. Even in victory the British had nagging signs of failures of leadership, ship construction and ordnance - all this made the whole war less than the glorious Nelsonic denouement that the Royal Navy had expected prewar. The only action that seemed to prove the Royal Navy's &eacute;lan was the Battle of the Bight and the crushing of von Spee's Pacific squadron at the battle of the Falkland Islands. The U boat war that followed Jutland was grim and decidedly unromantic. The Germans were disappointed that their powerful surface navy - whose existence had almost guaranteed that Britain would be their enemy, never was able to accomplish any of its goals, almost entirely due to the timidity of the Kaiser in ordering that his precious fleet was not to be risked in dangerous offensive actions.It is a fair statement that the only contenders in the war that really mattered were the British and the Germans and this part of the war is covered superbly. I have to say I would have liked some account of the other great powers - what about the Russian Baltic fleet? Or the French? The Austro-Hungarians had a fleet too- what did it do during the war? Then there was the Japanese, of course. None of these questions are answered. Massie has kept his attention on the items of real strategic importance which was probably the right choice, but I still have these questions and it would have been nice to be able to at least answer them in part after having read the book. Another failure of the book is that it does not have enough pictures of the castles of steel themselves. What about a picture of Canopus or the Cressy class etc. etc.? We readers want to see these vessels. Nor are the maps up to the standard required, particularly the one of Jutland which is entirely inadequate. I suspect that this is due to meanness on behalf of the publisher. With these kinds of books maps are very important.Nevertheless, this is a wonderful read. As usual, Massie is top of the heap at this kind of writing so it is heartily recommended."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Remarkable narrative.

The first volume named 'Deadnought: Britian Germany and the coming of the great war' was a masterpiece of history and a great span of history from the unification of Germany to the declaration of war. The first book detailed the arms race between the two nations, specifically at sea.This second volume covers a mere four years of bloody conflict, yet its a tour de force. The Germans confronted the British in the North Sea with a large navy that had come close to rivaling Englands mighty naval supremacy. Yet the Germans were timid at sending its high seas fleet into action. Why? Because the Kaiser treasured his fleet and was afraid it might be destroyed or harmed.The book expertly covers the search for the 'Goeben' and Dardenelles campaign, the fights at sea in the pacific and the standoff at the river plate(Falklands). These were times when small german surface raiders travlled the high seas seeking out prey.The books climax is the battle of Jutland, an epic battle where Britians 'castles of Steel' confronted the High Seas fleet in a massive contest.This book is simply massive in scope as well as words. A wonderful, if lengthy read. If you have read the first one you will love reading how these fleets confronted eachother, if you missed the first then you will love this one for its scope of history. Makkie describes in meticulous detail the lives of central characters like Churchill, Beaty, Scheer, Jellicoe, and Beatty, Hipper, and Tirpitz. Wonderful character sketches bring these great men to life.A sad story about a great German fleet whose commanders, although very skilled, did not have the guts to committ an expensive armed service to battle and the decisive English who gambled everything on the theory that 'every man will do his duty'.A must read, will Makkie write another book, I hope so!"},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Both interesting, well-written but too longwinded.

Half the size would have been perfectly adequate.Douglas Dicconson"},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"As with his earlier pre Great War masterpiece \\"Dreadnaught\\" (1992), Robert Massie again presents a brilliant and informative history with \\"Castles of Steel\\" (2003). This next book for the period, is destined to become a World War 1 classic.With this massive read (866 pages with 77 pages of notes, bibliography, and brief index) Massie speaks to the German and British prewar naval build ups, the principle Pacific and Atlantic naval battles, the chief personalities on every side, and the German navy's forced 1919 division and fleet's scuttle by it's own seamen (under the British fleet's nose). Massie also presents 20+ pages of battlefield maps and black and white period photos.Massie describes naval maneuvering, battle strategies, high command political posturing, seamen's and soldiers' reluctance to fight, and naval transportation and supply problems. The battles at Colonel, Falklands, Heligoland Bight, Dogger Bank, and Jutland are analyzed with precision. North Sea mining, the u-boats' tactical use, and each ship's fighting power are evaluated. Massie considers the strengths and weaknesses of each war-time leader (drawing readers to every character's successes and mistakes).\\"Castles of Steel\\" brings Massie's objective look at the naval war for 1914 to 1918. He reviews others' war reflections and examinations in presenting his own informed understanding for the Great War. The book's critical analysis is an effective war assessment tool.This book is recommended to everyone novice and expert alike. It answers many World War 1 questions. For this great history the 300-word review limit imposed by Amazon is not enough!"},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"The text opens with a review of the July 1914 diplomatic crisis and concludes with the scuttling of the German High Seas fleet at Scapa Flow. The author, Robert Massie, gives a concise narrative of the Great War at sea between Germany and Britain focusing on weapons and tactics together with covering the colorful/controversial military and political leaders. The well-written battle narratives (Jutland being the most famous) are most interesting as are the lesser battles in the Pacific and the Falkland Islands.The German High Seas fleet was second only to the British Royal Navy with German dreadnoughts superior in armor and water-tight integrity while British dreadnoughts were faster and had larger guns. These differences were due to the Royal Navy tactic, advanced by First Sea Lord Fisher father of the dreadnought warship, which was to get there first, hit hard, and leave quickly; while Admiral von Tirpitz's, founder of the Imperial German navy, maxim was \\"....that a ship's primary mission (is) to remain afloat.\\" Consequently, German warships, which were only slightly slower that the British dreadnoughts, could sustain multiple hits, remain afloat and continue to fight.The concise narrative of the Gallipoli campaign espoused by Admiralty First Lord Churchill and grudgingly supported by The First Sea Lord Fisher is both interesting and well written. As originally conceived it was an all Royal Navy effort (infantry could not be spared from France) to force the Dardanelles, occupy Constantinople, enter the Black Sea, take Turkey out of the war, and reopen a supply route to Russia. The naval effort was halted after March 18, 1915 when ships were damaged by mines. Later information from American diplomats established that had the Royal Navy pressed on the fleet could have forced the straits leading to a \\"victory decisive upon the whole course of the war.\\" After the naval efforts, attempted infantry operations were a dismal failure resulting in Churchill losing his cabinet post and ultimately the First Sea Lord Jacky Fisher leaving as well.The Royal Navy fostered protests from neutral countries when they blockaded Germany. In response Germany initiated a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare resulting in the torpedoing of the passenger liner Lusitania in May 1915 with the loss of several lives including 128 Americans. Kaiser William wishing to keep America neutral suspended unrestricted submarine warfare. Now, Germany's only recourse was to weaken the Royal Navy. The Battle of Jutland, May 31,1916, resulted when the German High Seas Fleet tried to lure the British Grand Fleet into a surface battle trap. The author devotes five interesting chapters to Jutland. While the German battle fleet sank a greater number of ships than the British, they failed to seriously injure the Royal Navy, and at the end of the battle, the British battle fleet was positioned between the Germans and their safe home ports. The German fleet escaped during the night of May 31/June1.Mistakes were made by commanders in each fleet. The author notes \\"Hipper (a German Admiral) made no mistakes at Jutland and was the only one of the fours senior admirals present to come away with his reputation enhanced.\\" The book gives a succinct account of the political maneuvering and fall-out after Jutland. British Admiral Jellicoe ultimately lost his command of the British Grand Fleet becoming First Sea Lord in the Admiralty. The Germans faced a serious problem: unable to weaken the British Grand Fleet and reduce the blockade which was strangling Germany yet forbidden by the Kaiser to use their most effective weapon, unrestricted submarine warfare, political maneuvering and debate commenced. The major political issue for Germany was that returning to unrestricted submarine warfare would bring America into the war. Ultimately the German army high command, convinced the Kaiser that before America could become a factor Germany would win the war. Germany then resumed unrestricted submarine warfare. The text gives an excellent account of how Germany addressed this problem.With the return of unrestricted submarine by the Germans, America entered the war. The author notes that the German gamble to win the war with an unrestricted U-boats offensive failed. By July 31,1918 more than a million American soldiers were in Europe with many thousands more arriving each month. The hand-writing was on the wall, \\"Germany could not win\\" so they responded to American President Wilson's peace offers and signed an armistice on November 11,1918. A critical requirement of the 11 November armistice was that German warships and submarines would be surrendered to the Allies and would be brought to designated British ports awaiting disposition. German Admiral Reuters, German commander of the surrendered fleet at Scapa Flow, and his officers \\"all felt themselves still bound by a standing order of the Imperial Navy that no German warship was to be allowed to fall into enemy hands.\\" On 21 June 1919 Reuters gave the order, and the German navy scuttled their warships in Scapa Flow. On June 28, 1919 the Treaty of Versailles was signed, the German fleet was at the bottom of the sea, and the Great War was over.This book by Robert Massie reads like a novel: smooth, interesting and always moving forward. He brings the political maneuverings and personalities of the major players in both Britain and Germany into focus while narrating the critical naval events of WWI. It's a lengthy work, 786 pages of text alone, but both the amateur and advanced student will find reading this work was worth the effort."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"Robert Massie is a great writer. His massive books weave together naval technology, politics, geography, personalities, tactics, and human error into a tightly woven and crystal clear narrative."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"I just finished reading this book, and almost until the end, found it to be of a very high caliber. Then, a few dozen pages from ending, author Massie, while discussing the involvement of American battleships during the Great War, states in a footnote that (US Battleships) Utah, Oklahoma, Arizona, and West Virginia were sunk at Pearl Harbor, and Pennsylvania, Mississippi, New Mexico, Colorado, and Tennessee were severely damaged.What an incredible gaffe!Mississippi and New Mexico were not only not damaged at Pearl Harbor, they weren't even in the same ocean! They were in the Atlantic Fleet at the time! At least Colorado was in the same ocean, but it was thousands of miles away in Washington state at the time! He fails to mention California, which was present and sunk. Pennsylvania, which was present, was in dry dock at the time and remained almost untouched. Tennessee received only minor damage. Furthermore, Utah was no longer a battleship, but had long before been converted to a target ship.How can not only a battleship expert, but an AMERICAN battleship expert, be so ignorant as to publish a book including such amazing errors? I knew the name and disposition of every battleship at Pearl Harbor by the time I was 13, and I'll bet a lot of other teenagers could tell you their names as well. And this guy is a Rhodes Scholar? It is mind-blowing to me that this was not picked up in editing.The entire book, then, falls in to question with me. As the book primarily deals with the British and German fleets during World War One, let us hope Mr. Massie picked up more at Oxford than he did during his American education. I, for one, am appalled."},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","review":"This is a very interesting book about the Sea and WWI.

This specialized dictionary provides a generous list of American idioms in an accessible format, but sacrifices phrase origins and portability in the process.The dictionary's comprehensive nature suits students of English as a second language, as well as communications professionals. With over 24,000 entries, it offers over twice the number of listings in the popular \\"American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms\\" and four times the number of listings in the \\"Cambridge Dictionary of American Idioms\\" and the \\"Oxford Dictionary of Idioms.\\" ESL students can understand the language better and communicate more effectively. Writers and editors are more likely to be able to track down needed phrases.It's easy to use, too. Phrases are listed alphabetically by the first keyword, allowing the reader to look up the phrase by its familiar form. An explanation follows, and usage examples are provided for each entry to enhance understanding. If the exact phrase is not known, the handy index provides phrases grouped by an alphabetical listing of keywords.Unfortunately, phrase origins are mostly lacking, apparently by design. The editor's explanation for this is that reliable linguistic evidence for the origin of idioms is rare. The few origins that are offered are thoughtfully placed and seem to be well-researched, however.This hefty, textbook-size dictionary may be a drawback for those looking for a handy reference. Shorter idiom dictionaries have the advantage here.This idiom dictionary best serves ESL students and communications professionals needing a reliable reference to confirm the spelling, form and meaning of American English idioms. The pages are printed on heavier, acid-free paper, so the book should hold up well. Those intersted in phrase origins or a more convenient book size should consider other idiom dictionaries."},{"Title":"McGraw-Hill's Dictionary of American Idoms and Phrasal Verbs (McGraw-Hill ESL References)","review":"This book is one of the most comprehensive I've ever seen when it comes to Idioms and Phrasal Verbs.

If you know at least one word from the phrase you are looking for, then you may find it listed and then you just go to the proper page for the necessary details.

Most of the idioms are basic and used in everyday speech in the U.S., but because there are so many basic ones, it is hard to find the funny and unusual idioms (if that is what you are looking for).

The price of this book, as advertised (about $14), if worth the investment for the wealth of information you get about american idioms and phrases. However, you do not learn the language by sitting on, or putting the book under your pillow. You have to use it! Nothing replaces active reading, writting, and speaking the language.The text has two sections: the dictionary, and the phrase-Finder Index. These two and the earnerst desire to communicate in English will take you far.Kuddos to Richard for putting such a wonderful publication for the benefit of many.PS: English is my second language."},{"Title":"McGraw-Hill's Dictionary of American Idoms and Phrasal Verbs (McGraw-Hill ESL References)","review":"this book is a little too extensive.
