There's even a website devoted to her works... Other books by her concerning Tibet are also interesting."},{"Title":"In Secret Tibet (Mystic Travellers Series)","review":"To begin, its obvious Mr. Illion never went to Tibet; there are *no* descriptions of specific places in Tibet. In fact, I think actual 'named' locations in Tibet are mentioned once or twice at most.Most of the descriptions of 'Tibet' are overly generic, and could probably have been culled from National Geographic articles. In addition, Mr. Illion has massive contempt for the Tibetan people, calling them 'gullible', 'stupid', 'unwashed' and so on throughout the book. He also harbors quite a grudge against the Lamas of Tibet, an interesting opinion in light of today's adoration with Tibetian Buddhism. I won't even go into his cover stories of losing his camera & staining his skin... its so much garbage it shouldn't even be dignified with an explanation.Here's what I think is really going on in this book. Mr. Illion was probably a 'mystic' back in Germany, making money on speeches & teaching other Germans. This book was most likely used to give him some credibility as a real mystic (he claims to meet Tibet's 'Enlightened Masters'), and bring in more money from his audiences.The book is garbage, and contains no information on Tibet pre Chinese invasion. All you will get out of this is 1930s New Age claptrap.. avoid it."},{"Title":"In Secret Tibet (Mystic Travellers Series)","review":"Some years ago, I have read Illion's Darkness Over Tibet (Mystic Travellers Series) by Illion, Theodore published by Adventures Unlimited Press [ Paperback ], which seems to have conveyed the truth about the insidious side of spiritual pursuits. That book has brought me to re-think about such pursuits and never take anything at face value. So, earlier this year, I've had a chance to read \\"In Secret Tibet,\\" which seemed to be about his so-called \\"experiences\\" in Tibet. To be honest, I have found this book to be entertaining yet interesting because it portrays the truth about \\"wise\\" people with a tendency to lull people for their own agendas.I do think that this book is considered to be fiction to some form, but then, oftentimes a fiction can contain the deepest of truths. It is what the reader learns from these books that seemed to be important, I think, in the mind of the author.This book is much to be recommended along with his other book, \\"Darkness Over Tibet.\\""},{"Title":"In Secret Tibet (Mystic Travellers Series)","review":"I made a BIG mistake getting this book. I've never read such a load of garbage about Tibet in my life. I doubt if the guy has ever even been there. It is full of pseudo-esoteric mysticism of the worst kind and gives no valuavle information on what Tibet was like before the Chinese occupation. It is an insult to Tibet and the intelligence of anyone interested in Tibetan history and the plight of the Tibetan people today. Avoid like the plague and put the money towards buying something more worthwhile and informative on the subject. I had it one star because there was no way of indicating how bad this book really is. Amazon should come up for a symbol that denotes 'crap', or some other negative colloquialism."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"I first read this book while I was still at peace with the idea of a hospital birth. At that time, I thought it was a good book but quite a tough read. Then when my personal circumstances changed, I began to question hospital birth. This book was invaluable in helping me switch to a birth center, ultimately experiencing a beautiful, gentle birth in water."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"When I was pregnant, I read many books, wanting to explore the many options that I had. I ultimately decided on birthing in a hospital, but with a doula and a midwife. While I knew that both would work to assist me in a natural birth, I still felt unsure of whether or not *I* could handle it. Often, pregnant women are told horror stories of the pain, of how most women are \\"screaming\\" for an epidural, of what can go wrong in labor. Very rarely are gentle, beautiful birthing stories told.For me, this is where this book comes in to play. I did not read this book looking for knowledge and factual information on birth, I'd already gleaned that from several other books. I read this book wondering if a gentle birth was truly attainable.I read this book a few weeks before my due date. After finishing it, I truly felt at peace with my body and with my decision to pursue a natural birth. Sure, I still had my doubts, but after reading about all the women who had NCB in many different settings, I felt strongly that I could do it. And a few weeks later, I DID. Once labor began, I probably forgot everything I read, but what I didn't forget was the sense that I was just one of many women who embarked on a journey toward a gentle birth, and that if other women could do it, SO COULD I. My memories of my son's birth are gentle and peaceful, most of it spent in the water with my midwife holding my hands and my doula massaging me through contractions. My only regret is not having my husband read this book, too, as I think he was more nervous than I was. The accompanying DVD is also something I found immensly helpful. Neither my husband nor I had ever seen birth, but this DVD gave us an idea of what to expect. While it helped to calm me, it really helped my husband when I was actually in labor because he knew that what was happening was normal and natural.Should this be the only book you read while pregnant? NO! But then, I don't think there is any one book that really covers every little piece of information about pregnancy. Do I think this is a book that should be read by every pregnant woman? Yes, I do. Perhaps if more women read this book, pregnant women would no longer be treated to horror stories about birth, and instead, would know that, in most cases, it can be a gentle, loving process."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"I did find this book very informative. I feel like it made me think or ask questions about why we tend to trust doctors more than our own bodies. Don't get me wrong I think doctors know very much what they are talking about most the time. But it did make sence to me how the book talked about how a normal healthy pregnancy many times is rushed or sent in for a c-section all for the sake of time. There were a few biased oppinions in the book. And some sections seemed repetative ( this is the reason for the 4 ) But I think over all it was not a waist of time. And as I do with all information I recieve it was taken with a grain of salt. Additional advice: try checking it out at the library before you decide to buy it or not. Depending on your beliefs this may or may not be the book for you."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"It seems birth is a mystery, especially to first time mothers, but even to those of us who have given birth. This respectful and highly intelligent book brings all the puzzle pieces together in a beautiful, dignified manner as it tells us the WHOLE STORY of what birth can be.However, the Gentle Birth Choices DVD that is included with the new version is an essential element to the WHOLE STORY. I would not recommend buying a used book unless the DVD is included. Thank you."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"Reading this book made me feel angry about how women in childbirth are treated in the United States. It also empowered me to make certain decisions for myself and share information with others interested in taking charge of their births. If you're a mom who's happy to turn over your pregnant body and baby to someone else, I wouldn't read it because its tone can seem a bit radical at times. I would suggest this book to any woman who expresses interest in more gentle options, or birth the way it ought to be. I'm happy to say I took charge of my own birth a year after reading this book. I brought a beautiful child into the world at home, attended by my family and midwife, and in water. Thanks, Barbara Harper!"},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"I had my own ideas about birth, but this really encouraged some ideas I had repressed. It is both empowering and informational. I think that this book should be mandatory for all medical professional's in the feild of obstetrics, as well as all expecting parents. I would reccomend this book to my pregnant friends."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"I have not yet finished reading the book, but thus far it is incredible. This reveiw is mostly concerning the film that is included with the book.The film is awesome! It goes through several aspects of the current controversy over \\"safety\\" in childbirth. With every point, it clearly states the point, then supports with expert opinions and actual births. The births are extremely graphic, which is important for first time moms to see.I highly recommend both the book and the free film!"},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"If you aren't sure about a hospital birth, this will help you decide. Additionally, it isn't a &quot;home birth or else&quot; as some &quot;alternative birth choice&quot; books can seem to be. Very nicely considered birth centers, the medium ground. Overall, very well-written and thought-provoking. My husband and I even had several good discussions when I brought up points in the book."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"I have one pretty major complaint, which others should be aware of: this DVD does not have chapters or a menu screen, so you can't skip tracks to the birth you want to show your clients. It's not the end of the world, and I'm going to try making a copy on my computer today with chapters, but it seems to me like a pretty dumb choice not to have done this when they made the original tape into a DVD...Other disappointments include the total run time of birth footage, which is very low compared to the interviews with medical professionals. The interviews are quite good, some of the top names in the field (Marsden Wagner, Michel Odent are the only two I had heard of), but my clients (many of whom don't speak English) will not be interested. Most of the births only show pushing, or a very little active labor and then second stage. All the births take place in this birth center or at home; several are in the tub.I was also put off by the blatant demonization of cesarean birth - they literally put a horror movie filter over the camera lens and play scary music for the brief (10 second) montage. And so what happens if a woman who watches this ends up having her baby by cesarean for whatever reason? She's already associated the experience with terror, and perhaps she wouldn't have otherwise. They're trying to make a point, but for the majority of women it's not helpful.Same with the book - looks very interesting, but not useful as an educational tool for most doulas because it doesn't have very many pictures at all.Overall, my message is: know what you're buying! This is a political book, made at a particular time and place in the history of childbirth in America, with specific political ends. It is probably not the best choice if you're looking for an educational book/DVD on birth for use with doula clients."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"I'm a birth doula and have added this book to my library for clients. This is a great book and explains all of the information about the options for birth. It also comes with a great birth video that follows several women and their choices. I would really recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"To the so called fictitious Austin anonymous reviewer, how did you get the &quot;way to the right&quot; so called fact? Based on your one time experience? May be your fact, but not mine.. The doctors here are among the best in the nation.. Nothing is forced down your throat here.. You have a choice to give birth in your house if you want to.. No one is forcing you to go to a hospital. This isnt a communist country the last time I checked. I am okay with paying the higher rate, to help out the poorer among us who need the emergency caeserian because the baby's umbilical cord was wrapped around its neck. Caesarians - last time I checked was determined by the doctor, who is responsible for you.. since you are in so much stress at the moment of child birth..and besides, that's what you choose a doctor for, and that's why they undergo such training and education.. and it is not dispensed like candy.. They have to write an explanation to the insurance company why it was necessary, or they dont get paid.. Did you attend ALL child birth classes offered at Austin (hundreds of different instructors), or are you generalizing all Austin Lamaze trainings based on your misfortunes. Austin is a BIG city.. Lamaze instructors are certified (yours might not have been), and Lamaze is a standard teaching method.. It is not modified.. If it was modified in your case, then you cannot call it Lamaze anymore, but call it your own technique. Midwifes are still encouraged in Austin hospitals.. what do hospitals care.. as long as they get paid for their room.. Sorry for your experiences.. Sorry about your &quot;malfunctioning birth machine&quot;.. Maybe you need to stop seeing a quack, and get a more reputable OB/GYN for your next one. And, this book is outdated.. needs to catch up with the times.. Maybe this still holds water in some small towns... but I cannot relate to it, living in a modern, hip city with the highest number of people with masters degree than anywhere in the country."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"Gentle Birth Choices was my birth changer. I knew I wanted a natural birth, but after reading about the wonderful experiences that other women have had, and also finding out a little more in depth about hospital births, this book has not only swayed my husband and I to indulge in a home birth, but to also give water birth a try. The most important thing to me is serenity. Serenity for me AND the baby - and after reading her book, as well as several others, I have come to the conclusion that this is what we want. Not only does Barbara give you options, she gives you the history. Excellent, excellent book! Highly recommend - as if you didn't know this already. ;+)"},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"This book has changed my life, 10,000-fold, for the better. It was loaned to me in the beginning of my first trimester, and I devoured it -- I gulped it down like a drowning person desperate for air. (I am due in about 5-6 weeks.) It helped me to return -- on a straight and narrow path -- to my original hopes of having a midwife attended homebirth.Barbara Harper introduces us to the fact that modern medicine has \\"medicalized\\" childbirth, which is a normal bodily function, a natural process. She goes on to dispel myths, such as once a Cesarean, always a Cesarean; childbirth for women over 35 is difficult, and high risk (!); pain killers won't harm the baby; and a number of other myths, which most of us have been taught by our obstetricians to believe. She offers us further information that many of us have likely been unaware of, such as the non-necessity of cutting the cord immediately, and the fact that it is in fact likely to be harmful to the newborn to have the cord cut immediately.When writing about the electronic fetal monitor, Barbara Harper says that \\"Dr. Robert Hon, inventor of the EFM [electronic fetal monitor], asked his colleagues to consider the causes of the rising cesarean rate in the United States. He stated that he never intended the EFM to be used in routine obstetric management. 'If you mess around with a process [birth] that works well 98 percent of the time, there is a potential for much harm.'\\"This book has been, for me, a comforting, lifesaving, safety net in which to fall at a time when I was newly pregnant at 37, and frantic with miserable discomfort at the care I had been receiving at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.And of the seven Appendices offered in this book, Appendix F: Resources, provides a wealth of references to other groups.I must also add that this book changed my husband's life just as much as it did mine, if only because it brought me to my search for a homebirth midwife. And in that search, we were introduced to another fabulous book called Silent Knife (find it under Nancy Wainer Cohen), which my husband has told me has changed his life, and which is a must-read for any woman trying to avoid a C-section, or a repeat C-section.Barbara Harper has has also introduced me to a vast collection of other authors, whose books I have begun to acquire at a steady pace. To note just a few: Michel Odent, Sheila Kitzinger, Nancy Wainer (Cohen), Frederick Leboyer, Ida May Gaskin, Marsden Wagner, David Stewart, Henci Goer, Penny Simkin, and many others.Barbara Harper founded Global Maternal/Child Health Association (GMCHA) and Waterbirth International in 1989. I called GMCHA and left a message on their machine looking for some information, and I was thrilled to be able to personally thank Barbara Harper, and to tell her that SHE changed my life, when she called me back herself. So I was doubly happy to see that she remains fully a part of the organization she established.I have come to two conclusions through my recent reading, thanks to my introduction to Gentle Birth Choices, and all of my reading since then: 1) To rely so fully as Americans do, on advice from the medical profession, is a tremendous abdication of responsibility. Though the search for the right care is not easy, good things do not come easily, and we must take back responsibility for our own health care, rather than blindly relying on doctors; and 2) Those of us who continue to insist that doctors MUST know what they're doing, are not behaving with respect toward their God. I happen to be Atheist, and my view is that Nature has designed the human body. For many believers, the human body has been designed by God. Either way, the human body is a finely honed machine, designed by something or someone greater than any of us. For humanity to behave the way that we do toward the birth process shows a profound lack of respect for Nature/God. Do we really think that a system designed by God or Nature is so faulty that C-sections are required approximately 25% of the time? Those who will simultaneously prefer an obstetrician-attended birth in a hospital, and who will allow the numerous interventions likely to attend their birth in a hospital, and who also claim to love their God may want to re-evaluate both their understanding of medical practices in America, as well as their understanding of God.This book, and ALL of the others to which it has led me, will provide readers with information from an endless supply of studies, all of which have been published in the most highly respected medical journals (JAMA, British Lancet, Am. Coll. of Obstet. & Gyn., etc.), every one of which show results that prove that ALL medical interventions only contribute to difficulties in labor. Why do our doctors continue to practice this way? Read up -- educate yourself -- you'll be glad that you did. And you'll want to thank Barbara Harper profusely, as I still want to!!!"},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"Gentle Birth Choices is a wonderful book to read whether you have already decided to birth naturally, or you are considering it. Even if you have decided to use medication, the material is so informative, it may be an educational experience for you. The information provided on birthing &quot;myths&quot; is extremely helpful to women given that all too often we are provided only one side of the story when dealing with the medical profession. The photographs are also so gorgeous. They show women birthing in all different settings. The photos show how birth can look when women trust nature and their bodies. I would recommend this book to all pregnant women so they can see that there are options to hospitals and medical procedures."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"I originally borrowed this book to read and later saw the video at a doula training workshop I attended! I had to have them both the minute that I saw the video! They are both great... The book is informative and the set INCREDIBLE! They are such a learning tool! I highly recommend them to every woman who is pregnant or who is any type of childbirth educator, doulas, etc."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"By the time I was pregnant with my 3rd child, I already knew a lot about childbirth. But one day I was browsing the library shelves and looking over their pregnancy books, looking for something new to read that would start to put me in \\"birthing\\" mode. I came across the book Gentle Birth Choices by Barbara Harper and really enjoyed it. Now that I am a doula/Childbirth Educator, I own my own copy and it is a book I often recommend.Barbara Harper, RN is the founder of Global Maternal/Child Health Association, which is a non-profit organization committed to educating the public about natural birth - specifically water birth. I had never heard of her, or this organization, at the time that I first read the book, but I was considering a water birth then. I was already planning on giving birth at a free standing birth center, which did have Jacuzzi tubs in every room, so I was hopeful of using the water in some point in my labor, and possibly delivering there. But I wasn't really committed to it yet; it was just something that was in the realm of possibilities. After reading Gentle Birth Choices I couldn't imagine why anyone wouldn't want a water birth!So, tell us about the book?Gentle Birth Choices is well organized into 8 chapters. It is a very easy read, but will take more than a few hours. I read it in a few days the first time, and recently re-read it in about the same time.Chapter 1 is called \\"Gentle Beginnings\\" and consists of explanations of what a Gentle Birth is, and examines the necessary ingredients - things like low light, a reassuring environment, well prepared mom, early breastfeeding, etc. It also includes explanations of why these things are necessary and \\"better\\" for your baby.The next Chapter is on the Medicalization of Childbirth. This chapter discusses the history of childbirth in the US, and the corresponding results in today's healthcare. This is actually a fascinating read!Chapter 3 is on medical myths and the goal is to debunk some widely held beliefs about childbirth (such as the hospital is the safest place for childbirth, continuous fetal monitoring is necessary, that kind of thing)Chapter 4 is called a \\"Gentle Revolution\\" it is about the natural childbirth movement and it's history.Chapter 5 is on the use of Midwives and their status in this country. You need to bear in mind that this book is 10 years old, so some of the information on state laws is out of date.Chapter 6 is on water birth; its history, its benefits, water birth around the world, as well as an FAQ of commonly asked questions about water birth. If you are considering a water birth, this chapter is a must read! It is also good to give to family/friends who think you have lost your mind :)Chapter 7 is on the mind-body connection in childbirth.And finally Chapter 8 is on making gentle birth choices - choosing where to give birth (hospital, birth center, or home), choosing a care provider. That kind of thing.After that there are 7 appendices, which range from questions to ask a doctor/midwife, to writing a birth plan, to resources.All in all it is a very complete book on planning a gentle birth and why you would want to.So, what's wrong with the book?Nothing is really wrong with it. It is a great read and is very interesting. But I think it has a target audience of people that are already committed to natural birth. I think Ms. Harper goes a little too far with the \\"touchy-feely stuff\\" at times, which is OK - childbirth is a very emotional thing. But she also goes too far with her commitment to natural childbirth.Let me explain that. I am a VERY staunch supporter of natural childbirth. The over medicalization of childbirth is a huge part of the health care crisis in the US. However, I also know that there are times when the interventions are necessary. Are they needed as often as they are used? Not even close, but sometimes they ARE needed. And when they are needed, I thank G-d that they are available!However, Ms. Harper does not seem to acknowledge this well. She says that \\"all women\\" can have a gentle birth and gives the impression that interventions are never needed. First of all, that is just false, and second of all, I think it sets women up for heartbreak. For example, what happens to the woman who does all this planning for her gentle birth and then something is wrong with the baby and she has a needed c-section? Is she then a failure? I don't think so, but I am not sure that Ms. Harper feels the same.Final ThoughtsDespite my criticism, this really is an excellent book and I do highly recommend it! It is packed full of information to help you make decisions on planning the best birth possible. It might be a bit too out there for someone on the fence about natural childbirth, but if you are already committed to a natural birth, and just want a little pep talk to help convince you that you are doing the right thing - or just want to learn more about water birth - than this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"I would like to say that first of all, I agree with the previous reader from Austin (who rated this book a 1 out of 5 stars) only in that the author definitely has a strong bias against the medical establishment. The bias is so severe it does at times appear as a chip on her shoulder and she is so against modern medicine that she argues against any involvement with doctors at all. And I also agree that her choice of pictures/illustrations do seem overly dated given the publication date. (I actually had no idea that it was published as recently as 1994. I definitely perceived a 1970s feel.)Given that, I would still say that the basic points of her information are worth considering. A natural birth is natural. In the normal situation of birth, the body is able to handle the huge amounts of stress that it experiences. And a woman's mind CAN be capable of cooperating with the body. The author also gives anecdotal evidence that the mind is also capable of working against the body. Basically, a natural birth is a whole experience and all components of the woman must work together to get the most out of such a tremendous experience. Her body, mind, emotions, and social support system must work in agreement and any conflict may cause problems or delays.I read this book earlier this year after resolving to start a family. I read it a full 9 months before I actually became pregnant. At first, I was very convinced that natural birth is the only way. But after 9 months of contemplation, I now believe natural birth is the best way, but not the only way. Perfectly normal and happy families are created through less natural processes. And I still have another 8 months to dwell on my own choice for the birth of my first child.So my goal is to start from an ideal birth plan that is natural, but safe, and then I can determine where I am willing to accept changes. After all a healthy baby and a healthy mom is what is ultimately important, right? Sure it may be better for my baby to be born drug free. And it may be better for me to nurse my newborn immediately and upon demand the whole time I am in the hospital so that we may bond as soon as possible. But it is also better if I never eat cheetos or pizza, and I can live with myself if I indulge in that occasionally.So here's my bottom line. If you're considering a natural birth method and want some stories and a varied picture of what types of options are available, definitely read this book. But read it with some salt (as several other reviewers have said). Be critical and objective of all that you read. Likewise, be just as critical and objective of what your OB and doctors tell you. Be an informed medical consumer and I think you will be happy with a healthy baby, however she arrives. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"This book is definitely biased toward natural, vaginal birthing. If that is fine for you than this is a great choice. I found it very informative. The author gave a history of childbirth and how it got to be so medicalized. Medical myths were also addressed. The succint pro's and con's of typical hospital interventions I found especially helpful. The differences between midwifes and other providers came in handy for me because I was contemplating ditching my OB for a midwife. Finally, they had in depth info on waterbirths, creating birth plans, choosing a provider and birthplace. Definitely worth reading. I did watch the video also. Besides it being a bit dated, it did show the gentle births that this book is all about. I think the video would have been more helpful if it showed more 1st stage labor. I was hoping to see more of how the women coped with labor pains then to just see second stage."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"I highly recommend this book to every pregnant woman... filled with practical information and the accompanying DVD version of the video is fabulous. My two children enjoy watching the DVD in preparation for the birth of their sibling, we are planning our second who will be waterbirth at home. Well worth $13 for the set!"},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"This book was riveting from beginning to end. As I am preparing for my first child, I've begun the process of learning about what's to come. This book not only informed me, it turned me into a believer. It affirmed intuitive feelings I already had about the way birth should be. Now instead of thinking that women who birth in water are wierdos - I now plan to have a water birth! What a turn-around... Thank you Barbara Harper!"},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"Everyone always told me the hospital was the only place you could give birth and I was absolutely terrified of the thought of a birth in a hospital. Even my insurance company and my doctor told me there were no other options. This book is WONDERFUL. Not only does it tell you how to make a hospital birth better by giving you information your doctor won't and voicing your opinion (and meaning it), but also covers all of the other non-hospital options available to you (such as birthing centers) that your doctor will never tell you about. I have the book and video set, and would strongly recommend the set to anyone having a baby, whether they plan to go to a hospital or not. I noticed a VERY distinct almost unreal difference in the births in the video compared to video of hospital births. This is a MUST HAVE."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"This book arrived fast and in great condition. I'll gladly use this seller again. I'm a labor support assistant(birth doula,) and this book is very helpful in my job. Thanks for getting to me so fast."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"I couldn't help but add that the previous reviewer from Austin's comments are way out of line regarding childbirth in this city.First of all, not all hospital's and doctor's in Austin are as left leaning as the reviewer indicated, in fact they are way to the right. Perhaps she was in an unusual practice, or perhaps she was just misguided about the realities of what are being practiced. I, myself was with a woman OB who practiced in a female dominated practice, and they delivered babies in one of the most \\"liberal\\" hospitals in Austin. However, all of the talk was merely window dressing, and their actions were a far cry from the \\"we're so modern and supportive\\" pep talk they give you in the examination room. The practice as a group still delivered a large number of babies by cesarean or surgical vaginal extraction, and almost all of the patients had epidurals and delivered their babies on their backs in stirrups (yes, they do for a fact.) The statistics on the Austin hospitals indicate lower cesarean rates for the hospitals who service lower income women, and cesarean section rates for privately insured women in the suburbs nudge the %50 rate. Clearly, I don't believe that these higher income women have more problems giving birth, and since the fetal outcome rates are virtually the same for all of these hospitals (including the lower income public hospital), I do not believe that they are getting \\"better\\" service in these areas either. The other Austin reviewer needs to bear in mind that in order to employ a full time anesthesiologist on the labor and delivery floor, the epidural rates need to be rather high in order for them to make enough money to stick around. After all, insurance generally reimburses at a standard rate for these procedures, and the anesthesiologist needs to make a living too. Also, if more women are anesthetized, it can free the nursing staff up to take care of more patients because there isn't any support needed (or at least enough for the partner to handle) - and the patient is on full time monitoring stuck in bed and not walking around. Therefore reducing the nurse to patient ratio, and costing the hospital less money. Because of this, hospitals don't exactly discourage epidurals. Last I checked, even the most liberal hospitals in Austin had a 2-4 patient per nurse ratio. That doesn't sound like supportive staffing to me.Also, if you don't believe me, check out the hospital sponsored \\"Prepared Childbirth\\" classes that are offered at Austin's hospitals. They spend more time talking about what medical interventions to expect, along with some lame Lamaze breathing techniques which might work until the laboring women reaches the requisite 3-4 cm before they're allowed to get an epidural.I believe that the other Austin reviewer needs to bear in mind that just because a doctor is a woman does not change the pregnancy/childbirth=pathology training that they receive when they are in medical school. I myself can attest that my female OB who was so great in the beginning ended up treating me as an object that needing processing because of my \\"malfunctioning birth machine\\". Gender in obstetrics really has little if no bearing on the overall practices that are employed.Most hospitals in Austin allow rooming in, but the majority of women I know did not have the most supportive nursing staff with regard to breastfeeding. One actually had the staff accuse her of starving her baby because she didn't want them to give it a bottle, another friend couldn't have her baby discharged until she was seen by the nursing staff feeding her baby a bottle herself. No hospitals in Austin are exactly vying for the \\"Baby Friendly Hospital\\" initiative.Another indication of Austin's conservativeness regarding natural childbirth is the recent removal of midwifery services from all Austin hospitals. The OB community in Austin does not desire the competition, and would rather not promote the level of care that midwives deliver. This action alone demonstrates how backward and medieval Austin can be when it comes to having a baby.In the end, yes \\"Gentle Birth Choices\\" probably needs some updating with regard to the way many OB's try to show how modern and supportive they are by giving the option of \\"no pain meds\\", \\"birthing in any position you want\\", \\"rooming in\\", or having female OB's in the practice, and then failing to live up to those expectations. After all, a zebra can't change it's stripes. For the most part the moves toward more compassion are merely hollow words that frequently have no solid action to support their assertions. They are window dressing to get you into the practice instead of hunting down a midwife or researching more \\"gentle birth choices\\"."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"I wanted to give this book one star for my immediate reactions to it. I opened to the page where she discusses how harmful the narcotics given during childbirth for pain can be to the baby. I have a unique situation - I have a medical condition that has required pain management throughout my pregnancy (with narcotics prescribed by my specialist, with full support of my OB & Midwife). I will also have a planned c-section for medical reasons. So this book, rec'd as a gift, is not a good one for someone in my position with medical issues.I have done a lot of research and consulted with a number of health care professionals who have assured me that the medications I am taking will not harm by baby. Do I know for certain? No. Were these decisions undertaken lightly? No. But, given my situation and the best available medical information, these were the choices and recommendations I have followed. These are choices not at all supported by this book. This is not a book for women who require medical management and intervention in order to be able to have a baby in the first place.As a previous reviewer noted, there is also some misinformation in the book. The hospital where I will deliver has 27% of deliveries attended by midwives (and they deliver about 10,000 babies a year!). Rooming-in is encouraged, even for c-sections. On my tour, there were 4 babies in the nursery on a full floor (so maybe 25+ babies were with their mommies). I can look up c-section, episiotomy and epidural rates for every hospital in my state, and they are lower than what she quotes in her book (although they do vary by setting).Another important factor for me is that my health care team consists of both a midwife and an OB, and my wonderful midwife has done almost all my prenatal care even though I will have a c-section. (My OB will perform that). I do think there are ways to have a more empowering experience, even if you need (or want) a more medicalized one. One would not know that from this book. It is hard to find non-judgemental materials for someone needing a c-section, and this book is no exception. Fortunately, my health care providers, partner, family and friends are very supportive!I also think a woman who opts for pain relief (such as narcotics or epidural) could read this book and feel herself a failure as a woman for choosing that.On the positive, I do think this book is an excellent resource for information about water birth, water labor, and non-drug labor and delivery. If that is your interest, I think you will find a lot of very useful information in this book. I give it 5 stars for that information."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"This is a GREAT book for any expecting mom or doula.

They are exageratted, and undocumented, and don't take into account anything that doesn't support the focus of the book.Overall I enjoyed reading it, and recommend it for women who want more choices in childbirth.

I could really feel how important it was to her to get her message across, while doing so in a compassionate manner.Even though \\"Gentle Birth\\" was written quite a few years ago, I still found almost all of the information to still be applicable.I think thus would be a great book to read even if you are not planning a birth on the near future and are purely curious about how beautiful birth can be."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"Great book, came with a DVD... that I really loved watching!

The information provided throughout the book really empowered me as a woman. Its startling how much information this book holds. Our nation has successfully hid much of this under the rug, but for those who are willing to take an unbiased look, you may also be stunned. The facts that the author presents are thoroughly backed-up with statistics and numerous references. I encourage any woman to read this and then pass the book around to all your friends. This is what birth should be, was meant to be like- compared to what it has turned into."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"This book is absolutely an essential read for anyone who is planning to have a baby or even if you are just interested in birth. The way that our society pedals epidurals and hospital interventions for birth is horrible and this book will tell you why.

PLEASE PLEASE read and suggest to all your friends!!!"},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"Make sure you get the copy with a DVD! It's a wonderful companion, especially for your birth partner who may not read the book.

No two women birth the same! Surprisingly according to other reviews here apparently some women don't think that they (or their babies) should have the option of a gentle birth. But every woman deserves it! Must read this book!"},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"I really appreciate the way this book is laid out, the important information it contains and how easy it is to access!

You were fortunate to have the options you shared - they are still not the norm for hospital births in much of our country. I live in Virginia Beach, VA, am a nurse, mom and grandmom. Hosp. births here still leave a lot to be desired. Episotomies are standard, induction and c-section rate are very high. When I went to nursing school in the 1980's, I was not taught anything about natural childbirth, I was taught that women needed interventions and taught about the interventions. It wasn't until I became natural childbirth educator that I found out how our bodies really work during birthing and how to work with the body's natural birth capabilities. Many women live in localities where they need to be aware that they have other options than what is traditionally offered in their communities- they may have to fight for their right to have the birth of their choice. This book does an excellent job at empowering women to look for healthy birth choices- I look forward to the day when your experience of forward thinking and practices in a hospital setting is the norm, rather than the exception."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"I have always been really scared of the birthing process. After reading this book, I felt much more empowered and confident about the whole process. Now I am really looking forward to it and feel like I understand so much more about how our bodies naturally can help us through birthing. This book sparked my interest and now I have learned a lot more about natural, drug-free birthing options. I am excited instead of scared. As with anything, we still need to make our own personal decisions about how we want to do things, but I really feel like reading this book opened me up to many options that I wasn't aware of or hadn't considered. It amazes me how many people go through being pregnant and birthing with a very limited view of how it &quot;should be done&quot;. When I was reading the book, there were so many times where I thought, &quot;yeah, that makes a lot of sense&quot;, even though I had never thought about it myself.I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"Harper has good points and empowers women to make wise choices and take responsiblity for their own labor, deliver, births. Unlike the reader who found it to be information not pertinent to today (I wish I had her hospital &amp; doctor in my town), my birth experience with my first (&amp; so far only child) was very much taken out of my control. My child was never in danger, I was never in danger. And despite my &quot;birth plan&quot; and my constantly telling my doctor that I was okay with however long my labor took as long as baby &amp; me were fine,she intervened and eventually I ended up with a c-section. Hospital protocol dictated that I be put in hospital gown, hooked up to iv and fetal monitor despite the fact that it slowed my labor and made the pains more intense. A nurse came in every hour and offered me some sort of pain releif despite the fact that I had expressed that I didn't want it. She'd tell me I didn't have to be martyr. That was agrivating. As a result, I've been looking for hope to avoid this the next time around. Had I read this book before I believe I would NOT have the physical or emotional scars of the cesearean. I know some women are okay with their c-sections and I probably would be too if I knew that my life or my baby's life had been saved. But neither of us were ever in jeporady."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"because it focuses on the mother-to-be naturally reclaiming the birth process. This book was one of my tried-and-true resources during my pregnancy while I was thoughtfully trying to decide what birth experience I wanted. I ended up making an informed decision to have a midwife-assisted natural homebirth, and it was the most exhilarating experience of my life. There is no other way I would want to bring a child into this world. I challenge any mother-to-be to think for herself, inform herself of all the options, and make the choice SHE (not just her OB/GYN) feels is right. Thank God a medically-controlled hospital birth is not the only option. Blessed are the babies who receive such a warm welcome into the world. And, my heart breaks for every innocent little soul who is yanked from his mother's womb by a pair of cold, latex-gloved hands in a cold, bright, sterilized hospital. Trust me, women...there IS a better way!

It also gives you reasons why a \\"conventional\\" hospital birth is not all it's cracked up to be.I recommend this book to any friends of mine that are pregnant, I think it's important to be able to make detailed choices regarding the birth of your baby."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"Gentle Birth Choices is an excellent book for all expectant parents, regardless of their birthing intentions (i.e. birth center, home birth, hospital birth, natural birth or water birth). Moreover, childbirth educators of any affiliation will benefit from the information covered in the text and on video.Gentle Birth Choices is riveting, yet powerful. Barbara Harper guides the reader through a history of birth and birthing procedures, dispels the myths perpetuated by the medical establishment and presents alternatives to hospital birth. However, for those who are unable to birth outside of a hospital, Ms. Harper provides guidance so that the reader may obtain the best, &quot;gentle&quot; birth possible. The book benefits expectant parents in that it presents them with options, some of which they may have not previously considered. Moreover, childbirth educators will not only find the book informative for teaching purposes, but also useful for influencing the medical establishment in a tactful manner.Like the book, the video is an asset for both expectant parents and educators. Whether you have never seen a birth before or have witnessed thousands, the births contained in the video tape are absolutely beautiful and refreshing, relaxing yet empowering. After watching the video you will want to share it with everyone you know!I wouldn't hesitate to recommend both book and video! In fact, I've already gone one further -- I purchased it for my cousin who is expecting in April."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"This is an excellent book. The pictures are gorgeous, as usual Suzanne Arms has done terrific photography, and the descriptions of childbirth are pretty acurate. I must state though that every woman's experience of childbirth will be her own and be different so just because someone's childbirth was one way as described in this book it does not mean it will happen the same way for you. Technocratic birth is still the norm throughout the country and it is important to read books like this to prepare yourself should you be considering a hospital birth. The writer has obviously had a bad experience in the hospital, but many people have and I admire her wanting to share her experience as a warning to others. In my last hospital birth in 1999 I too was subjected to many of the interventions I did not want, for the third and final time I gave birth in the hospital. Never again. I wish I had read this back in 1995 before I had my first son and maybe things would have been different. Hospitals are for sick people, not pregnant women who are low risk. Also, someone else who reviewed here made some mention of a baby having an umbilical cord wrapped around its neck as a reason for c-sec, but that is not necessarily true. It is a small matter to unwrap a cord from around an infants neck as it is being born...I know as this happened with my son at his birth at home this past spring. If I had been in the hospital...would they have cut me open? Who knows?"},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"Many books are written on birthing noutside the hospital, but most of them come from authors who are extremely biased. You can't avoid that, but this is a book which uses scientific studies to back up its biases, convincing the reader that the author supports natural childbirth because it has been proven safer, not because they are part of some conspiracy theory. I literally would pick up natural childbirth books and flip right to the back to see if the author cited medical studies. Most don't, but this has a good resource section. She cites statistic, national averages, medical journals, research studies, quotes from medical association conferences, etc. There is also a good history of midwifery and obstetrics - very interesting.Wanting to give birth outside a hospital is not necessarily the most popular decision and those who support hospital births often say, \\"I would never forgive myself if something happened to the baby\\". However, most people have not done the research or read the material to make an informed decision. I wanted to find scientific research that proves that a \\"low-risk\\" birth outside a hospital is as safe or safer than those in a hospital. This has been the most helpful book so far.I just discovered \\"Obsteric Myths Versus Research Realities\\" by Henci Goer which seems like it also may have good scientific backup. You may want to check it out. This book is great for learning little statistics and facts to reference when friends and family members question the wisdom and safety of non-traditional birth. If you're going to go against the mainstream, be well-informed, not just easily persuaded.For another non-citation book, I also enjoyed Midwife's Pregnancy and Childbirth Book by Marion McCartney and Antonia Van Der Meer, which talks about the possible interventions you may encounter at a hospital, why you may need them, why you may not want them; as well as other good information"},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"As a doula, I have not only watched and enjoyed this video, but also shared it with many of my clients. It gives a wonderful view of several different types of births, helping the future parent make educated decisions about the type of birth they want. It also is very realistic in terms of what to expect during labor. I look forward to reading the book after enjoying the video for so long!"},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"I was pretty sure I wanted a midwife when I bought this book. I was hoping for an instruction guide to birthing gently, more naturally, with a CNM rather than an OB.What this book actually is, is a guide to deciding what kind of birth to have. It's a bit preachy, too, not unusually so, but not exactly openminded, either. So if you are wondering if there is a better way, but don't know anything about midwifery or homebirth, you might learn something. If you have, say, researched it on the Internet, you might already know what this book has to say.I would recommend one of Ina May Gaskin's great books before this one."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"Gentle Birth Choices lays out the various aspects of childbirth, and explains the drawbacks of medicated birth or birthing interventions that many moms may encounter. This isn't a how-to book (such as Hypnobirthing or Bradley), but it does inform as to why \\"natural\\" birth choices are better, both for parents and baby. There are helpful sections at the back, listing questions to ask your health practitioner and your hospital or birthing center so that you can go into your labor and birth better informed (or find a different practitioner while you still have time)."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"One of the best birth books available, with options ranging from hospital birth to waterbirth.

I highly recommend it for anyone planning a gentle and natural birth, but also for those who are not sure what they think about epidurals, induction, interventions, et cetera. You may be amazed at how leaving this book lying around the house can turn even a first-time father into a birth advocate, too! ;>)Suzanne Arms' photography is just breathtaking.

Ms. Harper is thorough and honest, she did her research and presents the facts in a way that is concise and easily understood, by even the newest, youngest mom. Too much technology has intruded into the age-old practice of having babies the way nature and God intended - women are strong and powerful and built to have babies, without drugs, without intervention, without doctors. If you think your doctor has 'informed\\" you, think again. This book has the answers. I used it, I followed it and I recently purchased a copy for my daughter-in-law who is pregnant with my first grandbaby!

It gives complete, accurate information about natural labor and childbirth, and is great source if you have already chosen natural labor or are thinking about it. Though my birth experience was awful and not the way I had planned (planned a homebirth), what I read and what I saw on the included DVD stayed in the back of my mind throughout the entire 37 hours of unmedicated labor.You CAN do it, and God bless you for giving yourself this option."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"When I was pregnant, I read many books, wanting to explore the many options that I had. I ultimately decided on birthing in a hospital, but with a doula and a midwife. While I knew that both would work to assist me in a natural birth, I still felt unsure of whether or not *I* could handle it. Often, pregnant women are told horror stories of the pain, of how most women are \\"screaming\\" for an epidural, of what can go wrong in labor. Very rarely are gentle, beautiful birthing stories told.For me, this is where this book comes in to play. I did not read this book looking for knowledge and factual information on birth, I'd already gleaned that from several other books. I read this book wondering if a gentle birth was truly attainable.I read this book a few weeks before my due date. After finishing it, I truly felt at peace with my body and with my decision to pursue a natural birth. Sure, I still had my doubts, but after reading about all the women who had NCB in many different settings, I felt strongly that I could do it. And a few weeks later, I DID. Once labor began, I probably forgot everything I read, but what I didn't forget was the sense that I was just one of many women who embarked on a journey toward a gentle birth, and that if other women could do it, SO COULD I. My memories of my son's birth are gentle and peaceful, most of it spent in the water with my midwife holding my hands and my doula massaging me through contractions. My only regret is not having my husband read this book, too, as I think he was more nervous than I was.Should this be the only book you read while pregnant? NO! But then, I don't think there is any one book that really covers every little piece of information about pregnancy. Do I think this is a book that should be read by every pregnant woman? Yes, I do. Perhaps if more women read this book, pregnant women would no longer be treated to horror stories about birth, and instead, would know that, in most cases, it can be a gentle, loving process."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"I highly recommend purchasing this book/video set as opposed to just the book. The book is wonderful, and will help any pregnant woman make sound, informed decisions on how to approach her individual birth. The video shows the births of several babies-which is wonderful and educational to watch. Both book and video are extremely high-quality and worth every penny you may spend on them. The set is slightly biased against our medical establishment here in the USA, and I do want to warn some of you out there to absorb the information that works for you, and just listen to the rest with an open mind and a grain of salt. The video is what really changed my mind about my approach to the upcoming birh of my son-I strongly recommend this set for every pregnant woman, whether she is interested in natural child-birth or not."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"This is absolutely a lovely book. When I first became pregnant, I assumed that when it came time to birth to my baby, I would check into a hospital, get my epidural, and have my baby. However, as the months past and I began to appreciate the tiny individual inside me, I started to get curious about the entire process of child-bearing and birth. This particular book is slightly biased against American Obstetrics, but with good reason. I would advise all pregnant women to read this book, whether this is your 1st pregnancy or your 5th: but do read it with a grain of salt. Our medical establishment, for the most part, is interested in what's best for us and our babies. But this book can help those of us who haven't experienced birth, or had an unsatisfying birth experience previously, to educate ourselves on the birth process in order to make informed, sound decisions about what birthing method is best for us and our babies. I strongly recommend purchasing this book with the accompanying video-the video is excellent: informative and high-quality. It shows several different women actually birthing their babies. The way those babies (free from the sedative effects of narcotic or epidural anesthesia) respond to their parents and the others around them immediately after birth will awe you!"},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"This is a good book full of info on childbirth. It has a good video in it too.Heather mama of 5"},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"Who will deliver my baby? On recommendation of a midwife I interviewed early in my pregnancy, I read Barbara Harper's Gentle Birth Choices. I had disavowed myself of AMA practitioners and expected to opt for a midwife but wanted to be convinced that midwifery was best for me and my baby. Harper convinced me, however, to have nothing to do with home birth.That's shocking. I prefer alternative methods. A doctor of osteopathy (DO), chiropractor and nutrition therapist restored my health after MDs destroyed it. I wanted facts.But here's her dis-infomercial's despicable thesis: Enduring natural childbirth 'proves' a woman's self-worth. Hospital birth's sole purpose is to humiliate and victimize women duly put in their places by a wretched experience.Her rage comes from a horrible birth experience 20 years ago. The hospital denied her wishes. Staff refused to let her nurse. She banged on the hospital nursery window in rage as nurses formula-fed him. She confronted her doctor, who accused her of fanaticism. This prompted her anti-doctor crusade for other methods of birth. Fine, but readers should read with a block of salt.&quot;Technocratic (hospital) birth&quot; is a &quot;rite of passage&quot; and &quot;hazing initiation&quot; into modern society. Male doctors designed symbols to strip women's dignity: forcing her to wear hospital gowns, cutting pubic hair, using IVs and inaccurate fetal monitors, flat-on-the-back birth position, postpartum separation from baby, forced episiotomies, 50 percent cesarean rates, banning fathers and loved ones from the birth.That's enough to scare first-time mothers like me into hanging on birth empowerment guru Harper's every word on self-defense against the villains. She expects readers to swallow her gospel.But I did my own research. Here's what I learned:--Women obstetricians fill Austin's yellow pages --I can wear anything I want for the birth --'Rooming in' with the newborn is encouraged --Intermittent monitoring, until and unless I choose an epidural. (The midwife I interviewed uses monitors - why, if they're so bad?) --IVs only for epidurals --Some states require Lamaze certification to attend a birth, but nobody knew of banning a spouse from the delivery (fathers may attend routine c-sections, too)The OB-GYN I chose to deliver my baby: --Encourages upright, not on-the-back birth --Gave me questionnaires asking my preferences for the birth --No pubic hair cutting --No episiotomies--Pharmaceuticals when necessary or requested --5 percent c-section rate - she doesn't perform them herself and gains nothing by recommending oneHave these changes occurred since her book's 1994 publication? To several in-the-know about hospital birth I showed page 37's disturbing photo of a birthing woman on her back, wide-apart legs strapped into stirrups. I learned from the room's design and equipment that the photo was probably from the late 1970s, way before the book's publication. So why would Harper use it to illustrate 'modern' birth, if not to scare away from hospitals potential home-birth clients?Why, in Chapter 2's 'history' of hospital childbirth, did Harper omit that doctors in the 1800s refused pain medications for birthing women because they believed suffering was God's ordained punishment for Eve's fall? Why is so little devoted to pain control, except to imply that pain is overstated and mothers who want meds are evil and selfish? She tips her hand in slamming the routine use of IVs on page 78 - they allow mothers to easily accept drugs: &quot;Many women reach a point in their labor when they feel like they cannot take [the pain] any more and are ready to throw in the towel.&quot; Finally, an honest admission that childbirth is painful.On pages 72-74 are scare stories about pain meds: They're all dangerous to baby. Thus, readers must conclude, how vile those who would consider them. She talks of a doctor's or nurse's 'misguided sense of kindness' encouraging suffering women to take meds.Truth is, nobody's pushing drugs. They are simply available. It is a mother's CHOICE whether to take them. Why must Harper judge those who opt for pain relief? In Harper's world, the woman is unworthy UNLESS she endures suffering. Why not just prove my worth in an Ironman triathlon or building my own house? Why must I must prove anything at all?Harper throughout subtly reinforces the idea that these evil MDs are all men by referring to them as 'he,' though today more than half of med school grads are women. My OB-GYN is a woman.Page 79: &quot;A chosen support person must attend childbirth classes and carry a certificate of completion in order to be present for the birth,&quot; true in some states, but we attended Lamaze in Texas, where Lamaze isn't mandatory to let him attend the birth. If Harper seeks to address educated readers, she should do her homework. They certainly will.Page 81: &quot;The routine procedure is to separate babies from their mothers for some period of time immediately following the birth, reuniting the baby and mother only three or four specified times during the day.&quot; Why, then, does Lamaze encourage rooming in if most hospitals don't allow it? Again, why present as current this information that was outdated even at publication?Millions attending Lamaze learn their babies will stay in their rooms where routine medical/hygeine procedures are done, that only babies with medical difficulties or with tired mothers who want reprieve are taken to the nursery. Hospitals are consumer-driven. Denying expectations means going bankrupt.Imagine my shock when Lamaze's magazine named Gentle Birth Choices among top birth books! Clearly, Lamaze did not read it carefully, or it would never have done its members an injustice by recommending such disinformation.If Harper cares to right her wrongs, she must learn today's practices, then revise her book to eliminate disinformation. It would behoove her to deal with her anger at her traumatic experience and forgive the offending system. If she tells the truth about midwifery, many will still opt for it."},{"Title":"Gentle Birth Choices","review":"When I was pregnant with my first child I read, believd, and greatly enjoyed this book. I felt so prepared for my home birth attended by a midwife, and was so sure everything would work out....To make a long story short, everything doesn't always work out great with home birth like the beautiful stories tell. I had to transfer to the hospital, and had a miserable birth experience with my first child. After reading this book I was so built up for a wonderful experience. I still had a healthy baby, and no major complications.I think this is a good book to read, if taken with a grain of salt. A home birth would be a wonderfull thing, as would a birth center, or an OB who was behind natural birth(the choices which are given the most credit). Unfourtunatly, in practice there are people who have difficulties with birthing, and I feel this book failed to address that, and went overboard on the 'woman-power'/have faith in your body/you can do it aspect. If you choose a home birth, this can be a wonderfull thing to do. But it is best to have a back up plan, just in case."},{"Title":"THE RELIGION OF INDIA: THE SOCIOLOGY OF HINDUISM AND BUDDHISM","review":"This book is a part of gThe economical ethics of the world religions,h which consists mainly of three parts; others are gThe Confucian and the Taoismh and gThe Ancient Judaism.h It also includes two important short briefs.This article tries to reveal the relation between the social behaviors and religious ideas of the Hinduism and Buddhism derived from the ancient India. Its analysis is founded on the fundamental question why the Capitalism hasnft developed under these religions. The conclusion is that both disturbs the economical rationalization; the caste system of the Hinduism inhibits the free market of workers, while the ideal of the Buddhism isnft the success of business, but the liberation from the inner world. Both ideas of the salvation have nothing to do with the economy. The content of this analysis begins from the religious idea and ends with its influence on the economical behavior.We canft help amazing his understanding of these religions and insight to the impact on common people. If anything should be added to his analysis of the Buddhism, its original preaching has never legitimated the caste system, but tried to overcome its temptation to keep the peaceful state of mind.If you are concerned about the modern India and the South East Asia where these religions have lived now, this book will be useful to understand their style of life."},{"Title":"Multicultural Issues and Literacy Achievement (Literacy Teaching Series)","review":"This book is a great read for anyone who teaches.

The landscape is so menacingly empty, so flat, that she wonders if she will take a step and fall off the edge of the world. In a bit, the scene changes to a different part of Chicago, and we meet protagonist/narrator Ellie Foreman, who soon receives a mysterious video that appears to show a woman being murdered. The video is delivered anonymously, and Foreman, a documentary video producer, feels compelled to investigate even after delivering the video to the police. Of course, cop Georgia Davis tells her to stay out of it, but Foreman is disturbed. Why was the video given to her? Who is the woman, and who killed her?While this tale unwinds in the present United States, in alternating chapters the clock turns back in the crumbling Soviet Union. Best friends Arin and Mika try to cope in Georgia as their husbands see their military careers evaporate when rubles stop flowing in from Moscow to support the troops. Months go by, and there is no money. What choices will these people make to survive?This book is so full of yearning, struggling characters that it is amazing it sits quietly on a bedside table. You almost expect to hear it murmur and see it restlessly stir. The likable Foreman juggles a documentary on foster children, her teenage daughter, and a lover whose behavior is worrying her. Her father, who lives in an assisted living facility nearby, longs for the days when his friends weren't dying or coping with the onset of dementia. Foreman's lover, who was raised in foster care, is obsessed with a desire for blood ties. Searching for his relatives in Europe is the most important thing in the world to him, and suddenly, his efforts may have produced results. Whether in America or Georgia, all of Hellmann's characters toil and hope for the best.Not all books of mystery fiction are meant to be page-turning thrillers. This one is an insightful book populated by memorable characters whose decisions affect strangers thousands of miles away and result in more than one murder. Hellmann has a compelling story to tell, and her writing is very well done, whether she's relating how the facets in a diamond are cut, creating dialogue, or painting the landscape of Chicago. She is effortlessly entertaining, but she can also make you re-read a paragraph for the joy of her descriptions. Here is an example:\\"The storm dumped five new inches of snow on the ground, but the streets were clear by ten. So was my driveway, thanks to Fouad, who must have plowed before dawn. I was grateful. I was nursing a wicked hangover; I doubted I could have picked up a shovel. Turning onto Happ Road, I had to shade my eyes. Winter on the North Shore can look like one of those Currier & Ives scenes you see on cookie tin lids. Today, though, the sun shot bursts of light through the trees like artillery fire. Everything was too bright, too intense, too loud.\\"I'm looking forward to reading another book by Libby Fischer Hellmann. I enjoyed this one. These characters won't be leaving my mind any time soon."},{"Title":"Image of Death, An (Ellie Foreman Mysteries)","review":"I've read all of Ms. Hellmann's work, and all have been wonderful. This may be her best work yet. The writing is polished, the prose of the back story especially evocative, the tale itself both sad and satisfying. Ellie continues to be a protagonist of real dimensions beset by very real personal problems. Although Chicago is always a marvelous character in Hellmann's work, here the story encompasses a much broader, more ambitious landscape in both time and geography, and the author does a superlative job of making it all vivid. I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Image of Death, An (Ellie Foreman Mysteries)","review":"Libby Fisher Hellmann has a remarkable ability to tell the tale of ordinary people who rise to the challenge of extraordinary circumstances.

I think \\"A Bitter Veil\\" is the standout from the four I've read so far, but these works all have major things in common: great central concepts, strong grounding in facts, believable characters, and plots that advance briskly without gaps in logic. Next up is an entry in the Georgia Davis series. For an author to manage one series well is tough enough, let alone two."},{"Title":"Image of Death, An (Ellie Foreman Mysteries)","review":"The plot drives this story more than the characters do. Hellmann does a great job with the Eastern European aspect of the story, where she touches on human trafficking and forced prostitution. The one problem I had was that Ellie Foreman, the main character, kept referring to some sort of nameless danger she got into in the past that, from what I gathered, had to do with her video editing career and the police. However, that was never clarified. Consequently, the character and aspects of the story felt incomplete."},{"Title":"Image of Death, An (Ellie Foreman Mysteries)","review":"The lives of two young women from different worlds collide in this fast-paced murder mystery. Fans of Leslie Glass, Lisa Scottoline and J. A. Jance will be thrilled to discover the author Libby Fischer Hellmann and her crime series featuring Ellie Foreman.Ellie is an endearing and precocious young video producer who manages to fight crime, raise a teenager, care for a father and have a relationship with the man she loves. She describes David as too old for \\"boyfriend,\\" but too young for \\"companion.\\" He is too conservative for \\"lover\\" and not PC enough for \\"significant other.\\" And, she dreams of producing the next award-winning video documentary.Feeling cozy and safe, Ellie works at home in her small neighborhood north of Chicago. Stolen bikes and drunk driving are the high-profile crimes here. Her teenage daughter answers the door as Ellie is cooking dinner, and returns with a package containing a videotape. The tape is blank and Ellie lets it run as she idly stares at the snowy screen, and thinks it is a prank. Her mind wanders--until after a long lead in, it abruptly changes into a surveillance view of a young woman dressed in jeans and a t-shirt huddled in a small room. Her face looks bruised and her shoulders sag. Suddenly two men in ski masks rush through a door. The woman staggers up to greet them. As a puff of smoke explodes beside her the woman crumples to the floor and something dark begins to creep across her chest.Ellie is stunned. Her intuition tells her that she has just witnessed a murder. Furthermore she feels responsible for solving the crime since the tape was delivered to her doorstep.Arin's tragic story is revealed in surreal flashbacks. The reader is propelled along with Ellie Foreman as she is innocently entangled in this same dangerous world of murder and corruption. We learn she is from the Republic of Georgia whose husband was in the military before he was killed. What is Arin doing near Chicago? How did her life spiral into crime and prostitution?Armchair Interviews says: A mystery that will keep you at the edge of your seat."},{"Title":"Image of Death, An (Ellie Foreman Mysteries)","review":"Another disappointment... It's no fun reading a book when you know the outcome right away. A plot twist once in awhile would have helped. The characterization of Ellie was difficult to believe. Her clingy relationship with her daughter was irritating enough, why did we have to suffer through hers with her boyfriend David, too? Characters than are capable of intimate relationships are much more interesting. Far too much of this series is spent on her personal issues, definitely not eough on the mystery!"},{"Title":"Variable Universal Life","review":"This book provides an overview of variable universal life products in the US. It is designed as a continuing education textbook for financial planners and insurance brokers.The language is simple to read and it provides exercises in each chapter. A review of different life insurance products is in the first chapter.If you are interested in VULs because you are considering purchasing one, this is an outstanding book to get for the money. It describes how the polices work in a way that is much clearer than what is provided in a prospectus.Unfortunately, the book does not make recommendations on companies or what premiums are at various companies.

What I got was a blurry New Age philosophy that states in the intro that is is a modern adaptation of stregheria, thus not the real thing. Caveat emptor!!! I read them anyway, since I had spent my money on them, and neither had any impact on me other than sadness that I had wasted it."},{"Title":"The Witches' Craft: The Roots of Witchcraft & Magical Transformation","review":"A wonderful book from beginning to end. In the introduction Mr. Grimassi states that one of the reasons he chose to write this book was that \\"Many young people in the Craft community now have never heard of many things that were once the basic elements of practicing Witchcraft.\\" Sad but true. This book has helped me fill in the gaps in my magickal training and has explained in deeper detail why I was trained to do certain things in certain ways.

Every Witch should have this book in their library along with &quot;Wiccan Mysteries&quot; and you'll have all the books that you will ever need."},{"Title":"The Witches' Craft: The Roots of Witchcraft & Magical Transformation","review":"In THE WITCHES' CRAFT, Raven Grimassi, a hereditary Italian witch continues to inform those who care to know about the ways of witches, Wicca, and pagans. At the time CRAFT was published, Grimassi was directing Elder of the Arician Tradition. CRAFT describes the resurgence of the \`Old Ways' of Witchcraft into the modern world. Had they completely disappeared? Grimassi thinks not as he was taught a hereditary path, but whether or not you have access to hereditary material, you can find and use the well worn path of Wicca until you find your own path of heart.For those who might find the notion of Wicca or witchcraft off-putting, Grimassi raises an important point..who determines what is religion? \\"Mainstream\\" religions with numerous members can claim a secure status no matter how \\"wacky\\" their ideas might seem to the non-religious or members of competing religions. However, Wicca, the oldest of all religions is viewed by some sceptics as a recent incarnation, a fabrication, or something worse. Grimassi says no other religion is held to the standards of \\"purity\\" imposed on Wicca. And what is Wicca..nothing less than the religion of our paleolithic fore-parents who were not arrogant know-it-all moderns. Our ancient parents understood that humans must be at-one with the natural world which is a mystical place. They also understood that the path of heart illuminates this truth and provides the individual with the reason for living.Grimassi's description of the differences between the \\"well-worn path\\" taught by various religious traditions (including Wicca) and the journey of the individual as s/he follows the trajectory of her own soul-path agrees with the teaching of Joseph Campbell who wrote and spoke of the \\"hero's journey.\\" Grimassi says you choose a religious tradition to get you started on the 'well worn path', however, to truly progress you must extend yourself and follow the path the hero blazed. This path is frightening as each of us believes a monster awaits us at the end of the inward exploration of our own existence. Campbell suggests and Grimassi agrees that rather than a monster, at the end of the journey the aloneness you experience will be dissolved and you will be one with the world. This at-one-ment can only be reached on the individual soul-path.Although the CRAFT is for intermediate students (parts of it may frighten the novice), I've believe Grimassi's latest book should be included among standard Wicca classics including Starhawk's SPIRAL DANCE and inspirational works by Cunningham, Valiente, and others. Grimassi does not discuss alternative Wiccan traditions in great detail in this book (see Margo Adler's DRAWING DOWN THE MOON - yes, she is the NPR reporter - and Starhawk's book to acquire this detail), however he does share information about his personal variant - \`Italian witchcraft' - which he detailed in his earlier book of the same name. (Grimassi uses the term \\"witch\\" or strega - the Anglo Saxon Wicce the male version of Wicca sounds similar to the word witch and is probably the source of the English term.)"},{"Title":"The Witches' Craft: The Roots of Witchcraft & Magical Transformation","review":"A wonderful and well researched book to be kept nearby (with the rest of Grimassi's works) and read over &amp; over. Over the last 20 years or so modern Wicca has gotten so far away from what it was originally that it is hardly recognisable. There are even people in the community who think it was invented in the 20th century, (and what they are doing probably was) but the roots of Witchcraft and the Lunar Goddess stretch back to neolithic times. R.G. takes us back to the roots and the real traditions, away from parking space angels and self-appointed authorities who tell you to put your scrying tools in the sun, to the true building blocks that will enable you to call yourself &quot;Witch&quot; with confidence. Tools, magic, history - it's all here, including ways to make protections and the like that are venerable and traditional - yet I've not seen them elsewhere!

However, Raven has in fact recaptured my interests in Witchcraft. Although, I have been a Witch for more then 10 years. It is refreshing to read this book. Since then I have purchased: \\"Italian Witchcraft\\", \\"Hereditary Witchcraft\\" I am as well very pleased with these books. the fact he takes the time to dive into the history is its weight in gold. If you are looking for a different connection or a connection to the Goddess and God this would be a great start.

The author is very knowledgeable with regards to the Wiccan faith. The author does a wonderful job explaining and breaking down the different views and beliefs of the old religion. Wicca is a beautiful religion, a nature religion, with many similarities to the Christian faith, regarding love and respect of others and all living things. A treasure trove regarding the history of the old religion, as well as instructive in comparing the difference of those following the Wiccan faith of today, and those of the past, who strive to keep the old ways alive passing them down to the next generations of Witches'. A very time honored religion by those who follow this ancient path. Witchcraft is a very miss understood earth religion, brought on through the ignorance of fear pounded into our heads dating back to the Salem Witch trials through organized religion. I only wish people would study it's true inner teachings, whereby one's eye's will truly be opened, when they come to realize the true magic and meaning of this beautiful nature religion, where people worship their beautiful planet and teach love and respect for all living things, right down to every single blade of grass.

I turned to this book as a last resort.My experience: I lost weight, got in shape, and strengthened my back. I've had no back problems for the past 17 years.20 minutes of my time for at least 2-3 times a week. One does not need to be in shape to do the exercises. One needs to be patient and take the time to learn each exercise and only do them at their own capacity. The process is more important than the end result. Use common sense. One can do these exercises anywhere with no equipment.The book is user friendly. One needs to read the text to get the most benefit and understand the exercises."},{"Title":"The Lotte Berk Method (or Awake! Aware! Alive! Exercises for a Vital Body)","review":"Both Lydia Bach and Callan Pinckney studied under Lotte Berk for a time, then went their separate ways. Callan did some modifications to the exercises so that people with back problems (which she also had) could do them, as well as people who were just starting out. Lydia did not modify them. When you read this book, you definitely get the message that if you are not already fit, or someone who has the flexibility of a ballet dancer or a yogi, don't bother.It kind of has some artsy/grainy black and white photography, and is interesting if you are looking at the original method to see where Callanetics came from, but as a manual of exercise, even though it demonstrates the positions, it is not as &quot;ordinary people&quot; friendly as Callanetics. Buy Callanetics instead, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Lotte Berk Method (or Awake! Aware! Alive! Exercises for a Vital Body)","review":"I have great respect for Lydia Bach.

Ms. Bach advises readers not to exercise while they are overweight because the fat will be converted into ugly bulky muscles!!! There are many such silly, uneducated statements throughout the book. The Lotte Berk method takes its movements from ballet, yoga, and therapeutic back exercises. This is nothing new. Pilates was doing it much better and for decades before anyone ever heard of Lydia or Lotte. While Ms. Bach specifically states in her book that one must study the method with a personal instructor in order to achieve true and proper form and thus results - one would have to live in New York and have lots of $$$ as the Lotte Berk Studios are expensive, exclusive, and for the wealthy. I understand that Lotte Berk is now available on video (gee, it sure took them a long time to get on the exercise video bandwagon)! Don't waste your money on Lotte Berk video,dvd,book (whatever). I highly recommend one of the many Method Pilates and Callanetics videos out there. You will not be sorry."},{"Title":"Richek World of Words 4ed","review":"I use Margaret Richek's book for tutoring purposes, both in one-on-one and group settings, for basic vocabulary and language skills. The primary purpose of this text is to strengthen the vocabulary of the learner. It is designed with the adult learner in mind, tailoring the vocabulary and language exercises to be of use to those who are continuing their education toward GED, community college and general literacy skills.Each chapter of the book has three key elements - word mastery, learning strategies, and interesting features of words. In the mastering of words, each chapter presents the tried-and-true vocabulary list, to be used again and again in the course of the chapter (and repeated occasionally throughout later chapters). Several sentences are used to put the words in context. It is not simply a dull list of definitions - words are connected, and related words given.Learning strategies are introduced in each chapter as well. These include use of a dictionary (how can you look up a word when you don't know how to spell it?), using context clues to figure out the meaning of a word, analysing word elements by parts (prefixes, suffixes, etc.), and learning words in settings such as forms, newspapers, and other familiar settings.The special interest sections include articles that highlight the vocabulary (articles include the history of Ben &amp; Jerry's, stories of how cars get named, biographical stories of famous people like Jackie Robinson, and more), as well as brief histories of words and word categories.Each chapter has a variety of exercises - mix and match, word association, fill in the blank, analyzing paragraphs, discussion questions for the reading passages, and more.The one thing I would wish for this text would be a general glossary or dictionary at the end of the book, for students to use with greater ease in looking up the meanings of words. This could be organised in the manner of a dictionary, to be useful for the dictionary use exercises, too. Other than this, \`The World of Words' serves as a very useful guide in language arts, reading and writing classes, as well as for individual tutoring for those looking to enhance their basic literacy skills."},{"Title":"Richek World of Words 4ed","review":"I was very pleased with the speedy shipping and condition of the used book.

It took me almost 6 months to work up the courage to read Mr. Palmer's book because I did not want to confront 'death' even by opening a book about the subject. When I finally did start reading it I found it hard to put down. Greg Palmer is alternately funny and somber, dealing deftly with each situation as he tries to understand what 'death' means. From his first experience with death, through the many people he encounters along the way, Mr. Palmer provides a much wider view of the world than we are used to. The book is a difficult journey, undertaken both with humor and great love.

My dad was a gag writer for comedians like Bob and Ray, Herb Shriner, Henry Morgan and a number of others during the golden days of radio. He and Greg had a fun time ribbing each other. Dad still laughed at things on his death bed.A few months after dad's passing and the release of his book, I called Greg to thank him for giving my dad a purpose outside his suffering during those months.

Opps! Too late. If you reading this, you are already in for the ride. Therefore, read this book and discover the range of rituals men and women in every society among humankind perform for this one of five most important events in our personal lives. Along the way, find confirmation older than the ancient Greek Stoic, Epictetus, who suggested physical death is not the problem. It is our fear of death. With surprising underlying warmth, Greg Palmer surveys how human societies choose to acknowledge the event none can avoid. Like birth, attainment of adulthood, marriage, and parenting, death is one of the five most ritualized life passages. The one who is born, grows up, marries, parents and dies is not the only one who is affected. In each of the five, there is an ever-shifting mix of altering relationships with others, tears, joy, and affirmatios. Take the chance this book offes and find new meanings."},{"Title":"FamilyFun Vacation Guide: Great Lakes","review":"I've lived in the Chicago area for 20 years, and there were a few things in here that I didn't know about, such as the American Girls Shop/ play in Chicago. But by and large, most of the Chicago area stuff I knew about. Where it really comes in handy is that many of the areas featured are within a few hours drive. Great if you're going to visit family and need something for the kids. We found all kinds of neat stuff about one of our favorite vacation spots in Door County, Wisconsin that we otherwise would have missed. One area that could stand to be improved - they have Chicago, then Northwestern Illinois (Galena etc). What about the 'burbs? There's a few little things here and there, but otherwise the whole Chicagoland area outside of the city limits is missed. I would also like to see more on restaurants. Chicago has a TON of restaurants,including the upscale but very cool Chicago Firehouse (actually built into a firehouse, complete with pole - saw Mayor Daley there!) and there are only 7 mentioned. All in all though, a good buy, and as I said, would make a great gift for a family with kids new to the area."},{"Title":"FamilyFun Vacation Guide: Great Lakes","review":"This book provides great family vacation ideas for the Great Lakes area.

There are a few points about this book that I have found particularly unique. E.E. Doc Smith originally wrote this story in 1915 and from that perspective of more then 40 years before we ventured into space it is very creative how he sends the characters into space. Reading the story I get a kind of Jules Verne, Steam-Punk vision of the space craft and it's accessories.The romance is a bit silly and the good guys are a bit too perfect and the villains perhaps a bit too evil but despite these issues it's a very fun story."},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"I've read the Skylark series a long time ago and even the third time around it is still exciting.

He would have loved the idea of that I think.This is the first of the Skylark series and what enamored me to his writing style and the science he was trying to bring forward. His unique and sometimes flowery wording of the late 20's is an old school lesson in morals, ethics, communication, and solid foundation to what Alfred North Whitehead talked about in &#34;Adventures of Ideas&#34; regarding Sociology, Cosmology, Philosophy, and Civilization, are all shaped by Ideas. Doc Smith fully embraces these in the Skylarks Series and writes these in a way that science and intellect bring the future of Ideas to fruition that a mass audience can understand and enjoy.These books have romance, adventure, Science (albeit somewhat tenable 85yrs later), with social and moral implications, and all done in a wonderfully woven thread of storyline. He was quite prophetic in many ways like Jules Verne and some of the other great 19th century writers. One of my favorite things is bringing forward the Idea of 3D imagery when television was in its infancy and here we are today watching 3D movies at home an on the big screen. There are many others that I don't want to spoil for you in the Adventure of these books and what you might glean from them.I only rated this book as 4, not because of the story...its an 8 in my opinion, but because whoever converted these to E-Book/Kindle included some forward and chapter leads that were not appropriate to me and somewhat took away from the Great Adventure. I am also not sure it was an exact copy of the text.

After the first couple of chapters, I had warmed up to this author, and the remainder of the book read much easier for me.Many times, I was laughing at or with the characters, rooting for the characters, and just plain well-immersed into the book. I had a lot of fun reading it, although I was worried that it would be too old for me to enjoy as much as I did.The only thing that I did not like about the book (and it did not detract from my enjoyment, it just seemed out of place) was that from time to time the two main characters would get sidetracked, describing how some piece of equipment works, or some other science-type discussion. They are usually in a time-sensitive situation, but take the time out for such talks? The scenes where this happens usually ends with one or the other saying \\"Well anyway, never mind that! Let's go!\\" or something, then the action begins again. While I appreciate the thought put into how things work in the Skylark science, it seems to always come out at the wrong times in speech.Speaking of the science of Skylark... A lot of it was very realistic, despite the book being written some 50(?) years before space travel. I was quite impressed. There were however, many things (as expected) that did not compute regarding science, but it is science-fiction, after all."},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"A revelatory experience seeing this non-\\"P-C\\" pulp story in the original text and enjoying the novel in all of its originality and adventurous glory.

It is set in the era of its publication; i.e.. the 1920s. Despite the theories of Einstein, the speed of light does not limit the velocity of the spacecraft in this story.In this novel, Richard B. Seaton is a chemist working for the Rare Metals Laboratory in Washington, DC. He is a tennis player, playing as a doubles team with Crane. Dick is also recently engaged to Dorothy Vaneman.M. Reynolds Crane is a very rich man. Since he has been the target of many aspiring wives and matchmakers, Martin avoids women. But then he meets Dorothy and learns the value of a good woman.Marc C. DuQuesne is another chemist working for the Rare Metals Lab. He is also a psychopath, without any conscience. He has moonlighted for the World Steel Company on various deals of a criminal nature.In this story, Seaton has been working on a container of heavy metal waste. He separates out several valuable metallic elements, but an unknown metal remains. Then he learns that the metal is an almost stable transuranic element. He calls the element \\"X\\" metal.In his processing, Seaton has a small accident with the waste. While electrolyzing the solution, a little waste spills into the copper steam-bath. He snatchers up the beaker, but the heavy bath plows through his lab apparatus and disappears out the window at high speed.The accident makes an exciting bit of gossip in the Lab. The next day, Dick tries to recreate the incident with a piece of copper wire, but nothing happens. The Lab folk begin to talk about his overstrained mind and go back to work.Seaton considers the circumstances surrounding the incident and decides that the main difference was that a device designed by DuQuesne was not operating during the second try. He waits until DuQuesne turns on his device and notices that the characteristic color change appears on the copper wire. He puts an electric current through the wire and it goes through the brick wall.Seaton talks to Dorothy after the first incident. She is supportive, but doesn't really understand. After the second incident, Dick goes to Crane with the story. Martin advises that they purchase the solution, so Seaton returns it to the chief clerk for auction.After buying the solution, Martin immediately forms a new corporation: the Seaton-Crane Company, Engineers. Then they call the first meeting of the board. Afterward, Seaton starts analyzing the properties of the unknown element.His investigations show that the unknown element catalyzes the release of the total energy of the copper. It can be channeled into motion or release the energy as an explosion. The element also has some other strange properties.Meanwhile, DuQuesne deduces the nature of the incident and informs a World Steel executive of the discovery. He wants to kill Seaton, steal all the solution, and gather up any available documents. The executive refuses to allow a direct attack on Seaton or Crane, but has a thief break into the mansion to steal half the waste and replace it with water.DuQuesne states his terms for working on the new element, but the World Steel executive declines. Instead, the executive has another scientist explore the properties of the element. The hireling leaves a two mile crater where the town of Bankerville, West Virginia, had been.Seaton-Crane issues an order with World Steel for construction materiel, but Crane correctly suspects that the company will deliver flawed goods. He issues another secret order to an independent steel mill that has proved dependable in the past. Seaton-Crane publicly builds the flawed craft -- which they call Old Crip -- while constructing another, larger ship in a hidden location.This tale involves Seaton and Crane in a covert war against World Steel and its minions. But their true adversary is DuQuesne. When DuQuesne abducts Dorothy with his own spaceship and flees into space, Seaton and Crane soon follow in the newly finished Skylark.Seaton and Crane accelerate continuously after the fleeing ship. Soon they exceed the speed of light. They travel far out into the cosmos.Dorothy is strong minded woman in this story, but her role in the novel is to be protected rather than as an active partner. The author treats her more kindly than others of his day, but the publishing industry believed that strong heroines would not sell SF novels. Others -- including female SF authors -- eventually overcame that restricted viewpoint.This novel made the author the leading writer of space operas for the period. Although others wrote such SF, Doc Smith wrote the stories that people anxiously awaited. He set the standard for decades.You may wonder why Seaton was making major discoveries in physics at the Rare Metals Laboratory. Mainly because the author was a chemist. Moveover, in those days, the difference between chemists and physicists was not as wide as it is today. Modern physics had been formulated over the previous twenty years, but only theorists were working on exotic aspects such as relativity and quantum mechanics.Since chemists and physicists -- indeed every scientist and engineer -- learned both classical physics and chemistry in the pursuit of their degree, chemists were fully capable of separating heavy metals using physical methods. Indeed, many of the scientists in the Manhattan project were chemists -- not physicists -- even though their major task was separating heavy metals.The author had a doctorate in chemistry -- hence his nickname of \\"Doc\\" -- and worked in this field for decades. He is better known in SF for the laterLensmanseries. Apparently much of the plot of the prequel to that series is based on his experiences as a chemist during the second World War.This series continued for three more volumes. The next installment isSkylark Three. Read and enjoy!Highly recommended for Smith fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of scientific discovery, space adventures, and old-fashioned romance. This work is included inThe Complete Skylark.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"I discovered E. E. (Doc) Smith in the late 1950's when I was a teenager. I, finally, had qualified to get into the adult section of the library (legally) and was hunting down science fiction stories. About 2/3 down one aisle, very near the bottom shelf, I spotted \\"Skylark of Space\\". I opened to the first page and was hooked. Doc Smith became my second most favorite author, next to Robert A. Heinlein.This is space opera at its finest.Richard Seaton 'discovers' what, apparently, is a new element with some astonishing properties and moves rapidly to 'research' those properties and use them. However a rival, Marc DuQuesne, suspects something and being a not so nice fellow, decides that he can rule the world, by using the wonderous properties of this new element. The two men are nearly equally matched in brains and creativity. And, we begin the \\"Skylark\\" series of novels that, in many ways, is fairly mind-blowing.I got this book home and devoured it in a few hours, the next day. At the first opportunity, I was back at the library, looking for other books in the series.Doc Smith wrote this series in the 1920's and 1930's. Some of the attitudes and some of the author's ideas are, now, outdated. Fortunately, that does not get in the way of enjoying these books.I recommend this story, as strongly as I can. It is, sort of, mind candy!"},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"It's a wild ride across the galaxy, making it a safe place for all right-thinking beings who look pretty much like us. Brilliant Seaton, wealthy Crane, a beautiful if ineffectual babe for each, and an oriental houseboy who lives to grovel, all zooming from one star system to the next. Oddly enough, every where he goes, Seaton is heaped with honors - at least by the people that don't get blown to subatomic smoosh for being un-neighborly.Since Earthman Seaton is so vastly superior to every other interstellar race in intellect, creativity, and all-American-ness, the bad guys out there are temporary annoyance. As a result, any villain worth the effort must also be from Earth: thus, we have Marc DuQuesne, as brilliant and mighty as Seaton, and as bad a bad boy as Seaton is a good boy.The original copyright on this book is almost 80 years old now. Back then, attitudes towards women and non-European cultures were neolithic by today's standards, as were other beliefs. For example, one of the highest leaders on one of those planets is both the primate of the church and commander in chief of their military. Today, the idea of a despot of the state religion, in control of that army and destructive power - well, we just can't see it as the concentration of rectitude that Smith made it out to be.But that was then, in that optimistic time when WWII was still so far in the future. It's like nostalgia for a time I never experienced, seeing that moral simplicity and technological optimism. I'm glad the racism and naivete are gone today, but I wonder how much else we lost in shedding them.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"This is the kind of sciencefiction i grew-up on, it is the best ever.

Kids, ask your parents what a slide rule is/was...)Easy enjoyable reading. Get the series. Heck, get all of Doc's books!!!"},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"E.E. Smith's _The Skylark of Space_ (1928) is at least a nominal classic of science fiction, so perhaps it would not hurt to quickly give a bit of the novel's history. In 1915, a friend of Smith's, Dr. Carl Garby, suggested that he put some of his speculative ideas into the form of a novel. Smith worked on the novel in collaboration with Garby's wife, Lee Hawkins Garby, who was supposed to help him with the romantic scenes. (The Seatons were modeled on Smith and his wife and the Cranes were modeled on the Garbys.) The novel was set aside in 1916. But in 1919, Smith began writing again. He finished in 1920.As it turned out, it took longer to sell the novel than it did to write it. After eight years of collecting rejection slips, Smith saw a copy of _Amazing_ on the newsstand and mailed the novel in to that magazine. It was promptly bought by editor T. O'Connor Sloane and serialized in the August, September, and October issues. The August issue featured a marvelously garish cover illustration to the novel by Frank R. Paul. Smith's pay for the novel did not even cover the cost of postage he had spent peddling the novel over the years. But it didn't matter. Smith had become famous overnight-- at least in science fiction circles.John Clute is one of the most perceptive critical observers of Doc Smith. In a 1982 essay on Smith, he states that _The Skylark of Space_ recaptures the childhood fantasy of playing hooky from school, of being completely free. Dick Seaton and his pals \\"as easy as pie\\" (130) discover a way to scoot off to the stars, where \\"everything is shiny new\\" (130). Clute compares the world of _Skylark_ with that of the Oz books by L. Frank Baum.With the best will in the world, I have tried to read the novel in this light-- as a kind of classical Edisonade. But I cannot get past the incredible awfulness of Smith's writing. His characters are cardboard, his plot is juvenile, and his style... Well, here are his heroes and heroines in zero gravity:\\"Tweet, tweet-- I'm a canary,\\" Seaton said, flapping his arms. \\"Toss us a line, Mart.\\"\\"A Dicky-bird, you mean,\\" Dorothy said.Crane studied the floating pair with mock gravity. [Noble sentence!]\\"That is a peculiar pose, Dick. What is it supposed to represent-- Zeus sitting on his throne?\\"\\"I'll sit on your neck, you lug, if you don't get a wiggle up with that rope!\\" (78-79)As for the comparison with Oz, I would like to point out one noteworthy difference. Baum kept the violence in his Oz books to a minimum. In _Skylark_ alone, Smith's heroes slaughter thousands upon thousands of aliens with the intent of exterminating them. To be sure, genocidal heroes of Edisonades were not unusual in those days-- witness the Frank Reade dime novels and Garett P. Serviss's _Edison's Conquest of Mars_ (1898). But it is a trait that has not worn well over time.Also a bit odious by modern standards are the values of the race of \\"good aliens\\" that spring from a religion based on a kind of social Darwinism: \\"Believing as they do that the fittest must survive, and of course thinking themselves the superior type, it is ordained that Mardondale must be destroyed, root and branch\\" (127).Another practice that Dick Seaton seems to approve of is their lack of any liberal Mollycoddling: \\"They have no hospitals for the feeble-minded or the feeble-bodied; all such are executed\\" (127). Couples who wish to marry are given a psychic probe. Anybody who fails the test is immediately shot. I believe that if I were living in this society I would have been killed at an early age. It would be no consolation to me that my death would be paving the way for someone else's notion of a super race.Yes, _The Skylark of Space_ has exuberance. Yes, it gave us the galaxy for a playground. But no, it is not a good novel."},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"The Skylark of Space is classic space opera, and is a window into a different era of science fiction, while still being completely fun.

You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"Some might consider this book, the first real Science Fiction; it's that groundbreaking. [...] Works like H.G. Wells, War of the Worlds didn't attempt to explain much scientifically but Doc Smith gets into the nitty gritty details that make it \\"Science\\" instead of \\"Fantasy\\".For sure the dialog and characters are rather strange to a modern person but they fit with the type of personalities I've seen in movies from the early 20th century so I'm not so sure they aren't realistic.But remember, this was written between 1915 and 1921!!! The story has atomic energy, spacecraft, black holes (dark star), beams, missiles, machine guns shooting atomic explosive bullets, rays, tractor beams, shields, screens, force fields and many other things that were original with this book and I've never seen prior. They even discuss Einstein's theory of the speed of light being the maximum speed in the universe but of course they violate it in order to travel through the galaxy.I consider Doc Smith to be the main, if not THE foundation of Sci Fi. It's followed by 2 more, even better books in the series (Skylark Three, Skylark of Valeron) and a final one that is not so good (Skylark DuQuesne).Doc Smith's other material is even better, the Lensmen Series, from which a lot of Star Wars was derived. In those books they are using entire planets as missiles and weapons. I think when movie makers really discover the ingenuity and imagination in Doc's works, we'll see a new age of Science Fiction cinema."},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"Pulpy Space opera Goodness...The good guys are good beyond belief, the bad guys help out sometimes too...But these remind me SO much of the old flash gordon, Matinee at the Bijou kinda stuff I cant help but LOVE them"},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"This is excellent!

Well, naturally, he and a buddy and a couple of girlfriends load it onto their own home-built space ship** and blast off to visit the moon, or maybe Mars, or Jupiter. Anyway, things go a little wrong and they end up in deep intersteller space.Almost before you can say Jack Robinson, the boys and girls are up to their necks in a war of planetary extermination waged between their allies (who look and talk and think just like good old, reliable, green-skinned Anglo-Saxons) and the no-good, nasty villains (who don't.)As if that weren't enough, the motor cyclist has an earth-born rival, one Marc C. \\"Blackie\\" (of course) DuQuesne, who is just as bright, a lot more ruthless and has this little plan to make himself Emperor of the Universe--or maybe just the galaxy***, I forget.Grab your spacesuits, boys, check the batteries of your blasters and jump on board.Hoo-BOY!!!!-----*E. E. Smith, Ph.D, yes, that was the form of the name the man used in his fiction, was a genuine chemist with a spectacularly soaring imagination and somewhat less high-flying literary skill. With the \\"Skylark\\" series and then the \\"Lensmen\\" series, he was probably the most popular and influential of all the pulp science fiction (or \\"scientifiction\\") authors of the 1920s, 30s and even into the 40s.** They christen it \\"Skylark.\\" Hail to thee, blithe spaceship.*** It should be kept in mind that in 1928, the astronomical world was only slowly emerging from the debate over whether the Milky Way Galaxy was the only \\"island universe\\" in all of space."},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"Way back when he was a young author, EE 'Doc' Smith wrote the Skylark series--which accounts for the youngish attitudes of the characters.

The two of them build a spaceship--of course the plans and the power source are stolen and duplicated--and set out on a galaxy wide adventure with three others that has them fighting moving plants and other dangers, and finally come back to the earth wiser and raring to go on more adventures.The book is a nice lighthearted read if you want to take yourself to another world and forget your troubles for a while."},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"Hard to come by but well worth the trouble this is the rest of the story of Mark\\"Blackie\\"DuQuesne;one of the most interesting characters in scifi.Perhaps more interesting is 'Doc'Smith's treatment of sex & social nudity:I smell Bob Heinlein's influence here.Classic space opera with a twist.Recommended."},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"It's been said that \\"The Golden Age of science fiction is thirteen.\\"I'd quibble about that in some ways, but - it was, in fact, almost fifty years ago, at the age of thirteen, that i first picked up my Dad's copy of one of \\"Doc\\" Smith's books - \\"Galactic Patrol\\", as a matter of fact - and flipped it open at random.I could still just about quote the passage i read (a description of the Delgonian torture chamber, if it matters) to this day.\\"Doc\\" Smith, writing in a more innocent and less sophisticated day, created some of the most memorable SF of any age - if you can deal with the pure 1930s (1920s, in this case) pulp-style writing, that is. But, for a lot of people, the sheer narrative drive and the size of the concepts and action behind that purple prose still hold a fascination.Even if Smith's stories didn't charge ahead like a runaway locomotive, this particular book would still be very important in the hsitory of science-fiction - while it's not (a some have said it is) the first story that could be called \\"space opera\\", it *is* the first (so far as i can determine) to take its action outside the boundaries of the Solar System.And that was quite a step.In the Foreword to the original hardcover edition (published lord-knows-when exactly) \\"Doc\\" remarks that the action of the story violates Einstein's Theory of Relativity. As he says, at the time, it was only theory, albeit a strongly-plausible one (and Smith, as the holder of a PhD in Organic Chemistry, would have been - as many today involved in varius debates over scientific issues are not - of the precise meaning of the word \\"theory\\" in science), and so he has seen fit to disregard it in this series. In later books (the \\"Lensman/History of Civilisation\\" series), he did accept Einstein, but created a large dose of bafflegab out of pure handwavium to sidestep it.An interesting aspect of this book - especially compared to some of Smith's other writings, almost forty years later, in which Soviet Communism was a villain - is it's rather bolshie anti-capitalist sentiments. The true \\"villain\\" of this book is not Dick Seaton's fellow chemist, the Byronic Marc C. DuQuesne, but the World Steel Corporation, which uses murder, extortion and sundry other dirty dealing to get what it wants. (Rather in the manner that today's extreme left often portrays corporations like Exxon or GM.)So i gave it five stars for what it is. I might give it three stars in terms of recommending it or not to a modern reader with no specific context for the book; two or even one for a reader who is (overly) sensitive to things that then were simply part of the mass assumptions of culture, and today are considered a bit less than acceptable. (Casual references to Martin Crane's valet/butler/general factotum Shiro as a \\"Jap\\", for instance, or the general portrayal of female characters and their relationships to the male protagonists ana antagonist, for another.)But it's an absolute hoot if you don't suffer from one of those regrettable deficiencies in your mental vision and \\"Star Wars\\" probably wouldn't have been possible without \\"Doc\\" Smith, John W. Campbell or Edmund Smith (to name three space-opera pioneers at random) - nor would my own brother, David Weber's, \\"Dahak\\" books -collected in a single volume as \\"Empire from the Ashes\\", which are fairly clearly a homage to Smith from one who (as did i) almost literally cut his teeth on him.(I wonder whether this edition follows the original serial, on which Smith had solicited collaboration from a friend, Lee Garby, since he felt he needed help writing romance from the female viewpoint, or the later editions he seems to have edited out her contributions and removed her name.)"},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"Sometimes we finish a book with disappointment, only to realize later that the disappointment was our failure to understand the writer. SKYLARK DUQUESNE is such a book for me, with the most jarring final sentence I can remember - a sentence so unlike the usual Doc Smith firecracker, I was for a long time angry and sad that the old boy had so badly \\"lost it\\" at the end of his life.Yet I now smile at the idea that this space opera pioneer was still reaching for new high notes - and I think he succeeded. If you consider this book as the beginning of a new Duquesne cycle, rather than the end of the Seaton cycle, suddenly you see that Doc has left us with wonderful new possibilities to imagine. For, as the song goes, \\"the minute you let her under your skin, then you begin to make it better.\\""},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"E. E. \\"Doc\\" Smith's four book \\"Skylark\\" series of novels that began here with \\"Skylark of Space\\" invented and defined the classic \\"Space Opera\\" genre, to which stories like E. E. \\"Doc\\" Smith's later \\"Lensmen\\" series, the \\"Perry Rhodan\\" \\"Bookazine\\" series, Star Wars, and Star Trek all owe their inspiration.Like all good stories, \\"Skylark of Space\\" succeeds because the author is honest with himself about the goal of his story, which in this case is to tell an interesting yarn without letting finicky details, such as scientific accuracy, get in the way of the fun.The book's main characters include our hero, the brilliant scientist Richard Seaton, his fiance' Dorothy Vaneman; his best friend, tycoon M. Reynolds Crane; and his unapologetically Machiavellian nemesis, former fellow government scientist Marc C. \\"Blackie\\" DuQuesne. They are all well painted as vibrant, interesting people. Their interactions, strong and quirky personalities, and even their human failings, are all believable, interesting, and easy to identify-with.As you make guess, our hero starts out by stumbling upon some great new discovery, in this case a seemingly limitless source of power. He then proceeds to cook up a whole suite of inventions based on it: such as a faster than light space drive; incredible weapons; and new, non-polluting and safe electric power plants which he builds with help of his friend Crane for (of course) the good of humanity. Brilliant, incorruptible, pure of heart, and with a charming (though a bit naive) personality, Richard Seaton is the prototypical All-American hero. He is quaint, idealistic and simplistic to our 21st century eyes, but nevertheless fun to read about. Give him a white hat and put him on a horse, and you have the hero of those old Western TV shows of the 1950's.As the baddie in this story, Marc C. DuQuesne is impressed with Seaton's scientific genius, but has total disdain for his idealism: seeing him as naive. He feels Seaton's willingness to freely contribute from his discoveries for the benefit of humanity is a foolish waste of resources on those who will be unable to use it wisely. Throughout the book, he makes temporary alliances of mutual advantage with various human and alien baddies in his attempts to eliminate Seaton from the picture and take control of Seaton's discoveries and power.The good guys win out (because their hearts are obviously pure): uniting all of humanity. In the process, Seaton wins-over various previously warlike alien races, who in turn provide their own scientific knowledge and technologies to Seaton in support of his goals of peace, prosperity and happiness for all.While this very optimistic view of the human spirit is a little dated and quaint in our eyes, the story is very much based on the American certainty that hard work, a good heart, and a good mind will always win out in the end. An attitude that underlies American culture as much now as it did back in the late 1920's, when this book was first published. (Although that certainity is now expressed in more nuanced, complex ways: often with more than a bit of irony.)\\"Skylark of Space\\" a great and fun ride. Sit back and enjoy it with the certainty that the good guys will always win out in the end, despite facing odds that are heavily stacked against them again and again throughout the tale!"},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"I enjoyed reading \\"Skylark Duquesne\\" as a kid and still enjoy this, last, novel in the Skylark series. While some of the interactions and explanations are somewhat dated, it does not interfere with the enjoyment of this story.Doc Smith pulls out all the stops and has Seaton and DuQuesne work together to rid the universe of the evil Chlorians.The book is fast paced and the scale is HUGE!While Seaton is still the hero of the series, DuQuesne takes on a complexity of character that is amazing. The resolution of the novel, and the series, is satisfactory.It does help to read the rest of the series first. However, I recommend this book without qualification."},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"an easy-to-read adventure and an SF classic, but outdated by &quot;ten thousand rows of Christmas trees.&quot;"},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"This is sciece fiction in the grand old \\"Buck Rogers\\" style. Written in 1928 it is interesting to see it talking about atomic energy long before it was ever developed. It is also interesting to see the slang used in those days such as a great deed referred to as \\"A flash and a loud report\\" or a liar refered to as \\"A man with a paper nose\\". Campy to the max."},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"A get into space opera, if you like, with some of your standard Smith elements, good good guys, sneaky bad guys, and lots of blowing stuff up. It is not too bad, but certainly isn't the Lensman series, by any stretch, and the fact that it is an earlier work probably shows. Still, pioneering sort of stuff for the time, but shows a bit more of the late 19th century type influences, I think."},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"Science fiction can be a serious examination of social issues, or a study of human character in a changing world, or a simple tribute to the majesty of all that we know and all that we don't.Then there's Doc Smith. His super-powered Frat Boys in Space, Seaton and Crane, leap with ADHD attention span from one world-shattering cataclysm to the next - including the ones they cause themselves. They vanquish the evil-doers of the universe from their planet-sized battlewagon, but make sure there's a white picket fence in there somewhere for The Little Woman. They save the downtrodden good guys on planets everywhere, and we know they're good guys because they look Earthian right down to reproductive compatibility. Caucasian, too, in case anyone wondered whether they really were good guys. They aren't prejudiced by the standards of when these books were written, though. Some of those otherwordly humans are green (not their fault, y'know, can't hold it against them) and some Asians from earth, because only Earth has non-anglo faces on it and because every grand hero needs a housekeeper.The finale has The Earth Guys getting rid of The Bad Guys by crashing something into their galaxy and ruining the property values. They were careful to evacuate all of Our Sort, of course. It was a pretty big galaxy, with billions of inhabited planets to evacuate and/or destry, so the job took two or three guys the whole afternoon. Phew - they were afraid it might have been a tough one.By being true to its 1950s spirit (despite 1960s authorship), this will offend modern sensibilities in a half-dozen ways. I sure don't want those days back, but that quaint naivete is part of the series's charm. If anything it's even more alien to a modern reader than all those improbable beings from unfriendly planets.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"According to the introduction to this book, \\"The Skylark of Space\\" is the first \\"space opera\\" ever written. The story first appeared during the 1920's in the pages of \\"Amazing Stories,\\" and was reedited in the 1950's by the author, E.E. \\"Doc\\" Smith. Smith went on to write other Skylark stories, as well as a few other sci-fi series. The introduction also calls attention to other themes in the story: the role of women in the sci-fi genre, the idea of manifest destiny, and the accuracy of predictions made in the story as opposed to real scientific development.\\"The Skylark of Space\\" is entertaining. Of that there is no doubt. Scientist Richard \\"Dick\\" Seaton, during the course of mundane research at his government laboratory, accidentally discovers a new means of propulsion. Of course, no one at the lab believes him. Seaton then goes to his buddy Martin Crane, inventor and millionaire, for help. Together, the two begin to develop a spaceship using the new propulsion formula. The wily Marc DuQuesne, a fellow scientist in league with the evil World Steel Company, constantly undermines their plans in the hope of stealing the formula and making a fortune out of it. When DuQuesne abducts Dorothy, Seaton's fianc&eacute;e, and flies her away on a second ship using the stolen formula, the hijinks begin. The characters end up uniting to face a host of spectacular space dangers. The characters, who use their wits and strength to great advantage, overcome black holes, hostile planets with weird animals, and a planet-wide war.While the story is entertaining, the cheese factor here is off the charts. The story starts out well, but quickly descends into confusion and pure goofiness. The introduction stresses that the reader must suspend disbelief, but this is ridiculous. The characters are all models of perfection, and each difficulty encountered in space is overcome with seeming ease. The only thing missing from Seaton's profile is the gleam of his teeth when he smiles. The worst part of the book is the end, when the marriage of Seaton and Crane to their respective women dominates the story. Who cares? Isn't one of the goals of science fiction, at least in theory, to provide action sequences? There is action here, but not nearly enough to hold my attention.This is probably essential reading for the diehard sci-fi fan, but all others should steer clear. A high intake of cheese like this can clog your arteries!"},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"I'm guessing a lot of folks who've reviewed these books experienced them in the original printings, prior to Star Wars and the mass-popularization of space opera. I didn't- I \\"discovered\\" Doc in the late-80's as a teenager, and have become a huge fan. But heed the warnings of \\"camp\\" and \\"cheese\\": if there were an MST3K of books, his would be regular fodder. The gender stereotypes and roles as well as the frequent commission (and implicit condonement) of genocide by the heroes in particular are very hard to get past for a modern reader. Character development is non-existant (all protagonists are basically Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts), dialogue is awkward and unbelievably cheesy, genocide is repeatedly condoned, and the fact that the books were originally written as serials is painfully evident (almost every chapter ends with a CLIFFHANGER!). If you are a conesseur of camp, these books are a *rich* source of material.But what I love about Doc's books is not rooted in irony: the incredible creativity in visualizing advanced technology, fast-forward and entertaining action plots, and the sheer scale of the \\"build up\\" within each book and from one book to another.Technology: Although very quaint by modern standards (especially in \\"Skylark of Space\\"), put in context the creativity Doc displays in envisioning future technology is second to none. Not in terms of \\"accuracy\\", but in terms of their self-consistency and imaginativeness. Skylark was written pre-television, pre-laser, pre-NASA, and pre-nuke. What Doc built from that base is incredible, entertaining, and fun, viewed from the perspective that even relativity was a comparatively new theory when it was written (Doc obviously knew about it, and chose to ignore it). In \\"Skylark of Space\\", the result is spacesuits made out of leather, descriptions of how the spaceship's hull is fashioned from heavy steel, faster-than-light travel by simple accelertaion, and \\"energy beams\\" of different frequencies with different effects. I think Skylark of Space actually remains too tied to the technology of the day, but those shackles are unleashed in Skylark Three (the sequel) and Doc's vision really shines.\\"Action\\": I understand that this book is the origin of spaceships shooting at each other. Doc's battle and action sequences need make no apologies for their age or context. This is why you put up with all the sexist attitudes, the bad speeches and the cheesy exclamation. Unless they are encountering the brief setbacks necessary to create some semblance of dramatic tension, Doc's heros kick so much alien bad guy butt it's amazing.\\"Scale\\": Doc obviously is a big believer in the \\"orders of magnitude\\" theory of plot development. The formula is this: at the beginning of the book, the main characters are on top of the world, and their power seems nearly limitless. Then they nearly get their butts kicked by bad-guy aliens who are so much more powerful that the good guys look like gnats. Then the good guys bulk up (in technology, knowledge, etc...) to the point that the bad guys are completely and easily decimated. Repeat as often as necessary. What is amazing and enjoyable is how long Doc can keep this up: by the end of the series, literally whole galaxies are being destroyed. Yes, it's completely implausible, but dammit! It's fun!Anyway, if you only are going to read one \\"Skylark\\" book, I'd actually recommend the sequel: Skylark Three. It's not very hard to get into the plot, and enough trappings of 30's earth technology have fallen away at that point to let Doc's real creativity shine.In summary: Smith is a must-read for sci-fi buffs. Stick with it, and you will be rewarded. But don't expect any of your friends or family to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"... There Was Doc Smith. &quot;The Skylark of Space&quot; was first written somewhere around the turn of the century. Some modifications were done to it before its publication in 1928, and in the 1950s Doc did some updating, but the vast majority of the story remains unchanged. &quot;Skylark&quot; was a revolutionary story of its time, featuring super-science, far-ranging adventure (it may be the very first story to take place beyond the bounds of the Solar System), and (for its genre) well-developed characters. Dated in many ways by today's standards, &quot;The Skylark of Space&quot; is still a hell of a yarn, and the spiritual ancestor of every great space adventure written since. Buy it and read it. It's a piece of SF history."},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"This is the original, classic space opera. I read it 30 odd years ago and it was already 30 odd years old! It predates E.E. Smith's better known Lensmen series and in many ways is better. (I don't remember the Lensmen stories but I do remember the Skylark series.) It begins with the classic brilliant, slightly mad scientist, Dick Seaton, except he's young and hunkish with a gorgeous and high-class girlfriend, Dorothy. (Her parents oppose the romance but she's loyal to her Dick.) Enter the brilliant, mad-scientist villain named Blackie. He kidnaps Dorothy. I'm happy to say she tries to kick butt, kicks the instrument panel of the space ship instead and they're off on a grand tour of outer space with our hero in hot pursuit. There's another girl and another guy and the book is climaxed by a double-wedding on an alien planet with an alien race in attendance. Of course Blackie is defeated (but only temporarily so he can show up again in the next book), and they all go home to live happily ever after until the next adventure (which will occur in about 5 minutes,) Yes, it's dated and corny and, if you think about it, extremely silly. My advice is, don't think about it. Just read it and enjoy. This is an excellent book to introduce early teenagers to a sense of wonder and adventure and awe at the vastness and mystery of the universe."},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"This is the last of the Skylark books, and in true Smith style the scale is grander than ever. Seaton and Duquesne, who have long been enemies, must pool their resources and work togeather against the most formidable opponent either has ever seen - not a hostile ship, or ruler, or even a planet, but an entire galaxy militarized by the Chlorians! This has all the qualities readers have come to identify as E.E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith - powerful weapons, powerful enemies, and unstoppable heros, but in this novel the character of Duquesne assumes more complexity than any other Smith character I can recall. He is definitely the most interesting - a criminal, power hungry, brilliant, yet at the same time he will never break his word, even when it could mean achieving his goals. Cold and heartless, logical to a degree unapproached by any other human character Smith wrote save Fernidad Stone, yet possessing no hatred for even his archrival, Seaton. This book is very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"For someone like me, who grew up on old Tom Swift books often purchased at antique stories, Doc Smith is the paragon of lightspeed adventure. Not particularly keen on technical accuracy (&quot;After all, Einstein's theory is just a theory,&quot; one character says upon discovering that he's traveling many times the speed of light) and full of predictibly stalwart or nefarious characters, Smith still manages to spin a great yarn. The main characters seem to exhibit a joyous recklesness remniscient (for me, at least) of Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's trilogy. The &quot;testing&quot; of the flight systems and nuclear-powered bullets, in particular, are quite memorable.If you're looking for gritty realism in characters or technical accuracy in technologies, you probably won't be able to enjoy this book. But for those who wish to put their brains in neutral and have a jolly good time, I can think of few books better than The Skylark of Space."},{"Title":"Skylark DuQuesne","review":"I think I'd give this 5 stars, just for being the original... if it WERE the original. E. E. Smith did some serious re-writing on this one, sometime during the 1950s. In this version, Greedo shoots first.Okay, that's a joke, but the Star Wars fan-boys get what I mean. I didn't want something revised, with mushroom clouds and television sets. I wanted something written in 1915. I think that's when Smith claimed to have started \\"Skylark of Space\\".Anyway, it's still a fun story, and since it sets you up for \\"Skylark 3\\" and \\"Skylark of Valeron\\" (both better written and more engaging), it's important reading. I think I'm like a lot of people who read something this old-- I'm trying to fill in the cracks in my understanding of the progression of sci-fi. It's an entertaining history lesson.I can still glean what the untouched book must have been, but I wish I could actually read the original version. If you can find that one, read it.

Along the way he saves a race of aliens, helps decimate another, rescues his girlfriend and thwarts the misdoings of his arch rival Marc DuQuesne.This is the first E.E. Smith book I've read and I must say that for the type of book that it is, The Skylark of Space isn't too bad. Think old school comic books. It has high adventure, a smart/strong/handsome protagonist, a loyal sidekick, gee whiz technology, an extremely evil bad guy, and pretty girls. For a large part of the book, the story is fairly interesting. Smith moves the action along quickly and provides a respectable amount of tension to the drama. Even though I knew everything would turn out fine in the end, I still wanted to know how Smith would accomplish it. At a short 159 pages, it was a quick and fun diversion.The Skylark of Space is not, however, without issues. Many of them are given: flat, completely unreal characters, rigid gender roles, featherweight science, wildly campy. I won't fault the book for these sorts of things. It's a product of its time that targeted a specific audience.What I do want to point out is that Smith treats war very lightly. Although this book was completed in 1920, Smith revised it in 1958. It's surprising to me that even though Smith had seen the effects of two world wars, mass destruction of life is a very casual act in his book.For those of you who aren't already huge Doc Smith fans, you'll probably enjoy this book if you know what you're getting into.

I was one of those military trained DC-9 pilots who flew for New York Air in LaGuardia and later transitioned to Continental Airlines in Houston that he mentions in his book. I also served in both line and management capacities at both airlines. His aviation exploits have always been fascinating to me for a couple of reasons.First, his background and job experiences are without equal. Secondly, I've always been astounded by his ability to remember people, places and events from many years ago like they occurred yesterday afternoon. Most pilots remember momentous events or challenges that have occurred in their careers but few can associate those events with exact names, times, places and dates. George can...and that's one of the reasons that his book is so enjoyable to read.His ability to regale the reader with fascinating stories is outstanding and makes this book fun to read whether the reader is a pilot, flight attendant, gate agent, mechanic or just an aviation enthusiast. I know several of the people mentioned in his book and I've heard of many of the others. George knows literally thousands of pilots at every level of the profession. I think each and everyone of them will enjoy his effort at documenting a remarkable and enjoyable career.

It has pages and pages of fascinating information about how the pioneers built, made, or raised almost everything they used. Interspersed with these pages are stories of the Robertson family, following their lives throughout a typical year. I would like to give this book 5 stars, but I was bothered by the way the family treated each other in the stories. The children were often spiteful and rude to each other. Usually this behavior did not contribute to the storyline, and could have been left out or worded differently. For example, in the story about harvesting, the older son considers the water-carrying being done by the younger son to be \\"baby work.\\" And the younger son responds by sticking his tongue out. \\"It wasn't much, but it made him feel a little better.\\" It would maintain the same story, but be a much better example if the exchange was more like \\"Thanks for the water, brother. Some day you can help out with the heavy work.\\" Well worth the read, though."},{"Title":"A pioneer sampler: The daily life of a pioneer family in 1840","review":"Barbara Greenwood has written a wonderful book that is as much fun for adults to read to children as it is for the children to read themselves.

The pictures are so well done that, even as an adult, I would like to step into the scene!There are instructions for simple, fun activities such as growing a potato plant, dyeing fabric using an onion, or making a cardboard jumping jack; pioneer games that will even entertain today's children for hours such as shadow shapes or knucklebones; and recipes that are easy for children.Reading this book to a child is a great 'stress releaver'...it's like a little escape from the treadmill of life!!!"},{"Title":"A pioneer sampler: The daily life of a pioneer family in 1840","review":"I've read many books on pioneer life, and this is by far the best one for children. The book is about the Robertsons, a fictional family living in the west. While the family is fictional, the material is all drawn from real life.The story takes you through a year in their lives, each chapter being its own story. After each chapter, the author provides explanatory material, giving detailed information about events and activities from the story. For example, there is a chapter about the children searching for a bee tree in order to find honey. In the explanatory material following the chapter, the author discusses beekeeping, division of labor among the bees, how the honey is actually made and the importance of honey to the early pioneers.Unlike most books, we found the explanatory material every bit as captivating as the stories. In addition, the author suggests some activities children can do in order to learn more. Yesterday we conducted an experiment to see how the sap in the maple trees resists freezing because of its high sugar content. Today we made butter.All in all, an excellent book.

And \\"A Pioneer Sampler\\" is one of those books.It is written in storyform about the daily lives of the Robertson family, pioneers living on a backwoods farm in the 1840's. Throughout this 237 page book we learn, in a fun and interesting way, how this family dealt with the everyday living that a typical family of the time might have lived: their chores, crafts, eating habits, their spare time. Tools used, how to milk a cow, making maple sugar, harvest time, visiting a general store, building a house...so much interesting historical living written in a very simplistic manner.Interspersed throughout are sidelines of information pertaining to the subject being written. For instance, there is a chapter about a peddler's visit to the family and the families reaction to this traveling salesman. But, at the end of the chapter, there are a few pages thrown in speaking of individual peddler's trades and how they do their crafts.Most of the chapters are set up in this way, which adds greatly to understanding more fully the chapters.I would love to see more books in this form for other era's in American history, as this style or history writing can entertain and teach all - kids as well as adults - who have an interest.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A pioneer sampler: The daily life of a pioneer family in 1840","review":"I am a visual mom.

Compiling this extensive handbook of tips, information, and personal stories certainly took some serious time and effort. But before I get into the details of this guide and cookbook, I do want to point out that this is a gluten-free guide first and foremost.I think the title of \\"Food Allergy\\" may be slightly misleading. It is true that the book is completely wheat-free (one of the top eight allergens), but gluten is the author's primary focus, which is typically a food intolerance and most problematic in autoimmune disorders such as Celiac Disease and Autism. This is not to say that she ignores all other common food allergies, dairy sits right along side gluten, firmly in the passenger seat, making this an excellent GFCF resource. Yet, other allergens are placed in the back seat, getting her attention and mention, but not focus. In fact, while peanut allergies are addressed, I didn't come across any tree nut references.Theresa's gluten-free focus is understandable, since her son was born with wheat/gluten problem, most likely due to Celiac Disease.I point this out, because while the recipes are all gluten-free and from what I could tell dairy/casein-free, you do need to read the guide of letters on each recipe to see if they also meet with your free-from needs. Some of the recipes do contain other allergens, and there are some errors in the allergen labeling of the recipes to add a bit more confusion.There is one other reason I bring mention of the gluten-free nature - many who are concerned with multiple food allergies (or even simply a wheat allergy vs gluten intolerance) are not looking for gluten-free recipes. All of the baking recipes use specialty flours, xanthan gum and other ingredients that may render the recipes less useful (but not useless) for someone who is say dealing with a dairy, egg, and nut allergy combo.With that commentary out of the way, I did find the reading entertaining. Theresa includes many personal stories, her own and those of other parents of children with allergies / intolerances. She also discusses coping with certain situations, and the basics, such as reading ingredient labels.What I DO like about the recipes is that they are all relatively simple and appear to be very kid-friendly. Theresa has compiled several of her own recipes as well as recipes from other well-known authors, such as Carol Fenster. As mentioned though, this is a guidebook first, cookbook second ... it is an excellent starting point, with a nice little selection of recipes to inspire. Though you will likely want to seek out some additional cookbooks once you get going.Overall, I do highly recommend the Food Allergy Field Guide for parents of gluten-free or gluten-free / dairy-free (GFCF) children, but would lean parents of children with multiple food allergies or life-threatening food allergies to the guide: How to Manage Your Child's Life Threatening Food Allergies."},{"Title":"Food Allergy Field Guide : A Lifestyle Manual for Families","review":"I got this book along with another allergy book when my son was found to have several food allergies.

Courage is a fundamental part to becoming intuitive-that is, taking action based on the guidance that's received. In fact, Myss says that the intuitive journey is actually the journey to self-esteem.Intuitive Power - Your Natural Resource is a live Caroline Myss workshop on 4 CD's. The theme of this workshop is the role of intuition, the nature of intuitive blocks, the importance of personal power and self-esteem in hearing and following intuitive guidance, and the interior spiritual life.CD 1In CD 1, Myss discusses intuition \\"American style\\" which includes the myth that we deserved to have our life \\"settled\\"-that the Mystery of who we are is something to be \\"solved\\" rather than lived. She also discusses the propensity of many American spiritual seekers to elevate roles like \\"healers\\", believing they are of utmost importance to the Divine-and how they sneer at \\"blue collar intuition\\" and grounded occupations (like accountant, for example) believing they're \\"just jobs\\" that don't require intuition. She goes on to dispel the myth that intuitive skill and the spiritual life are one in the same, as well as the idea that intuition is a \\"gift\\"-only bestowed on those who are \\"good\\" or \\"light enough candles\\". Survival intuition, that of the first three chakras, is *not* spiritual guidance or higher revelation; in fact, this type of intuition has a private agenda built into it.CD 2Funny stories are peppered throughout this workshop, and Myss begins Disc 2 telling the story of a Puella Eternis who was in her 30's and still lived with her Dad. Myss was discussing how God can \\"wipe you out\\" in an instant-with or without a prayer of surrender-and mentioned that as she was teaching this concept at another workshop, especially as it related to finances, this Puella called out \\"God can't take my money because my Dad put it in a Trust Fund.\\" The audience roars with laughter at this story. Myss also goes on to admit that she has changed positions of a lot of things as she read and learned more, including the concept that illness is caused by negativity. Stating that she \\"doesn't buy it anymore\\" and that it's a \\"cruel thought\\", she acknowledges that while negativity can enhance illness, it doesn't cause it. Myss also says that she will teach, until the day she disincarnates, that the great skill or power in the human experience is not love, but self-esteem.CD 3Myss explains how our physical body is the \\"caboose\\" on the intuitive train-it is not the engine. She explains how we are always doing \\"energetic readings\\" by scanning people-an unconscious process that lights up all 7 of the chakras. As she has taught in other workshops, Myss talks about how meeting new people is often an exercise in gathering energetic data-starting with 1st chakra questions like \\"Where are you from?\\", and working upwards to the other chakras. For example, a 2nd chakra question would be \\"Are you married? Do you have any kids?\\" Unfortunately, as often happens in her workshops, Myss doesn't go beyond the first three chakras so we can see how questions from the upper chakras would be posed to others, and what exactly we're assessing from chakras 4-7.Myss explains why some people and situations \\"gut\\" us, how to call our power back and how to keep energetically \\"contained\\"-which is the object of health. She goes on to tell a story about reaming out a guy when she was on safari in South Africa, despite \\"knowing better\\". She begins taking questions from audience members and someone asks Myss if she felt it was her place to do so. \\"No, I wanted it to be my place\\", she answers.CD 4Myss continues to take questions from the audience about her safari experience. She is asked: \\"Is it better to do that (chew someone out) then hold it in?\\" She answers: \\"You know, what I did is never the better path. He didn't come there to be attacked by me.\\" Myss admonishes the audience on the importance of being hard-core honest with themselves and ask \\"What is the real reason I want to do what I'm about to do? What's the real reason I want to say _____?\\" Myss also talks about the back-lash of the new age, saying we've become \\"hyper-responsible\\" about illness and the concept of creating your own reality. She argues that we influence our reality, but we don't create it.She is then asked about archetypes and if they are actual entities. She replies that they are, in fact, actual entities and that a person can be \\"possessed\\" by an archetype by identifying so strongly with an archetypal patterns that the pattern becomes more real than they are. According to Myss, comments like \\"That's just the way I am\\" are important clues to your archetypal patterns, and she correlates Julie Andrews' real life nun archetype and Andrew's role in The Sound of Music.In ConclusionMyss spends a good amount of time hitting home the importance of self-esteem and the containment of our personal power in this audio workshop. I have the Myss CD workshop series on Self Esteem, but haven't listened to it yet, so I don't know how much of this information from this series is covered in that workshop. If you're unfamiliar with chakras, you'd likely be lost, so I'd recommend reading Anatomy of the Spirit by Myss first. For hard-core Myss fans, there's really not a whole lot new here in my opinion, but as is always the case with her workshops, there are many nuggets wisdom that bear repeating and will help you on your journey towards becoming more conscious.Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)"},{"Title":"Intuitive Power: Your Natural Resource","review":"If you already have an extensive Caroline Myss library, no need to purchase this-it's nothing you haven't heard before. I was hoping that it would draw in some new insights into harnessing intuitive powers but it was more of a lecture on \\"getting over yourself\\" and a loose interpretation on recognizing your wake-up calls. Although you got to love Caroline Myss-she really de-mystifies mystical journeys and grounds you squarely back into our real world with our real dramas. Do I feel more intuitive as a result of listening to the workshop?-Good question, can't really answer that. The results aren't in yet."},{"Title":"Intuitive Power: Your Natural Resource","review":"On these CDs, Caroline shares some of her insights related to intuitive power. She states that what prevents people from becoming more aware of their intuitive impulses is fear and suggests that the more self-esteem and the more courage you have the greater intuitive power will you have. She has tossed love out the window, perhaps because to her love represents loss of power, and insists that intuitive power doesn't come from love, it comes from self-esteem.To me and to just about anyone else I've ever come across who teaches how to access intuition, intuitive power does come from love (for that matter even self-esteem comes out of love), but then again perhaps the rest of us view love through a different lens than Caroline. For me, love is a unifying power, that which removes barriers and opens doors, that which dissolves fear and that which says \\"The Infinite Spirit in me honors the (same) Infinite Spirit in you\\". Through love we see our holiness (wholeness which arises out of one Spirit expressing through everyone and everything) reflected in another. Love is that which recognizes the omnipresence of that which is divine, immortal, and infinite. For me, love has nothing to do with fulfilling the whims of another or losing power, instead, it has everything to do with expressing your true spiritual nature - allowing the Spiritual Self to shine through you.Caroline further suggests that you can increase your intuitive awareness by paying attention to the energy within you and all around you. This is a good point and at the same time, if you are already familiar with exercising your intuitive awareness, this may not be new to you.While I do appreciate some of Caroline's insights, I find her language and attitude off-putting at time, and personally find authors like Sonia Choquette, Judith Orloff, Penney Pierce, Laura Alden Kamm, John Holland, and others, more palatable."},{"Title":"Intuitive Power: Your Natural Resource","review":"Comparing and Contrasting two Audio CDs: \\"Why People Don't Heal,\\" 1994 and \\"Intuitive Power: Your Natural Resource,\\" 2004.Each audio CD is not a reading from that book, but a talk given by Myss to an audience that ranges over the major points, with her spontaneous ideas. The version of \\"Why People Don't Heal\\" that I received included 2 CDs, the first one is a lecture of her main points, and the second is her replies to written questions the audience has submitted. \\"Intuitive Power: Your Natural Resource,\\" was four CDs, which actually say little about archetypes but allow her time to describe what she has discovered since retiring from being a medical intuitive and moving full time into educating medical intuitives.About the sarcasm: In both audiobooks, Myss' voice has a sarcastic tone. Why People Don't Heal was recorded about ten years earlier than \\"Intuitive Power: Your Natural Resource\\"__ and to me her tone sounds even more sarcastic in the later recording. Her sarcasm is toward her readers/listeners, which I will describe later in my review. Sarcasm doesn't bother me too much, and I must say, her sense of comic timing has greatly improved from the earlier recording. In \\"Intuitive Power: Your Natural Resource\\"_, the audience actually laughs when she makes fun of them, and I found myself laughing out loud a few times myself. Laughing about oneself can be healing... however, by the end of both audio books, I felt heavy and tired from the nonstop barrage of criticism.Sarcasm Not Present in her Books:My wife and I have both read Caroline Myss' books and we did not sense sarcasm in the written books. We were both surprised to discover the degree of sarcasm in her recorded voice. I did not tell my wife about the sarcasm before I gave her the CDs. After she listened she shyly told me that she had to turn off the CDs because the sarcasm became too much for her. She too, said she was surprised to hear the sarcasm because she had not noticed any sarcasm while reading the books. Perhaps she has good editors?Career Shift:In \\"Why People Don't Heal,\\" Caroline Myss describes herself as a Medical Intuitive. During this phase of her life, apparently her experience is in working with individuals, often by phone, to see into their bodies and diagnosing the causes of their disease. In \\"Intuitive Power: Your Natural Resource\\", she had retired from working with individuals and now worked with groups teaching them how to be medically intuitive.Her main points:\\"Why we don't heal,\\" The reason people don't heal is that they invest too much of their personal energy in past issues that they refuse to release. For example, if a person holds a grudge upon someone from their past, they must continually re-invest their personal energy in that grudge, daily, hourly. That energy that is going into a past event diverts valuable energy that could be here now helping them heal. The person sends away the very healing energy that could be healing them. There are many ways that people send their energy away, and the generalization for all of these is \\"attachments.\\" There is plenty of healing energy within each person to heal them, if only they weren't sending this energy out of themselves on non-productive missions. One reason that people hold on to attachments is that it gives them an excuse to avoid challenges in their life, she says. The cure for all attachments, according to Myss, is Forgiveness, and Calling Back Your Energy. This seems do-able.In \\"Intuitive Power: Your Natural Resource\\" there seem to be two main points. The first is very similar to the message above, but now applied to students of intuition. The book title could have been, \\"Why Students of Intuition Don't Feel Intuitive,\\" which would have tied it into her earlier book. Students of intuition don't feel intuitive because they fear what would happen if they were to be remarkably intuitive. Again people rob their own connections or awareness by blocking their own powers. But students of intuition are not worrying about the past, now their concern is the future. Students of intuition state that they fear how they will be received by others, but Myss says that is a ruse. What they really fear is that they will be far more aware of the issues in their own lives, and they will no longer be able to hide from their own games. Myss says the most common reason people want to be more intuitive is so that they may control their lives to have a perfect relationship, a healing career that always supplies them with adequate money, and comfort. She is very critical of these motives. Myss says being more intuitive has the opposite effect; it forces a person to deal with her own issues, exposes her to unforseen challenges, one of which is to commit to a life of serving by divine guidance. Myss mentions that Catholic Nuns must do the following exercise as preparation to entering the service: every day for ninety days, ask yourself, \\"What is more important to me than divine guidance?\\" On the fourth CD she also mentions that intuitive healers should be cautious about demons, that the Catholic practice of exorcsism and demonology was her graduate project in college. As the CD set progresses, Myss more and more hammers home her point that to be intuitive requires turning one's life inside out, committing to embracing the unknown and unconditionally submitting to divine guidance. I see her point, but I think it could be stated much differently. She seems to have grown annoyed by humans who do not progress as fast as she does. She seems to be \\"guilting\\" us into picking up the pace. I think there are many gradations of becoming more intuitive and any person can find their personal balance. You may become a little more intuitive by embracing a little more unknown or releasing a little bit of control, and then you may be at balance for you, for now. I think it is important to feel safe as you progress. Listening to this CD is scary and I think it would discourage more people than it encourages. The main point I disagree with is that Myss presents intuition as \\"all or nothing,\\" but I see it more naturally embraced in safe, do-able steps, at a pace that feels right...as Obama says, \\"change we can life with.\\" Myss seems to be impatient for more change now.My recommendations:I recommend \\"Why People Don't Heal\\" highest rating for both people with healing issues and for students of intuition. While some sarcasm is present, it is easier to dismiss. \\"Intuitive Power: Your Natural Resource\\" would work for a student of intuition who is fearless and unaffected by the teacher's impatience and sarcasm (or perhaps it stands as a historic study of how a teacher changes over time).Whichever audio lecture you choose, keep in mind that the path to healing or to intuition, while challenging, is a lot more fun and more rewarding than these CDs reveal."},{"Title":"Intuitive Power: Your Natural Resource","review":"As always Caroline Myss is direct, to the point and informative.

But from now on, having in my hands this wonderful explanation of the seven point mind training, I don't need to look elsewhere. Everything is in this perfectly summarized and practical oriented book.Only a slightly negative view: for me, the author argues a little too warmly against the materialism of many scientists. I bet the majority of readers are not aligned with materialists, so perhaps the discussion could be left for more academic works. And I would add that this looks a bit like an intellectual battle, not completely clean of pride, not thoroughly unaggressive. In this field, I'd prefer Dalai Lama's relaxed attitude of acceptance.

His words are wise and ideas balanced scientifically by on his academic experience in Physics to accompany his long history of practicing Buddhism. I have only begun reading about Buddhism and feel distrustful of most mentors, especially when they start talking in New Ageisms - this book feels more rational and direct to the source of wisdom and compassion.

If you are looking for something to benefit your practice then \\"Buddhism with an Attitude\\" is the way to go. Although repetitive at times, this itself is helpful, and it is written in a more instructional tone. If you feel your practice has fully matured (lucky you) and you are simply interested in a concise, more academic exposition of the seven point mind training, then \\"The Seven-Point Mind Training\\" is the one for you. Also, for being more condensed, the \\"The Seven-Point Mind Training\\", will be the book you will want to carry around once you are familiar with Lojong practice."},{"Title":"Buddhism with an Attitude: The Tibetan Seven-Point Mind-Training","review":"As a book lover, I am one of those people who never, ever marks the pages of books. However, after the first few sentences I knew this is not a book you simply read, but one to study, digest, and absorb. It is now marked on every page, highlighted and underlined, and I know I will refer to it again and again. Since I am new to the subject, I have been seeking authentic instructions in a way my Western mind can grasp, without losing the richness of it's source. This is not &quot;New Aged&quot; Buddhism Lite, yet the author presents Lojong in a way that is completely accessable and easy to follow. This wonderful teacher is comforting, reassuring, yet challenging. He encourages an immediate and radical change of &quot;attitude&quot; and offers the tools to do it. We are not all fortunate enough to be able to sit at the feet of a master.

Perhaps, as another reviewer suggested, the unfortunate choice of title is slowing the readership of this absolute gem of a book. By the time I was only halfway through it, I had already purchased several copies to distribute as gifts, and intend to purchase more for the people about whom I care most deeply.Having been familiar with Alan Wallace's writing through some of his earlier titles (notably, The Bridge of Quiescence and Boundless Heart) I was aware of the lucid and penetrating ease which is his particular gift in explaining the conceptual intricacies of Buddhist philosophy and dharma. For those who have not had the pleasure of reading his former works, this book offers his complete array of formidable talent. I know of no other Western Buddhist writer who has the capacity to write with such clear-eyed, targeted, and insightful poise as Wallace. Here is the matured voice of a Western practitioner who has intimate and seasoned understanding of the Tibetan tradition, and whose experience is informed as well by his accomplishments as a student of Western philosophy and physics.Though there is no lack of titles which have provided commentary on Atisha's gift to Buddhists (The renowned Seven-Point Mind Training, referred to as \\"lojong\\"), Wallace's work will be particularly invaluable to the growing number of people attracted to Buddhism in the West. His straightforward, unassuming and articulate exposition here will aid many practitioners in their daily practice and reflection. He provides ample references for those interested in his sources, and pays homage to those whose works he draws on - particularly the esteemed and beloved Tibetan teacher, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche.I am grateful for this notable and praiseworthy effort, and have found it to be a book that I will joyfully return to repeatedly. May its merit contribute to the enlightenment of all sentient beings."},{"Title":"Buddhism with an Attitude: The Tibetan Seven-Point Mind-Training","review":"The first fundamental proposition of this book - that liesure and opportunity to embark on the spiritual journey is indeed an exceptionally rare event - is enough to move one's vacillating spiritual longing off of dead center.

Counterfeit Money (Vol 1)","review":"If there could be such a thing as a text that 'exemplifies' Derrida's thought, one that meticulously and clearly explains the strategies of 'deconstruction,' while at the same time distilling not just its own theory, but also producing a critical reading of several other prominent thinkers and their texts (and one that of course demonstrates the practical ends of the expos&eacute; of his theory), then \\"Given Time\\" (\\"Donner le temps\\") would unequivocally be that book. It is that good. In fact, it is superb. For those who have read Derrida's texts of the late 60s and early 70s, and know where they stand regarding Derrida's ideas, this book acts like a kind of overview or survey of his thought, a matrix or map of his thought, an architectural plan, even a game plan.The primary text is a story by Baudelaire, and Derrida uses this two-page story to explicate the relations he has with his own masters, the lessons learned and the major points that he has taken from them and transformed. Husserl on the notion of the gift and the necessity to zigzag (a \\"Zick-Zack\\" or \\"mouvement en vrille\\") between bound and free idealities; Heidegger on being and temporality and the impossibility of appropriation or presence; Bataille on excess. All through a refreshing reading of Baudelaire's story together with Mauss' seminal essay from 1923 \\"The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies\\" (often considered the most influential work of anthropology, focusing on the social customs of exchange and the obligation to reciprocate) which conceives of a total social fact of gifting that Bataille had himself begun to unhinge in his 1949 \\"The Accursed Share\\" by implicitly laying waste to Hegel's philosophical economy - a multivolume work that was itself greatly influenced by \\"The Gift.\\"From a map of thought to Derrida's Joycean world\\"Given Time\\" is a brief treatise on the layered notions of the 'gift' in several important works (in Husserl, it means what is given to us in the world through the 'immediate experience' of our senses; in Husserl's phenomenological reduction or \\"epoche\\" what is intended is separated from what is given. Derrida, in his earliest critical works on Husserl, analyzes the conceptual foundations of the intuition/intention relationship, and while he critiques Husserl's formal limits of the two, he maintains that the \\"epoche\\" is indispensable for transcendental phenomenology and for his own work. However, via Heidegger, Derrida will insist that in every act of being given there remains by necessity an aspect of the gift that holds itself back, is not given, and that gives nothing - the flipside of giving, as Deleuze noted, is theft. This temporizing aspect of the gift is reflected in Derrida's title \\"Given Time\\"). Derrida's thesis is that giving is only possible through a splintered 'time' of originary difference, which produces a doubling-effect of the notion of the 'origin,' and which means that the only possibility of authenticity will always be that of inauthenticity, which doubles and splits the difference. In other words, contamination occurs between the concepts of authenticity and inauthenticity: authenticity is impossible without the possibility of inauthenticity. Much like all 'counterfeit money' (which is also the title of Baudelaire's story) you can't tell whether the coin is or isn't truly money that you can buy a commodity with and truly possess something. Is it or isn't it fake? It's a split decision that Derrida patiently explores the 'logic' of. (By the way, art historian Georges Didi-Huberman has written a wonderful book, \\"Phasmes\\" (1990), partially translated as \\"The Phasmid,\\" on deception and pretending; search for it on the net.) This important concept, which also runs throughout Deleuze's work, is a term he calls \\"the power of the false.\\" But to give credit where it is due, it comes first of all in Heidegger's critique of his own project of a fundamental ontology (very arguably, to my mind) in Section 72 of \\"The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics,\\" where he speaks of the assertive logos as \\"false,\\" \\"deceptive,\\" and \\"pretending,\\" and discusses the as-structure that will be so crucial for all of Derrida's work - in fact his explication of the true/false pair in \\"Given Time\\" explains this operative concept of 'relation' without naming it. 'Relation' is one of the most important concepts in Derrida's thought, and he explicates it at length in \\"Given Time.\\" Derrida shows how there is indeed a beyond to the binary couple of truth and falsity, authenticity and inauthenticity, by exploring a catachresis that simultaneously surpasses each of them (suggesting that they are impossibly pure concepts, as each implies the other as its limit) but that also makes their 'false' opposition possible (and that they must therefore mix or contaminate each other). Derrida has given many strategic names to this notion, such as originary difference or diff&eacute;rance (which Leonard Lawlor has suggested is Derrida's reinscription of Husserl's notion of intention). This relation of possibility to impossibility is very clearly laid out in \\"Given Time\\" (\\"on one hand\\"...\\"on the other hand\\"), and gives the reader a penetrating insight into the importance that Derrida ascribes here and throughout his work - especially his more recent works \\"Aporias\\" (another very clear book of his, and highly recommended), \\"The Politics of Friendship\\" and \\"Cosmopolitanism and Forgiveness\\" - to the counter-intuitive and non-oppositional relationship between impossibility and possibility (which is an important redrawing of Kant's condition of possibility and the notion of 'limit' and critique).Also, one can read the entire book as a long commentary on capitalism, one which places Marxian thinkers in an uncomfortable position and that tries to think through capitalism a little bit further from within 'deconstruction': Derrida's most overt attempts at this are 'From restrictive to general economy' of 1966 (a superb essay with a very pretentious title that plays on Einstein's 1905 and 1916 Nobel-prize earning work \\"Special [aka \\"Restricted\\"] and General Theory of Relativity\\" - although his 1921 Nobel was technically awarded for his \\"contribution to photoelectrics\\") and \\"Specters of Marx,\\" from 1994, with a title that's cribbed from his mentor and colleague Louis Althusser's book \\"Specters of Hegel\\" as an homage. One also has to remember that this book was originally a lecture course from c. 1979. Derrida is of course using transcendental phenomenology as the guiding thread to discuss literature and sociology, and makes something really interesting occur in each, along with modifying our concept of capitalism. From anywhere you stand you can see Derrida's French qualities: literature, anthropology, the belief that philosophy has to engage with capitalism if it is to be considered at all relevant. All are relevant to deconstruction, and are considered game for being folded into it, so long as they take you somewhere else, produce different thoughts regarding the world we inhabit, and permit these thoughts to be formalized.There is no other book written by Derrida that lays out the material and the method so clearly and patiently (although again, \\"Aporias\\" is highly recommended). It does assume familiarity with his earliest programmatic works. If one looks at pp. 71-75 of Derrida's brief and incisive \\"Introduction to Husserl's Origin of Geometry,\\" for example, one glimpses the thematic affinity between that earlier, more programmatic work, and how Derrida's conclusions there are extended in multiple and different directions in \\"Given Time\\" (those pages discuss the troubled constitution of ideal objects and how they can always be false and inauthentic in their expression. If Derrida chooses a work of fiction by Baudelaire on counterfeit money, it is in part because all truth must pass through fiction, or to put it differently, the necessary possibility of inauthenticity).In sum, this is one of Derrida's most elegant and accessible treatises on his own philosophy and how its relations extend to other modes of thought that on the one hand he himself is influenced by, and on the other hand he radicalizes as he engages them. It is a book that thoroughly transforms the interrelated concepts of the gift that exist in separate disciplines - not least of which is philosophy, which is often said to have 'begun' in wonder or amazement at the world and what is supposedly simply presented or given to us. Derrida takes a critical step back (&agrave; la Husserl's method of \\"r&uuml;ckfragen,\\" that attempts to account for the structuring of tradition) to explore how this presencing comes about, and how the 'there is' (es gibt, in German) appears, and then goes a step further to explain how we relate in our everyday, societal lives via an uncanny and counter-intuitive 'structure' or 'logic' (as well as mediated 'experiences') of giving and receiving, and how these open onto the issues of responding responsibly (which is a theme that Derrida explicitly explores in his works on forgiveness and on hospitality).As to the translation, which is polished and luminous, it is one of the best translations of Derrida's work into English."},{"Title":"Given Time: I. Counterfeit Money (Vol 1)","review":"I read the comment on this book that called it \\"deconstructionist wool gathering\\", and after butting my head up against some of the tracts in it, I can see where that reviewer is coming from. Basically I'm reading Given Time to trace a thread of explication from Boas, Mauss, Bataille, Baudrillard through Christopher Bracken( \\"Potlatch Papers\\", \\"Magical Criticism\\"). I want to understand and assimilate those people's ideas into my own developing political and cultural thought in order to understand what Christopher Bracken is talking about. For me, if it has to be through Derrida, Hegel, Heidegger etc., I'm willing to do the \\"homework\\". Fundamentally, I do have a dilettante's interest in anthropology of the 21st century.All this does have another pragmatic end, I'm just tired of the dead-ended revolutionary rhetoric and discourses that have been taken off the shelf at the museum, dusted slightly, and reused by the Occupy Movement here in the 21st century. The last time I visited the Occupy headquarters here in Portland, Oregon, it was like going into a museum of revolution. All the obsolete grand narratives, you know, like Marx, political economy, on and on.Maybe there's a more valid and potent approach to be found in tracing the thread I describe above to arrive at a fresh political outlook, for me at least.So, my advice: read this book like poetry- it's precious, esoteric, and abstract, with some lucid and salient points made at various junctures. This may be a very synoptic distillation of Derrida and his writing at a point in time, but to tell you the God's honest truth, I can't formulate a summary statement of him after reading this book. But after all, I'm not really interested in doing that. If he feels he's incomprehensible, what the hell am I supposed to say about it, try to make sense out of his incomprehensibility?"},{"Title":"Given Time: I. Counterfeit Money (Vol 1)","review":"Given time, I would love to write an extensive explication of this text. Life being too short, I will forego the urge. A phrase begins to accrue to Derrida, &#34;not for the faint of heart&#34; and &#34;Given Time&#34; qualifies. It's not for the faint -- is it feint? -- of heart. What it is is an exploration of being in terms of the Heideggerean &#34;it gives.&#34; Being [not beings] isn't. It escapes the question of &#34;What is?&#34; Heidegger notes that the German phrase for 'there is' is 'es gibt' or 'it gives.' and explores the idea of whether 'being' might 'give.' He does so without much analysis of what 'give' might mean. Enter Derrida. Couple to Heidegger's exploration the Heideggerean understanding the 'time' is at ground of being and you come to Derrida's position of what 'being gives' can mean as 'time gives,' and this with variation of formulation. There is: Es gibt, Il y as, It/Id gives. Being gives. Time gives. Time gives Being. . . But what Derrida brings to the 'seance' is an examination of what 'gift' might mean principally through the text of Mauss, but not exclusively. The 'gesture' is pure Derrida. How might the understanding of gift in 'other' usage inform the ontological question? What did Johnson say about Shakespeare. &#34;Read him.&#34; Suffice to say that if you work out the allegory of Madam Maintenant's (sic) letter, you'll be well under way to understanding this rather difficult text.E"},{"Title":"Given Time: I.

But she gives the baby the blanket and things go better for them both.This is a great picture book to teach young children that sometimes Mommys and Babies become a family by adoption.We recommend this book to children ages 1-4. The book is short enough to keep their attention and has a great story line as well."},{"Title":"The Red Blanket","review":"I am getting ready to adopt from China in the next year and wanted to create a library for my child. I am a single woman and this book is perfect. It tells a beautiful story and is about a single woman adopting from China. I love it and so do all of my friends."},{"Title":"The Red Blanket","review":"I love this book! I purchased it as a gift for a 3 year old adopted from China when she was 10 months old and her single mother. She is at the age when she is asking questions about family and it's important for her to see herself represented in media. The only part i didn't like was that the mother 'felt empty' even though she had a nice home, a dog, etc and that's why she adopted. That idea is a little tricky for a youngster who needs to not feel they are there to take care of their parent. The rest of the messege of the book is quite wonderful and worth it."},{"Title":"The Red Blanket","review":"This story begins with a red baby blanket in a store inspiring a single woman to consider the adoption of a child. Through the story the blanket brings comfort to the young girl as she begins her life outside of the adoption center in China. As the bond between the mother and child develop over the span of years, the red blanket continues to convey the initial, unconditional love shared by her adoptive mother. The colors used in the oil paintings convey warmth and emotion throughout the story with crisp detail. As cross-country adoptions become more common and family dynamics change, this story maintains a current day appeal. Within the constraints of a picture book, this story conveys the struggles and frustrations experienced transitioning a baby from an orphanage to a new family. While particularly appropriate for the topic of adoption, children of all backgrounds can appreciate the young girl's attachment to her blanket. This book would be a wonderful addition to a study on families."},{"Title":"The Red Blanket","review":"As one of the hundreds of single women who traveled to China andadopted ,my daughter and I relate to this book. I tell herthat this was also the story of her and I only our blanket was white."},{"Title":"The Red Blanket","review":"A lovely picture book with slightly longer text about a chinese adoption. A book to read to a child under 7. The text is too long for a child under that age to read themselves. A nice book for single adopters as it features a single American mother who is adopting on her own. Good pictures of an orphinage setting and the joy of receiving authorisation to adopt. Also a good follow through with the child becoming a young adolecent and knowing what the red blanket stood for - ie the time she and her mother became a family."},{"Title":"The Red Blanket","review":"I bought this book initially for my nieces and nephew who were preschool age at the time of my adoption. I wanted to help them understand a single woman becoming a mom AND adoption I also bought it for my son (and created a red blanket for him).

It's a great story and easy to understand for a wide age range."},{"Title":"The Red Blanket","review":"I thought the book was really cute. I guess it is geared for single moms...b/c there was no dad included??"},{"Title":"The Red Blanket","review":"My kids have gone through phases of requesting this book at bedtime, so it rates a few stars in my opinion. But it's not great. I have two main problems with it: (1) It is very highly focused on the adoptive mother. Her feelings, her sadness, her loneliness, her reasons for adopting, her actions. I prefer my adoption books to be more kid-centered. (2) It's just way too long and wordy. So many details are provided that in my opinion add nothing to the story. Every time I read it aloud I abridge it more. To end on a positive note, I do like that it's a true story and my kids will ask things like \\"where is Pan Pan now?\\" Having another child's true adoption story available to us is a plus."},{"Title":"The Red Blanket","review":"Not one our favorite China adoption stories, it is ok but does not really keep my daughter's attention and I find it a little mediocre too."},{"Title":"The Great Pie Robbery","review":"Too bad it is out of print, it is the greatest book I had owned when I was a child.

I'd recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Wild season,","review":"Though written to more of a junior high reading level, this book has been a favorite of mine for many years. It chronicles the events surrounding a pond in the midwest from the early spring through the fall. It is more of a rambling journey up and down the food chain more than a scientific text. The book can make you realize just how important every part of nature can be in &quot;the big picture&quot;. I highly recommend it to all readers interested in nature."},{"Title":"Wild season,","review":"If I had a list of my top ten favorite reads, something I find impossible to create, as I like so many different books, I would probably put this one right at the top of that list. I first read this one when it was first published around 1967 or 1968. I, like another reviewer, have read this one each spring since that first read. It has become sort of a reading tradition for me. It never seems to get old.The entire work covers the thirty one days of May. It consists of some of the best nature writing I have ever had the pleasure of reading. The author takes a very small geographical area, centered in the woods, around a pond and stream, and examines just what happens during this brief but explosive time of year. Eckert goes from animal to animal, insect to insect, plant to plant, critter to critter and gives us a wonderful story of the life cycle of these creatures and plants during these thirty one days. His writing is quite blunt and to the point. This is not a Disney Bambi book! Nature is revealed in all of its fascinating glory which includes birth, life and very sudden death. The author does a wonderful job of showing us how the death of one creature, gives live to another and on how all life is so closely interwoven. He examines the habits and habitat of each of his subjects and explains how one cannot survive without the other. There are no anthropomorphisms here, and rabbit is a rabbit and a blot fly is a blot fly. Yet, you find yourself pulling for the survival of this creature or that, even a wayward seed of wheat that is sprouting in the forest via bird droppings being deposited there.The book takes us on a day by day journey through surroundings that are all around us but few of us actually take the time to see. It becomes very apparent and vary obvious that there are entire micro-worlds around us, so much is happening, so much living and so much dying...all for a purpose though. The author's writing style is almost flawless. This is one of those rare works that a rather young girl or boy can read and thoroughly enjoy and at the same time can be just as enjoyable to geezers like myself!Now I have always been fascinated by the outdoors and nature, even as a very, very small child. This book though, started me on a life long hobby. As an example; we have lived in our present location in the Missouri Ozarks for almost twenty five years. We live in the woods. My wife and I have left over two acres of our property as it was and is. We do not mow, or disturb it in any way. It is wooded, full of brush, has a small water source and can best be described as a rain forest. I have spent all these years since we began living here, studying this small patch of \\"wilderness.\\" This has not been a casual study, to be quite frank, I get pretty intense about it, observing, writing, drawing, painting, photographing and watching. The neat thing about this is that after all these years; I still keep finding and observing new species and events. Love it!It you have the slightest interest in the world around us, the outdoors, and the life we share this planet with, then this is one of the most enjoyable books you will ever read. Recommend it highly.Don Blankenship"},{"Title":"Wild season,","review":"I read this book as a youngster, and have reread it several times since. I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to explore a world that most don't take the time to notice. The author is most descriptive in explaining the how and why of all that happens in a very interesting ecosystem."},{"Title":"Wild season,","review":"If you know a kid that says that he or she does not like to read much, buy them a copy of this book.I own everything Eckert has written, I believe, and have been a fan for most of my life. His efforts to pass on the stories of Tecumseh, Simon Kenton, the Shawnee people and the Ohio River Valley certainly gained my admiration. Wild Season is one-of-a-kind and if you place an order I recommend that you buy 3 because once you loan it out it is hard to get back. I have probably purchased 30 copies in my lifetime, but currently have none on my shelves. One friend recently told me that it went through his entire household in the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas, from the youngest in 5th grade through the 4 siblings, his wife and -sorry- \\"my neighbor has it but I will get it back to you soon.\\" For adults, it can be completed in an evening. I try to re-read it in the spring after purchasing a fishing license, and then again around Labor Day after purchasing my license to hunt.It is not a difficult scientific tome, nor would Disney consider it in a re-telling of their circle of life, although between the spring and the frost it is likely that all of the wild creatures are singing one song or another. This book allows the reader to realize first-hand the point of view of many of God's creatures, one after another, as the sun rises on high and they experience their life's routines. As the writer conveys up front, it is what it is: beautiful, tragic, essential....The beauty is in the description of each animal in tune with the environment; the tragedy in that one living creature is but a meal to another (poor rabbits - making every list); and the essential part really needs little explaining since the lower order animals have yet to form groups that try to disallow the eating of meat in favor of legumes.If you have read this far I offer a simple version: In this book you become one animal until it becomes lunch for another, then you become that animal. I especially enjoyed the Bass, the Bull Snake and the Owl. The Dog makes an appearance as well, as does the most dangerous animal of them all, one that may kill without an allowable or acceptable reason.The thing that I am left to wonder about is that this idea has not been widely copied. I can envision an entire series -the desert, The Red River of Eastern Texas, the coral reef, Eastern Woodlands, etc.In November of this year, I stood high in a tree stand with the string of my bow pulled tight. As I watched, a large doe wondered into the area sniffing at the air for danger. My arrow followed true. She walked a few steps and fell. I climbed down from that tree and walked toward her. Pausing for a minute to give thanks, I'll admit that this book entered my mind. As I bent down to complete my business, I remember hearing Jeff Buckley singing somewhere in my mind:Well I heard there was a secret chordthat David played and it pleased the LordBut you don't really care for music, do you?Well it goes like this:The fourth, the fifth,The minor fall and the major liftThe baffled king composing Halleluja.I am still looking for what that means although I suspect it is an inner question about my place in the circle, about David and Uriah, and about the sometimes deep relationship between love and pain."},{"Title":"Wild season,","review":"As another reviewer did, I first read this book when it was published in 1967. I went on, over the years, to read almost all of Mr Eckert's Winning of America series, but among all his titles, this is the one I keep coming back to.Not just a book to read every year, it's also a book to read with your children when they're old enough, and then to read again with your grandchildren. It's a book about a world that hasn't changed in literally millions of years. Rather than drawing our attention to a small part of the universe, it reminds us of how small OUR place is in the universe.The writing is just right. The number of details Mr Eckert slips in is spot on - any more, it would be a text book. Any less, it would be Bambi again.Don't know when this title went out of print, but any who can should scarf up used copies while they're still out there."},{"Title":"The water lords; Ralph Nader's study group report on industry and environmental crisis in Savannah, Georgia","review":"This book was a life changing experience.

The first part explains how psychic abilities (what the author calls psi) work and then tiesit into the mystery of UFOs in the second part.

Good strategy Guide and source of questions; it is very well written and pleasant to read2. Reading and Critical Reasoning are explained in more depth than in the Kaplan GMAT Guide with CD. I would recommend to get this book in addition to the Kaplan's Guide if you are having troubles with verbal (who doesn't you may ask). I improved RC only after i got this book.3.

In fact I would skip the verbal section of Kaplan's general GMAT guide (the one with the CD) in favor of this workbook.Con:- A couple of questions on the sample verbal section test appear in the other Kaplan guides.Overall, the best guide to the verbal section of the GMAT I have seen.

In the novel, Roth reveals the sacrifice immigrants must make in order to assimilate into the American culture. Essentially, the novel is about a shift from an old way of life to a new way. Capturing the heart of this theme is Reb Yidel Pankower. As this rabbi ponders the condition of his pupils, he realizes that they do not understand who they are and what has happened to their people. In a sense, the rabbi mourns because he feels that the Jewish culture is inevitably dying in America. He refers to this as being &quot;an evil day&quot; (p. 375)."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"Call It Sleep, the first novel of Henry Roth, is the book that must be be next in your life. To get pedantic about it, Call It Sleep is the logical (don't think about it -- logic has little to do with the visceral impact) outgrowth of the lessons of novel-craft as demonstrated in James Joyce's Ulysses (read Roth's later books, Mercy of a Rude Stream et al. to find out more). No literate person should neglect this striking work. It is another example (and perhaps the finest) of how the simple is the most complex; its story will find that part of you that needs to hear it most and you will never be sorry.

The author uses a stream-of- consciousness technique and creates a unique English Yiddish poetic language through which the world is seen. The child's relation to his distant father, the cruelty the child suffers is movingly portrayed .So too his encounters with the world , search for love, meetings with women.The pains of an immigrant world, of trying to find one's way in a strange land, are also vividly portayed here.True literature burns through every line of this work."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"In a sense, it's sort of silly to try and write anything useful about a book so completely hyped by critics and carefully studied (cf. New Essays on Call it Sleep), but I'm going to anyway, because I didn't like it. Now, to be totally up front, I read it under a certain amount of duress. My book group picked it, and after the first ten pages I decided I wasn't going to read it and would miss the discussion for the first time in four years. However, it happened that at the exact same time, I started a research project in which I needed to learn about Manhattan in 1916. Since that's just a year or so after when this novel is set, I realized I could kill two birds with one stone -- and so I went ahead and read it.In hindsight, I realize that I should have skipped the introduction by Alfred Kazin which appears in my edition. It gives away almost every significant plot point and plants far too much in the reader's head -- I cannot conceive of why it wasn't the afterword. Plussing as which, it's not a great essay, even a light skim of it will reveal at least one logical flaw and a total misreading of a scene from the book. So, skip the introduction until after you've read the story. And that story is basically the heavily autobiographical inner life of a emotionally damaged 8-year-old Jewish kid in a rapidly modernizing New York. Many like to laud this book as the best novel about the immigrant experience ever written. This seems rather a strange proposition, for while one of the central themes is certainly the boy's attempt to discover an identity in this brave new world, his circumstance is far from typical. First of all, the Jewish immigrant experience in New York is a very particular one, especially as it relates to cultural persecution in the old world and the notion of alienation and always being \\"the other\\". Trying to say the \\"New York Jewish immigrant experience\\" is representative of the \\"immigrant experience\\" in general is clearly ridiculous. Secondly, by their own choices and actions, the boy's family is almost completely cut off from their fellow immigrants, and are hardly representative. Indeed, it's almost refreshing to find a depiction of immigrants whose hardships are largely of their own making.The boy protagonist is a particularly irksome guide to this world, as he is the ultimate mama's boy (although not without reason). One of the running menacing subplots is the question of whether or not his father is truly his biological father or not, and what exactly his mother got up to in the old country that led to her being married off to a brute of a man (elements apparently drawn from Roth's own childhood). The bulk of the book concerns the boy's horrendous struggle both to assimilate into the world around him and to decipher the spiritual world. The former is a reasonably well-told and familiar portrait of an outsider who just doesn't \\"get it\\". The latter fills the book with religious symbolism, which remained largely a mystery to me owing to my utter lack of religious education and knowledge. Clearly, readers with a strong understanding of Judaism and Christianity will certainly find plenty to chew on. The sexual realm is another running theme, and one that's treated with a great deal of angst, confusion, and negativity. This takes on an entirely different aspect if you read the book knowing that Roth, as his biographer so gently puts it, \\"indulged in incest\\" with his sister Rose (and a cousin) for several years during his early teen years. A less sugar-coated way of putting it is that he sexually abused and raped his little sister for several years... This is hardly incidental to the book, as his biographer writes: \\"Roth would ultimately recognize that incest was the engine that drove his composition.\\" Roth's tortured soul comes through very clearly in his younger alter ego, and it's not a pretty sight.The style and language used are certainly distinctive, and doubtless many find it invigorating and affecting -- I did not. Roth was rather famously influenced by Joyce, Eliot, and other modernists, and I just happen not to care for modernism. The stream of consciousness employed to depict the boy's inner terrors is effective in moderation, but each passage of it runs on far too long, almost to the point of parody. Similarly, much has been written about Roth's representation of Yiddish and the phonetic treatment of English in the book, but neither has aged particularly well. The stylistic flourishes, epithets, and distinctive syntax of Yiddish which Roth employs are difficult to read without simultaneously \\"hearing\\" them as farce or parody of the Mel Brooks variety. There are a great deal of detailed descriptive passages, which again, may appeal to those who appreciate the writer as still-life artist, but again, these struck no chord with me.So, I freely admit that many of my reasons for not liking the book are personal, however I doubt I am alone in this (as indeed I wasn't in my book group). It simply did not resonate with me on any level, and I can't say I'm the richer for having read it. Others certainly will be though, especially those with an interest in Jewish-American literature or literature about New York."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"The book came faster than I expected and in excellent shape. I read this book many years ago, and I wanted to read it again. I love it."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"Call It Sleep was published in 1934, but is set between 1907-1917. The father of the family had immigrated from Germany and the novel opens with the arrival of his wife and son. The story is recounted through the boy, David's eyes. He is very impressionable and sensitive, and his father's animosity aggravates his sensitive nature. Adjusting to life in New York's slums is a challenge. Roth's writing was unique in its use of Yiddish and vernacular speech for dialogue and the scenes that are described are evocative.David's father has a very belligerent character and doubts that David is actually his own son. Because of this doubt he treats his wife and son cruelly. His cruelty, Roth implies, pushes the mother and son to be unnaturally loving and close. Frequently David's love for his mother seems to cross over into a sexualized feeling. There are frequent references to his mother's bosom, jealousy of a family friend who attempts to seduce her, etc. For example, after an upsetting incident David says: \\"'Mama! Mama! Mama!' Only the sheltering valley between her breasts muffled his scream of fear to her heart.\\"Or earlier,\\"With knees drawn up, David watched her wipe the linoleum beneath his chair. The shadow between her breasts, how deep! How far it - No! No! Luter! When he looked! That night! Mustn't! Mustn't! Look away! Quick!\\"The relationship between David and his mother (who's name, Genya, is used rarely) appears to not be healthy, and until the end of the novel the reader wonders if David will end up having a mental breakdown as he does not seem functional. He also does not seem like a realistic 4-12 year old boy.[...]"},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"I struggled through this whole thing but finally finished it. I don't think it was worth the effort.As for capturing the Jewish experience in America, I don't believe Roth did anything that wasn't done much more brilliantly 19 years later with Augie March.But while that book is entertaining as well as gripping, you're going to find this a slog. Roth is very serious about capturing the dialect of his various urban characters . . . and I don't mean capturing the \\"flavor,\\" but the actual dialect.Here are a few unaltered examples:1. \\"My ticher calls id Xmas, bod de kids call id Chrizmas. I'ds a goyish holiday anyways. Wunst I hanged up a stockin' in Brooklyn. Bod mine fodder pud in a eggshells wid terlit paper an' a piece f'om an ol' kendle. So he leffed w'en he seen me.

It's also a brilliant evocation of the alienation of the Jewish experience-- you can't really compare it, as one of my fellow reviewers did, to the experiences of other ethnic groups. The Scherls are a family profoundly alienated from everyone else-- which serves to heighten the terror. This book is written in a stream-of-consciousness style that is really brilliant in that it is completely convincing and totally natural on the part of the author-- it never seems forced-- and in that it beautifully evokes the thought process of childhood. I read this when I was very young and it has stuck with me ever since-- it helped me to understand the feelings of my own childhood."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"My hope was to read a novel that gave an accurate and detailed account of the world my grandparents lived in and I was not disappointed. As with the best historical fiction, I was able to gain a sense of not just the environment and setting, but its effect on the main characters, especially David, the main protagonist.While the prose is often challenging and innovative, the book is a surprisingly easy and quick read that I could not put down. While I was often frustrated by David's inner dialogue, the author must be commended for attempting to convey the inner workings of a child's mind, how his thought process often chaotically bounced around from one thought to another. The author also uses language in a very unique and interesting fashion, namely the contrast between early 20th century New York slang, composed of so many different ethnic groups, to the authors \\"translation\\" of Eastern European Yiddish.For anyone currently reading the novel, who might feel frustrated at a seeming lack of direction in the plot, my advice is to keep reading, as its themes of alienation, growing self-awareness, family, sexual awakening and assimilation become more apparent as the story progresses. And for those who have yet to read the book, I strongly recommend not reading the introduction until after you've finished the book, as it pretty much gives away almost everything that happens in the story and really should have been the Afterword. Regardless, it happens to be a well-written analysis of the novel and can even help the reader in his or her own thoughts and opinions of what is most definitely a classic of 20th century literature."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"Henry Roth wants to do two things well in this book: first, accurately describe the experience of being a child -- not a tough, bully-type child, but a shy kid with no friends. (I can relate.) Secondly, he wants to capture the language spoken by native New Yorkers and by immigrants to the city.It might be best to explain the book's trick as \\"inside versus outside.\\" Most of the time, we stand in a position of semi-omniscience, much like in Crime and Punishment: while the godlike narrator in Crime and Punishment could see inside Raskolnikov's head and no one else's, we are allowed into David Schearl's mind while he wanders terrified through the world. David understands perfectly well why he's so scared, and by the end so do we -- but we also understand why he can't explain his terror to anyone else. We are trapped in the child's head with him. It's been a very long time -- probably since I was David's age -- since I've remembered those feelings.The language of New York's Jewish ghettoes in Call It Sleep also has an inside and an outside, and Roth's great trick is to pull us so deeply into that world that it's a slap on the face when we're back outside. The immigrants talk to one another in their native Yiddish, in which there's great poetry and biblical allusion (as well as more than a few \\"may your remaining days be dark\\"-type curses). We're steeped in that world. Only occasionally do the immigrants step outside and talk haltingly with, say, a local policeman. They are shy, awkward, and adrift. Roth is so ingenious in the delivery that we feel their shyness and awkwardness as though it were our own.It's rare to find a book that is so committed to its characters. Roth has no ulterior motive. He just wants to introduce us to this little community and its little people. If we happen to see larger meanings or other people in those he depicts, it's accidental. That sort of devotion to character is extremely rare. I can only imagine how absorbed in the characters Roth must have been, if he drew his reader in that completely."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"I read this book many years ago, in college, and remember enjoying it thoroughy. I have recently heard it read (Recorded Books, Inc.) by the incomparable George Guidall, who seems to read books requiring Yiddish phrases/accents particularly well (try Stanley Elkin's &quot;Mrs. Ted Bliss&quot; for a hilarious and compassionate thrill).I was not disappointed this second time around, having matured myself, both as a reader and a writer. One of the most striking aspects of the novel is Roth's obvious love of women; few novels by men present women in such a truly beloved light. David's aunt - something of a shrew, a harridan, and a slob - is nevertheless incredibly good-hearted - and alive! Now I want to know more about Henry Roth. Does anyone know if there is a biography of this great writer available? Also, I noticed that there is a book of essays about &quot;Call It Sleep.&quot; I plan to get it."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"This sad, wonderfully written book of tormented immigrants at he turn of the last century from the eyes of an 8 year old child, is vivid and painful. A portrayal of the growth of a youngster, and the gradual revelation of the source of his pain is not easy reading. Roth's power of description of people and scenes are like verbal photographs. This is a work of art."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"According to Amazon, I bought this novel four years ago and for the life of me I actually don't remember what made me buy it.I do that a lot, I have a very long queue of things to read and so it's not uncommon for me to buy something and then file it away for several years until I finally get a chance to get around to it. So who knows what prompted me to purchase it, as I don't really fall into what one might consider a person who this book would resonate the most with. As you can tell by my last name, I'm not Jewish and I didn't grow up anywhere near the 1930s. Yet this book captures the feel of being alive in all its glory and terror (mostly terror) than anything I've read in a while. It's a vibrant work that seethes with the pulse of a city and a child, sometimes the two of them acting in concert and sometimes the two of them opposed.It tells the story of a Jewish family, the Schaerls, who have come over to make lives in New York City. David is a young child, his mother a gentle woman and his father a rather . . . intense man, let's just say. The plot isn't so much a plot as a coming of age tale, as David experiences life and starts to explore the world outside their apartment, the dirty city streets, the collision of people and language, the terror of separation and attempting to find his place in a world that he doesn't fit into very well.If nothing else, this novel manages to simultaneously capture not only the experience of Jewish immigrants but the feel of growing up. David's father Albert seems like a man who is aware that culturally he's a Star of David shaped peg trying to fit into a round hole, and the constant tension that results from that causes him to constantly rage at a world that isn't necessarily fair to begin with and seems doubly unfair to him. His effect on David is tremendous and balanced out by the sheer gentleness of his mother, who adores him.But if the story was just about growing up and being Jewish it wouldn't be that remarkable. What is remarkable is how Roth literally puts us into the perspective of this family and filters the world to us through them. The language churns and leaps and shouts, shifting unexpectedly into a stream of consciousness, as David's thoughts whisk back and forth, rarely focusing and coming at us in cascades of short sentences. Even more interesting, he chooses to render all the dialogue that would be Yiddish in plain English while rendering the English and other languages into a phonetic form, meaning that to us our own language becomes something alien, where we really get a feel for how the Schearls experience the world, where even the words have to be puzzled over for their meaning. It's amazing, not only in how vividly it conveys this world, but how easy it is to read once one gets the hang of it. It makes some sections difficult, especially when all the children are talking but it also comes closer to giving us these people's lives than anything else.Through it all, David tries to learn what it means to be Jewish, tries to learn what his family is about, tries to learn how to live in a world that shifts just out of reach as soon as he starts to adapt to it. His world seems both small and expansive, with the city streets of New York becoming the size of fields, where two avenues over can take you to another planet entirely.It all comes together in a chapter that seems to be a complete mess at first and then suddenly all the various shards fuse into something brilliant, all the voices of the city mingling, thoughts mingling, symbolism mingling, in one virtuoso effect that makes you sad that Roth only seemed to write one proper novel, as nothing else he's ever done really seems to approach the scope and intimacy of this. It leaps into voices and minds and into gutters and cellars and rooftops. It takes the world that we know and first turns it into something alien and new, and then manages over the course of the book to turn it into something familiar. I'll never know what it's really like to grow up Jewish, the traditions, the pressures, the sense of being an outsider, the twin tensions of wanting to maintain your culture and become part of this new world. I'll never know these things, as a third generation American citizen. But thanks to a book written when my grandparents were children, I have some idea on how to start understanding it."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"I discovered Henry Roth serendipidiously--by purchasing a used copy of &quot;Call It Sleep&quot; from a street merchant on West 4th Street in New York while I was a student at NYU. His writing completely and utterly captivated me--the beautiful (yet simple) lyricism of his prose, and his ability to capture and preserve an era gone by...&quot;Call It Sleep&quot; is truly one of the great American novels of all time--brilliant in every respect, it deserves its rightful place in the Western Canon as one of the greatest 20th century literary works. I continually re-read &quot;Call it Sleep&quot;--as well as his recent &quot;Mercy of A Rude Stream&quot; cycle of works. Roth's passing in 1995 was a truly sad time for me and for contemporary American literature."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"Henry Roth was a truly talented writer and I feel frustrated as a reader that there are only a few books of his to read. However, \\"Call it Sleep,\\" is a wonderfully full and vibrant novel about a poor Eastern European Jewish family that settles in the Lower East Side slums of New York. David is the protagonist, a small, fearful, and imaginative boy who must contend with the fast moving intensity and danger as a foreigner in New York. He is surrounded by moving characters, such as his brutish and impatient father, who struggles to support his family or Aunt Bertha, the sanguine flirt who represents the peace and comfort of the old world. I don't ordinarily enjoy these kinds of sociological novels, but Roth is able to conjure up breathtaking images, and he paints his canvas with fascinating dialects with encompass the multi-culturism of American life. \\"Call it Sleep,\\" is truly a neglected piece of depression-era literature."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"Mandatory reading for anyone who can read. Roth belongs alongside Faulkner, Dos Passos, and Joyce. Call it Sleep is the most beautifully written book I have ever read. Tight, turbulent, and heartbreakingly gorgeous. The author squeezes poetry from the tiniest, grittiest of experiences; the reader is allowed so far inside the head of David Shearl it is almost as if he or she travels the same intimate, painful path to awakening-an awakening at once political, sexual, and religious."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"I read this book several years ago as an American Studies major at Penn State University. At first I began to read it only because it was a requirement of my major, but this quickly became one of my favorite books I've read in my studies. The story is of a young jewish boy, being brought up in a ethnically diverse New York City. It is about his grappling with his spirituality, and his perceptions of the world. One thing I learned about the Jewish culture is of its strong patriarchy, and this book shows conflicts that arise between father and son, and how a son can almost never live up to his father's expectations. The story is haunting, and the landscapes are vivid and picturesque. I also recommend a similar book, &quot;Bread Givers&quot;, by Anzia Yezierska."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"I found this book alternately interesting and boring. The stream of conscious narrative was an interesting perspective on the mind of a young boy. Overall, though, I wasn't engaged by the story, which didn't seem to go anywhere, nor by the inner life of the boy, which was too undeveloped to draw me in.Probably best for people deeply interested in New York or Jewish immigrant life at the turn of the century."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"Having been an English major in college, I know this is the kind of book that English profs love to teach.

I was constantly plagued by the annoying nature of David, a sissy mama's boy who is terrified of anything and everything in the world.

The dialogues in the novel--Yiddish written in prose and English in dialect--highlight the clash and synthesis of the two worlds. It is the essential immigrant experience, to straddle between two cultures, to struggle with identity, and ultimately to reconcile and integrate the two into a new creation.Manhattan's Lower East Side has been a microcosm of the \\"melting pot\\" where Jews, Irish, Italians, Greeks, Chinese, Puerto Ricans and Russians mingle and yet retain their unique identities. Often, second and third generations move to more affluent neighborhoods, but this place remains \\"ground zero\\" for the dynamics of cultural synthesis.

I award this particular ROTH-ROTH pair a counterparts quotient of 10 out of 10. It's as if the very first double bar routine of the very first olympics had just earned a perfect score--pretty amazing! If you want, you can just skim the following bulleted list, but these things must, for the sake of history, be enumerated:*Both books were written by men name of Roth. (that's a freebee, but still.)*Both books take place during the time period in which the authors themselves were growing up (1910s in the case of Henry, 1940s in the case of Philip).*Both books are about Jewish families living in Jewish neighborhoods.*The protagonists of both books are children.*The protagonists are pretty much the authors themselves, to wit: the main character in Philip Roth's book is named \\"Philip Roth.\\" Henry *Roth's character was born the same year as Henry Roth and, like Henry, moved to the U.S. during infancy.*The fathers of these characters both lose their respectable dayjobs and end up working nights.*The fathers are both angry men, and both books feature climaxes involving these fathers beating up family members.*The protagonists of both books share an unreasoning fear of cellars.I found Call It Sleep amazing. It's the story of a family of Austrian-Jewish immigrants who live in New York tenement housing--a \\"daily struggles\\" sort of book. The characters were beautifully drawn, and the world rendered so deeply that by the end it seemed like I could just walk around in there. As I confessed to my wife afterwards, I sometimes have a chip on my shoulder when I read something written by someone younger than myself--but that chip melted instantly here (an ice chip), despite the fact that Roth wrote Sleep between the ages of 24 and 28.The Plot Against America was harder going. When I finished, it was with a sense of having toured a nice museum. I found myself thoughtfully stroking my chin and muttering, \\"Yes indeed--the work of a master...\\" I know this sounds dismissive, and it is a little bit, but I'm telling the truth, too. P. Roth rose to the challenge of a difficult narrative task--an alternative history of WWII in which Roosevelt was defeated in his bid for a third term by the aviator, isolationist, and anti-semite Charles Lindbergh. The action alternates between the daily life of the Roth family and the larger world stage of wartime politics. I kept thinking it wasn't going to work, but it lumbered on like an oblong wheel.The style of the two books had a lot to do with their effect on me, I think. Plot is related through a distant 1st person POV, and has the marked remove of memory, whereas Call It Sleep is told in a close third person that injects the reader right into the head of the protagonist. It's interesting to note that herein is proved the notion that an intimate 3rd person can be \\"closer\\" than a distant 1st person. I'd never really thought about that before. Here are two sample sentences in which the narrators reflect upon their shared fear of cellars:Plot:The cellar was a place bereft not just of a sunny window but of every human assurance, and when I came to study Greek and Roman mythology in a freshman high school class and read in the textbook about Hades, Cerberus, and the River Styx, it was always our cellar that I was reminded of.Sleep:The rats lived there, the hordes of nightmare, the wobbly faces, the crawling and misshapen things.(Next month perhaps I'll write Literary Counterparts as a child in close third person. \\"He looked upon the book, the words, crawling and misshapen things, I am but a boy of eight!\\")"},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"Very few Jewish novels can dare lay claim as the best American Jewish work of fiction. Call It Sleep is one of those that deserve serious consideration. Influenced by James Joyce, Henry Roth created a world seen from a child's point of view. Long-neglected, Roth's book finally was published in the mid-60s and became recognized for the classic it is."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"After 20 years of attempting to break open this novel, Call It Sleep by Henry Roth, I have finally finished it. Once I was mastered reading the long sections written in dialect form, as well as the use Yiddish, I discovered an amazing novel.A breathtaking, horrifying, gorgeous novel: poem, journalism, stream of conscious, realist, psychological, social-impossible to define. I can't say I ever found it easier to read; I can say I found it impossible to stay away from. The only way I could read it was by becoming deeply immersed in it, reading carefully line by line, word by word even.The story is of a Jewish family, immigrants from Poland and one major theme of the text is the immigrant experience. They, as are most of the people living around them, are dislocated, cut off not only from family and friends and familiar landscapes but from their culture, their very language. Their speech is reproduced in dialect only when they are attempting to speak in English, in their native Yiddish the speech is rendered in perfect English, showing us their ease and eloquence in their mother tongue.The story is also that of the streets of the Lower East Side, surrounded by tenements, overcrowded, teeming with people, life, clashing cultures, children adrift in families unmoored from their past and still unattached to their brilliant. Poverty is almost the least of their problems. Dirt, smells, noise-unbelievable noise of trolleys and trains and people screaming-\\"hollering\\", a word I haven't heard since my father died, to each other, at each other, pushing, fighting. All I remember as a child shopping on Delancey Street on a Sunday (back then, only the Jewish stores on the Lower East Side of Manhattan were allowed to be open on Sundays and I remember the terrifying crowds, loud, shoving and my terror that I would be separated from my parents).The story is also a very personal one of three years in the life a boy (aged 6-9), whose father is often violent, paranoid to a clinical degree, who shouts, rages and beats the child who turns desperately to his gentle, adoring mother who, unable to speak English and thus even more isolated than the father, turns to her son as well as her emotional lifeline. The boy, David, is sensitive, gifted (very likely to some extent a portrait of the author, Henry Roth).Published originally in 1934, the book was barely noticed. It is now considered an American classic. I wish I could quote from the book but it seems impossible to convey its power through any one sentence or paragraph. The book works in rhythmic sections that in an almost musical way resonate off, contrast with, and highlight aspects of the work in a way that resists easy description.A difficult work still but one that pays off close reading many times over. This book was well worth the effort I put into reading it. I am grateful I did not give up on it, even after so many years. I feel as though through its reading I have been changed, both as a reader and as a human being."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"I must confess that even though I studied American literature in college I had never heard of Henry Roth before reading a profile of him at HistoryAccess.com. Reading that piece made me passionate to get this book, and I must say, it's a remarkable work, one of the finest novels I've read in years, an essential chronicle of the immigrant life. (Really, in order to understand America, we must understand the immigrant experience.) But more than that, the book is an essential chronicle of human life. I am about to dig into Roth's other works. He bears comparison with the other Roth (they're not related, except in spirit and passion and talent and will to create)."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"After hearing about this book from the movie \\"The Stone Reader\\" I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. It is a wonderful insight to an era in America for immigrants. I loved spending time with the characters even when I didn't like some of them. The prose was beautiful to read as a translation from the yiddish and polish, the reading was hard and slow when spoken in the characters broken english.It is a great read and a good reminder to all of us what it was like to be an immigrant, young, and innocent in a new country."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"Henry Roth's book \\"Call It Sleep\\" truly describes with great depth, feeling and emotion, the American Immigrant experience. Roth chose to use a 7 year old boy to narrate his story, thus making it more visceral and intense. Roth takes advantage of a 7 year old's state of mind and innocence, to portray the mid-childhood experience in a NY City East Side tenement ghetto.Though Roth happened to choose a Jewish part of the ghetto to portray in his story, the true beauty and excellence of the book, is that the story could have taken place in any one of the ghettos of New York City. It can easily be generalized to the Irish immigrant experience, or the Chinese immigrant experience, or the Italian immigrant experience or virtually any other immigrant experience at that time. All of those immigrants experienced this cultural mixing and its attendant discriminations as immigrants in New York City in the 1920's and 1930's.Roth published his book in the midst of the depression in 1934. But it came to real prominence when printed in paperback in 1964. The books true appeal is that it is universal to all Americans, except Native American Indians. All of the rest of Americans immigrated somewhere in their past. And thus, whether one be an immigrant today, or a 1st generation American or 2nd or 3rd, even if our ancestors came over on the Mayflower, we are all immigrants somewhere in our past.Even if one's ancestors were Pilgrims, parts of Roth's book would ring true for them as well. Through the use of intricate analysis of the thoughts of Roth's main character, he portrays those innate emotions that we have all experienced, and from time to time, continue to experience.The book is highly informative, highly emotional and highly entertaining. It reads very quickly, and is written impeccably. \\"Call It Sleep\\" is truly one book that all Americans should have in their collection."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"I tried four or five times over forty years to read this book and failed - till now. Why in my 70's did it finally grip me! And grip me it did. The angry bitterness of the father, Albert, the yielding supportiveness of the mother, Genya - all the side characters, each adding something to one's sense of life, one's sense of the human condition.The immigrant English was perfect. Still better, the way the children talked opens sealed portals of our past. What I loved were passing sensory descriptions, the sound of a boat horn in the night, luminous shadows of buildings, moment to moment sensations that are heavy one moment, turn into airy nothing the next. A combination of James Joyce and Yiddish drama. For dramatic it is, and in a style those of us who remember Yiddish theater will recognize.Most of all for me was the penetration of darkness and the ways the protagonist sought Light. Even if it meant almost electrocuting himself to achieve ultimate union with God, much as Aaron's sons did.If I wrote such a novel as a young man, as Henry Roth did, I can see that I would have a hard time writing another or writing at all. I'm left more than breathless, more than forlorn. Scarred with recognition of the human plight, commingling hope and hell."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"A 1934 novel depicting life in pre-World War II New York City, Henry Roth cleverly utilizes the young and impressionable mind of David Schearl to explain the complexities interwoven with great simplicities of the 7 year old's life.The book commences with an introduction to his father who left for the promised land to earn enough money to achieve financial capabilities to deliver his wife and toddler son. The meeting is less than warm and could be explained as reproachful and with disdain.Fast forwarding a few years, the book delivers us to Manhattan kids in Jewish ghetto and how their thick accents contradict and compliment the eastern European or Germanic accents of the parents.This is really a KosherAngela's Ashes; or since it predates Ashes,Angela's Ashesis an Irish Call It Sleep. Like the ever successfulAngela's Ashes; , the poor kid in the big city offers hope in the doldrums of the gray life delivered by the \\"hood\\" or poverty.The mind of young David warps - either through constant exposure to the city's ever-emitting poisons, or through a fermenting process experienced when exposed to the city's vices. Innocent David loses innocence many times over. David's befriending Irish Leo winds up being a sexual violation upon his cousin Esther. He is bullied by adult men for some of his fathers milk cart's bottles, and then witnesses his father beat one of the crooks with a horse whip. He even sees good Jewish boys pull fast ones on Rabbi Reb Yidel at their Hebrew school. No one, no matter how young, no matter what their faith, no matter what their gender, is immune to what David experiences. This New York is the equivalent to Upton Sinclair'sThe Jungle.In the end, David speaks to himself in mumble jumble, garbled think speech, through a very awkward stream of consciousness. Hard to read, it is the author's valiant depiction of the broken psyche of David's whose book-ending act is either a product of contemplated act, or youthful ignorance. You hope for the latter, but cannot rule out the former.In any event, he must escape the world in which he lives, at least for part of the time. And, his mother cuddles him to take a nap, have some rest so that he can forget about what happened. Or what is happening about him. And, he shuts his eyes to this tranquil retreat within the borders of the city's chaotic atmosphere, and placates his mind and body in a restful feeling - one that \\". . . he might as well call it sleep.\\" And, enjoy it he should, as in only a few years, his Austrian relatives and many more are going to experience much worse than what he has had to endure in America."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep, a Novel","review":"When Henry Roth's novel Call it Sleep was published in 1934 it was hailed by some critics and readers as a minor masterpiece. Indeed, this is one of the best novels about our immigrant experience. Mr. Roth's compassion for his characters, his intense narrative force, and his wonderful ear for dialectic speech and poetry is evident throughout Call it Sleep. A simple story of an immigrant Jewish family during the years 1911 to about 1913, it centers on a boy named David Schearl, who lives on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, his feuding parents, his street friends and some relatives. At times its scenes of domestic strife may get wearisome to the reader, but then Roth introduces the colorful Aunt Bertha, who has a different temperament than David's gentle mother, and the fireworks begin. She is a loud, course, stout and an outspoken woman who never hesitates to stand up to her sister's bitter, argumentative husband. Their hard life reaches a climax during an ugly family fight wherein David, fearing his father's rage, runs away. He soon finds himself hiding in a train yard, but comes close to being electrocuted. He survives his harrowing experience and is brought home to his worried parents.The beauty of Call it Sleep lies in Mr. Roth's power of description and his deep understanding of people. The images he conjures of his old Lower East Side neighborhood, its struggling people, busy streets and loud sounds, its smells and relentless drama all come alive. Some readers may find this somewhat lengthy novel confusing at times, with several passages difficult to understand, and its dialog undecipherable when Roth weaves speech, narration and poetry into a confusing jumble, but Call it Sleep is terrific reading. An excellent introduction by Alfred Kazin and an afterward by Hanna Wirth-Nesher, a language scholar, proclaim it a masterpiece of language and literature.

The book became an addiction, one that I am glad to have experienced, but would not want to try again."},{"Title":"Scandal","review":"This is a very good book, rehashing scandals of all sorts throughout history (leaning toward modern times). Lots of details not found easily elsewhere. I love any true book where the high and mighty get a comeupance when it's deserved, and this book gives the reader a variety of scandalous stories to choose from. But don't skip a page! Even if you think you know everything about one of the scandal mongers listed, the author's style of writing is always a treat."},{"Title":"Scandal","review":"Colin Wilson's Encyclopaedia of Scandal is a good basic introduction to the scandals and scams of old. He and Donald Seaman describe some of the most notorious scams of the past and explain how they affected public thinking (and often public policy).I recommend this book to all readers, but especially to those who look at the past with rose-coloured glasses."},{"Title":"IS-95 CDMA and cdma2000: Cellular/PCS Systems Implementation","review":"This is definitely not the right book if you do not know anything about wireless communications and you just want to have an idea of this topic. In order to understand most of the chapters you need quite a strong background on analog (AMPS) and TDMA systems(GSM). If this is the case, this book is helpful to understand all the main features of the IS-95 CDMA standard and the differences between this systems and the previously mentioned ones. The book is complete, well organized and structured even though sometimes it exceeds in details and becomes heavy to read. But if you are not interested in the mathematical parts you can easily skip to the following section without losing anything."},{"Title":"IS-95 CDMA and cdma2000: Cellular/PCS Systems Implementation","review":"This book has only one chapter on cdma2000, most of which is a re-work of what's available from standard specifications and freely downloadable from .... The use of \\"cdma2000\\" in the title of this book is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, as the book provides little insight beyond what's readily (and cryptically) available elsewhere. The treatment of IS-95 is deeper, particularly on handoff. Coverage of power control is terse. On the whole, this book provides good grounding for IS-95 (cdmaOne), yet leaves the reader to make appropriate connections to cdma2000."},{"Title":"IS-95 CDMA and cdma2000: Cellular/PCS Systems Implementation","review":"The book's content is organized very well. I recommend the book those readers, as it is stated in its preface, who needs an easy and smooth introduction to IS-95 and CDMA 2000, but not requiring a detailed mathematical analysis, or complex and complete systems architectures, network protocols.

De hecho, la evolucion del GSM hacia 3G, era extremadamente obligatoria, ya que estaba en juego su supervivencia, en cambio el CDMA, evoluciona a 3G muy facil, pues crecer sumando codigos es mas facil que crecer compartiendo y limitando cada vez mas el uso de los slot times,para voz y datos."},{"Title":"IS-95 CDMA and cdma2000: Cellular/PCS Systems Implementation","review":"Introduction.

The tools he uses help us fill in the gaps that scripture leaves out and give us a fuller picture of the New Testament world, especially Corinth and Paul's church there. Because I am a pastor whose job is a people job, his work makes my job easier and helps me to focus on the message for my people well.I am grateful for his description of a church fragmenting in confusion, and how the Gospel Paul preaches can heal it!"},{"Title":"Conflict and Community in Corinth: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary on 1 and 2 Corinthians","review":"I used this text for a class in seminary. Witherington has helped me wrestle with the difficulties of Paul's often controversial Corinthian correspondence. Witherington helps the Corinthian exegete to understand the culture bound context from which Paul was writing from and writing to (he offers 75+ pages of helpful guidance to navigate the Corinthian correspondence). Placing the letters in their social and rhetorical contexts, Paul's words spring to new life. I would highly recommend this text paired with Fee's commentary on 1 Corinthians as conversation partners."},{"Title":"Conflict and Community in Corinth: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary on 1 and 2 Corinthians","review":"I really appreciated this commentary greatly. It helped we to get a feel for 1st Century Corinth and to understand the motivations behind the actions of the Corinthian Church. It was a significant reference too in a post graduate essay on \\"Discernment in the Corinthian Church\\"."},{"Title":"Conflict and Community in Corinth: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary on 1 and 2 Corinthians","review":"I have used this commentary exclusively on 2 Corinthians, and Witherington's comments are shorter on 2 Corinthians. I consider this the best commentary on 2 Corinthians. I may not always agree with Witherington, but he has the knowledge base and mind of a great scholar and writes from a fairly conservative position. He evades nothing and is thorough.Witherington's commentaries are academic but understandable to even a serious laymen, but they are especially useful to pastors and theologians -- people who want to get into the meaning of the text at a deeper level."},{"Title":"Conflict and Community in Corinth: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary on 1 and 2 Corinthians","review":"I have used this commentary in my studies for 1 Corinthians only and it is fantastic (I have not looked at 2 Corinthians as yet so my review is purely based upon 1 Cor.). BWIII's work is complemented by this book as 1 Corinthians is riddled with rhetoric as most readers will know. His understanding of 1:10-17 is excellent (pp94-105) and his cross overs with other Greco-Roman works is great (throughout). There will be some sections you may not agree with. I personally found his thoughts on head coverings interesting but not convincing (pp232-240), but he may well be correct. I was glad I read his perspective all the same! I found this tome complemented Fee's work fantastically.As with Keener, BWIII is at his best when developing a picture of social life in the 1st Century Roman Empire. He does engage with the Greek often but if you are someone whom is a Greek 'nut' then you may be better off picking up Thistleton. I have to say though that if you are seriously studying 1 Corinthians be sure to purchase Fee, BWIII, Thistleton, and Garland. Those are my top four on this book in no particular order.I also find that you will often get a different opinion on many passages throughout the NT in BWIII's numerous titles under the banner of 'Socio-Rhetorical'. This is welcomed as too many scholars today are not adding anything of value to discussions."},{"Title":"Conflict and Community in Corinth: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary on 1 and 2 Corinthians","review":"This was the first of all of Prof Dr Ben Witherington's commentaries which I read, and by which I became captivated by his depth of understanding and style of writing.

As a former fellow student with Ben, I knew that if the book would be anything like Ben himself it would have to be a good one.It is an exhaustive book. It has a plethora of footnotes which I now have to read because I wanted to get through the chapters themselves first. That in itself promises to be most informative.This is a very thorough book.This book reflects Witherington himself: it is thorough, fair (and he tries to treat those who disagree with him with respect as he dismantles their arguments) and imaginative reflective of good teaching ability. For example, Witherington does a very good job of fleshing out the members of the actual church in Corinth to the best of his ability. Of course, this is not a work of fiction, but to understand the church at Corinth these people need to be \\"fleshed out\\" someway , somehow. Including Paul himself.The litmus test of this book is whether it accurately places one in the middle of Corinth Greece in 53? AD and within the mind of Paul during that place and that time.Litmus test passed.Right now I'm looking at two more of Witherington's books on my bookshelf I bought 2-3 years ago.

It is a beautiful story about the Angels who design animals and the process they go through to achieve perfection. Both my mother and I would swear we could smell the crayons the angels used to illustrate their visions. Every child should read this beautiful book."},{"Title":"Lion","review":"I vividly remember my mother reading Lion to my sisters and me. It takes place in the design department where new animal species are developed before they are created on earth. Not religious at all, but all the people are depicted as stereotypical angels. If your kids can understand that this is make-believe and just for fun it's great. If you're going to feel obligated to explain away differences between this story and your belief system you should stay away from it.

Unfortunately when we went to \\"La Fontaine Saint-Victor\\" at 24 rue St.-Victor the building was being renovated and the restaurant was gone; Then we went to Montmartre (18th arrondissement), tried to find Le Soleil Gourmand --it was gone. So we went on to Le Maquis --that was gone too! However, we ended up eating at the new restaurant at that same address, and had a fine meal. --But better check ahead before relying on this 2007 edition in 2010."},{"Title":"Sandra Gustafson's Great Eats in Paris","review":"I'd used the Gustafson London restaurant books twice five years apart, and found them extremely dependable; never steered me to a bad meal. The Paris book, therefore, went with me on my first trip there last year.Admittedly, finding good food in Paris isn't quite the challenge that London poses, but doing so for even a sort of reasonable price can still be a challenge.Gustafson paid off again. with one small caveat: as a prior reviewer notes, given the restaurant business in Paris, you MUST MUST MUST make sure you're working from a current edition, you MUST MUST MUST have, and be able to read, a DETAILED Paris street map, and you MUST MUST MUST call ahead. I only ran aground if I slipped on one of these steps. Given that some of Gustafson's Paris finds are hard to find, even when they're there and flourishing, if go in search for one that's actually gone out of existence, you may find yourself walking in circles, increasingly hungry and frustrated.Menu price changes? Yep, they happen, but as Gstafson points out, the menu with prices is always posted; look once more before you leap."},{"Title":"Sandra Gustafson's Great Eats in Paris","review":"A perfect companion to Gustafson's hotel book.

She's right on the money, review-wise. Some of our favorite restaurants to which we return on every trip (A La Biche au Bois, Le Petit Saint Benoit for sure)were from her earlier book \\"Cheap Eats in Paris\\".The only problem is that restaurants change and a book with a 2007 copyright (meaning it was written in 2006) is beginning to get old.There's nothing worse than pitching up to a restaurant only to find that it's no longer there.And the world has changed. There are lots of bloggers on Paris restaurants that are more up to date.So I would not buy her book (or any restaurant review book) if the copyright was more than 1-2 years past.Note: My purchase of this book was in May, 2007 shortly after it was published."},{"Title":"Sandra Gustafson's Great Eats in Paris","review":"This has been described as a food guide for real people, which I think means people who can't afford to go to Michelin-starred restaurants for every Paris meal. That's a pretty fair description for the guide--an update of earlier \\"Cheap Easts in Paris\\" guides by the same author, Sandra Gustafson.I'm just back from a visit to Paris and I can honestly say that I used this guide several times. I like the way Gustafson has organized the book, by sections of the city and I like her straightforward analysis of the restaurants and their bills of fare. She doesn't waste time on her own experiences at these places which has been the case in at least one other recent Paris guide. The two restaurants from the guide that we tried were accurately described, although prices have gone up since the book was published in 2007. Gustafson's intro chapters explaining the various kinds of eateries in Paris is also helpful for the first time or infrequent visitor to the city.As useful as this book and others like it (Time Out, Patricia Wells' books, etc.) are, no single food critic or guide can do justice to the vast number of meritorious cafes, bistros, brasseries and restaurants that populate nearly every block or two of the city. A visitor to Paris can usually find a perfectly fine place to eat every time by following a gut instinct and by avoiding places with obvious tourist menus (national flags printed on the cover) or surrounded by shops selling souvenirs. (It's generally a good idea to eat at least a block away from any major tourist attraction.)Gustafson's effort is a good one and we can hope that she will bring out a new version sometime soon."},{"Title":"Sandra Gustafson's Great Eats in Paris","review":"There is no better way to explore and learn Paris than by seeking out the restaurants that Gustafson recommends. I've been using this book and its predecessor (\\"Cheap Eats in Paris\\") for five years and now I have and continue to build a treasure trove of unique places to revisit and to recommend to friends traveling to Paris. But not too many friends though, as the whole point is that these places are where Paris dines routinely, with thankfully a shortage of tourist traffic."},{"Title":"Sandra Gustafson's Great Eats in Paris","review":"Sandra Gustafson's \\"Great Eats in Paris\\" unfortunately denotes a sad fact in its current title: it used to be known as \\"Cheap Eats in Paris.\\" With the new title, Gustafson acknowledges that there's no such thing as a bargain meal in Paris any more. However, her book does present a wide range of choices throughout the various arrondissements where you can still eat without paying ridiculously excessive money. She describes her favorite places and dishes in such mouth-watering detail that you can read the book for pleasure even if you're not planning a trip to Paris. Her early chapters, in which she describes French eating habits and preferences and gives her tips for finding the best restaurants (i.e. walking a block or two off the most heavily traveled streets), are a great help to American tourists who might not know what to expect.My sister and I were in Paris for a few days earlier this summer, and we had the opportunity to try only one of Gustafson's recommendations: Le Fin Gourmet, on the Ile Saint-Louis. She was absolutely correct in saying that Le Fin Gourmet's cuisine was of uncommon delicacy for its price range, particularly the amuse-gueule of couscous and the wonderful cabbage stuffed with shredded duck. However, we were happier on the whole with a restaurant a few doors down, Le Caveau en L'Ile; the food wasn't as creative as at Le Fin Gourmet, but the portions were larger, the people friendlier, the premises more comfortable and the quality still good. We also wondered why Gustafson didn't include the famous Cremerie-Restaurant Polidor, where the foie gras, confit de canard and Tarte Tatin were superb. (We had been at Polidor during a previous Paris visit, and the quality if anything was even better the second time around.) Based on our experiences, we would say that Gustafson is fun to read and generally accurate, but not infallible."},{"Title":"Sandra Gustafson's Great Eats in Paris","review":"We found this book very disappointing. Even with the name change from Cheap Eats, Gustafson still seems to concentrate more on the &quot;cheap&quot; than the &quot;great.&quot; It was such a poor guide that we stopped using it after two tries, one a vegetarian restaurant, the other Italian. Actually, we found our Fodor's guide to Paris a much better restaurant guide than Gustafson's. Several restaurants in Fodor's were in the same price range but were superb in comparison, and fortunately we had some excellent dinners.The only thing to commend this guide is the organization. We did like looking up restaurants by arrondissement, and the maps were good. We wish the restaurants were as good. We were so disappointed that we left the book at our hotel in Paris rather than taking it back home with us."},{"Title":"Sandra Gustafson's Great Eats in Paris","review":"This is the third edition of Sandra Gustafson's book Cheat/Great Eats in Paris I bought. I still find it to be incredibly valuable. Look, if you have 50 Parisian friends and know Paris perfectly and/or what top caliber - high price restaruants this book is NOT for you. If, however, you are like me, you've noticed you can pay lots of money at a brasserie and get mediocre food, get great food but at prohibitively expensive prices, or go to places where attitude seems more important that the food itself. This book has never steered me wrong: You can get great meals at reasonable prices. The truth is, sometimes you WANT a good pizza parlor or sandwich joint if you are on a budget. But you also have the \\"big splurge\\" list and many restaurants where you can get really good food at much less than other places. I find her descriptions to be very accurate and honest - I've never gotten to a hamburger joint expecting fine dining.Is this book for absolute conaisseurs of Parisian restaurants? No. Is it for people who want really good food and don't want to pay double if it is not necessary - YES!One word of warning: Do call ahead before going to then restaurants.

I'm a vegetarian and we were traveling on a very tight budget. This book helped me find restaurants that had vegetarian-friendly menu items, that were nearby, and that were in our price range.The entries are detailed, and are arranged by arrondissement. Each entry gives the name, address, phone number, price range, hours, and whether reservations are recommended. She also notes whether English is spoken and if so, how fluently. She describes the ambience, the service, and the type of food, often listing several menu items as examples. She also writes about her favorite menu items as well as those that weren't as good in her opinion.The book covers breakfast, lunch, dinner, coffee/tea/internet cafes, etc. and includes all types of food, from classic French cooking to Italian, Thai, American, etc.I do think, though, that this book may appeal most to budget travelers... although the name has changed from Cheap Eats to Great Eats, the philosophy remains the same: good food at great prices.

In quantity and quality I have loved Sandra Gustafson's choices. I miss the \\"Cheap Eats\\" of her earlier years, but she still suggests many restaurants that have excellent food at reasonable prices. Her detail work is great: days open, hours open, Metro stop, menu suggestions, etc. To drop a name, I recall mentioning a favorite \\"Cheap Eat\\" to Claudette Colbert, with whom I was working at the time. \\"Oh, darling,\\" she said, \\"that's one of my favorite restaurants, too.\\" This book is not for diehard foodies.

I am going to Paris for the 5th time and I am purchasing the revised Great Eats book (formally titled cheap eats). I would not go without the book.

Much to our surprise, we were almost always happy with where we ate. Plus, eating was secondary to our other interests, such as museums, parks, etc. But, if eating is your focus, then this book is a must. She's objective and quite thorough.

This new edition of her novel offers a well-deserved opportunity for Brooke to steal some of the spotlight back from the illustrious Austen. Her heroine, Maria Villiers, will delight literary readers with her naive ambition to win fame and glory as a dramatist and author in the London market. Maria's adventures in the city, her near misadventures with seduction, and her blossoming romance with the &quot;brave, generous, sincere&quot; Colonel Herbert are all sure to amuse readers who have long enjoyed Austen's works, and the introduction provided by this edition offers an excellent sense of the context in which readers should view the author and her work. The Excursion is a great, quick, fascinating read!"},{"Title":"Defining Visual Rhetorics","review":"The editors' introductory essay does everything but define visual rhetorics. They define some major semiotic concepts from Roland Barthes and C.S. Peirce and, for some reason, the concept of intertextuality. But nowhere in the introduction, or in their own chapters, do they provide a definition for visual rhetorics.For that, the reader must skip to Chapter 3,\\"The Rhetoric of Visual Arguments\\" by J Anthony Blair. However, Blair has a very specific focus--argument--so his definition comes with its own limitations. The rest of the essays offer a decent sense of how to apply visual rhetoric, and Sonya K Foss in the final chapter also attempts a definition. Four stars for these essays.Two stars for the book as a whole. The editors ruined the chapters with their odd subheadings, and I just cannot get over their confusing writing in the introduction and their complete failure to fulfill the promise made in the title of the book. As a student with a limited budget, I feel totally misled."},{"Title":"Defining Visual Rhetorics","review":"This book made me want to take scissors and gouge my own eyes out for every reason imaginable.

Jaguar, an empath uses her psi skills works with the prisoners as a Teacher and she has a phenomenal success rate with even the hard core killers. Her latest case involves three women who went on a killing spree and when she examines their records she diagnoses them as suffering the affects of exposure to Artenis compounds, the by products of moon mining.Moon mining has been suspended for two years pending the outcomes of studies on women who miscarried, hemorrhaged and even killed for no apparent reason after being exposed to it. Lobbyists are trying to get the repeal lifted but Jaguar and her boss Alex can prove that exposure to Artenis compounds caused the women to kill. There are people including one of the administrators of the prison planetoids who are willing to kill Alex and Jaguar to prevent them from making their concerns public.It has been too long since the latest Jaguar Adam's science fiction mystery has been published but it has been well worth the wait. Both the heroine and her wannabe lover Alex get caught up in a criminal conspiracy and it takes the fighting nature of the protagonist that gives them a chance against their enemies in a final confrontation that is explosive. A LUNATIC FEAR has cross genre appeals to fans of science fiction, mystery and romance. B.A. Chepaitis is a terrific world-builder who creates characters readers will root for.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Oriental mythology (His The masks of God)","review":"Campbell's Masks of God series is an excellent exploration of underlying themes across belief systems through history. Oriental Mythology is no exception as it delves here and there into Asian belief systems and their history. All in all a fine read for those attempting a better, broad understanding. One unusual aspect near the end I was ultimately a bit confused by - Campbell went into great (and perhaps excessive) detail on the modern attempts by the Chinese government to quash local belief systems. Several episodes of torture, abuse and violence were described in graphic detail. I'm not exactly sure of the point he was trying to make in highlighting this multiple times."},{"Title":"Oriental mythology (His The masks of God)","review":"In this second volume of the &quot;Mask&quot; Trilogy, Campbell has moved from the perhistorical to historical. There is and has always been a great divide between the Occident and the Orient on matters of faith and Campbell thinks this has a lot to do with the mythical origins underlying all cultures and religions. Oddly, he begins in Egypt which eventually approached the Occidental viewpoint. But it is in the deserts of that ancient land that we begin with the ideas being set by the changeless seasons and the Nile.Next a study of Buddhist, Hindu and other Oriental religions is undertaken. Somewhere along the line, East and West diverged on the issue of religious thought. One might say that Oriental belief systems harken back to the primitive in that multiple gods, representing various emotions, objects or ideas, were the norm. This was the way of ancient Greece and Egypt but both societies soon &quot;evolved&quot; toward a semi-monotheism or gave life to sects (ancient Judaism) that adopted the single god notion.Of the three, this book was the hardest to comprehend, perhaps due to the foreign names. Still, it is a testament to the monumental research and innovative ideas of the author."},{"Title":"Oriental mythology (His The masks of God)","review":"Good And Valuable Reading Material Of Further Studies For The Occult Student!"},{"Title":"Oriental mythology (His The masks of God)","review":"This is the most impressive book I've ever read about mythology.Just buy it, and let it introduce you in a new world,full of spiritual knowledge."},{"Title":"Oriental mythology (His The masks of God)","review":"This book is a massive summary, comparison of, and commentary on oriental mythology. It is divided into 3 major parts: Western Oriental mythology, Indian mythology, and the mythologies of the Far East. Campbell's incredible scholarship is very impressive, and rather overwhelming at times. He obviously had a great familiarity with the mythologies and religions of practically all areas of the planet. However, his explanations for general readers of foreign mythologies weren't always clear, as evidenced in this book. Much of this book focuses on developing the idea that Oriental mythologies had one major origin, in the Egypt of the Pharaohs. According to Campbell, traces of the religion and mythologies of the Pharaohs, as well as implements of their material culture, could subsequently be found in every major culture heading eastward, from Persia to India, from China to Japan.This idea is not exactly clear in the beginning of the work, and the initial chapters about the Pharaohs start with a jerk, leaving some readers wondering \\"Why start here, so far west?\\" The idea is stated more and more explicitly as the book progresses, so that by the time we reach the Chinese section, Campbell writes about the \\"primacy of the West-to-East cultural flow\\". Later in the same section, Campbell writes \\"the question of the impact of sentiments and ideas carried from one domain to another, which is basic to our study, is ...well illustrated by the annals of the settlement of Buddhism in China...\\" Is there really enough evidence to support the idea of a single common mythology that spread from West to East? Is this theory accepted by modern specialists in mythology? A reader who comes to this book independently of a class or other mythology background can only speculate on these questions.Campbell does a masterful job of laying out similarities across cultures, such as his description of the \\"archetypal Savior Biography\\", where he lists the following elements (among others):--scion of a royal line--miraculously born--amid supernatural phenomena--of whom an aged holy man prophesies a world-saving message--whose childhood deeds proclaim his divine character--engages in arduous forest disciplines--which confront him with a supernatural adversaryHe points out that this list applies to the Jains, Buddhists, as well as Christians, and, if I read him correctly, presents it as one piece of evidence for linkage between Western and Oriental mythologies.The lucidity of Campbell's descriptions and summaries of myths vary. Sometimes he quotes stories or myths at great length. But other times, he passes over the details quickly with such statements as \\"We need not rehearse the legends of his miraculous birth...\\" in his haste to get to commentary about the stories in question. For newcomers to the topic, this can be somewhat of a disappointment, since the commentaries are difficult to understand if one is not already familiar with the stories, and it is to learn about the stories themselves that some readers pick up this book. The book itself seems to have developed from Campbell's notes. Thus, there is considerable explicit enumeration of points, as well as the occasional sentence fragment. This style of writing requires very active study from a reader who is determined to wrestle the kernel of meaning from Campbell's words.The one disappointing chapter was the chapter on Tibet, which actually includes only a few paragraphs about the mythology of Tibet. The remainder of the chapter is a brief collection of ideas from Maoist communism, juxtaposed with stories of atrocities during the Chinese takeover of Tibet. While the story of Tibet is indeed extremely lamentable, perhaps these details would better fit in a political description of Tibet in order to make more room for an overview of Tibetan mythology."},{"Title":"Oriental mythology (His The masks of God)","review":"\\"Oriental Mythology\\" is the second in the \\"Masks of God\\" series, the follow up to \\"Primitive Mythology\\". It covers more of the mind boggling extent of humankind's mythic past, material that is the basis for religion and philosophy. Campbell presents all sorts of details from artifacts dug up by archeologists and some rather long-winded quoted passages. Much of it is rather uneven and challenging to follow, but the payoff is usually Campbell's own commentary which often uses a soaring language to elucidate, to associate and connect different myths of different cultures.The especially fascinating part of the book for me concerns the mystery of how yoga philosophy and practice came into being and evolved as it did to different forms such as Buddhism and Hinduism. Yoga philosophy defines a very different state of being than the Abrahamic tradition of the West. It does not situate humankind in a state of sin and guilt, stranded in a corrupt world, alienated from a transcendent God; but rather, in a state of ignorance with knowledge as the key to escaping from inevitable suffering caused by the delusion of living in a material world. The ancient civilization in the Indus Valley contains seeds of it's development, but it is far from clear just how it developed and what role the Aryans, who invaded and plundered India, played. In any event, Campbell concludes \\"tentatively\\" that yoga is \\"indigenous\\" to India.The many different forms and manifestations of Buddhism follow from the ancient yoga tradition of asceticism. The book is not an good introduction to Buddhism, and it can be difficult to distinguish between the many sects and their different metaphysics and practices. It's influence burgeoned and then waned in India, but spread throughout the Far East, and combined with the Native nature religions of Tao in China and Shinto in Japan. Though Buddhism in whatever form mainly involves a turning away from the affairs of the world, from what is shown here, it has hardly ever failed to provide a civilizing influence.I have to echo some of the criticisms of other reviewers. The inclusion of a chapter on ancient Egypt and also a section on the hieratic city states of Mesopotamia do not go the way of clarifying how Oriental myth grew as it did. The organization of the book would have been a lot more straightforward if he had gone directly from the introduction, in which Campbell compares East with West, to ancient India and directly to the mysteries of the Orient. He seeks to trace the influence of Egypt and Mesopotamia to the East, but the influences are so scattered and so relative, that it would have been better to have stuck with India, China, and Japan. Also, the final section on Tibet, although illuminating, departs in large measure from the subject matter."},{"Title":"Oriental mythology (His The masks of God)","review":"A Myth is not a lie, but, like Art, a rendering of Truth. Subsequently, religion is the extension of myth through ritual. Despite the titles, these texts are as much about religion as myth, and the works are all the better for it. Campbell skillfully explores the Human experience, and what Man has made of it, over the course of these four seminal works. At times, one feels the influence of Toynbee, but Campbell has gone beyond the author of A Study of History and into a world all the more full of wonder.Man is the most conscious participant in Nature, and, as the Image of God, the only creature capable of reshaping Nature according to his own interpretations of its meaning. These little shapings, which we call art, myth, religion, culture, and philosophy are the stuff a rich existence is made of.Stated simply, this work dutifully charts the progress, derivations, and points of origin of these shapings. Campbell's prose is warm, friendly, compassionate, loving but stern, and creative. One could not ask for a better introduction to the Man's works.Oriental Mythology is the second volume in the series, and probably the weakest. Campbell's familiarity with the subject is clear, but his ability to carefully balance his west-to-east/east-to-west thesis is a tad clumsy. The facts themselves are illuminating, as are his deductions, but the volume itself seems slightly awkward compared to the other three volumes. Don't start your reading of Campbell's work with this volume. (NOTE: You might also consider reading Volume Three: Occidental Myth BEFORE reading this volume. Such a reading might clue you into Campbell's style before delving into the depths of Oriental mythology.)For those not familiar with some of the artistic themes discussed in this and other works, Campbell's Mythic Image (Illustrated Edition) makes a strong companion."},{"Title":"Oriental mythology (His The masks of God)","review":"In this book Campbell has covered the entire fieldfrom Ancient Egypt via pre-Buddhist, Buddhist & post-BuddhistIndia to China, Japan & Tibet.Apart from a multitude of references, citations and amusinglegends illustrating his nominal concern (Mythologies)-thecenter of this book (a part of \\"The Masks of God\\" tetralogy)lies elsewhere. Essentailly, all Campbell's work (and \\"OrientalMythology\\", with its chapter 1 \\"Signatures of the four greatdomains\\", is a particularly good example) is a predominantlyJungian (with a few Freudian insights assimilated) comparativeanalysis of the dominant traditional mindsets.For instance, he sharply differentiates between two\\"Western\\" archetypes (Jung again) & \\"loyalties\\":1.Promethean hero-the Greco-Roman legacyof ever-expanding and conquering being2.Job-the Levantine legacy transmuted into ChristianityOr, \\"Eastern\\" loyalties of:3.Yogi- ascetic absorbed in transcosmic cataleptic trance, as the \\"trademark\\" of India4.Sage-essentially the Chinese ideal of harmony (\\"flowing\\" with Tao, or realizingone's tao in society (Confucians))Be as it may, this is a treasure trove of ideas, associations & insights.I haven't encountered any richer or profounder work of late.And, as a ghastly surprise, book ends with factual report on Chinesecommunist invasion of Tibet (mutilations, castrations, sterilizations,public executions & humiliations), as all the horrors from the \\"Bardo Thodhol\\"have descended on our earthly reality. A horrendous reminder thatmythologies are not dead, dated nor irrelevant."},{"Title":"Oriental mythology (His The masks of God)","review":"Mr Campbell was clearly well-read and thought deeply about mythology. That comes through in his attempt to summarise here what exactly is unique about oriental mythology and religion.For those only familiar with Campbell from the TV show \\"Power of Myth\\", Campbell can seem like someone who only wants to bad-mouth the enforced duality (good vs evil) of the Western mythologies, and to praise the more ego-smashing mythologies of the East. But this book shows a much more even-handed approach. You might be surprised here to find Campbell criticising many aspects of Eastern religion, such as the downplaying of individuality (to an extreme extent in the case of the Jainists) and his statements that modern Hindus can be just as eager as fundamentalist Christians to plaster over inconsistencies in the history of their religion. He also does not hold back in criticising human sacrifice and the practice of Suttee.Nevertheless, Campbell retains a strong appreciation for the unification of the pairs of opposites (especially good vs evil) that occurs in Eastern religion, whereas surviving Western religions tend to treat the opposites as irreconcilable. In Campbell's thesis, a belief in the creative force of the universe as an impersonal, roiling, dark substrate of the universe, before which even the gods cease to matter, is vital to all the Oriental mythologies. In its purest form this leads to a seeking \\"within\\" through yoga and meditation.Thus, Campbell looks at this princple in the Egyptian mythology (Ptah's creative force is said to be a universal substratum of reality), Sumerian myth (the myth of the flood, now known as Noah's flood, was originally a regular activity throughout the universe, destroying everything after a set number of milennia), and Hindu myth. In particular, Campbell, argues that the \\"really important\\" Hinduism stuff, the yoga and introspection leading to the destruction of the ego and appreciation of Brahman, was something that -predated the Rig Veda and was a sort of rebellion against it by Southern Indians.I have many criticisms of this book. For one thing, Campbell bases the pre-existence of yoga in the Indus Valley Civilisation on a couple of doubtful Indus era seals with yoga-like postures depicted. Also, Campbell treats Egyptian mythology as fundamentally eastern and opposed to Judaism/Islam, even though we now know that the Egyptian culture and language was as Semitic as Hebrew. Finally, Campbell treats the Indo-European invasions as something that was subverted and amended by the underlying principles of yoga from pre-Indo European days. This seems to be more an excuse for not treating Hinduism as something that is Indo-European in origin (and thus run the risk of being connected closely to Greco-Roman paganism).Nevertheless, a fascinating read. If you ever wanted to know why the religions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism and Jainism always seemed oddly and fundamentally \\"different\\" to Western religions, a poke around this book will reveal why. The idea that one should extinguish the ego and become one with Brahman is a remarkably different idea from anything in Western religion. On the other hand, expect a critical stance from Campbell, one that does not hesitate to point out some issues with such an attitude, and thus showing that perhaps Western religion is no more flawed that any other!"},{"Title":"Oriental mythology (His The masks of God)","review":"I'm writing this review as much in response to the other reviews as I am in response to the book itself. I feel the other reviews are misleading as to what this book is and what this book isn't.First of all, please be aware that if you wish to read this book, clearly marked volume two, then it only makes logical sense to read volume one first. You will not understand this book if you do not read the first volume, Primitive Mythology, beforehand. It's that simple. Campbell weaves an ornate tapestry with this series, and you have to start from the beginning of the thread to see how it all weaves together. Moreover, he introduces many invaluable foundational concepts in the first book that he uses in the second book without redefining, because he's assuming that you read the first book. If you didn't, then that's your burden to bear, and not Campbell's.Second, this is a difficult book. I'll just put it out there right now. If you're expecting an easy-to-follow textbook on the basic stories and myths of these cultures, then you're reading the wrong book. This book is not an enumeration of major myths, but rather an anthropological and philosophical analysis of the flow of concepts and ideas that gave birth to those major myths. This is not a book merely of \\"what,\\" but also of \\"why\\" and \\"how.\\" I'm not saying that you have to be familiar with every major myth of every culture before reading this wonderful series, but it does help to have at least a cursory understanding of the major religions and mythologies. Campbell does a great job of concisely relating the basic points of the myths he's discussing, so there's really nothing to worry about, but just be aware that you're not always going to get the play-by-play, and if you're looking for that, you should consult a different book.Continuing with the fact that this is a difficult book, I will also say that the language and the arguments are quite advanced, so be prepared for a book that's intellectually challenging, rather than summer reading. You get the hang of it after a while, but definitely skim some pages of the book before buying, to see for yourself if you'd feel comfortable with the reading level of this book. Personally, I'm OK with reading it in just about any season, but maybe that's just me.Now that I'm done ranting, I can get to the fun stuff. The biggest reason why you should read this series? It will change your life. It will reveal new histories and modes of thinking to you that you never thought existed. It will show you firsthand the story of humanity, in all its victories and tragedies, and more importantly, in all of its interconnectedness. All of mythology is different variations on the same theme, as Campbell shows. You can also tell just from reading how excited Campbell is about the whole subject, and his sense of awe and wonder, present even after spending his entire life studying this strange story we call mythology, will definitely rub off on you. I've realized things about myself, about humanity, and about life that I never would have if I hadn't have read these books. Please, do yourself a favor and read these books, but just like the mythological hero as of old, proceed only if you're ready for the challenge and adventure!

Where the usual discussion of spirituality and religion is bogged forever in legalistic literalism (These myths are false! How can you call them myths!). Campbell showed the playful but marvelous power of myth and art to inspire or enrich people's lives. In contrasting Eastern and Western myths, he highlighted how the Eastern spiritual journeys are not about obeying authority; they're about self-discovery and self-realization. They are not a matter of competing codes of law, but alternative therapies to deal with suffering.The book is of course a bit dated now. I feel the parts on ancient Middle Eastern myths are more related to the roots of Western religion. And he does not give Chinese or Tibetan myths the treatment they deserve. But I'll always remember something Campbell pointed out during WWII and he mentions here: As Japan was America's enemy, some religious Americans pointed out that the Japanese worshiped devils. Outside their temples there are statues of the ferocious, evil-looking demons those people bow down to! Campbell replied that these demons are representatives of our fears. These seemingly terrible wild things stand at the entryways to inner peace, seeming to warn us back. But for those who pass through the gates of fear, there is a sacred garden of the soul, referred to throughout the world by it's Persian name of \\"Paridise,\\" or \\"Pari-desh,\\" the garden of angels, from which Western myths say we are banished and can never find in this world, but only in another life after death.--author of A Galaxy of Immortal Women: The Yin Side of Chinese Civilization"},{"Title":"Oriental mythology (His The masks of God)","review":"there are no masks, only gods.

There were several reasons for this; one was that he played for the Minnesota Twins, away from the major media markets. Second, he was not a home run hitter, in 19 seasons he only hit 92 home runs. There was actually one full season when his total was zero. Finally, and what is probably the most important, his personality was not one that automatically gathered attention.That last factor is clear in this autobiography, told with very little emotion, generally a flat-toned retrospective of his life. Carew career spanned some of the most tumultuous times in baseball and the American society, the reserve clause was struck down, leading to a dramatic rise in salaries, racial barriers largely fell, the Vietnam War generated violence both here and abroad and the division system with playoffs was implemented in baseball.Yet, Carew is generally oblivious to all of that in this book, of all of the changes, racial issues is mentioned most often and in almost all cases it is a consequence of Carew's interracial marriage to a Jewish woman.

It immediately became my favorite. Since then I've read a lot more fantasy, and then reread this trilogy. Now, I agree with the complaints that the beginning picks up kind of slow. If you're the type of reader that would put it down because you lose interest without excitement in the beginning, I beg you to hold out for a few more chapters. It will suck you in soon enough. In comparison with other epic fantasy authors like Jordan, Goodkind, Eddings, and Kerr, I'd rank Tad Williams above all of them. His words are big and he can ramble a bit, and his plots are intricate, and the storyline could be considered trite, as some of my fellow reviewers have said. But his characters are absolutely brilliant - I've rarely, if ever, seen any better - and he is able to make the most despiccable bad guys I've ever encountered. Without needing to use explicit torture or blood and gore, which some authors (Goodkind) need to resort to. He holds onto his plot(s) without getting lost in his words (Jordan's biggest fault), and he knows better than to kill off any of the characters that are absolutely essential to enjoyment of the story (a problem I have with Katharine Kerr and R.A. Salvatore). And Williams has a wonderful, comparably concise and self-contained story with a momentous ending (whether or not Simon was awake . . .), and unlike many, many other authors, his ending did not feel quite too tidy and easy. I didn't have that feeling of being dragged into yet another adventure with the same characters in order to reach that long-off goal, because it was all contained in one humongous plotline. And the ending certainly did not feel trite after how hard the characters (and the readers) had to work to get there. Williams expertly manages to weave a long, intricate story that holds your attention with brilliant originality in his detail and wonderful characters. Push yourself through the beginning of the Dragonbone Chair, and I promise that it will be well worth the reward."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I'll admit to being a little befuddled and pissed that the last volume in this series got split in two-not only because it makes no sense (why didn't they just make it four books long with four titles) and it costs more to buy it all but I really like really long books. Once I started reading this little hissy fit passed though.\\"To Green Angle Tower: Part One\\" details the beginning of the true resistance against high king Elias' twisted reign over Osten Ard-and the increasing presence of the Storm Kings minions in the land.We witness as Josua fights for the freedom of his slowly growing population atop the stone of Farwell, and watch as Simon is introduced to the glory of knighthood and horror of warfare. We watch Miriamele escape from one who would use her, face and fight untold horrors, and discover a legend thought to be dead. And slowly the league of the scroll pulls its few remaining members together to try and discover what the three great swords can do that would help them.At the same time the Sithi-enraged with the slaying of the Storm King's mother upon her discovery of his plan-have come out of their last hidden places to fight the Norns in the open.And as wars rage and creatures from fairy tales emerge, as legends return from the dead, as an ancient evil spins a web and the forces of good fight to understand even a small part of it everyone is moving back towards the Hayholt-the ancient castle which has beneath it the ruins of the Sithi's Asu'a-and above it the one standing Sithi building-the green angel tower.The more I read this series the more I see common themes with the \`Lord of The Rings\\"-but its nothing that goes so far as to be stealing or even heavy borrowing-just a lot of fantasy standards. Evil has a mountain stronghold, lots of creep looking allies...ect. So where William's \\"Otherland\\" series was heavy on character mystery I think this series is more straight forward-or at least the great mysteries have little to do with the personalities and motives of the characters themselves. But who really knows? William's has suprised me before and I'm sure it will happen at least once more before the series is finished.

Do not miss this one!I cannot wait to see what happens next!"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"NOTE: This review pertains to the whole book, not just this one volume.This book is definately the best of the three, and a damn long one, too. The Dragonbone Chair sets it off to a good start. Stone of Farewell was the worst; it suffered from the Middle Book Syndrome-lack of action or anything important going on that makes a middle book only serve as a connection between the introduction and conclusion. That one kind of depressed me, but I kept hearing that TGAT was worth it. Guess what? They were right. They were right to give the advice, I was right to take it, I'm right to give the same advice and you'd be right to take it as well. Keep reading. If you liked TDC and turned your nose up at SoF(that's me), you will enjoy this book. If you were mildly satisfied with TDC and hated Sof, you should still enjoy this book, because it is the best of the three. If you hated TDC and hated even more SoF then you're probably screwed either way so I wouldn't bother.This book is divided into four parts. The first part is The Waiting Stone. The word \\"waiting\\" pretty much sums it up. This book is definately the most action-packed of the three, but I won't lie to you - the first 300 pages is more of the same from SoF. After the drudgery, though, the action picks up and slowly builds throughout the novel. Part 2 starts speeding things, Part 3 gets things going even faster as well as introduces a little romance (actually a lot), and Part 4 is pretty much action packed the whole way through. (Warning: Make sure you buy both volumes at the same time; Volume 1 ends on a cliffhanger and if you don't have Volume 2 handy you will pull your hair out.) The climax was about 150 pages long, no joke, and the ending will definately throw you for a loop. Good ending. For those of you who are saying that the ending wasn't cataclysmic enough, I honestly don't know what the hell you're talking about. Seriously. Most of the questions you've been herding in your brain, some from the very beginning, some you've probably forgotten, will be answered, mostly in the last 150 pages. I did say that most questions are answered, not all. The ones that aren't answered aren't necessary for the resolution. It's good to have a little mystery at the end of the novel; just as in real life, some questions remain unanswered.There are, however, a few shortcomings. The first is the way he ends chapters on cliffhangers. He'll end a chapter on a cliffhanger, go to a new POV and spend a chapter there, and then begin the next chapter exactly where the previous chapter left off. This didn't happen in his other two books. I think he said in an interview that the cliffhangers serve to keep the reader interested, but I think it has the opposite effect. Just when I'm getting into it, picking up momentum, I have to slow down and stop in order to read the next chapter, and by the time I get to the same situation one second later, it's lost some of its tension and dramatic effect.My other gripe is his writer's voice. I'll try to explain this as best I can. There's something about his prose that affects both characterization and description in such a way that I was never able to completely immerse myself into the story. It's hard to explain, but I think it's in the way he can overly describe some things(in a lot of ways similar to Jordan), and simultaneously summarize parts that should be spoken of in more detail. I'll try to give an example: in the book, say two people are fighting, the description would go something like this: \\"After a brief struggle, such-and-such did this...\\" It's the 'after a brief struggle' that I'm talking about. That kind of writing doesn't put you in the character's head, you don't get fully immersed into what's going on, because it doesn't really tell you what the character is feeling and thinking at that moment, it just kind of summarizes. Pick up a book by Terry Goodkind, George Martin, or Stephen King and contrast the two styles of writing and you may get a clearer picture. If I pick up a book by one of those afore-mentioned authors, I can't put the bastard down until it's finished! In this book I was never able to completely immerse myself in what was happening. I tried, but even during the action sequences I was never quite able to get into it; something held me back. This problem was in the other books as well, but to a lesser degree, I think.Despite its shortcomings, though, TGAT is still a very good book. Hats to Mr. Williams for a COMPLETELY ORIGINAL plot, excellent climax, diverse and believable heroes and villians alike, great action, great characterization, and a great, surprising, shocking ending. This is a long review, but it's a long book too, so it should deserve no less. This book is worth checking into."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"From Semon's departure from the Sithi city to Prince Josua's attempt to protect himself from Elis's loyal Duke.

The heroes lose and gain more and more allies as the book goes on(some of these the reader will grow really attached toIf you want a long description of the plot you can read the back of the book and it is a good plot and story that will keep you guessing.

First of all the series is just amazing. My whole life revolved around this series! The characters become apart of you, their emotions touch you, and their world engulfs you. Tad's style of writing is nicely androgynous where there isn't too much focus on love scenes and mushy stuff (*grin*) nor is it devoid of emotion. Each character you end up loving in some way. I must say that this was my favorite book out of the whole series. His portrayl of the magickal Sithi are amazing and beautiful. I can see a resemblance to the warrior race of the Tuatha de Danann (Irish Faerie Race).Thaleia6"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"This whole series is so amazing. Unlike some popular fantasy series out now like the Wheel of Time and Sword of Truth, Memory, Sorrow and Thorn never misses a step. Actually, throughout the series it just keeps picking up steam and getting better and better. The characters are so amazing and real. The world is fully realized and detailed. The plot has so many twists and turns yet you never get lost in the threads. In this the first part of the final book, you can see many of the threads that Williams has introduced begin to come together. Many fantasy books get bogged down with too much magic, too many superheroes, and too many unbelievable events and it starts to lose its authenticity. Not so with this series. When the fantasy elements are introduced, they are truly fantastic since they are not so commonplace you feel like you are playing D&amp;D. Overall this is one of the greatest fantasy series ever written."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"This book (and the others in the series) went far beyond my expectations. I have reccommended it to all my friends. The plot was... awesome, just when you think you have the answer Tad goes along and changes it all, putting twists in that you never expected. You grow with the characters and you feel their pain when they do something really stupid or embarrasing or painfull, and you just want to give them a big hug, Yes you get THAT into it. I could not put it down until I had finished it. Loving it and waiting for more."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"This novel is one of the best books I have read, and I have read many books, most of whichare fantasy and sci-fi. To Green Angel Tower is masterfully written, and Tad Williams has done an outstanding job of making 800 pages seem like maybe 100. Thoughit is definately the longest bokk in Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, I think that it is the greatest among them!"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I was looking through the books at the library to see if I could find something that looked interesting. I found The Dragonbone chair and read it whith in five days, I was hooked and went in search of the next book in the series only to find out that it had not been publshed yet...Finally I was able to get my hands on a copy of Stone of Farewell, I was in A.I.T. in the military at the time and kept getting into trouble for reading his book instead of the military books I was supposed to be reading. after finishing that book (another masterpiece) I again went in search for the next book in the series...again not yet publshed. I finally found a copy in a local bookstore. I read the book like a madman. I have told everybody I know and now, some I don't know that this series is unbeatable, and looking at the other reviews, it seems that I am not the only one that thinks so. I would reccomend this book to anyone that likes vivid, intense books wth a storyline that blends in so well you never even notice that you have read 2485 pages(total series) and like some have written before me, unbelievably not long enough"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"Tad Williams has done it again. I could not put this immense book down. Other than having a cramp in my neck from carrying the book around I cannot think of a disadvantage to having spent a lot of time devouring this wonderful conclusion to his Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy. Keep them coming Tad and keep them long. -Rand al thor :)"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"This is one of the most outstanding books I have read. Yes, it is in the common fantasy mold, but the ending has the most wonderful little twist that will assuredly put you on your head!Characters and plot are magnificent!A most entertaining read!"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"When I first started the series, I was slightly bored with it, but a lot of the more enticing novel series are like that....I recieved &quot;The Dragonbone Chair&quot; as a gift for my 16th birthday and as soon as I finished it, I read it again. I did the same after buying &quot;Stone of Farewell&quot; and &quot;To Green Angel Tower&quot;. Tad Williams has a way with words that ranks him as one of the greatest Fantasy writers of all time. Thank you Tad!"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"This series is very well written, and more character driven than any other series that I have read in recent history (including the tedious Wheel of Time). If you want a good, thoughtfull fantasy epic rather than a hack-and-slash gore fest, try this one out. Just make sure you have several weeks open on your calendar."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I must say that I spend close to a year reading this trilogy. I'm not a fast reader, and this story kept me going until the end. The thrid book is the best by FAR. The battle is so intense that I felt I was right there with Simon. Like Saving Private Ryan, the story puts you in the middle of the battle. When I was done reading, I felt that a part of my life was over. I felt like I had lost a friend when it was over. GREAT, GREAT, GREAT."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I would like to begin by saying that I give this book four and a half stars not five. It is a good conclusion and Williams did a good job tying up loose ends but it was too long. The ending was unlike other fantasy fiction novels in the sense that for once the good guy's triumph was not inevitable and he had to be saved by someone else. A series worthy of a place on the old bookshelf."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"The story of Tad Williams' books are usually quite good, but the characters that he creates are the most annoying that I've ever seen. From their actions, to stupidity, to the annoying way that they talk, its all you can do to keep from gouging your eyes out. If you can cope with your desire to burn the book everytime you are faced with the annoying characters that you'd like to pummel with your fists if only you were there, then you may enjoy the underlying story."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I can't believe how many pick this book over The Wheel of Time series! The only other highly rated series i hate more is The Sword of Truth (books 2 to 4) because TG copies Robert Jordan, but back to Tad Williams. I though that for an epic fantasy series this book was lacking. 1600+ pages in 1 book that didn't have the proper ending that an epic should have - he didnt do anything cateclysmic (no doubt spelt wrong). Over all the series could have been better if it didnt die after 200 pages in The Dragonbone Chair."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I know a lot of people think this series is too much like Lord of the Rings, but that's part of the reason why I love it. It combines the best elements of Tolkien with much better writing. Also, there are strong female characters in the series.(Still a little weepy though, why do men think girls are constantly crying?)This book is, however, a bit dangerous. I was about half way through when I sat down to read it one day, then about seven hours later I looked at the clock realizing that not only had I forgotten to do my homework, but I had also missed two meals. I quickly fed myself, did a horrible job on my homework, and promptly returned to the book until 1am the next morning, when I collapsed in exhaustion. I literally could not put it down. I started to get the shakes even thinking about it. I never felt tired nor hungry while engrossed in this book.So, a warning to other readers, keep an eye on the time and don't forget to eat and sleep. Needless to say I was an emotional wreck when I finished the book, but it was totally worth it. I love you Tad Williams."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"Memory, Sorrow and Thorn is the best fantasy series I have ever read, toppled only by the Lord of The Rings. In the first part of the third volume, Tad Williams really begins to wrap things up, moving the characters into their final places for the ultimate battle. Simon finally gets his maturity, along with other characters who experience some pretty rough stuff. I like how everything starts to come together in this volume, however, I didnt like the fact that besides that, not a whole lot happens, and most of the book is set in one location, and one of the things I have always admired about fantasy writing is the adventures that the characters have in overcoming their struggle...well this one is more politics than adventure, although there are a few welcome surprises added to the mix...a good start to a great conclusion overall, keep reading, its worth it, believe me..."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"This series is pretty decent, though I have to admit it has taken me a long, long time to complete each book. \\"To Green Angel Tower\\" part 1 alone took over 3 months. There are, of course, the excuses of a busy life, but I know I make time for books that truly engage me. Somehow, \\"Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn\\" doesn't keep me coming back for more.The quality of writing is quite good, and the characterizations have improved immensely since book 1. Even Simon has developed into an interesting man. The battle scenes, traditionally my bugaboo with fantasy fiction, are quite well described. Simon's baptism by blood is particularly engaging.Of particular note are the development of Miriamel and Tiamak. Each character survives harrowing experiences which change them: I think one thing I appreciate about this series is that instead of just *overcoming* series of obstacles to get to a goal, Williams' characters *learn from* these experiences (and just as in real life, the lessons might not be the ones we'd like them to learn).So... Good characters, good writing, and good battles (plot, too). Why am I not engaged? Why can I not give this book 5 stars?I suppose I don't connect with the world of Osten Ard, and for no reason I can readily identify. Other readers may have a set of experiences which make this world appealing to them: I, however, don't find it nearly as rich as Martin's Westeros, or even the world of Jordan's Wheel of Time. I suppose I could equate my experience to that of reading Donaldson's Thomas Covenant books: I enjoy reading about the characters, but find the land quite bland. YMMV.Still: recommended."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"An 800-page monster comes and goes as Williams begins to converge the several plot threads to what will hopefully be a stunning conclusion. This is the first of two parts to the third book of the trilogy. Apparently Williams didn't move things along in the two prequels as quickly as he'd hoped, so there was too much to wrap up in a single book and he had to split it into two parts. I can see that; the position of Josua and the good guys looked pretty desperate at the end of Stone of Farewell. Williams takes 1600 pages or so to turn it around.This first half of that 1600 pages contains a couple pivotal moments and victories for the main characters Simon, Josua, and Miriamele. Fengbald's siege of Sesuad'ra and its dramatic resolution is probably the highlight of the novel. But other scenes suggest that the Storm King and the Norn Queen have a master plan at work that won't be disrupted much or at all by any setbacks that King Elias suffers.Certainly well written and what helps keep the pages turning is the fact that Williams is highly competent at rendering scenes in vivid detail. Yet this makes the ratio of number of pages to events unfolding quite high. So in 800 pages the plot progresses about as much as the average author would manage in perhaps 350 pages.Let's hope the final book is worth the buildup."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"Tad Williams' Memory, Sorrow, & Thorn trilogy was one of the first fantasy series I ever read and it's still one of my favorites.The writing style is very pleasant and the pace is slow enough to be savored, but characters actually accomplish things by the end of each book (you know what I mean). The characters are well-developed and loveable, but not annoyingly perfect. This is a classic epic fantasy plot: Simon the kitchen boy saves the world. But please don't roll your eyes -- this was written in the 1980's -- before it was a clich&eacute;. Even though he's now a clich&eacute;, Simon is still charming and you can't help but love him.Memory, Sorrow, & Thorn is on my list to read again, and along with Robin Hobb's Farseer Saga, it's the one I always recommend to newcomers to the genre."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I &quot;ummed and ahhed&quot; over whether to give this book 4 stars or five stars - I wish I could give it 4.5 stars. The only thing that kept it from being a definite 5 stars is the ending. But... I always said that it is the content of the book and not how it ends that counts, and I have that philosophy simply because I am hardly ever happy with the endings of books or series, and I have decided against letting that ruin my view of the work. (The only ending I ever liked for a series was the Coldfire Trilogy, but then again I have started way more series than I have finished).The problem with the ending (hopefully without giving anything away here--) is that it was too easy. I was actually starting to think that they were actually going to lose to the Storm King. It seemed impossible to defeat him, but then it was so easy - too easy, I just don't buy it.With that being said - I loved the book, best I've read in a while. I have been reading the series since February (It is now the beginning of October), but it only took me three weeks to read &quot;To Green Angel Tower&quot; (I lugged that massive book everywhere with me ;) The series starts off very slow, but it actually picks up in this novel, as if Williams realizes that he has too much to say in too little space (he shouldn't have wasted so much paper on the first two books).If you are reading the first or second book, and wondering if you should continue, yes, you should, it is worth the read! (If not the ending)."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I must say...all three of these book are the best books I have ever read in my life. To Green Angel Tower is the best of the three (if there can be such a thing) But you would expect that being that it is the final book of the trilogy! The character development, sub-plots, forshadowing, and main plot all work together to create a wonderful trilogy. And his attention to detail is extravagant! He doesnt ignore ANY of the characters. And he creates so much suspense by switching to a different character RIGHT as something good is happening to another character...and by the time you get back to the first story...its out of your mind because of the excitment he has created with the other characters! I definately (sp) recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story!"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"After finally finishing Memory, Sorrow and Thorn, I conclude that Mr. Williams is a very talented writer.His story contains many elements that are far too familiar in high fantasy today, such as a humble kid out to save the world, a race of powerful immortal elf-like beings, a great evil poised on the edge of destroying the world, a strong willed runaway princess etc. However Williams gives the clich&eacute;s fresh twists that make them his own. The result is a deeper more thoughtful tale than the works of most contemporary fantasy authors.Other positives include-The characterization- though Mr. Williams juggles a myriad of different characters he succeeds in making them separate and distinct from one another-especially in dialogue.His adolescent protagonists- Miramelle and Simon act exactly like what they are - teenagers. It's a common mistake in fantasy stories to make the young people act either ridiculously stupid and nave or uncommonly intelligent and brave. Williams creates a more realistic blend in the coming-of-age element to his story.The dream sequences- I have never read such disturbing and powerful dream sequences. Dreams can be very dull to read about but in Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn they compose some of the most compelling parts of the trilogy.However, Williams has a terrible problem with pacing. His books are excruciatingly detailed and rarely skip over or narrate anything. This makes for a highly realistic approach, but a tedious read.Finally during the last two hundred pages of this last book, To Green Angel Tower, things begin to pick up. At last it transformed into the kind of gut-wrenching action-packed reading I couldn't put down (after all, I had been waiting for thousands of pages).A lot of the mysteries and puzzles are answered at last in the final chapters of the book. However, it's been so long since the original prophesy or hint that it almost seems too late to finish them up by cramming them togther at the end of the novel.Also though the final confrontation with the Storm King was full of sound and fury, the resolution was astonishingly quick and simple. I won't spoil the ending, but it was remarkable that no one planned for or foresaw the possibility of such an event taking place. This leap in logic was disappointing and uncharacteristic of the rest of the books.Overall, I enjoyed the series and I'm glad I read it, but I can't help but wonder how much sharper and more powerful the trilogy would be, had a more stringent editor gotten his hands on it. If you're a patient reader and enjoy spending months investing yourself in the characters and world of a story, then these are the books for you. Everyone else might want to steer clear and pick up something shorter."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I am trying to read the LOTR trilogy, but am finding it somewhat difficult because it is pure fantasy in the sense that it is about races other than our own: hobbits and dwarves and the like. It makes for entertaining read but I miss the shared involvement I got when reading these books by Tad Williams. I loved the Memory, Sorrow and Thorn trilogy because the writing was truly superb, and classical. The description of Osten Ard was real and provocative. When I think of To Green Angel Tower, I can feel the cold air of the unending winter brought upon by the Storm King, and I can see the delicately wrought Green Angel Tower, and the hidden halls that Maegwin discovered, and the ragged rebel army gathered on the Stone of Farewell, the parting place of the legendary Sithi and Norns, cheering and making merry for each small victory. I loved Tad Williams' characterizations most of all. Each of his characters were individuals, leaving a different imprint on mind and heart, and easily brought to life due to the excellency of its drawing. Scholarly, defeated Prince Joshua, not understood by his honest followers, with his odd sense of humor and his strong ethics. Simon the former scullion, still full of ideals and a strange mix of experience and unexpected-humble- wisdom. More than the usual &quot;naive hero&quot;. But there are too many characters to get into detail. There is Miriamele, the runaway princess who has grown painfully during her adventures, Cadrach, her companion, a false monk who has connections to the League of the Scroll, and lost his faith in all, Binabik, a little mountain troll of surprising knowledge, who is utterly adorable and rides a tame wolf, Duke Isgrimnur, of a Viking-like clan, cutting off pagan oaths for his newer religion adopted when he served the great Prester John, Sithi Prince Jiriki and his sister Aditu, the young of an ancient fey, with a fascinatingly bizarre manner, and Tiamak, an educated, determined small swamp man who lives in the backwater marshes and holds a key to the Leagues' mystery, and Maegwin, struggling daughter of a dead cheiftain, ruler of a broken, noble people, and Vorsheva, a vivid, fiery, brave woman, and Elias, the weakened tyrant king, lost in his own sorrows, wanting desperately that which he has lost (his dead wife), slowly being ruined by his sorcerous, hairless, scarlet-robed advisor Pyrates. And of course many many more! If you want high fantasy, a richly detailed world with a history that incorporates our legends, and a magic that is not raw power blazing out of finger tips, but a mystic touch and a boundless imagination, then you really must read these books. It starts with the Dragonbone Chair, goes on with the Stone of Farewell and ends here, To Green Angel Tower. If you have already read the other books then read this one too, and don't let the huge size stop you! Unlike Robert Jordan and sadly many other fantasy authors, Tad Williams is forever going forwards, maturing his characters and covering vast chapters of quest, making his every word worthwhile (and this is the biggest book he has written yet). So don't hesitate if you want something classical, but full of human emotions, and delight in a finely crafted tale."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"&quot;To Green Angel Tower&quot; is the culmination of what I consider the best fantasy series by a living author. He has created a world as fascinating and detailed as Tolkein's, blending European history and mythology into a seamless whole that creates a land both familiar and strange. His bad guys are every bit as creepy as anything I've read, and the hero has just the right blend of courage and confusion to make him utterly believable. If you haven't yet discovered Tad Williams, you owe it to yourself!One word of advice - buy the whole third book in the hardcover if you can - they had to split the paperback version up into two parts, which is awkward."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"One thing that kind of irks me about this trilogy is it is really a four part book series. The first two books are fine; then you come to this one. If you notice at the bottom of the title, it says Part 1. Yes, there is a part two, and it is actually longer than this book. Talk about contrived, this book series is a beautiful example of people running off to various places with much ado about nothing (with apologies to Shakespeare). The author has a number of characters running around chasing down various things, much of which is useless in the context of the main plot. Simon, the main character, shares a lot of time with other characters, the princess, and Prince Joshua, amongst others. I'm afraid shallow is the main word that comes to my mind when I think of this series."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"Absolutely rivetting! I lost a lot of sleep because I could not put the book down! Very well written with an amazing group of characters and histories."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"To Green Angel Tower part 1 is an action packed ride centered around a battle between the king's army and a ragtag band of survivors. Stone of Farewell saw the characters trying to discover a place of sanctuary to escape an oncoming storm and showed us a society in a summer paradise untouched by the omnipresent winter. This book sees all that plunge straight into chaos.At the beginning Snowlock has just returned from his adventures in the north and the detours he took along the way and meets up with Josua and company. After a good bit of planning, scouting and preparation, the people of Sesuad'ra under Josua are forced to make a last stand against an approaching army. As they're undermanned and overwhelmed, things aren't looking too good for the survivors.Tad Williams does an excellent job of keeping things realistic on this front. This is no romantic depiction of war: it's bloody and extremely violent, loud, chaotic, and repulsive -- like stepping into hell on earth -- and good doesn't automatically triumph against evil. And Tad's writing here covers these descriptions of this hell as fluently as he did that of the summer paradise of Jao &eacute;-Tinukai'i. He also throws in a few surprising twists with this battle and the Sithi, not to mention there's a few shocking deaths. It's all extremely well done.Miri's story in the south also concludes in this volume. Without getting into it too much, it's suffice to say that some of the weirdest events in the story take place there, though it was very good overall. In the end, everything is concluded in a satisfying manner and there's even some downtime at the end for a few mysteries of the plot to be solved.5/5 for this book and the series as a whole."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"Part 1 of the final book in Tad Williams' epic series Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn is another mixed bag. Unfortunately, for the first time in the series, the negatives outweigh the positives.The good news is that Williams' prose continues to improve. The writing is fairly crisp and the imagery is stunning. Unfortunately, the editing is still hideous. I won't even repeat it here, but you can read my reviews of the first two books.The book's biggest strength is its characterization of Simon. Now a full knight under the renegade Prince Josua, Sir Seoman finally begins growing into the hero that Williams has been grooming for two books. He takes part in the epic battle at the Stone of Farewell, showing himself a skillful warrior and leader. The horrors of combat bring stark contrast to the starry-eyed dreams of Simon from the first book. As others around Simon begin respecting him more, so do we the readers begin to see him growing into his knighthood.And then Williams has to completely ruin it by having Simon make a stupid, rash decision in the last few pages of the book. It doesn't completely break character, but it runs totally counter to Simon's development that Williams has been so meticulously building. It's infuriating.Miriamele's tale is a practice in dichotomy. Her character development is quite good. I was pleasantly surprised at the adult nature of her journey aboard the Earl Aspitis' ship, the personal torture she goes through as she wrestles with his advances.Unfortunately, her plot line is mired in vast amounts of tedious travelogue. While her characterization is great, the only real purpose that her plot line serves to the overall narrative is to bring the heroic knight Camaris into the fold. For hundreds of pages of traveling, that seems like a very small payoff, and when she is finally reunited with her friends at the Stone of Farewell, I found myself asking, \\"Ok, so what was that all about?\\"Truth be told, I will finish this series and get the 2nd volume of book three. However, if this had been the first or second book in the series, I would not be finishing it."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"Was received in good shape. Was shipped wothin expected time.

The ending is very clever and worth all the praise for the series, it has that Holy crap moment that just blows you away. I highly recommend this Trilogy."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I'm still not through it. I bought the entire trilogy in June, spent 2 weeks reading for 4 hours a day back then, it's August 4th and I've not been able to finish it, I eventually got burnt out on the sheer volume of it.It is an awesome story though, and you'll find yourself immersed in it for quite some time.This is really another 2 3/4ths a book.Oh? On the content?He drags on and introduces too many new places/people too quickly. I'm 100 pages from the end and wondering how he's going to wrap it all up gracefully, am not sure he can. He has too many subplots open."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"Williams's novel has familiarity, but look at this way. There are movies out there that have a familiar story but the acting is great. That is this novel. The story may move along slowly but this allows the charcters to become more developed and permits multiple points of view. Yet, with most mainstream movies, studios get involved and demand a \\"happy ending\\" that seems forced to please the audience. This book seems to do the same thing. It appeared that 20 pages or so were added to create this \\"happy ending\\"I loved this series and this would be a movie I would like to see again.If you like classice fantasy then this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"This is the first half of the final book in the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy. Not being intended as a stand-alone book, it ends without any sort of conclusive note, leaving you with a burning desire to immediately pick up the next (and final) volume. That being said, this book is still great. Much better than the previous one, STONE OF FAREWELL. The story actually progresses nicely here, with events escalating and coming together for what should be a highly exciting finish.This book is primarily one of triumph for the heroes of the story. Josua and Company defend Sesuadr'a with the help of some unexpected allies, Princess Miriamele finally finds her way to safety, and Simon becomes Sir Seoman Snowlock, defender of the realm. All of these happenings involve grand adventure and harrowing exploits that make this book fast-paced and exciting. With nearly all of the character building completed in the first two volumes, Williams is now able to focus on developing the overall story. In fact, so much happens to build up the plot and prime the coming confrontation between good and evil in this first part of the last book, that I am quite sure the conclusion will be intensely fulfilling.I'm surprised by some of the other reviewers claiming to be bored by this installment, as I thought it was the best of the series up to this point. With the great characters of the series finally seeing some signs of success, and extremely compelling mysteries being slowly unveiled, this beautiful setting that Williams has created sees its full potential. I'm not saying that every single book that Tad has ever written couldn't be edited down somewhat, but this one is far better than most.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"To Green Angel Tower concludes the tale set in the fictional world of Osten Ard.As the evil minions of the undead Sithi Storm King prepare for the kingdom-shattering culmination of their dark sorceries and King Elias is drawn ever deeper into their nightmarish, spell-spun world, the loyal allies of Prince Josua desperately struggle to rally their forces at The Stone of Farewell. And with time running out, the remaining members of the now-devastated League of the Scroll have also gathered there to unravel mysteries from the forgotten past. For if the League can reclaim these age-old secrets of magic long-buried beneath the dusts of time, they may be able to reveal to Josua and his army the only means of striking down the unslayable foe.But whether or not the League is successful in its quest, the call of battle will lead the valiant followers of Josua Lackhand across storm tossed seas brimming with bloodthirsty kilpa, through forests swarming with those both mind- and soul-lost, through ancient caverns built by legendary Dwarrows and to the haunted halls of Asu'a itself--the Sithi's greatest stronghold, and now the seat of mankind's power in Osten Ard."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"This book kept me hooked till the very end..

It is a good book from kids of 12, to adult of 40. It is the best book someone can read if they want a fantisy, action book, but you must read the books in order, first; The Dragon Bone Chair, then, Stone Of Fairewell, and finaly To Green Angle Tower. Williams is a very imaginative author, making his books very interesting, and fun."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"As far as I can see, the quality of this entire series is beyond my power with words to describe in the time that I have. It combines hope, sorrow, horror, and anger in an incredible tapestry of detail and plot. I agree with some readers that the pace seemed a little rushed near the end, but I imagine that the publisher would have been rather upset if it had been much longer...and this story isnt longer than originally intended because of its author lacks skill, its longer because it evolved, just like the world it describes. Everything in it is interelated, and I have read few fictional books that have developed their characters better (How can anyone say they are cardboard thin!? ) and I have read a lot of fantasy books in my time. Only objections: rushed ending, author's style of closure, and to anyone who thinks Robert Jordan is a better author (alright, I guess you're entitled to an opinion too). AND DO NOT READ THESE BOOKS OUT OF ORDER"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"Indeed Tad Williams has written a series so unique that it is almost difficult to follow for readers of traditional Fantasy. An enthralling series that is not comparable with any other. In my opinion, one of the top storytellers of today, with one of the most real epic fantasy's of all time."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"When I started this series I didn't expect much from it. Boy how wrong I was. This was a great story. But it was so much more as well. The depth of his characters, the strenght of his ideas, the power and depth of his symbalism make this a truely profound read. Not just a great work of fantasy, but of literature as well."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I read this book in 5 days simply because I could not put it down.

I would like to thank Tad Williams for saving our little corner of the universe."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I love this series! I finished Book 3 in 15 days, and 7 days for The Dragonbone Chair. I often feel like I am in the book, running, laughing, crying and eating with the characters. If you have't read this, DO!! This is my most favorite saga ever, and I read TONS of fantasy!"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"To Green Angel Tower is a terrific ending to a great fantasy series. I read Fantasy novels religiously, and I can tell you that Tolkien himself would have been proud to have written this. Sure, it's derivative in its way. It's even almost predictable. But the characters are so engaging (and for ANY Fantasy to work, characters, and not setting, must come first) you won't care. The only other work I've read in the last decade that compares is Tigana, by Guy Gavriel Kay. In this novel (split into two books for the paperback version - it's just so thick) Simon the scullion boy becomes a man, Princess Miriamele comfronts her father, King Elias, and his evil, and the monk Cadrach reveals his secrets. With a cast of hundreds, this series is as sweeping as any Doctor Zhivago or Gone With The Wind. In fact, it would be easier to compare this work to those, rather than Lord of the Rings. People who aren't fans of Fantasy would actually do better to pick this series up FIRST, before LOTR. Yes, you heard me correctly. LOTR is the greatest Fantasy work ever written, but more people could actually relate to the themes of MST. Everyone grows up, and there are not many stories about Rites of Passage that are as good as this one. If you are a Fantasy fan and haven't read this series, you're missing out. Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"When I started this series, I had no idea what I was getting in to. The sheer amount of content was amazing, but at no time did the series lag. Every scene was needed and I never felt like it was dragging on. I would recommend this book to anyone who has the time to read it...they will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I have been a huge fan of this series. The story gets 5 stars, easy. However, it drives me crazy when publishers release a series on the Kindle and don't release the entire series. Even more crazy is to release the last book first!If the publishers (and Amazon) truly want e-books to become a viable market, please provide releases of the full series and, even more importantly, make sure it is a good quality translation. Nothing says you're being treated as a 2nd class citizen more than the feeling that the book was just pulled off the shelf, scanned (with numerous typos, no book cover or maps) and slapped onto the Kindle bookstore."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I found the first book overly detailed and long winded, I found myself skimming pages and pages...I struggled with the decision of continuing with the series or not after that first book...I should have backed out. I read a lot and love long books and have read many long series. I have little tolerence for details so am used to skimming some parts when I find there are too much and I don't have a problem with that (and no I am not simple minded - I actually have a healthy IQ, I am not scared of long books and I am not the poor victim of the fast food era that cannot wait for gratification). I must say that on a detail continuum this author is way way on the extreme side...G.G.Kay, Tolkien and others aren't shy on details either but never to this extent... Everything does not have to be described to death...When one idea is introduced, we could expect the the completion of that idea in about fifty pages...and often, these same explanations are given later by another character from their perspective.This is a preference and I know that a lot of people enjoy a lot of details. So if you don't like too much details, you may want to skip this series...I feel I have lost much precious reading time.Maybe this would have been a 3 or 4 star story for me if it would not have been lost in waste."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"Although the size of this book may be daunting to some, and Williams' style discouraging (to those of limited intellect who prefer writing that does not &quot;waste time&quot; on anything not key to the movment of the story), this is a very satisfying novel in every sense, and one of the great works of fantasy. I will not give it a perfect five stars, however (there are few books I have read that would deserve such a rating), but, if it was possible, 4.5; it nears greatness, and almost achieves it. But not quite. I enjoyed the entire book, but there were the occasional bits that could have been reworked. The size of the novel did not bother me in the slightest; in fact, I wish more writers would cover such an amazing scope. Only in a thousand and more pages could such a story be adequately told. I also enjoy Williams' style immensely. He spends the time to fully describe each passage; it is not, as some have suggested, useless detail. It is necessary. The only ! thing I object to is the familiar theme of, it seems, much American fantasy; that of the commoner rising from nothing to achieve greatness. Although the descendant of a past king, Simon makes a speech towards the end about a commoner's blood being just as red as a nobleman's. It is that speech alone, perhaps, that forces me to withold that final star. Over all, however, I found &quot;To Green Angel Tower&quot; to be a wonderfully imaginative, entertaining conclusion to a great trilogy."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I,v read alot of complaining that the trilogy was rushed and long winded. That Williams &quot;bit of more than he could chew&quot;and others,the books were a prime example of a large, knowlegable mind. He described the characters well and the ongoing subplots kept me reading till the morning hours.I wished that the adventure would never stop and that the conclusion would take another book. His fantasy writing style has no comparison to Tolkien,Jordon or Brooks,his writing is not better or worse than anyone else it's strikly HIS, just as the three writers I mentioned have there very own style of writing.So complainers, read the trilogy again and find out what I mean."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"Simon is tall. Joshua broods. Now you can skip about 400 pages. I thought the series was picking up after Stone of Farewell, which was pretty decent. I was the more deceived. The author is simply killing trees here. I would almost recommend just skipping to Part 2 and reading the synopsis of Part 1. You won't miss anything."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"The Dragonbone Chair was 1/2 snooze fest 1/2 o.k. Stone of Farewell was a vast improvement and really got me hooked into the story. It only gets better with this one and continues on thru the final book. A definate must read series in my opinion."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"This is really a general review of the series as a whole. First of all, it is great! Any fan of fantasy will love these books. Unfortunately I can't give it five stars, because the leangth of the books is not justified."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"This epic is indeed one of staggering proportions. Staggering to carry, at a hefty 1083 pages in its hardcover edition. Staggering proportions: so many characters, so little characterization. So much &quot;plot&quot;, so little origionality. So many pages, so little worth reading!!The trouble with this series is that Williams has overreached himself. This tries to take on too grand a scale, leaving us frustrated as we skip from subplot to subplot. The characters are like cardboard, with institutionalized reactions and unispired speech. The author is a good one, proved by his well-written TAILCHASER'S SONG, but he has bitten off more than he can chew here. Well I hope for more product from this worthwhile author, perhaps he can take to heart his words &quot;The Bloated Epic&quot; and &quot;The Story That Ate My Life&quot;. Guess what? It ate ours, too!!"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I read it a while back.Book 2 was well written and built up the conflict. The names were as inspiring as those employed by Tolkein.To Green Angel Tower felt ponderous, meandering, and poorly paced. The chapters where Simon were tortured were more painful for the reader. The romance between Simon and the lead female was not believable. By the end, I didn't like any of the main characters.Overall, it was flaccid."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"Simon, Prince Joshua and Simon's old friend Binabik, the troll realisethere is a bit more to all of this fancy sword business than meets theeye. There are actually three of these fanastic artifacts, and one ofthem had been somewhere obvious all along. The old beaten up sword ofKing John is actually one of them, Doh.4 out of 5 (1 out of 5 for georestrictions)"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"This has to be the best series i have ever read. Highly imaginitive cultures, well developed characters, legends within the story, tons of battles, interesting dialogue, and one of the best twist endings ever written. This was a series I could barely put down. I spent most of my waking hours either reading it or thinking about it, trying to figure out how it might turn out. I read it as fast as I could, because I couldnt wait to see how it ended, yet once I finished it I wished that there was more. It was probably the most unpredictable story I have ever read. I highly recommend the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy to anyone."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"Is it any wonder that Tad Williams is compared to JRR Tolkien? I mean, look at the description and the characterization of To Green Angel Tower and the other books as well. The characters are all three-dimensional - for example, Simon. He's had all that experience with battles on Sesuad'ra and on Urmsheim and has really learned from them. Or Miriamele. She loves her father so much, but she is strong enough to have her own opinions and travel the world to find someone to special enough to share her experiences. I also love the way Williams describes the Sithi. They aren't elves, dwarves, or wizards, they're somewhere in between. They have magic but it's a special kind that you don't usually find in run-of-the-mill fantasy novels. This book is a wonderful example of creativity and a relief from the usual &quot;good vs. evil&quot; saga."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"This book was wonderful; the conflict is perfectly believable, characters all have pasts, futures and all are important. There are no throwaway characters, just to fill up the ranks. Everyone has a distinct personality. The battle between good and evil is a real struggle, not just a predictable nothing. The &quot;bad&quot; guys have as much personality as the &quot;good.&quot; They are all complex individuals. One of the death scenes was that of my favorite character. I actually went through the five psychological stages of coping with death (denial, anger, etc.) When I finished the book, I felt angry I had to leave the world. That has never happened with any other book."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"There are few books in the history of fantasy novels that parallel Tad Williams' &quot;Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn&quot; trilogy. In a time where fantasy writing has been reduced to the application of time-tested but lazy formulae, Williams takes a turn for the epic and produces a work of such scale and depth it can only be rivalled by the genre's patriarch, J.R.R. Tolkien. In this final installment, Williams continues to demonstrate the literary quality which has created such a devoted following. As events in the world of Osten Ard build to a Homeric scale, Williams' characters remain so thoroughly real and personal that keeping up with the staggering number of plotlines becomes an easy task. Throughout the volume, Williams moves the plot from a cluster of personal conflicts to a climax of global proportions, and does so with such a master's touch that the novel's conclusion is satisfying in every possible way. A phenomenal conclusion to a most unique and remarkable trilogy."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I was not planning to offer my comments about this publication, but the review posted on April 30th of 1998 unintentionally makes a good point which needs further explication.The review implies that the critic began this final volume without reading its predecessors, and consequently felt overwhelmed. I would urge readers to read the first two works prior to the final volume. The simple actions and dialogue that appear in To Green Angel Tower are augmented by nearly 2000 pages of prior development; each page is a revelation to the reader, a progression that crackles with tension. To begin with this book would be overwhelming indeed. Start where the story starts--The Dragon Bone Chair, which you can buy right now at this site. Do not, however, begin here and ruin one the greatest potential literary experiences a reader could hope to encounter."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I picked up the books in this series not expecting a profound experience but simply an enjoyable adventure. The story is good and parts are quite creative, although it borrows heavily from Tolkien (Elves are called Sithi, Hobbits are Trolls, the Sithi are immortals who are dying out and came from a faraway land, lots of Tolkien here.) I think the series would have benefitted from a lot of editing - Williams drags on far too long with many scenes. There characters are rather shallow and sometimes hard to believe. One moment they're intelligent, the next they miss the obvious. I became rather tired of them bursting into tears every ten pages. Nearly every character would freeze in terror when some danger faced them. These would all be fine, but when Williams uses the same reaction for every character and repeats it ad naseum, one grows a little tired of it. One of the other reviews here thought that the best thing about the book was that the depictions of the characters on the covers matched their descriptions in the book. Heh. If it's covers that are important to you, enjoy! Otherwise, spend your time and money on other books. There are many better ones than this."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"\\"To Green Angel Tower, Part 1\\" begins the two-part conclusion to \\"Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn\\" series and follows all the characters plus a few of the more mysterious characters. The author's brilliant writing compliments gripping action and ideas with thorough expression of emotional and physical exertion.Simon matures significantly, presenting a marked improvement from the initial installment. But the greatest element has got to be the impact and influence of the legendary Camaris. His unwitting contribution as a humble yet awe-inspiring figure provides Simon a persuasive standard by which to improve as an individual. Unfortunately as a counterpoint, Miriamele's lacking maturity and responsibility diminishes her character potential. Her decision at the novel's end, even if true to character and somewhat honorable, is a surprise given one would think she has learned her lesson from prior exploits.While at times seeming long, the storyline blends the many cultures smoothly and rarely offers a dull moment. More is revealed connecting the history between the humans, Sithi, and Norns at a practical pace.Sufficiently detailed maps precede both of the two sections relating to Prince Josua's military position. Conventional characters and races inhabit the vivid realm, such as the Sithi or Fair Folk containing Tolkien's Elven traits and mannerisms. The great assortment of royal characters might leave one hoping for a more comprehensive appendix, perhaps a section in alphabetical order or with a genealogical chart.I highly recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"Tad Williams' Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn series is certainly derivative. A young scullion with dreams of grandeur finds himself embroiled in an epic struggle to save the land of Osten Ard from the dreaded Storm King... Stop me if you've heard this before. Even so, \\"The Dragon Bone Chair\\" (book one in the so-called four book \`trilogy'), was a compelling return to the undying genre of high fantasy, and fueled my interest in the series that ultimately lead me to the second offering, \\"The Stone of Farewell\\" - a book that was slow, ponderous, and anti-climactic. \\"To Green Angel Tower: Part 1\\" is an improvement over the middle volume, but might have been equally disappointing were it not for the later chapters.This book moves at a glacial pace that's unfortunate. If you found \\"The Stone of Farewell\\" to be unexciting, but you've decided to persevere, then the first portion of this follow-up will have you second guessing your decision. Very little happens of any consequence, and many subplots are pointlessly integrated into a story that sometimes forgets its true goal, and its true nemesis. One particular adventure, which sees some of our heroes rescuing a friend from an insect-like menace, is overwrought, overlong, and underwhelming. Though this \\"side quest,\\" so to speak, does have a minute connection to the Storm King at the heart of the story, it's thin at best and serves as nothing if not filler. This is but one example of Williams' divergence from what's important, and what keeps his readers... well, reading.Passionless as the first chunk of this thickset tome is, it finally recaptures the urgency of book one as it progresses into the latter chapters - and it's a very welcome thing, because the world of Osten Ard is a beautifully conceived and richly textured place, and the threat of the Storm King is suitably menacing and ominous. Even better, many of the novel's characters grow into maturity (literally as well as figuratively). Eolair, who before seemed like just another waste of space, comes into his own as a living, breathing, and ultimately likable character. Miriamele stops behaving as a spoiled brat, and actually begins to grow into a woman. The main character, Simon, even gets a bit more relatable, though I still cannot help but wish someone else was the hero of the story. Even knighted, he still behaves as a nave, whiny child. Still, Jiriki, Aditu, Binabik, and Isgrimnur are as likable as ever, and Camaris takes a pleasant turn as well - even if he displays an implausible recovery from that which plagues him.As a whole, the negatives and positives make \\"To Green Angel Tower: Part 1\\" a decent read, and nothing more. Too often this is a bit of a \`skimmer,' where you can leap and bound over several paragraphs and miss absolutely nothing of significance. Then again, as you progress things improve so dramatically that you'll want to pour over each and every word. Despite suffering from too much filler, and sometimes too little character building, this belongs to a series that could have been a classic were it not for its poor, uneven pacing. Still, the series is good and surprisingly well-written, and stands out in an overcrowded genre. If the dull moments ultimately lead to the joy of the exciting ones, then I say it's worth the price."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"This is is one of my favorite all-time books. What Williams lacks in originality he makes up for in the intricasies of this plot (or plots as you will discover.) This is no mere story, it is the twisting, weaving, and intertwining of several small stories that rivals even Tolkien in detail. It is this intertwining that is one of the major themes of the book. This is a wonderful series to read if you have a couple of weeks (or months). The best points of the book: 1. The best bad guy around. (pryrates is perhaps the slimiest bad guy ever) 2. Politics, conflict, age-old hatreds, stereotypes, and religion, in perfect detail. (all of these lacking in the lord of the rings) 3. A great climax with just enough explanation at the end to keep you wondering, &quot;well what about...&quot; 4. Magic is not used blatantly as in most fantasy, but is more subtle and &quot;art&quot;istic. 5. Seoman. (In the true spirit of Taran from Lloyd Alexander's series) 6. The little sayings of the Quanc &quot;Winter is not being the time for naked swimming&quot;, etc."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"Tad Williams does not write series, he writes 5000 page novels that the publisher simply chooses to break up into three of four parts. Memory, Sorrow and Thorn is a compentent and often compelling novel with a few memorable characters, and well developed world.The main problem with this book is that the world that Williams creates stoped developing and coming up with new suprises after the first book. To key to keeping a good fantasy series going is much the same a planning a good vacation. The fun is not so much in what you do, but in living and seeing the different lifestyles in the cities you visit. The culture of the characters was suprisingly monotone, and to make it worse the mythology behind the story was weak. Sorry, but the storm king couldn't make it anywhere near my fireside storytelling list.I give this series three stars because of the good characters and the often compelling trials that they are put through. But ultimately the book draged too much for me to give it any better."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"One thing can definitely be said for Tad Williams: in comparison to other fantasy writers, who start big and then peter out, his writing improves in leaps and bounds with each passing work. All the threads he wove together so cleverly, beginning with 'The Dragonbone Chair' and continuing in 'Stone of Farewell', are revealed to their fullest extent in this majestic conclusion. Typical fantasy this is not. Throw your predictions out the window when you read this series--Tad knows cliches when he sees them, and avoids them masterfully until the very end.Toward the end, the story begins to take on the quality of a lush piece of music: marching in ever-twining threads which like strains of melody, spiral upward, constantly adding new threads of power and beauty whenever the tune starts to become familiar. There are moments so moving that they are transcendant, and so imaginative that one is tempted to predict that this is an epic that will last after many others have faded with the years.The characters only get better, Simon in particular, who literally goes to hell and back. Tad Williams does not put his hero to minor tests and allow him to earn his status as the hero with the swing of a sword; rather, like Winston Churchill, he demands &quot;blood and toil, tears and sweat&quot; in relentless profusion. Yet rather than being an orgy in pain and suffering, the story is uplifting in its depiction of boy who begins as 'ordinary', and in overcoming tremendous suffering and tests of courage, becomes a hero worthy of the name.There are some drawbacks to this otherwise perfect book. For one thing, Tad Williams is lacking in his portrayal of women, primarily Miriamele and Vorzheva. The latter is constantly whining and irredeemably selfish--it's difficult to understand how a great guy like Josua got stuck with her, let alone risked his life for her sake. The fact that the author is obviously in love with her does not make liking her any easier.Miriamele is well-realized character, but toward the end she becomes sulky, and the problems that exist in her relationship with Simon are never resolved, let alone discussed, since any such discussion deteriorates into cuddling. This makes the abrupt resolution of their relationship at the end hard to swallow--so they slept together. Maybe it'll put off their problems for a night--but what about the rest of their lives?I also thought that some very dramatic events at the end should not have been narrated by Tiamak after the fact--it took away any sense of immediacy, and belittled the importance of Cadrach's wrenching sacrifice.Other than that, though, what is there to say? This is an epic that actually lives up to its length and delivers. The author obviously knew where he was going from page one, and his intent drives the story home by the end with stunning power. Not by any means a light read--but deep and immensely satisfying."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I'll try to keep this short, yet still explain the multitude of reasons why you should (wil) buy this book. I am a student of biochemistry, and reading (everything i get my hands on) is my most important past time. The first time I read this series I read it in German (I live in Austria). Since then I have bought the English Paperback Version of all books, read it one more time in german, and three times in English; and now plan to buy the hardcover books (only few books get the &quot;hardcover award&quot; from me, since I couldn't afford it else - Lord of the Ring has, so do the Simarillion and LOTR, as well as a book about the roman law and its development until today...). Bought three times, read 5 times.....within 7 years... Anyway the whole series is ended with this book, wich in itself is as long as the previous two. The pace gets faster, the story more tense, the characters develop and are finally taking action themselves, the plot finally gets solved (...), a love story developing, a happy-end with a slightly bitter taste, you may dwell on the world you have grown to love on 1600 more pages. Problem is: it's too short! (whine, whine, i wan't more) Of course it isn't the perfect story/book. But that is as good as they get. Trust me-READ THIS BOOK. I'd be proud of you....(probably doesn't help you in any way, but still)"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"Unoriginal, boring, long winded? Unfortunately, we live in an &quot;instant&quot; society, instant gratification, instant highs, instant food, if something lasts for longer than an instant, we've been trained to find it boring. Fashions come and go in a year, sales are always high as we strive to be &quot;un-boring&quot;, movies must perpetually keep viewers on the edge of their seat... That's why I read. &quot;The book is better than the movie&quot; syndrome occurs around 85% of the time, usually because the story as presented in the book is too slow, can't be packed into 2 hours, etc. This gives the movie a rushed, unfinished and undetailed impression, in comparison to the book. If you prefer movies to books, then this series is not for you. Unfortunately, however, this &quot;perpetual action&quot; syndrome has crept into literature, fantasy being no exception. Writers must churn out one pulp novel per year, keeping books to a healthy length and be madly full of action at every turn to gratify the baser whims of the less sophisticated readers. Tad Williams put a lot into this trilogy, more than his publishers anticipated when the work ran sorely overtime, more than the readers expected when we hassled the local bookshop for news of release dates, all in the name of art. If you want heads rolling, magic flying, a formula being strictly adhered to and a stock-standard cast of non-complex characters wandering around aimlessly and killing trolls, then this series is not for you. Tolkien wrote of a dragon, elves, small men, trolls, treasure, magical artifacts, rites of passage and a journey - so did many other authors. Are all works of fantasy to be compared to his? Yes, he was brilliant! Yes, he was original, but are all works of fantasy to be labeled &quot;unoriginal&quot; because they use an element of his work? It is almost impossible to name five works of fantasy since that don't contain any common element with Tolkien. So too with all writers hence, must a new book necessarily be judged in the light of all works preceding it, some small-minded critic not tolerating a common element or two with another work? We might as well cease reading. &quot;There is nothing new under the sun&quot;, but sometimes a great story rips us off our seats and plunges us into an intricate and ALIVE world, spun from the imagination and rhetoric of the author, history, previously read works, current affairs, dreams and aspirations. This is one such series, and I can not recommend it strongly enough to any who would appreciate what is one of the most intricately woven and spellbinding trilogies set in a fantasy world. The momentum of fifteen hundred pages of pure art sweeps the reader of their feet and carries them through to the spectacular ending. When I awoke from this saga, I felt as if I'd woken from a pleasant dream."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"Yes, I have read LOTR, but i consider this better than that overall, though nothing can compete with LOTR history. Memory Soorw and Thorn by Tad Williams is a masterpiece. It's world and the charecters that call it home are totally believable. Everything about the story speaks at so many levels that I know that I will reread this series many times. There is no way that I can explain the book in under a thousand words. He takes many stereotypes and completly breaks them. Without ruining the story, all i can say is that by the end, I felt sorry for the storm king. Also, there is a twist that occurs at the end of this book, that puts the previous pages in a new light. if you are a fan of epic fantasy, or personal conflict, this series covers both and so much more."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"To Green Angel Tower: Siege is the third volume in Memory, Sorrow and Thorn (started with The Dragonbone Chair and The Stone of Farewell, and ending with To Green Angel Tower: Storm).After meeting with Josua's party and exiles from the plains on Sesuad'ra, the Stone of Farewell, Simon is knighted by the prince for having recovered the legendary sword Thorn. But soon they learn that Josua's brother, the High-King Elias, has sent an army led by Duke Fengbald.They have to prepare for a desperate war. With a makeshift army of exiles, and even with the unexpected help from the trolls, they know they'll be greatlty outnumbered.To the south, Princess Miriamele, pretending she's daughter of a minor nobleman, has unwillingly given in to Lord Apsitis. He soon tells her he knows her true identity and plans to marry her, for political purposes. She'll have to escape.In this book, Tad Williams manages to keep us reading avidly without revealing too much of the final plot, digging deeper into each character's personality, making them seem so real. I just can't wait to read the next and last one!"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"This is really getting scary. I have read Jordan's WOT series from a recommodation from my brother, grabbed The Sword of Truth of of the shelf at random, and then later found out it was like WOT, and now I found this book by mistake, and it, too, is liked by readers of WOT! I'm getting scared. Anyway, the library by my house is terrible, and like always, they get the last in the series before the first. I read To Green Angel Tower before the Dragonbone Chair or Stone of Farewell. Oops.I loved it. Absolutly loved it to death. It is not confusingly stuffed full of new characters like Jordan does. Jordan is constantly throwing around his huge cast of characters, so you forget who is who and who they are. But, To Green Angel Tower is stunning, and Tad's characters are 4-D and like onions, every time you think you know somthing, you discover another layer underneath. The ending is 7 out of 5 stars, and suprising, even though, when I read it again, I thought, &quot;I should have known that was coming!&quot; I love how Tad portrays his characters, especailly Simon and Josua. Both are weak induviduals who become strong and misterious. I love Geloe to death, and I nearly cried when she died. I love owls. The only part I don't like is how Miriamele treats Simon is the third quarter. Half of the time she is kind, and the other half she is vicious and mean. But that is the only flaw in the whole book, and it's not that obvious to take it down a star. This book was very good in the beginning, and it just got better as it went along. It had the perfect mixture of all fanasy , and it had suprises around every corner. I loved it. VERY highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"This series is a true epic which will go down in memory as one of the finest yarns to ever grace the pages of fantasy. William's undaunted prose and fully realized characters mix to create a tale that will make you cheer. Williams takes that classic fantasy beginning of a young boy and his trials and tribulations on his way to greatness and he adds a new twist that the fantasy genre has not seen in years: HE DOES IT RIGHT. The story is great, the setting realistic, the characters palpable, and most improtant of all for legitimate fantasy readers, the magic is realistic and believable. This is one tale that you will not want to miss, and the entire series is done being written and in paperback print. Williams is one of this age's finest fantasy authors and deserves the praise to be mentioned along with other greats such as David Feintuch and George R.R. Martin. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"Those who comment that Memory, Sorrow and Thorn is heavily influenced by Tolkien are missing the point. The book has to be close to standard Tolkien-clone fantasy because this is the type of book it subtly parodies. Can't give away too much but lets just say that the prophecy in this book is not as helpful as the ones in Eddings. Also, the nice happy ultra-good race (read Elves) are not ultra-good at all. They abused their servants (Niskies) and bicker and fight like anyone else and are also extremely paranoid. Likewise, the 'dark lord' is far from the incarnation of evil he appears. Black and white, morally transparent plotting and character writing is one of the biggest faults in modern fantasy, but Williams avoids this easily. The only real 'bad guy' is Pryrates, and that is still slightly debatable. Apart from these deviations from the norm, the book is also more than competently written fantasy, the only fault being that Williams has a tendency towards an almost Jordanesque weight of prose, though To Green Angel Tower suffers less from this than the first two volumes. Overall, a highly interesting and well-written spin on old material. Two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"...Williams' high writing standards. This book has a lot of good action and battles, reunions, new characters and breakthroughs, questions answered and more questions raised, everything that I expected. Unfortunately, there are also a few of the old errors from book one popping up here again; for instance, calling Josua Joshue semi frequently.While the book for the most part upholds the level of excellence of its two predecessors, my enjoyment of it was severely hampered by the fact that when I picked it up, I was only getting half of the book, and at that time my bookstore didn't have part 2 in stock.Well, I read it anyway, and I'm beginning to wonder, because halfway through the final book in the trilogy, the story doesn't really seem and closer to closure than it did in the middle of the second book. There are more questions than answers, the characters are certainly not ready, or even yet moving towards, any kind of confrontation or resolution. Indeed, I am left to wonder how the author plans to tie everything together in the seperate second half of the novel.However, it is still an exceptionally good bit of fantasy, and eminently worth reading; just don't pick it up unless you've got To Green Angel Tower (Part 2) ready to go.And a final note -- the cover format and paper grade have changed from the previous books. This has nothing to do with the story, but the world is in the details and I like consistency throughout a series. Just a note. Still -- read the book."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"The first thing I would like to say about this series, something which I almost couldn't believe I had found on the science fiction/fantasy bookshelves (especially after the shock I took with the Robert Jordan books) is that . . . and this is really quite amazing . . . the characters on the COVER of the book looked *exactly* like their DESCRIPTIONS *IN* the book! Besides this amazing feat, what struck me most about the whole series was the development of the main character. Williams succeeds wonderfully in absorbing the reader in his realistic depiction of Simon's growth from a clumsy, dream-filled boy to a clumsy, love-struck adolescent to a slightly more mature (but still clumsy) young man. Also, he masterfully transforms the tired old formula of disguising the standard fantasy races by giving them a different name. He imbues these characters with such incredible detail that you barely notice the gimick. Altogether a great read, worth the hours it takes to get through the dictionary-sized tomes"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"Very Good, except for too many unimportant minor details, which have to be skipped over."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"If you loved the epic nature and detail of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings Trilogy, then you should also love Williams' Sword trilogy. The third and final volume in Williams' trilogy, To Green Angel Tower, has a cumbersome name and length (1083 pages!!! - split into two, more manageable volumes in the paperback editions), but successfully brings the epic to a close, finally explaining most of the mysteries of Osten Ard and the tragedies that torment the key characters and shape their lives. While Tolkien's Ring trilogy presents an ongoing battle between good and evil, complete with incarnate &quot;angels&quot; (the wizards) and &quot;demons&quot; (Sauron and the Balrog), William's presents a more complex picture with both humans and Sithi in their own personal struggles with love and hatred, vengeance and sacrifice, with his own keen insight into the true nature of sin thrown in for good measure."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"To Green Angel Tower is the massive concluding volume to Tad Williams' epic fantasy trilogy Memory, Sorrow, Thorn. The novel weighs in at just over a thousand pages and the paperback edition has frequently been published as two volumes. Here Prince Josua has gathered refugees from this brother the King Elias and the Red Priest Pyrates at the Stone of Farewell (also the title of the second volume). At this point Josua and the good guys have an idea of what they are up against. Not only is Elias a bad king and under the influence of the evil Pyrates, they are also up against the The Storm King who has been dead for 500 years but whose spirit is still strong and full of hatred and the Norns. The Norns are the cousins of the Sithi, a long lived race of near immortals of great power. The Sithi once held all the land the humans now hold. The Sithi have accepted humanity's right to live and live in exile from their former homeland. The Norns seek to take their lands back and destroy the humans. To say that the odds are stacked against Prince Josua and his allies is to downplay the situation. The situation appears to be nearly hopeless.The hero of our story is not Josua, however. The hero of our story is a young man named Simon. Simon started in The Dragonbone Chair as a kitchen scullion in the caste Hayholt and before long is on the run and finding his true destiny. By the beginning of To Green Angel Tower Simon, now called Seoman Snowlock for his slaying of a dragon and recovering one of the three legendary swords, has become a major player in his world. He has befriended the Sithi, some of the trolls, a princess, become a warrior, slain a dragon, recovered the sword Thorn, and has become part of Josua's inner circle. Still, Simon is a young man just discovering who he is and he has not yet grown as confident and mature as he will.To Green Angel Tower brings the story to a crawling conclusion. At some point Josua and Simon and the allies will make a push to claim the throne and before that to claim the two missing swords Minneyar and Sorrow. They will face the great conflict from the Norns and will seek to bring healing to the land. They do not know how and neither does the reader. Tad Williams has one thousand pages to wrap the story up, so there is plenty of time. Tad Williams uses every page in the book to get us there, and by that I mean that he takes a really long time. One would think that after the first 1200 pages or so covering the first two volumes that we would be farther along, but in a very real sense the story has a long way to go because Josua does not know how to get the swords and has no idea how to overcome the enemy. One thing the reader has to understand is that the story moves slowly. Creeping along slow. Slow like the author doesn't quite know what to do next so he will keep writing more and more until he figures it out. Eventually he does.So, here's the thing: Memory, Sorrow, Thorn is a very traditional high fantasy story. This is what is typically called \\"kitchen boy\\" fantasy because the hero is usually a servant of some sort, often a kitchen boy like Simon, with no parents and real hope to be anything more than what he is. He dreams, of course, but no real hope of becoming more. Something happens and the kitchen boy goes on a grand adventure and learns that he has a great skill or power, gets involved with the powerful men and women of the land who accept him as an equal, and more often than not finds something out about his own heritage which involves some sort of grandeur. This is a staple of the high fantasy genre and this is exactly what Memory, Sorrow, Thorn is. That's fine. It is what an author does within the genre that matters, not the trappings of the genre. This series is both very ordinary, but also well done up until the end. Williams gives us such a slow build that many readers would have quit a thousand pages ago and it is recommended that new readers give the first book at least two hundred pages before making a judgment on the book. There is some promise in the story as Williams makes some of the familiarity seem new. If one gets to the meat of the story, there is an exciting story here. With a good editor Williams could cut several hundred pages out of this book (and from previous books) and really make a moving, tightly paced story that still gets all of the detail (unlike what Terry Brooks is doing with his most recent novels which is all pace and no detail). Still, when I got deep into each novel and especially To Green Angel Tower I was wrapped up in the story and shortly before the end Williams makes some bold moves for such a traditional novel and does a couple of unexpected things to characters which is true to the story and characters and I was impressed.Then we got to the coda and Williams betrayed the sacrifices of what came before. Note how I am trying not to spoil exactly who made these sacrifices or what the sacrifice entailed. Right before this coda of an ending which wraps everything up I am sold. Williams hammered home a great ending and then he went and undid everything that came before with one more chapter. He revealed too much, gave the reader too much and the ending lost all the power it had up to that point. One thing had been hinted at for a while regarding Simon, so I understand even though I wish Simon's fate could have come about without the family history. The other couple of characters who sacrificed at the end meant nothing after the coda. Betrayal by the author who apparently needed an extra happy ending to close out the trilogy.If Williams did the same thing with the Otherland series I might be done with him.Final Analysis: Slow moving traditional fantasy that has a strong story buried in with the lazy river of a plot but a feckless tacked on ending after the final battle which invalidated the power of said final battle.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"Are you kidding me? This is what I waited for? Long before I was half way through this book I starting skimming some chapters and completely skipping others. Don't have to worry about skipping anything important, the author has thoughtfully provide a work around for that by repeating any important events that have occurred, again and again it seems at times. At no time in this volume do I find the sort of edge-of-your-seat tension that I would expect from a store with so many intersecting plot lines. I should have taken a hint about how this series was going to go by the two-hundred odd pages it took to get Simon from scullery hand to Doctor Morgenes' assistant way back in volume 1. I basically skimmed my way through the last half of volume 3 and don't feel as if I cheated myself.I have a great idea for writers who wish to delve into the worlds of fantasy and magic; create characters that readers will at least care about. In the end I no longer cared about magic, I know longer cared about who wins or who loses, the only question I had left in my mind is: are all of these people certifiably insane? Outside of the troll Bibinak, I can't think of a single character that seemed to be able to avoid taking the most obviously stupid or careless action at an any opportunity.It is high time that fantasy writers stopped writing about endlessly selfish and self-absorbed characters that seem to ignore rational thought and literally run off into the unknown without thinking, planning, or seemingly even caring about their fate. By the time the characters in this story would have made it to book three, I was resigned to the fact that they weren't just selfish and rudely inconsiderate of others, they were stupid. In the end, that's how I felt for trying to finish this book."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"well I just finished the series for the 2nd time, or is it the third? at any rate I hadn't read it in probably ten years. I have to admit I'm more critical of it now than before but still think highly of it. for me maybe the main problem of the trilogy is that the main characters who have risen to prominence at the end of the series Simon and Miri are fairly dull whilst worthier figures have fallen along the way and characters who are fading into oblivion, the Sithi, are endlessly fascinating in comparison. now for some more indepth whining, yes these are spoilers... Simon and Miri running away from Josua is a pretty awful plot development because Simon has just been in a war and killed many people and therefore hopefully grown up at least a little and Miri has just been reunited with her uncle after being kidnapped, raped, nearly killed etc after running away from him the first time. what they did was inexcusable and Miri being \\"so\\" sure that telling her dear old dad that she knew all it really was about was reaching her dead mother was pretty silly. the first time she tried to tell Josua that she needed to talk to dad in private he should have reminded her that her father killed all but a handful of people at Naglimund and she would have been part of that if she hadn't already run away. dad was way past redemption at that point. Williams obviously wanted to get the two away from their elders so they could bond and feel like they were making grown-up decisions before he made them the rulers of the continent but this was a poor way of doing it. one of the most unfortunate consequences of this plot choice was Binabik being reigned in one last time to bail the idiot dishwasher out of another dumbass decision jeapordizing the peaceful future with Sisqi that he so richly deserved thousands of pages earlier. Binabik is nothing short of a saint in his treatment of the \\"heroes\\" of the series, though he was a deadly saint with his poison darts. and of course even his wolf was forced to save the main characters at least ten times. Yet what recognition does he get in the end, a visit from the great Seoman two years later maybe. King Binabik anyone? just to look at the development of Simon. He was a dishwasher/janitor of limited capability. He learned how to read and write at the age of 15, not very well. He got on his own and nearly starved. Binabik saved his ass. He managed to get Thorn up in front of a dragon that was going to crush Jiriki and Thorn cut the dragon's eye. He got lost in the forest and the Sithi rescued him from certain death. his nightly training from sludig and hastean somehow prepared him to fight off the best fighting men in the land the Erkynguard and mercenaries at the stone of farewell, maybe the most unbelievable part of his story, that he actually beat someone in a fair fight. He was made a night by a rogue political figure whose entire fighting force other than Deornoth was destroyed a few weeks earlier (desperate man). He deserted his Prince to be with an idiot princess determined to get herself killed. He nearly brought on the end of the world taking a great sword to pryrates at green angel tower. He became King of all the lands. Does this sound remotely natural or plausible to anyone?By the end of the book, the moral seems to be that the shallow, simple, and short-lived shall inherit the earth. most of the interesting characters are killed off along the way. Morgenes who it is hinted has lived an unusually long life some how and definitely has magic ability is of course the first casualty. The learned hardy Jaurnaga died saving the survivors of Naglimund or so he thought. Apparently the norns would have let the handful go anyway although the reasoning for that was never really explained. Amerasu the loveliest deepest figure in the series was unceremoniously killed off along with the up till then invincible Jegger and his really big dog. The niskie dies after saving Miri and Cadrach (they should have forced her to come with them, and they should have killed Aspitis when they had the chance), Geloe who it is hinted has been alive longer than many Sithi dies. Geloe... was definitely one of the most enigmatic characters. when she died Aditu revealed that she was one of Ruyan's own, a Tinukedaya. this seems like a pretty interesting development but was it ever mentioned again? hell no, we needed to spend more time talking about tunnels, swords, and eating worms and moss to survive said tunnels. Leleth, who seemed to be the only person who didn't have to die to figure out that the messenger was false but couldn't tell anyone because she had been bitten by a dog and quit talking (couldn't she write it down?) finally succumbed to her misery after Geloe died but not before trying to enlighten the unenlightenable Simon, Maegwin died, which means Eolair might as well have been dead as we know he will never be happy, pretty depressing outcome for the only Hernystiri characters we get to know. the dwarrows, after saving Miri, Binabik, and Cadrach are cast aside as the plot devices they always were. Cadrach, the only mortal who knows how to use \\"the art\\" at that point, dies after saving our heroes. Killing off Isorn was certainly cruel after all he went through in the series, tortured by Skali, barely survived Naglimund, survived the stone of farewell, survived Naglimund again this time alongside the Sithi, and then unceremoniously killed by a flick of the wrist from the uber powerful Pryrates. speaking of pryrates he was easily killed by the newly formed elias/storm king with some sort of magic but then the newly formed creature was killed off by an arrow after pryrates had withstood such a wound himself only moments earlier, inconsistency? Camaris might as well be dead at the end, nobody knows what the heck happened to him. Utuk'Ku is apparently alive but somehow lost her power along with her people, and the Sithi? back hiding in the forest having their one or two births every 100 years surely fading into oblivion taking with them their magic powers and knowledge of arts and craftsmanship humans can not even begin to imagine. honestly, I'm not sure at the end it wouldn't have been better for Ineluki to triumph in erasing mankinds mastery of Osten Ard as it doesn't seem to be an improvement over the Sithi culture in any way shape or form. The sithi had a weakness to Iron or else it seems they would have had no trouble keeping homo-sapiens in check while maintaining their far advanced culture. in retrospect, the entire resistance to Elias reign including the reclaiming of Nabban by Camaris seems to have been in vain as the meeting of the swords was going to happen regardless and that was where the battle for osten ard was fought. In fact if Elias could have managed to be a half-way decent ruler whilst working out the bargain for immortality with the storm king instead of betraying Lluth, Isgrimnur, and Josua in his haste to alienate his entire kingdom he probably could have made it through his two or three year reign fairly secure with the people not blaming him for the damnably cold weather and whatnot. But of course that wasn't how it went. In summation, Sithi VERY GOOD, Geloe & Morgenes, very good, Binabik, great hero with much wisdom, Simon & Miri, not so much. Tad Williams series? worth the price of admission for the side characters alone"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"A Great ending to an important series by Tad Williams.

No loose ends; no predictable endings; just great reading. I love that there is brief synopsis of the prior 2 books at the beginning of the volume and therefore not pages upon end dedicated to rehashing previous story lines within the body of the book itself."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"To Green Angel Tower by Tad Williams is the conclusion to the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy. I read this book as one story, where as other have this 3rd book in two parts. Reading it as one story makes sense but creates for a mammoth book of some 1,100 pages and 2.5 pounds of material. This will never be considered a light read, in more ways than one.The plot of this book continues with that of the first two, in that it centers around Simon and the choices he makes. However, there are countless other characters that are discussed in some detail, yet the story always returns to Simon. In the first two books we see Simon's progression from kitchen scullion to that of someone in the army. In the 3rd book this progression is pushed further. The main plot line of this book is the upcoming battle between Josua and his brother King Elias. This is made more interesting with the wizard who is Elias's right hand and the emergence of the Storm King and what that means to the battle. Add to that that each side has their own \`immortals' the Sithi and the Norns. This truly has the making of an epic battle and one that could have very well helped shape the fantasy genre, yet sadly I was disappointed in the ending of this book. It seemed rushed and at time disjointed. That is not to say Williams left any loose ends, rather that they were all so nicely tied up it left the reader little chance to \`dream' about what happened after everything was over. Add to that the fact that Williams spent over 900 pages leading up to the battle and took barely 60 pages to start the battle, fight the battle, come to a climax with in the story, and start tying up the ends of the story. It just seemed rushed to me. If he was running short on space there are several places within the book he could have easily cut back. Of course this is merely my opinion, others may liked that rushed feel to the ending.I think I need to say this was a good story, just some things about HOW it was written that I didn't like all that much. One other complaint I have is that at the end, the final battle is recounted by someone, we don't get to read everything that happened it is more of two characters talking and one telling the other everything that happened after a given point.The character development within this book is fantastic. Williams has a knack for not only writing believable characters, but giving them qualities that we can all see in ourselves. Simon is both smart and self-doubting at the same time. Others around him know he is capable of good things, yet Simon himself is always doubting that. Other characters are equally interesting and this speaks to Williams writing ability. It is one thing to have a good story, but if good characters are not there the story will falter. This is certainly not the case with these books. If you like a series of books where there is a lot of character development on multiple levels, you will really enjoy these books.Yet one more area to give Williams praise is his ability to construct a world that seems to be both rich in history and believable at the same time. All too often, fantasy authors try to cram a multitude of things into their universe leaving the reader trying to remember everything that is going on. While there is no shortage of information for this world, Williams does a good job of giving the reader small pieces of it at a time so as not to overwhelm the reader.When all is said and done, I would recommend these books to serious fantasy fans. If you are looking for a light easy read, these books are probably not what you want. This is a complex world and characters that forces the reader to always pay attention. If you are looking for lots of magic use and lots of fighting, again this is probably not for you. That's not to say those elements are not present, but they are not the driving force behind the books. This is a very good story and one that I hope people will continue to enjoy, but if you decide to embark on this journey, be prepared for a long demanding ride."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I just finished a marathon reading of the &quot;Memory, Sorrow and Thorn&quot; trilogy-- all 3000 plus pages-- and I am totally knocked out! I loved the books on several levels: first, the character development. All the characters were multi-dimensional, really human in their responses to situations and to eachother. Many evoked strong empathy-- the reader really cares what happens to them. Simon's coming-of-age journey from innocent, somewhat goofy &quot;mooncalf&quot; to mature young man is beautifully and sensitively drawn. His relationship with Miriamele--halting, tentative, gradually growing stronger and deeper, blossoming finally into fully realized love, is written with real delicacy. The noble friendship between Simon and Binabik is gratifying. Josua's character is also one I came to care a great deal about, one of the truly good and noble forces of the books. The villains are truly nasty and quite vividly evoked. The pacing of the plot is excellent; nothing is flabby about this story, from start to finish. All details are important, and one must read with steady concentration. Everything is woven together with much skill. The dialogue is a real treat to read; one can fairly hear the characters as one reads their words. I was totally immersed in the story throughout the four volumes (the third part of the trilogy is so long that it is broken up into two books) and begrudged the time I had to spend doing mundane things. I was faced with the dilemma of wanting to go on reading while also wanting to put off reaching the very end! Getting to the end was satisfying yet also upsetting, and I found myself thinking about the story and the characters for days after. I HIGHLY recommend the entire trilogy, and also strongly suggest that anyone interested begin with &quot;The Dragonbone Chair&quot; and proceed in order.

Having loved the first two books in the series, I couldn't wait to read this one. I was not dissapointed. Rarely have I become so engrossed in a story. I felt every emotion with them. And the rewards at the ending were worth waiting for. This is a wonderful love story; both between a young man and a young woman, and between that girl and her father.

Overall, it is above your standard fantasy book. A must read"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"I originally became interested in Tad Williams' trilogy after reading his short story &quot;The Burning Man&quot; in Legends, and then discovering on the Internet that this series was very popular. What intrigued me most was that his fantasy world has a version of the Catholic Church -- in his books, Jesus Christ becomes &quot;Usires Aedon,&quot; the Cross becomes &quot;the Tree,&quot; etc., and priest and monk characters (some holy, some fallen) play a significant role.That said, I actually found it very difficult to get into this series. I never felt like I really empathized with the main character, Simon -- and I think the author realized his failure in the second book, when he began to transform some of the background characters into main characters -- all of whom were more satisfying to read about. I think the most troublesome thing, though, was that the author tended to be extremely verbose, and constantly repeated the same information to the reader, over, and over, and over -- from a different character's viewpoint, for example. Very often -- even up to the very last pages -- I found myself skimming over large sections of redundant information.(Possible spoiler warning:) Although I found the ending rushed and generally unsatisfying, it did have an interestingly unique message: that hatred and revenge are ultimately useless. At the end, the Sauron-like enemy is defeated when Simon and Camaris *forgive* him. It's a powerful moment, but ultimately marred by the author's inability to integrate their choice with the series' earlier pseudo-Christian moral messages."},{"Title":"Siege","review":"Culmination of a truly epic storyline"},{"Title":"Siege","review":"As one other reader has commented, this series is far too long, outstripping many other trilogies by page length and nothing more.In the first book, there is a painful amount of description which really isn't necessary to the plot or to worldbuilding. Passages that seem to read like 'there was moss on the rock. The rock was of about average size and weight. A long linneage of erosive factors had gnawed since the dawn of time on the rocks grandpappy, which had been somewhat larger' abound in this book.The second book builds upon this flawed heritage, though it begins to pick up the pace as the author prepares to package his epic into the cliched trilogy of volumes expected of a fantasy series. This is the best book of the three, but by the end, most readers will anticipate that the author has only really told the first third of the tale.This is borne out by the third and longest book. All 'moss on the rocks' type narrative is dropped completely as the author realizes that he doesn't have time to waste lavishly describing things that don't move the plot along. Unfortunately in the rush to put the wraps on the plot, the characters fall by the wayside, becoming the unwitting victims of the authors poor pacing.The entire series ends with a gimmick that is so tasteless that it deserves disclosure here - the hero is knocked unconscious and it is only later described to him by the other characters how the bad guys were defeated. This is a convenient way for the author to finish unveiling all the plot devices in the shortest amount of time possible, and one senses that by the end of the third book, the author is too tired of the trilogy to try and do something better. Too bad for the reader!Due to the problems with pacing, the lack of character development (especially in the last book), etc. I cannot begin to understand the constant comparisons of this trilogy to Tolkien. Read Terry Brooks, read Guy Kay, read Goodkind ...But leave Tad Williams on the shelf."},{"Title":"Targeted by the CIA: An Intelligence Professional Speaks Out on the Scandal That Turned the CIA Upside Down","review":"What would you do if suddenly you were accused of being a Soviet mole? It would obviously be a complete and utter shock. Peter Karlow lived this nightmare. After service with the Navy and OSS field operations during World War II -- in the course of which he lost part of a leg -- he continued in the CIA, until, one day, he was addressed by two FBI agents and asked to \\"assist with inquiries,\\" as the British euphemistically call it. This inquiry turned out to be his own. He was accused of being a Soviet spy. Any loyal career officer can understand the shock. His crime, he found out later, was that his name started with a \\"K.\\" Alexander Golitsin, Soviet defector, had told James Angleton that there was a mole within CIA. He could not remember the name, but it started with a \\"K.\\" That ended Peter's career and began years of turmoil, until he was finally completely cleared, compensated and decorated.Peter tells his story, his OSS days (the first 88 pages of 178) with operations in North Africa, Corsica, Italy, the creation of CIA, and his CIA Cold War work, and then when the CIA turned on him -- the FBI interrogations and what followed, including his eventual complete exoneration and decoration, all in easy to read fluid prose. It is not only a shocking story, but an interesting account by someone with an outstanding memory, who tells the story without bitterness or rancor, a treasure of information from a working-level perspective about wartime and peacetime intelligence and \\"special\\" operations. It is also an account of the struggles within the CIA (and the Intelligence Community) to deal with the threat of penetration and betrayal -- threats with which we have become familiar with the stories of Walker, Ames and Hanssen, among a host of others. As it worked out, Angleton and Golitsin formed a strange team that indeed can be said to have turned 'CIA upside down,' decimated the work of the Soviet Russia Division and impacted on CIA's defenses against Soviet operations.This is a remarkable story which would make a complex and fascinating espionage thriller."},{"Title":"Targeted by the CIA: An Intelligence Professional Speaks Out on the Scandal That Turned the CIA Upside Down","review":"As a former CIA FI/Clandestine Services officer, I found TRARGETED BY THE CIA fascinating. Not only because I had participated,on the rim, and very much a junior, in some of the things described, but also, because of that, I could feel Karlow's sense of shock and bewilderment at the utterly shabby way The Agency dealt with him.Having seen, from documents and a few accounts,how CIA's Inner Circle dealt with the subject of a book I am writing on Bill Harvey, I am not surprised at the way Karlow's casewas handled. His restraint in describing the decades of humiliation and ostracism he felt because of a direly wrongful accusation is admirable. He tells his bleak story with just enough detail that the reader can begin to feel his inner agony, when former friends turned their shoulders, and when white became Orwellian black.I have long admired the people I knew who stayed on in The Agency, despite the overpowering bureaucracy and the inevitable advance of mediocrity, after the high-flying 1950s. There weresome, of principle and courage . . . although their numbers were dwindling, all too rapidly, under the grinding millstone of political conformity.TARGETED BY THE CIA reminds us that Peter Karlow wase one of them."},{"Title":"Como manejar su propio dinero","review":"Para los millones de hispanos que vivimos en este pa&iacute;s, cada d&iacute;a sea hace m&aacute;s dif&iacute;cil manejar dinero, por razones simples: desempleo en los dos &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os, creciente costo de vida, mayor presi&oacute;n de los empleadores para producir m&aacute;s con menos...pero precisamente en esas circunstancias es que resulta m&aacute;s importante el manejo del dinero: cuando es m&aacute;s escaso.

The failure to close the Falaise gap and the subsequent german escape is an example of indecision by both Eisenhower and Bradley.

(I don't know if the original had them, but the pb doesn't)"},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and triumph","review":"I am currently rereading this book after receiving it as a gift in 1971.General George S. Patton, Jr. has been one of my lifelong heros so it's no surprise that I'm taken to books on him. I'm also a realist concerning him and will be the first to concede that the man was far from perfect in his personal life as well as a military leader. Ladislas Farago's epic biography does the supreme job of telling the whole story, from both sides of the fence, including Patton's triumphs of military genius to his emotional breakdowns and insecurities which lead many times to him weeping openly in front of his staff.But this is so much more than just a book on Patton. Ordeal and Triumph is an exciting, easy to understand walk through the African and European theaters of WWII and it's pivotal battles. Where Farago writes in great detail, he never gets overburdened with details. At just under 900 pages, you may wonder how that can be but he takes Patton from his ancestry up through his days in Europe after the war, and chronicles not only the battles, but all that went on before and after, including the baffoonery that happened on a daily basis within both the British and American military commands.And that's one of the scary revelations that is brought out time and again in Ordeal And Triumph. Between Montgomery, Bradley and Eisenhower, it now looks like it was only by the grace of Providence that the Allies won the war at all. The combined military leadership was timid, reserve, old school, by the book that was decades and even centuries old, head strong, non-creative, and just plain stupid in just about everything they did, UNTIL Patton was released in France with the Third Army. And even then, he was hampered until finally Bradley let him loose. Unfortunately, by that time, the German forces had had time to retreat, which had been a familiar occurrence in most of the battles preceding D-Day and it was this, along with many other errors that prolonged the war up to a year.Farago's biography, first published in 1963, would become the basis for the 1970 moviePatton (Two-Disc Collector's Edition), starring George C. Scott, along withA Soldier's Story (Modern Library War)by General Omar Bradley. And even though Scott played Patton with a low, gruff voice, when in reality Patton had a thin high pitched voice, those who knew him said that everything else about Scott's portrayal was spot on.I highly recommend this book, in either hard cover or paperback edition, for any student or person who is a history buff, especially of war and battle tactics. It is researched meticulously, drawing from every documented source available, as well as from personal writings and diaries of Patton and many others who were there and fought along side the man whom some say singlehandedly won the war. But it is also just a facinating story of one of the most colorful characters this country has ever created. A man who was comfortable cussing at the drop of a hat, but was a profoundly spiritual man who daily, on his knees, sought the wisdom and blessing of his creator to help righteousness win over evil."},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and triumph","review":"\\"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph\\" is a full life biography of one of the most colorful and successful officers ever to wear the uniform of the United States. It claims to be the book on which the movie was based and many of the anecdotes so beloved in the movie are presented in the book, although, occasionally, with slightly different details.Author Ladislas Farago informs the reader of Patton's ancestry, beginning with his immigrant ancestor who, presumably, left Scotland to avoid debtors, justice, or both. He continues with the Congressman and series of generals, including ones who died in the Revolution and Civil War, in Patton's line. He brings us to the subject who, he tells us, grew up on a ranch in California, where he made the acquaintance of Rudyard Kipling and John S. Mosby.Patton's own tale is larger than life. His days at VMI and West Point are mentioned, but they are not the focus of the story. The focus is Patton's active duty career. He saw action with Pershing in Mexico and World War I, where he was introduced into the world of armored warfare.This book enables the reader to understand the crucial role which Patton, in cooperation with Eisenhower and others, played in bringing tanks into the American arsenal. Having taken command of the tank corps in World War I, he tested its potentials. Between the wars he maintained his research into armor, preparing for the day when the U.S. Army would embrace the weapon.Throughout this work, Patton is shown as a leader whose dash and unconventional behavior is the key to his notoriety and success. In his first tank action, at St. Mihiel, Patton incurred the wrath of his superiors by extending his attack far beyond its expectations in a spectacular, but undisciplined advance. His performance in the 1941 maneuvers in Tennessee would lead to instructions for the famous Louisiana maneuvers later that year to \\"Not let Patton run wild again.\\" Despite the efforts of the judges to restrain him, he did \\"run wild\\", ending each part of the Louisiana maneuvers prematurely.Patton's high point was, of course, World War II. He entered it as field commander of the first major American force to see action in the war, the Western Task Force in the invasion of French North Africa, Operation Torch. This was an operation of diplomacy, not one of dash and maneuver. Predictably, Patton's performance was less impressive than later efforts would be. It was not until he was advanced to command of II Corps, after the disaster at Kasserine, that Patton's emphasis on training and spirit would begin to yield the results for which he became famous.Patton's next theatre of operations was the Sicilian invasion. It was here that his rivalry with Field Marshall Montgomery, which would continue to the end of the war, began. Here theme of Montgomery slugging it out with the best that the enemy had to offer while Patton made rapid advance against light opposition was born. It was in Sicily, too, that the slapping incidents, which would plague Patton and the American war effort, occurred.With the conclusion of the Sicilian campaign, Patton was transferred to England where he distracted the German's with his Phantom Army while others prepared for action. It was not until the month after D-Day that Patton began his legendary command of the Third Army and its dramatic sweep across France into Bavaria and Czechoslovakia. Throughout this Patton would be in constant battle with Eisenhower and Montgomery for supplies, almost as much as he was with the Germans for prisoners and territory.The last days of Patton are shown as a discouraging wind down of the career of a general who predicted that: \\"Peace will be hell on me.\\" The inability to obtain a combat command in the Pacific reflected Patton's standing among many of his fellow officers. His failure as Military Governor of Bavaria illustrated the weakness of his political skills.Farago provides the reader x with an introduction, later efforts into the order of battle, but also into the complex character interactions among the leading personae dramatae. The deteriorating relationships between Patton and Eisenhower, as Patton's indiscretions created repeated distractions for Ike, are contrasted with the improving relations between Patton and Bradley as Bradley, originally disgusted by Patton's bravado, gradually came to appreciate Patton's aggressiveness in contrast to the comparative lethargy of Montgomery.You see how much I was excited by this book. I read this in preparation for a one night continuing ed class about Patton. It provided me with most of what I needed to know in order to teach the class. I am well satisfied with the way it covered its subject. I am confident that you will be also."},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and triumph","review":"I have read most of the biographies of WWII Generals and politicians, yet this one brought tears to my eyes when I saw evidence of a massive jealousy and ego on behalf of America's generals and politicians because Patton was \\"insensitive\\". How we would rather a person be sensitive than proficient, such is the case with Patton. His ideas and plans would have saved America thousands of men, yet, the command and politics played behind the scenes to steal this man's thunder border on the obscene. Well written, well researched and proofed, I get the impression that the author went into the work somewhat biased against Patton and emerged as his fan, as anyone would who have read all the accounts of this war. I highly recommend this book for the historian who wants to know the truth. Sadly, our country has not produced any general of this caliber since WWII. The axiom is proven here; performance, personality and politics are necessary for greatness, but not necessarily in that order."},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and triumph","review":"This thick book has larger typeface than the small paperback I read years ago, however the binding was poor quality and during the first reading the spine cracked open in the middle despite my careful handling of the book. It's an open question whether I got a lemon or this publisher's work is shoddy, but there it is. The book itself is highly readable and Ladislas Farago does a good job in balancing anecdotes with stating historical facts to keep the reader entertained while informed as well."},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and triumph","review":"This was an enjoyable read as well as an excellent military history. Farago took a complex and mythologized character (Patton) in a complex military and political environment ( WWII) and wrote a history that reads like a novel. It comes close to the can't-put-it-down category. The paperback edition would have been improved by maps such as those found in the other excellent read, \\"A Soldier's Story\\" by Omar Bradley. It is more readable than Carlo D'Este's \\"A Genius for War\\" but focuses more on the military aspects of Patton's life.Farago portrays Patton as a general who was shrewd and instinctive and well studied in the art of war. He was deeply patriotic and a devoted to his Army . Despite his trials under the cautious leadership of Bradley and Eisenhower he never lost respect for either. His opinion of Montgomery was higher than most popular history would have us believe as well. His main problem with Monty was not Monty's ego but Monty's inability to get the job done as happened in Sicily, Falaise and Arnhem. Patton's faults and eccentricities get popular attention but his virtues as a combat leader and tactician far out weighed any of that. Had he been let loose in Europe the war would unquestionably have ended sooner. He could never have filled the shoes of Ike or Bradley but he was among a very small number of Allied generals including Hodges, Middleton, Patch and Simpson who knew that aggression wins wars. My father who served with Patton in North Africa and Sicily never liked the man but he respected the general. Watch the movie that was based on this book, but if you really want to understand a military genius read \\"Patton - Ordeal and Triumph\\"."},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and triumph","review":"If you like war history, you will love this book.

Some great quotes and some strange tales....I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and triumph","review":"This book is a wonderful and instructive biography as well as a fine reference of the war in Europe written by a very good writer.Farago has nailed it right on the head.His description of one of America's greatest generals ever to command our forces was a joy to read.Patton is the model,the archetype, albeit a man with many faults but a man you would want to be on your side not theirs if you ever had to go into battle.A book visited by Francis Ford Coppola when hired to write the screenplay for the movie of the same name.You remember that one don't you.Many scenes and dialog were practically taken and used verbatum.The book traces him from his beginnings to his untimely death with just about everything in between.How his early days of struggle went on to shape and hone his adult personality, what drove him despite being considered an oddball primadonna by his peers.Yet all who knew him, worked for him or served under him grew to respect the man and what he tried to accomplish even at the expense of having to deal with his persona.I wish I could have met him just once.When given a job to do he did it with effectiveness and flair.The fight with Germany may have gone on longer than it did if Patton was never there.True, he did have many flubs some of which could have ended his career and nearly did several times.George had a big mouth and a short fuse which often got him into trouble with his superiors but as a military tactician he was brilliant and they knew it.The Germans feared him and in his many battles with them he usually came out on top.We need more men like him in the field today not these politically correct yes men who prance around trying to win hearts and minds.Look where that tact has gotten us, nowhere fast as more American soldiers come home in coffins.This book,nearly 900 pages long takes some time to get through but it is worth it.It will leave you with a complete and accurate picture of the man,his trials and tribulations and the battles he faced on the field and in the office.A more inspiring leader of men you will never find in modern times.He did believe that he was at many battle fields in the long forgotten past which may have helped him to find his destiny.A writer of poetry,a lover of fine wine,horses,discipline, an aristocrat in many ways yet war was what he was made for and this book will fill you in on all the details of his life and of some of the most difficult and famous battles in WWII Europe.There are many other biographies you could read about him perhaps too many, you need to narrow your search to just a few.If you value your time and want to get to the nuts and bolts of the man known as \\"old blood and guts\\" then look no further. Sure you could watch the movie but that just scratches the surface of the man.If you want to know what kind of leader we need today defending us at home and abroad or just want to get to know Patton himself, then this book should be your first choice for doing just that."},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and triumph","review":"this is one of the best biographies of george s patton that has been written. i have read 4 other biographies on him and none of them compare. he was not only a military genious and our greatest and most feared general to the gemrans, but, he was also very ecentric. he was very controversial, but, when leading troops into war there was no comparison. his belief was to attack, attack compared to montgomery's take it slow and be careful. the third army loved him ever though of his harsh ways and members were proud to say that they served under patton. if the supreme commander had given patton the oil and supples he wanted instead of \\"pleasing\\" montgomery, the war might of ended sooner than it did. if a person wants to know about patton's life, they should read this book."},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and triumph","review":"I like this book alot because of the details it goes in to of the subject.Patton was a very complicated person and to me a very fascinating one.The story line is 855 pages long & i'm a slow reader, but I love every page of it.He brought the 3rd army into the battle of the bulge after a 100 mile march in the middle of a record setting winter and saved the 101st airborne.

On the back cover the reader is informed that, \\"The book survived an assault of law suits which sought to prevent its publication. That is was published is a testament to the courage and perserverance of the author and the original publisher.\\" Throw in Ladislas Farago's excellant writing and thorough research and you have an easy 5 star selection.To say that Farago's book on Patton is revisionist is a classic understatement. Right after the war ended, George S. Patton's book WAR AS I KNEW IT(1947), Ralph Ingersoll's TOP SECRET(1946)and Captain Harry C. Butcher's MY THREE YEARS WITH EISENHOWER(1946)were published. These books tended to tell the truth, as best these three men knew it at the time. Patton had died from an automobile accident shortly afer the war ended and his memoirs were published by his wife Beatrice Patton Waters. These three books revealed an unpleasant secret, that the Anglo-American Alliance was flawed at the highest levels of the allied command. The British and Americans never could agree on the right strategy to use against the Germans. This was in stark contrast to accounts written by Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower and the senior U.S. Commander in Europe, General Omar N. Bradley.During the war Eisenhower had gotten high grades from both British and Americans for his committment to the Anglo-American Alliance. He continued this policy after the war had ended. Eisenhower admitted that there were disagreements between the allies, but suggested that these disagreements were settled amicably and caused no serious problems in their ongoing strategic efforts to defeat the Germans. General Bradley (in A Soldier's Story, 1951) was far more critical of British Field Marshal Bernard L. Montgomery but never questioned Eisenhower's broader point that the alliance was a huge success. Forrest C. Pogue, Martin Blumenson and other official and unofficial U.S. Army historians adopted Eisenhower's position on disagreements between the allies, which is to say that they were surpressed. George Patton, Harry Butcher and Ralph Ingersoll were treated as renegade officers, poor historians and men with a grudge against Eisenhower or the British.For twenty years Eisenhower's official version of the war in Europe was seldom challenged then in 1964 along came Ladislas Farago. Farago's solid reputation and his impeccible research were impossible to ignore. So the official gatekeepers of U.S. military history tried, but failed, to surpress publication of the book. Farago's book gave George Patton's reputation an immediate shot in the arm. The famous movie PATTON followed and 10 years later the British began releasing copies of their hugely successful ULTRA intercepts of encoded German ENGIMA radio traffic. What ULTRA revealed and what a series of revisionist historical accounts of the war have since documented is that Patton, Ingersoll and Butcher had gotten it right back in the late 1940's.Farago takes General George S. Patton, Jr. through North Africa, Sicily and the slapping incidents, Eisenhower's doghouse in England, the Knutsford incident, command of the fictional First U.S. Army Group, still in Eisenhower's doghouse, the waiting before given command of U.S.Third Army, finally command of Third Army, the breakout from the Carentan, turning the corner over one good road at Avranches, the mistake going into Brittany and the drive onto the open German southern flank at Le Mans. Farago tells it all in infinite detail. Farago's writing about the Battle of the Falaise Gap is very good, almost an hour by hour account. Farago recounts Patton's drive across France, his gas shortages, banging his head against the Germans at Metz, anticipating the German attack in the Ardennes and his drive into the southern German flank to rescue the defenders of Bastogne. Farago also gives an accurate blow by blow description of British efforts (P.M. Winston Churchill and C.I.G.S. Alan Brooke)to secure American troops to serve under British Field Marshal Montgomery. The British were very short of men and were incapable of conducting sustained offensive operations on their own. If the reader wants to understand how British efforts to undermine the American command influenced Allied strategy and how General George Patton's place in the pecking order of Allied generals was secured, Ladislas Farago's, PATTON, is a great place to start.For additional reading on this subject the reader may want to consider: Carlo D'Este's PATTON: A GENIUS FOR WAR, Martin Blumenson's THE BATTLE OF THE GENERALS, Canadian Major General Richard Rohmer's PATTON'S GAP, or William Weidner's EISENHOWER & MONTGOMERY at the FALAISE GAP."},{"Title":"Patton: Ordeal and triumph","review":"Loved this book, a fascinating portrayal of a flawed but brilliant military leader and tactician.

While the movie was great, this shows much more of General Patton than the movie ever could. It shows his early years, including fighting in WWI where he basically developed the American Tank Corps. It also shows how he almost did not make it to WWII, due largely to his own actions. It goes without saying that General Patton was one of the best American generals in WWII, but few people realize how close he came to being \\"sent home\\" (i. e. forced out of the Army), during the period between the wars and even during the early part of the American involvement in WWII. The only complaint about the Kindle version of the book is that the maps at the end of the book are almost impossible to read.

Fuentes manages to place Laura Diaz at almost every important cultural and political event between 1905 and the 1970's-from pre-revolutionary hacienda life, through the building of Mexico's union movement, to the Spanish Civil War, and the massacre of students at Tlatelolco on the eve of the 1968 Olympics. This might seem like a stretch. Come on, how likely is it that any one person would manage to fit all that in as well as love affairs, a teeming family, and a friendship with Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera?Not likely at all, but Fuentes' has created a rich and readable novel, filled with many characters who exist mainly to express a political point of view but who are complex and interesting people nonetheless. The first part of &quot;The Years with Laura Diaz&quot; works especially well, recording Laura's early years as the granddaughter of German immigrants living in the coastal state of Veracruz and the kind of life enjoyed by the families of landowners. Her marriage to a union organizer who takes her to post-revolutionary Mexico City puts her in the heart of a society recreating itself. No one writes about the Mexican capital like Carlos Fuentes, and Mexico City in the 1920's through the 70's springs to life in all its glories and maddening confusions.There is a lot of politics, which unfortunately causes &quot;Laura Diaz&quot; to bog down as her cipher of a husband stirs an alphabet soup of labor unions and political parties. It's interesting if you know Mexican history, but I can imagine it's pretty incomprehensible if you don't. (The fascinating thing is that during this period following the Mexican Revolution, labor was delivered to a political party and not the communists, thus putting an end to the possibility of government/labor conflict for once and for all, or at least until that party was voted out of office seventy years after it was first voted in.) But once you get past that, you'll be glad you stayed with the novel to its mysterious and elegant end."},{"Title":"Years With Laura Diaz","review":"In 1999, he came to Detroit to begin filming a TV special on the famous twentieth century Mexican muralists. However, looking at one of the works, he finds himself captivated by a woman in one of the murals who seems eerily familiar before he realizes that she is his famous great grandmother, Laura Diaz.He begins to think about the life and loves of Laura. Born in 1898, her lovers include Communists and other activists before she marries and has children. She watches as male members of her extended family die during the constant years of turbulence shaking her country. She becomes friends with some of the artistic elite and ultimately becomes one of them as a renowned photographer. As Mexico lives and dies with each new tremor, so has Laura Diaz.Renowned author Carlos Fuentes has written his best work to date with the incredible THE YEARS WITH LAURA DIAZ. The story line centers on the life of the title character, but actually serves as a backdrop to the bigger mural of twentieth century Mexico. This entertaining, dark, but powerful novel provides an enlightening look at the nation and its people rarely seen in a novel. Senior Fuentes deserves awards for this classic biographical historical fiction.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Years With Laura Diaz","review":"Like Carlos Fuentes' masterpiece, \\"The Death of Artemio Cruz,\\" \\"The Years With Laura Diaz\\" traces a migration from the state of Vera Cruz to Mexico City, during and after the Mexican Revolution. Here, however, the protagonist is not at all similar to the jaded revolutionary, Artemio Cruz, (who makes a cameo appearance in the novel). She is Laura Cruz, an artist and photographer, a woman of integrity, as well as a wife, mother and lover. Strong and vibrant, she manages to circumvent the Latin machismo which surrounds her and become a person in her own right, able to produce her own creative work, and to love with great abandon. In this sweeping historical saga, which spans a one hundred year period, Laura Cruz meets and mingles with all sorts of 20th century luminaries, like Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, along with numerous political figures. Logically, history is portrayed through the eyes, experiences and ideology of Carlos Fuentes. He incorporates his views on the Mexican Revolution, socialism, Mexico's various workers' and labor movements, the Spanish Civil War, the Holocaust, McCarthyism and other important events which took place during the last century.Santiago Lopez-Alfaro, a young Mexican filmmaker, is in Detroit to make a documentary about Mexican muralists and their work in the US. He also wants to capture the decay of a great city, \\"the first capital of the automobile, no less, the place where Henry Ford inaugurated mass production of the machine that governs our lives more than any government.\\" He goes on to narrate, \\"I wanted to photograph the ruin of a great industrial center as a worthy epitaph for our terrible twentieth century.\\" While Santiago is absorbed, studying the Diego Rivera mural at the Detroit Institute of Arts, he recognizes a familiar face - that of his own, spirited great great-grandmother, Laura Diaz. He proceeds to investigate, chronicle and relive her story, through various personal tragedies, her development into a great artist, and several marriages and love affairs. Against this fictional backdrop, Fuentes juxtaposes important historical events. And Laura Diaz seems to always be at the center of everything. She's everywhere - a veritable witness to history, reminiscent of Woody Allen's Zelig. And 'History' is as much a protagonist in this novel as Sra. Diaz. Fuentes' narrative, as usual, is driven by the ideas his characters represent. He sacrifices their natural development, frequently, to make his political and historical points. Indeed, the documentation of political upheavals, the rise and fall of various Mexican governments, and the lack of social and economic reforms are a constant here. The focus on the political and philosophical interests of the characters, with long sections of debate, makes for some dry reading at times, and certainly hampers the narrative's flow.Laura Diaz was born in 1898 and comes of age during her country's revolution, in which her beloved brother, Santiago, was killed. She marries a prominent union leader, but when she becomes restless after nine years and two sons, her husband advises her to focus on the home and children, rather than help him with the Worker's movement. She finds temporary solace in an affair, becomes part of a bohemian circle and, after a year, finds an interesting job with Diego Rivera, an acquaintance. She decides the only way to save herself from the passive, boring life of forced idleness is through work. Rivera, Frida Kahlo and Laura travel to Detroit, where the great master is to create a mural. The continuing epic of Laura's life, loves, adventures is fascinating. There are colorful stories within stories, but Laura is essentially pulled along by the force of history.I was disappiointed with \\"The Years With Laura Diaz.\\" Carlos Fuentes is a favorite author, and I have read his work in Spanish. I was expecting another masterpiece and this does not measure up to his usual standard. It is not an easy book to read. The information included is interesting, but there's an overabundance of it, to the detriment of the characters' development. Our heroine, appears to be little more than an observer, a front for Fuente's portrait of a century. The book is also very long. Although I usually enjoy long novels, especially when the prose flows, I felt like I was actually on a century-long journey myself, and couldn't wait for the conclusion - always a bad sign. For all it's epic quality,\\"The Years With Laura Diaz\\" left me with an empty feeling. Something crucial was missing. Perhaps I missed relating to three-dimensional characters.Carlos Fuentes, probably Mexico's greatest living writer, is the author of more than twenty books and has received many awards for his accomplishments as a novelist, essayist, and commentator, among them the Cervantes Prize in 1987.JANA"},{"Title":"Years With Laura Diaz","review":"This is a novel of great depth, written by a man who has lived his life observing, thinking, asking questions, considering and writing.

Fuentes draws on his own family history to weave a tale of love and tragedy and of extraordinary people whose lives and work influenced their times. Laura Diaz, the heroine both normal and unusual in her roles as wife and mother--lover and artist, waltzes through the years with grace and vitality. Her honesty and common sense approach to life make her an example for the many lives that she touches. She married a dashing young man in the labor movement andwas thrown into the political mainstream that coursed through Mexico City in the early part of the century. She also was the lover of more than one dashing and famous man as she joined the high life of Spanish-European society that existed in Mexico City. Diego Rivera and Frieda Kahlo became friends of hers, and she traveled with them to the United States as Diego painted his famous--and infamous--series of murals celebrating the workers. As a friend of Frieda's, Laura was able to tell the tragic story of the famous painter and her struggle with health and tragedy. The figure of Santiago, first the murdered brother of Laura and later her son and grandson, symbolizes the heroic persona who fights for what is right only to be cut down before his prime. Laura holds her love of these three in her heart, and eventually it sustains her through her life and into her new career. That in later life she became a famous photographer of the poor and downtrodden is indicative of the love she has for the three Santiagos, and for her husband and lovers, all of whom where involved in the people's movement. This novel encompasses all that is important in life, and it celebrates the courage and vitality of those who are willing to spend their lives for other's causes. The tracing of Mexico's history from revolution, corrupt politics and visionary idealism, interwoven with Laura's life, is fascinating, and leaves the reader with a better understanding not only of Mexico bul also of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Years With Laura Diaz","review":"Carlos Fuentes is an amazing writer. He writes in a beautiful, poetic style. As a narrator, he notices even the minute details and brings them to life with his writing. The problem for me is that with all this attention to detail and poetry, the story seems to get lost. I would have liked the plot to move more quickly. Mr. Fuentes does not seem to be in any hurry to tell the story or stay on track with the plot. A scene my divert into a long, lovely description of nothing much, and the reader and characters are left waiting for Mr. Fuentes to return to the narration of the plot. It is, as I stated, beautifully written, it is just not a style for which I care."},{"Title":"Years With Laura Diaz","review":"Fuentes aspires to cover over a hundred years of Mexican history in this family novel. Since I go to Mexico often, I was drawn in by the social, cultural, and political material -- which sometimes makes the novel read like a patriotic essay, relieved by plentiful critical comments on the government. And wouldn't you know it? Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera make an appearance. The main character is drawn with partial success. To me she gets most interesting when she discovers a new vocation late in life. Some of the others, like her husband and her lovers, are more interesting, perhaps only because they remain partly enigmatic. I'm 97% done reading this novel and I fully expect to finish it -- and that's a positive comment because I do not hesitate to abandon a novel that doesn't engage me. The book is passable as fiction. If you like to learn history by reading historical novels, it's worth a look."},{"Title":"Years With Laura Diaz","review":"I love reading magical realism tales from Latin America. And this novel had lots of promise, at its inception. However, somewhere in the storyline, the author began to debate and relate the series of political events that led up to the modern processes of Mexican government.Just when I was reveling in the waves of emotion and description that magical realism offers, Senor Fuentes inserted lots and lots of political facts, in a rather non-fictional manner. This constant change of tone and literary intent threw me off and eventually I gave up reading the book, which I rarely do. Maybe I was expecting one kind of read but got another. Maybe I'm less interested in Mexican political history than in the processes of Mexican culture mores.Maybe I will finish this novel but I will have to skim over the too dense and dry descriptions of the setting's historical facts, even though I know the author means to give more credence to his main characters' actions and thoughts. If you like Latin American history and literature, this book is for you.If you're a magical realism fan, or wonder what this genre relates, do try reading Gabriela Garcia Marquez, Jorge Amado and Isabel Allende."},{"Title":"Years With Laura Diaz","review":"I read the kindle version and though the formatting could use some work, particularly the lack of adequate space breaks between major shifts of scene or time.But upon finishing it my first reaction was \\"this was magnificent.\\" I can not understand reviews like some here, for instance the \\"...bla, bla, bla...\\" comment. My only conclusion is perhaps some readers are not willing to invest time and patience to uncover the grandeur of a great piece of literature.These are some of the aspects of the work I think make it magnificent.1. It's scope. The work covers a very long time period that includes; the political history of Mexicio at a key time in it's modern growth, the First World War as it relates to Spain and Fascism, love, marriage & infidelity, parenting, fascinating characters, etc, all well integrated in a seamless web through the ongoing development and interactions of the characters.2. The writing is so often poetic and beautiful and offers long beautiful poetic runs somewhat like a well crafted yet emotional long moving musical solo.3. The characters are well formed, real, human, complex, courageous, flawed, soulful and moral, varied, and interesting. The conversations between them could almost be published as a stand alone University reader for a literature, cultural geography, or history seminar discussion course.4. The development and growing maturity of Laura Diaze, the main character, could be a novella on its own. The evolution of her growth and emergence into a full giving maturity is worth the price of the novel.5. The characters are well integrated with each other, the time, the historic/human context issues, and the geography of the setting. This makes them living, believable people. Their individual identities are given depth, vulnerability, strength, intelligence, heart, and the ability to love despite their very human limitations.I do not know how you could ask for more from a novel, or have a \\"...blah, blah, blah\\" reaction to such a great work. I was sad to finish this novel, the first I have read by Fuentes. I came out of the experience of reading The Years With Laura Diaz admiring Fuentes as a painter and poet of life through his writing.As a closing note, I really enjoyed the integration of Diego Rivera (some of whose Murals in Mexico City I have photographed) and Frida. I also have spent time in some of the places and cities that are settings in the novel and it brought back memories of those places and the lovely Mexican people I got to know and work with in those travels. It made me want to go back and stay. Still, I do not give my review based on a sentimental basis. I love great literature and this stands up well with some of the works that have most moved me. In that sense it was as moving as War and Peace for me. Unforgettable."},{"Title":"Years With Laura Diaz","review":"This is a book I wish I had written; it is of a life, I feel I have lived. Senor Fuentes brilliantly composes a story that encompasses all that is grand and horrific about the evolution of a country, of a people, and of one life that reflected the emergence of the Mexico we know today. If you know anything about Mexico in all its riches and contrasting hues, this book confirms why we love it so. If you know nothing about Mexico, read it for the sheer poetry of one woman's life. Bravo Carlos! I can't wait to read whatever books you have written that I haven't read yet!!!"},{"Title":"Years With Laura Diaz","review":"the key moment in the Fall of Communism came when Soviet dissident intellectuals took advantage of Perestroika to demonstrate that Lenin was a totalitarian butcher. The sustaining myth of the Soviet Union and fellow travelers in the West had been that Stalin took a noble and righteous revolution and perverted it to his own ends, that Marxism would have worked, but for this artificial intervention by one monstrous man. The truth was quite different, that the Revolution was corrupt from it's inception, that Lenin and the Bolsheviks stole the Revolution from more popular and democratic Left parties, and that Lenin and the Soviets ruled through terror from the start. Once this final prop was kicked out from under the Soviet Union, it quickly collapsed.Comes now Carlos Fuentes, the Marxist novelist of Mexico, to argue that the Mexican Revolution was likewise pristine and honorable until it was corrupted by faithless leaders and corrupt one-party rule. In fact, this long (excruciatingly so) epic novel seeks to go back and revisit many such arguments from the 20th Century. It is quite audacious--he is after all trying to say, at the end of a Century that was decisively won by the forces of liberal democratic capitalism,, that the Socialist/Marxist Left was generally right about most issues--but it is neither convincing as history nor compelling reading.The story is ostensibly about the life of a famous photographer, Laura Diaz, as retold by her grandson who, at the start of the novel, recognizes her as one of the figures in a Diego Rivera mural. Fuentes charts her life through several marriages, numerous love affairs, various personal tragedies, and her late development into a respected artist. But all of this is juxtaposed against the events of the Century. In what quickly becomes a noticeable annoying contrivance, the main events of her life just happen to occur at the precise moments in history which the author wishes to comment upon--her life is really secondary to the march of world events. The problem with this is that, since the author obviously is less interested in her than in what's going on around her, it is hard for him to get us to care about her. Why should we care more than he does ?If you'll indulge me for a moment, I think I've discerned a pivotal structural flaw in the novel, though I admit I've not thought it out fully. It seems to me that most multi-generational historical epics like this don't merely pin themselves to one character and a batch of events, instead they are generally driven by a discrete set of events with a known conclusion (Winds of War comes to mind) or the central character/characters are trying to build or defend some family enterprise (Scarlett O'Hara had Tara, and in Tai-Pan, Dirk Struan had the Noble House). In the absence of such coherence imposing structures, the main character has to be incredibly interesting in order to keep our attention for hundreds and hundreds of pages and nearly a hundred years. Laura Diaz is simply not such a character.Now that is a significant weakness, but it's not fatal. Other authors have written great epic novels without one overwhelmingly interesting character : consider War and Peace. But if you don't have such a character for us to identify with and root for (or against), you had better have a sure hand on the tiller of events. It's here that Fuentes fails miserably. To take just one example, a major portion of the story features the community of Hollywood refuges from McCarthyism living in Mexico in the 1950's. Fuentes argues correctly that McCarthy was a demagogue run amok, smearing people for his own political reasons, rather than on the basis of evidence or out of any moral sense of right and wrong. But he then proceeds to excuse American Communists and to himself smear anti-Communism generally.At various points--in complete opposition to conclusive evidence that has come to light since the end of the Cold War--he maintains that the Rosenbergs were innocent, that Communist writers, directors and actors were not following orders from the central Party, that there was no basis for the anti-Communist movement, etc. At one point he says that :The day will come when all the accused will be rehabilitated and celebrated as cultural heroes, and the accusers will be the accused and degraded just as they deserve.In fact, at the end of the Cold War, who are the honored heroes ? Elia Kazan received a special Oscar for Lifetime Achievement. Whittaker Chambers received a posthumous Medal of Freedom from Ronald Reagan and was the subject of a major reassessment by Sam Tannenhaus. Even his journalism and reputation as a writer has been revived and rehabilitated; by any measure, his memoir, Witness, must be considered one of the major texts of the century.And what of the unrepentant Party members who refused to testify ? Alger Hiss, like the Rosenbergs, lies, unmourned, in a traitor's grave. Despite the continuing bouquets from the modern Left, the once towering reputations of Dashiell Hammett and Lillian Hellman are in tatters. The repellent pair having been exposed as doctrinaire Stalinsts, unswayed even by genocide. Take a look at books like Hollywood Party: How Communism Seduced the American Film Industry in the 1930s and 1940s (1998)(Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley), Not Without Honor : The History of American Anticommunism by Richard Gid Powers, Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case by Allen Weinstein, The Haunted Wood : Soviet Espionage in America- -The Stalin Era by Allen Weinstein, The Soviet World of American Communism (Annals of Communism) by John Haynes , Venona : Decoding Soviet Espionage in America by John Earl Haynes, and try to make an honest argument that the victims of McCarthyism were innocents. No, the tragedy of Joe McCarthy is not that the witch hunt was unwarranted, but that he was too irresponsible to lead it--not that lives were ruined, but that some of the wrong lives may have been ruined. There was in fact a Communist conspiracy to subvert American democracy; it was financed and directed from Moscow; and those who refused to testify before Congressional committees were aiding and abetting a foreign power.Perhaps more disturbing, and indicative of how oblivious Mr. Fuentes is to the true historical record is the absurd distinction that he repeatedly makes between Hitler and Stalin. He continues to maintain what one would have hoped would by now be an indefensible canard, that though both used evil means, Stalin at least had good intentions because communism was intended to help the workers, but that Hitler represented genuine evil because his ends were evil.Nazis and Communists are not the same thing. The difference is that Hitler believes in evil, evil is his gospel--conquest, genocide, racism. But Stalin must say he believes in the good, in the freedom of labor, in the disappearance of the state, and in giving to each according to his needs. He recites the gospel of the civil good.First of all, this ignores the inconvenient fact that Hitler was just as serious about Socialism as he was about racism. Second, it ignores the by now nearly incontrovertible argument that mass movements like Nazism and Communism have far more in common than they do that divides them. The work of authors like Eric Hoffer, F. A. Hayek, Paul Johnson, Allan Bullock, Robert Conquest, and a host of others should really have settled this issue. These movements are, by and large, driven by intellectuals who think that they know better than the masses how to run a country, adopt a nearly religious belief structure to justify their actions, and then unleash the destructive forces of followers who don't particularly care what the new system may bring, but know that they are losers in the current system. It is inevitable that such revolutions end in violence and repression, as every single one we've ever witnessed has in fact done. Finally, it assumes that ideal Communism is necessarily a good. The idea that a system based on oppressing one man to benefit another is de facto a good thing, is hardly a given, and, I would argue, is actually evil itself (see Orrin's review of The Communist Manifesto.)Which brings us to the Mexican Revolution, whose initial urges Fuentes works so hard to vindicate. In particular, he seems awestruck by the emphasis on worker rights, the six day work week, and the eight hour work day. I don't know enough about Mexican history to know whether this was truly the great focus of the Revolution (Fuentes tends to make the unfortunate assumption that we are as obsessed with Mexico and conversant with it's history as he is with us and ours), but let's accept Fuentes's insistence that this is what made it worthwhile. Elevation of these basic tenets to nearly sacred status requires one of two things : either they must be invested with some kind of absolute semi-talismanic level, must take on the quality of nearly religious commandments; or they are subject to being trumped repeatedly.

Dick book cover to cover twice, Clans of the Alphane Moon may not be a breath of fresh air, but it is a new plot. Although I found it kind of slow, who knows psychoses better than Dick? There are better ones out there, but you need it for your collection to be complete"},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"Beware. If you have a slightly twisted sense of humour, reading this book could make you seriously addicted to Mr. Dick. It was the first of his I read, and I ended up befriending a second-hand book dealer just to get hold of some of his rarer books. Sad but true.You have been warned."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"After having read almost every single book written by Philip K. Dick, I really feel like I could write a program (maybe in a Mad Lib style) that could generate brand new stories in the style of Philip K. Dick. Think I'm kidding? Ok - Man loses his (way, mind, faith) after being reamed by a (ex-wife, current wife, harpie girlfriend) only to discover that what he thought was (reality, truth, purpose) is really only a (illusion, lie, sham). So, after having said that, I have to say that out of all of Philip K. Dick's books, Clans of the Alphane Moon remains my personal favorite of them all. Written at the beginning of the period of time when he produced most of his books, Clans of the Alphane Moon somehow manages to use some of the standard tricks used in his other novels, yet here it still seems fresh and new. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"Though this does have the PKD signature on it, the plot is not exciting. One of his classic characteristics is that you almost have to be mentally ill to fully understand his concepts. This is no exception. As most PKD fans know, PKD suffered from mental illness himself, and he used it as fuel to write."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"There are precious few books by Dick I haven't read yet, and I still consider this one to be my very favorite.All of the classic, wonderful Dick themes are represented: Paranoia, conspiracy, maliciously evil women, simulacra, assassination attempts, and a telepathic slime mold from the planet Ganymede named Lord Running Clam, who may be the best Dick character ever written.Of all Dick's books, this one made me laugh out loud and shake my head with amusement the most. I would recommend it to hardcore Dick fans and first time Dick samplers alike."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"I wouldn't consider Clans to be PKD's best, but it is pretty good. What I found most interesting about this book was the variety. You have (as is common in PKD's works)a man who is struggling with his (in this case)ex-wife. There are lots of psychological and thought-provoking passages, as well. Then there's humor, like the fact that the main character's ex-wife was a marriage counselor! And who can forget the Ganymedean slime mold? But what this book mostly concentrates on (in my opinion) are the Pares (Paranoids), Ob-Coms (Obsessive Compulsives), Skitzes (Schizophrenics), Polys (Polymorphic Schizophrenics), Heebs (Hebephrenics), Manses (Manics), and Deps (Depressed). Although it isn't a prerequisite that you know what all these are (if you don't know already), it sure does help in understanding this book."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"When I started reading this book,it wasn't so clear where Dick wanted to arrive.But going on,I discovered to be in a road with no exit,and I started to explore the dark corridors of human mind.More a book on human behaviour than a science-fiction novel."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"Philip typically has a Big Question that underlies his books such as \\"What is reality?\\" or \\"What does it mean to be human?\\" He typically doesn't answer these questions, but leaves them up for the reader to decide. In this book, the question is \\"What is sanity?\\"It's the 21st century. The human race has set up colonies in the Alphane system. On one moon, Alpha III M2, a mental hospital was set up for those who couldn't handle the mental pressures of colonization. A war broke out between the humans and the native Alphanes, and as a result the mental patients have been left to their own devices for the past 25 years. The moon is now legally independent. The patients have broken up into Clans based on their ailments - the Deps are depressives, the Pares are paranoids, the Skitzes are schizophrenics, and so on.Mary Rittersdorf, a psychologist, is ostensibly recruited for a mission to treat the patients, although the true purpose is to re-establish the human legal claim to the moon. She is in the process of divorcing her husband, a CIA (Counter Intelligence Authority) agent named Charles Rittersdorf. Also assigned to the mission is \\"Dan Mageboom,\\" who, unknown to Mary, is not a human but a sim, a robot which can either run on its own or be remote controlled. Charles is assigned to operate the robot. Then he contemplates killing his wife...Typically with a Philip Dick novel, your ability to suspend your disbelief will be stretched a bit. Are the children of crazy people necessarily going to be crazy themselves? Well, if the whole world is crazy, what is sanity? And as the action switches back and forth from the Earth to Alpha III M2, you'll find yourself thinking \\"Are the Terrans any more sane than the, um, M2ians?\\"4 out of 5 stars because, although this is quite good, he's done better (\\"Valis\\" and \\"The Divine Invasion.\\")"},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"I've long been a fan of PKD. I first read \\"The Game of Death\\" and \\"Deus Irae\\" when published by DAW almost thirty years ago. At that point in my literary adventures, I found the books confusing, bizarre and almost plotless. Then I read \\"Do Androids Dream...\\" (in the movie tie-in as Blade Runner had just been released) and was more more impressed as the character of Decker had been created in heartbreaking detail. Finally I read \\"A Scanner Darkly\\" and was stunned; here I had discovered one of the most amazing books ever. I reread it several times, lent it to friends, and seriously discussed adapting it to the stage.Since then I have worked my way through the PKD canon and have only rarely been disappointed. And so, here I am thirty years late and I finally get around to reading \\"Clans of the Alphane Moon\\". In fact, I purchased a copy of the novel back in the late 80's but my best friend borrowed it before I ever had a chance to read it and of course, I never saw it again. Then I discovered a copy in the bargain bin at the University Bookstore and picked it up for $4.95 along with \\"Game Players of Titan\\". I guess it was time.Clans was published in 1964 when PKD was at the height of his first classic period; some would say his amphetamine period but I think stimulants are beside the point. Starbucks coffee kicks as much a punch these days as any white cross and what writer does not lean on cup'o joe for focus and inspiration? Within two hundred pages, PKD crams a truckload of characters, plot twists, sociological and technical speculations; one can see how an inexperienced reader would be overwhelmed by the experience. I cannot even imagine what some innocent scifi reader in 1964 would have thought of this profusion of imaginative elements not to mention surgical nipple dilation and out-of-body gandhis. Nobody else but PKD could have written this in 1964, and while many have tried to write in this style since, few succeed. PKD had by now perfected the Tolstoyan technique of interweaving subjective plot lines. No matter how fantastic, all the characters seem fully developed, even the aliens. It is unfortunate that PKD was not able to or did not bother to put more time and care into this novel. I believe that there was the potential for a masterpiece in this imaginative milieu. In particular, the last third of the book seems rushed and underdeveloped. Most flawed novels needed a good editor to remove a hundred pages of fat and they could have been classic works. \\"Clans of the Alphane Moon\\" is the opposite, perhaps another hundred pages would have allowed the ideas and characters therein to have flowered into something even more memorable."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"This novel starts so promisingly. Its created world of clans of people each with a specific mental illness, and yet 'cooperating' with each other, is very interesting. Its counterworld with the marriage guidance counsellor whose marriage fails, and her husband the CIA writer who scripts and operates remote simulacra (who could resist that!) and who refuses to take up the more lucrative job of a TV comedian's script writer (just one of a team), opens all sorts of intriguing possibilities. Including when these worlds come together.And yet the end of the novel is such a disappointing 'space opera' with a romantic ending that seems unlikely coming from the pen of Philip Dick. Perhaps he was rushed to the end to earn a few extra dollars. And I guess it was practice for the more mature novels that followed."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"Clans of the Alphane Moon had a promising topic - what happens when a whole society is (severely and persistently) mentally ill. Although this is not a new idea in fiction, it is one of the first to have structured a whole work of fiction on this idea. Unfortunately, although the book starts interestingly with a characterization of various psychopathologies and their impact on the society involved, it quickly deteriorates to stereotyping and to engulfment of most if not all involved - including from another (human) society - in psychopathology. The end, where so-called normals become part of psychopathological society, epitomizes this undeep approach to human experience and behavior. There are some additional flaws that are more technical (and hence less important), such as the unbelievability of a psychologist and people who know her discovering late in the day that she is and has been for long (very) mentally ill. Still, the book was an entertaining and easy read."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"Though not Philip K. Dick's best-written or most ambitious novel, Clans of the Alphane Moon is highly recommended for fans; one should certainly read the more famous works first but should definitely stop here eventually. There is almost no plot, but the book abounds in delicious signature weirdness; we truly never know what will happen and keep reading feverishly to find out. The book has a wealth of suspense and surprises that will delight fans. More importantly, Dick's trademark reality manipulation is ever present; he plays with our senses, truly keeping us on edge. The dark humor, heavy irony, and sheer weirdness for which he is known are as strong as ever; this is one of his funniest books, though the humor is as ever far from conventional. Clans also deals with customary Dick themes like paranoia, government oppression, and mental illness. This last is especially important; Dick focused relentlessly on it, but this is in many ways his fullest and most thorough exploration. He shows stunning knowledge of and sympathy for the mentally ill, giving a fresh perspective on their problems and a bold new angle on their treatment. This gives the book substantial meat, as do some of the more allegorical elements, e.g., an attack on racism and general xenophobia via the slime mold. Clan's characters are also some of Dick's most vivid - far from traditionally likable but certainly engaging. All told, while this is of course essential for fans, it is also a good choice for those not usually keen on Dick, as it has several elements - interstellar war and politics, etc. - popular in science fiction but not usually common in him."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"Last year I've attended a seminar on \\"Philosophy & Sci-Fi\\" and was delighted when PKD was chosen the first author to discuss. I plunge into reading and re-reading his works.Obviously the second step of my renewed PKD-mania is to produce new reviews!\\"Clans of Alphane Moon\\" (1964) is a great sci-fi novel somewhat underrated in PKD's opus maybe due to its complex story.This book, as each of PKD's novels, is unique, captivating and full of action, moral and ethical issues. Characters are not heroes, just human beings doing their best to survive in a hostile environment. They may be selfish and even despicable but within them there is always a spark of altruism trying to emerge.The story is as follows: there is a moon situated in Alpha Centauri system where humans have installed a hospice. After war erupted among humans and alphans the asylum has been abandoned for 25 years.In those years the ex-patients has grouped in seven clans according to their mental ailment, managed to survive and coexist among them.After some years of peace the Terran power is trying to claim alphane's moon sovereignty again and send a medical aid mission as a Trojan horse.Main characters are Chuck Rittersdorf an agent from the CIA (Counter Intelligence Authority) who is having a conflictive divorce from his wife; Dr. Mary Rittersdorf psychiatrist going bona fide in the fake humanitarian mission and Chuck's ex-wife; Lord Running Clam a telepathic amorphous yellow ganimedean; Bunny Hentman a powerful TV comic star and the Councilors of the Clans.What a great mixture of odd characters! PKD manage an intricate story of spies, politics, mental illness and marital conflict delivering a gripping tale with his trademark talent.Do not expect a neat \\"these are the good guys\\", that's not PKD style. The reader must compromise with the story and choose its own solution to the puzzle.As usual with PKD writings, an unfathomable melancholic undercurrent traverses the whole story, forcing every character to wonder \\"why am I here?\\"This book is real good. Not only sci-fi fans may appreciate it, general inquisitive public too!Enjoy!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"This is really a silly book, but I love it anyway. Not for any greatness of writing, but for its inspired silliness in plot. Imagine a world (the alphane moon) where once there existed a hospital for the insane. Imagine that the moon was abandoned by all but the inmates, who manage to create their own society. I love it!! Many times in my life, I have wondered which clan I was currently a member of!! The wife of the protagonist is typical Philip K. Dick domineering, evil wife. One wonders about his personal relationships. At any rate, this is worth a quick read."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"The idiocy of modern psychiatric notions are devastatingly exposed in this 1964 book by the master of the mind-bending novel. Follow the adventures of Chuck Rittersdorf as he tries to excape from the clutches of his shrewish, domineering wife who maneuvers him to the third moon of the Alpha star system where a lost colony of 'nuts' has long since been abandoned.But are they nuts? &quot;Clinically&quot;: yes. But in actuality they're as 'normal' as the rest of us; that is, all screwed up.The CIA is involved in its usual machinations but Chuck wins through in the end, loses his wife and gets the girl with the help of a telepathic Ganymedean slime mold. One of Dick's funniest and most pointed stories. And at $4.45 you can't go wrong for one of the best reads you'll ever have"},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"Philip K. Dick had an on-again off-again relationship with the physchological crowd, and this absurdist novel sends up all the seriousness and pseudo science. Characters get trapped in their self-defined neuroses and adapt their traits to the rigors of interplanetary colonization. After reading it, ask yourself how these characters would do empaneled on Oprah. Only remember, the book was written in the fifties! PKD sure saw victim culture coming! It's a terrific book. Buy it"},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"After my latest fugue on Planet Phil, I discovered that I had not reviewed this one. First off, I don't think this is Dick's strongest work but is certainly emblematic. Frustratingly it makes it an ideal entry point for the novice PKD fan but certainly obscures what makes him unique. While not as clunky as \\"The Pennultimate Truth\\", I just don't feel that it is Phil firing on all cylinders. While the characters are Dickian, the connect is not as strong as a \\"Radio Free Abermuth\\" or a \\"Valis\\". It is almost no surprise that the alien, Lord Running Clam, is the most sympathetic character here. Running Clam is almost like the reader in that he is involved but not entirely bonded to the lead character. Now the ideal rating would be three and half as the constant reader of PKD can see that this as a step in the author's movement from world builder to philosopher. Each turn of the plot points towards a unique point of view that pushes SF towards a more personalized vision than a mere excercise in space opera. Admittedly while I found the texture of the plot more interesting than the usual \\"how is this going to end\\", I do recognise the cleverness of the construction. And it is certainly more engaging than the dry construction of \\"The World That Jones Made\\". Dick is, if not a dazzling stylist, a remarkably focused writer. His interests are crystaline and consistent. It is just here that it is smuggled inside a late 50s/early 60s SF novel. While a novel like, say, \\"Counter Clock World\\" is more consistent with later period PKD, this is certainly the breeziest of Phil's novels and much better written than some of his early pieces. So if you are going to read this just make sure to make it part of a double header. Perhaps team it up with \\"The Man in The High Castle\\" (A classic with a bit more heart) or \\"Now Wait For Last Year\\" (A more mind-melting traditonal SF work from the mid-period). Then make sure to follow up with something really great like the aforementioned \\"Valis\\" or \\"Ubik\\"."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"This may not be his best book of them all, but a very interesting, stimulating tongue-in-cheek psychological drama nevertheless."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"Besides having a really great storyline/plot. that plot is full of humor and brilliant ideas. definitely an underrated SF masterpiece by Philip K. Dick"},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"I love PKD. But this book belongs at the bottom of the PKD pile. Don't make it your first read by PKD. Predictable, underdeveloped, ludicrous, and tedious, without the usual PKD reality or thinking challenges. Sadly, the best character is the slime mold."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"The SF author Barry N. Malzberg described \\"Clans of the Alphane Moon\\" as a perfectly typical Philip K. Dick work. I'm inclined to agree; for better or worse, \\"Clans\\" has almost everything we anticipate from this author.It takes place at an abandoned mental hospital colony on a small moon. The ex-patients and their progeny have divided themselves into separate but interdependent groups according to their complaints - paranoia, hebephrenia, depression, mania, obsessive-compulsive disorder, delusional and polymorphous schizophrenias. Representatives from each clan meet regularly to discuss matters of importance, including the sudden arrival of a psychiatric team from Earth. The clans, mentally ill as they seem to be, must decide how to respond to this new circumstance. PKD may have been one of the first to let the lunatics take over the asylum and then form a government.The novel, like much of PKD's work, also deals with the sadness that sometimes comes with human relationships. Mary Rittersdorf (PKD was a whiz at character names) gets an offer to join the psychiatric team going to the asylum moon. So she divorces her husband Chuck, takes him for everything he's got, and moves away, all to fulfill her career ambitions. Chuck is furious, to the point of suicide, then homicide. Eventually, both Rittersdorfs end up on the moon. This being an astronomical body full of mental patients, and in a PKD novel at that, things don't work out quite the way either one them expects.\\"Clans\\" includes some standard PKD aliens as well. The Rittersdorfs and the people of the moon come to the attention of, among the various non-Terrans in evidence, a sentient slime mold named Lord Running Clam (I told you PKD was a whiz at character names). This being's behavior is that of a slightly innocent Himalayan guru. His power is anything but.PKD's books often questioned how we perceive reality, and this novel is no exception. Do we ever perceive the truth? How can we learn the truth? Is there even any advantage to doing so? Some of the novels, like \\"Eye in the Sky\\", deal with these questions directly - they suggest, for instance, that the world is really someone else's delusion. Here, the issues are more subtle, which is not surprising. After all, most of the story takes place on a planet full of people whose grip on reality is tenuous at best. Then again, if the whole planet experiences reality as fluid, are the Rittersdorfs so sure they're wrong?And there's also the multiple interweaving plotlines, the sense of vast conspiracy victimizing the working man, the slightly clunky but generally convincing dialogue, the idea that empathy will save the world - about the only classic PKD theme missing from this novel is the use of psychoactive drugs. Then again, a lot of these characters have a problematic relationship with reality when clean and sober. And I'm not talking only about the former inmates.All right, it's true - \\"Clans of the Alphane Moon\\" is the pure expression of PKD's mid-1960s style, or close enough so the seams don't show. What does that tell us?For one thing, it tells us something about his attitude toward women (God knows how I missed that in all my previous reviews). The women in PKD's work can have many good qualities, but generally they don't seem truly human or humane unless they have some man to look after. In extreme cases, these women need a man to just plain control them. Mary Rittersdorf may be the worst of the bunch as the novel opens. She's a hard, mercenary, castrating harpy, who thinks she's being sane and rational. The revelation at the end regarding her mental state is no excuse. PKD was married five times and had his troubles in and out of relationships, and no wonder, if \\"Clans\\" is really typical of him,.One of the tragedies of PKD's life was that he failed at a cherished ambition - to make a career as a writer of both mainstream and science fiction. Nevertheless, like a lot of things, this may have been a blessing in disguise, and \\"Clans\\" illustrates the point. Since PKD was not allowed to publish both mainstream and science fiction, he was forced to combine them. This led him to fashion something extremely powerful both in \\"Clans\\" and elsewhere.Some have suggested that PKD used SF material to avoid a painful examination of the life issues he raised. As far as I'm concerned, \\"Clans\\" allows those issues room to breathe that they'd never get in mainstream fiction. Ask yourself this question - do you really want to read another novel about a couple at each other's throats in middle-class suburbia? You know all about that story already, not only from books but from down the block. Well, what about the same story on a planetwide insane asylum at war? Not only is that new and different, but with that backdrop the characters have to deal with the issues, rather than avoiding them in the swirl of daily life. Escapist literature, my foot - SF like this is in some ways the most realistic of all.Finally, as in all but a very few of PKD's books, \\"Clans\\" concludes with a message of hope. Let's face it, in a novel where almost every character suffers from some mental malformation, anything short of total annihilation is remarkable. When, as here, the characters manage to survive, thrive, and even care for each other, it's more like a miracle, fictional though it may be.That's sort of the main point right there. PKD spent years without intimate relationships, underappreciated, lacking in means of support, and maybe even mentally unbalanced, yet he insisted on ending his most typical work with hope. Maybe this is why so much of his work is so moving - his characters act like dizzy fools, but eventually they try to love each other. That's just what happens here. Right on.Benshlomo says, You gotta have heart."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"Years before computers could create virtual realities by dozens, Philip K. Dick, by the sole power of his words, was describing books after books virtual mental universes that were a lot more frightful than those our beloved techno-directors try vainly to shape nowadays. Among the four novels he published in 1964, MARTIAN TIME-SLIP and CLANS OF THE ALPHANE MOON were treating this Dickian theme by essence.After an interstellar war that ended 15 years ago, the world has forgotten this alphane moon and its inhabitants. Alpha III was considered as a giant hospital for mentally ill people by the Earth; now maniaco-depressives, schizophrenics and obsessive have founded cities and try to leave peacefully. But Alphans and Earth want to retake possession of this forgotten moon for obscure political reasons.If you liked EYE IN THE SKY, a novel published 7 years before by PKD, you will appreciate CLANS OF THE ALPHANE MOON and its numerous points of views. The same events are described and analyzed by the different characters and one is lead to understand very soon that there is no objectiveness in Reality and that the actions of so-called sane people often obey to rather perverse motivations. Anyway, if you're a Philip K. Dick fan, you already know by now that there is no such thing as Reality !A book to discover if you are lucky enough to find it."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"Clans of the Alphane Moon was written in the same year as three other books by Philip K Dick after he peaked early in his career with the Hugo award winning - The Man in the High Castle, highly original in either being a very divergent type of sci-fi or a deviating political comedy. Dick is often cited as the best science-fiction writer who does not write sci-fi, but some of his works, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep (Blade Runner) and UBIK, come across as more descriptive in the future they present, rather than ideology and dialogue driven. Clans of the Alphane Moon tends to be a situational environmental type of Dick presentation, rather than then latter, somewhat harder, but more heady science-fiction herbs that rely on dialogue and thoughts to tell their story. It is the environments the writer conjures up that makes this one of Dick's easier books to read, comprehend and probably enjoy.Clans of the Alphane Moon is like an early version of UBIK, developing a series of events, rather than a full story, to engage characters with other characters, in the most interesting of environments, under the most oddest circumstances. It focuses on dysfunctional relationships from the persona and how that is reiterated through the cosmos like an expanding fractal, Dick himself was married five times, here a couple, in process of getting separated, end up on a Moon run by the offspring clans of various mentally ill people who once occupied a Terra owned hospital there. Each clan has a personality character disorder that affects their role in life, down to their functions in government offices and their own disturbed nuclear family (again we have the dysfunctional relationship problem), with the looming background crisis of a CIA backed pharmaceutical company invading the Moon, to reclaim all the citizens and lands because they are all genetically insane - only to be double-crossed by Terra's entertainment industry, homicidal CIA agents turned scriptwriters, walking talking telepathic slime moulds, RBX303s and government executive love date drink spiking. It is not as funny or as heady as UBIK but certainly is a lot crazier.Alphane Moon has all the ingredients that you can expect in a good Dick novel but maybe not as much philosophy as it could have delivered on given such a rich premise, but then again Dick is always more suggestive and overall elusive in that he never delivers on it straight in a predictable way and is the reason why second guessing the next page will never turn out the way you expect making Alphane Moon as original as any of his other works with classic characters like CIA robot simulacra and slime moulds that regenerate by sporing when they die, a galactic mini-drama with an innovative design, although crazy in parts, that is exactly what the Alphane Moon is... but then again how do the people from Terra really compare?This is one of Dick's earlier works and maybe a little more down the avenue of choosing a follow up Dick novel to one of his more readable classics like Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep or Ubik, where the reader is urged to go first, and certainly try to get in The Man in the High Castle to see how polarized this science-fiction writer is, the latter works towards the end of his career more metaphysical in nature as the writer descended into his own madness or genius (he believed an entity called VALIS was controlling him and even wrote a book about it).I choose this after reading \\"The Simulacra\\" and will move onto the other novel he did that same year \\"Martian Time-Slip\\" next. See you there."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"This book has all the hallmarks of Dick's body of work without being one of this best novels. It is certainly mining a rich vein of story-- an abandoned mental hospital on a small moon evolves its own complex society and corresponding psi abilities. After the war that resulted in the abandonment ends, Earth intends to reclaim the colony by launching a mission in the best colonial tradition-- occupation disguised as a humanitarian mission. Add into this mix a feuding couple whose efforts to destroy each other place them squarely in the middle of the action. Clans of the Alphane Moon (1964) has all the ingredients for a great book, and it is without a doubt a good one.For me, the difference between a book like this and some of Dick's more important works are how well he works out the ideas that he uses as part of the plot. Clans is occasionally a little frantic, with images and new thoughts tossed together in a kind of mental salad. Each one of the bits was fascinating, and I couldn't help but wish that he had spent a bit more time over the respective moments. And, yeah, I also wasn't in love with Dick's view on women or marriage here. I know that it's just a novel, but I can't help but think that Mary is unnecessarily evil-- was Dick going through one of his relationship breakdowns during the writing of this?I'd certainly recommend this to Dick fans. If you don't already know the big novels in his body of work, then I would suggest that you begin somewhere else.VALISis my unquestioned favorite, butThe Man in the High Castleis also amazing."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"\\"Clans of the Alphane Moon\\" was one of six books that sci-fi cult author Philip K. Dick saw published in the years 1964 and '65. Released in 1964 as a 40-cent Ace paperback (F-309, for all you collectors out there), it was his 14th sci-fi novel since 1955. This period in the mid-'60s was a time of near hyperactivity for the author. Under the influence of prescription uppers (like one of \\"Clan\\"'s central characters, Chuck Rittersdorf, who takes extraterrestrial \\"thalamic stimulants of the hexo-amphetamine class\\" in order to work two jobs), his output during that time was both prodigious and wildly imaginative. \\"Clans,\\" although it may be accused of being underdeveloped and shows signs of being hastily written, IS nevertheless as fun as can be, and a really wild ride.In the book, we are introduced to some of the residents of the second moon of Alpha Centauri's third planet: Alpha III M2. A mental hospital had existed there some 25 years before, its residents left to their own devices when Earth abandoned this world back when. Now, in the year 2055 or so, the former inmates have most certainly taken over the asylum, and the moon is ruled by the six titular clans, organized according to their members' various mental imbalances. Thus, there are the Manses (manics), the Pares (paranoiacs), the Heebs (hebephrenics), the Skitzes (schizophrenics), the Ob-Coms (obsessive-compulsives) and the Polys (polymorphous schizophrenics). Some of these residents, mainly the Heebs and Skitzes, have even developed various \\"psionic\\" powers, such as the ability to foretell the future via visions and to levitate! To this literally crazy world comes a group of disparate characters, drawn there for various reasons revolving around the Alphans' and Terrans' annexation claims. Mary Rittersdorf is a psychiatrist, there to assess and analyze the population; Chuck, her husband, a CIA (Counter Intelligence Authority) agent, is there to kill his ex-wife, with whom he had recently split; and the famous TV comedian Bunny Hentman is present for political reasons of his own. And then there is Lord Running Clam, easily the most memorable and likable character in this book: a telepathic, self-locomoting, yellow slime mold from Ganymede (!) who befriends Chuck and helps him on his adventure.As you may have inferred, there is some pretty zany sci-fi plotting involved here, with 36 named characters, and Dick mixes his stew with a good deal of zest and humor. The novel is one of the author's more accessible ones, with none of his trademarked abnegations of reality to blow the reader's mind. Still, not everything is as it seems, double agents abound, human-seeming \\"simulacra\\" are ubiquitous (\\"Person, shmerson,\\" one of them tellingly says at one point) and moral truths are slippery things (\\"Quid est veritas...what is truth?\\" one of the Pares asks). And Dick's Earth of the mid-21st century almost seems as whacky as the Alphane moon (and perhaps that is the point). Nipple-dilation and extreme breast-augmentation surgeries for women are common (50-lb. breasts?!?!?!), lawyers use \\"potent-cameras\\" to take pictures of people's future deeds, and the CIA uses programmed propaganda robots to spread the good word about the U.S.A.I must say that as much as I enjoyed \\"Clans\\" (and it IS an extremely enjoyable work), I was still left with the feeling that the book could have been so much more. As with some other Dick books that I have recently read, this one cries out to be 100 pages or so longer, or to have a sequel added on to it. Heck, I could've used another novel just featuring Lord Running Clam himself! Still, what the author HAS given us is a significant achievement, and yet another feather in his already crowded cap."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"This is one of Dick's funniest novels, in spite of the fact that the plot centers on a lethal marital relationship-Chuck and Mary Rittersdorf are actually trying to kill each other. He is depressed and resigned in the midst of their breakup; she is bitchy and vindictive, planning to take him for all he is worth and more. Their showdown culminates out on the distant moon Alpha III M2, a former hospital world inhabited entirely by the clinically insane. The former patients have adapted well to having been left alone by psychiatrists, living in relative peace with each other by grouping into different \\"clans\\" according to their psychosis. Their social functions are defined by their type of abnormality. For example, the Pares (paranoids) live in Adolfville and constitute the statesman class. But there is nothing inherently crazier about their society than the one we find on Earth. It should be noted that the sanest and most empathetic character in the book is Lord Running Clam, a telepathic Ganymedean slime mold, who saves Chuck from suicide and lines him up with a more compatible woman. This is classic PKD with all his usual neuroses but also a good dose of humor and hope."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"CLANS OF THE ALPHANE MOON has so many hysterical, sarcastic and insightful passages you'll want to memorize most of the book.

This book is typical PKD genius - Philosophy, theology, madness, and above all the looming question of \\"What is real?\\" - this book has it all. And delivered in a riveting, fast-paced and dizzying style.

The characterizations are crisp and well representational of our own inner reflections of his personal struggle as an independant thinker in a disfunctional world. A brilliant satire of the modern insistence of society to pigeonhole its members, the conflicts and characters show early keys to understanding the developement of later efforts in his writings."},{"Title":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","review":"Phillip Dick was one the most philosophic of modern American writers. &quot;Clans of the Alphane Moon&quot;, may be his most deeply personal revelation of what he saw as &quot;Reality&quot;. Ultimate truth was his goal; a truth in the guise of science fiction. Undiluted Philip Dick can be a bit difficult even to veterans of his multi-dimensional perspective. &quot;Clan&quot; is not for the faint of heart.

Really, there's no reason to waste any time with it when you have a (well-edited, suspenseful) simulacrum called &quot;Valis,&quot; his never-topped Hugo winner from 1963 (&quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;) and a much spicier, sadder and more compelling '70s period romp (&quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot;). This is really nothing more than a draft, and readers who think this is a masterpiece just haven't read enough of the master to tell the difference. The grave robbers should have been content with their &quot;Total Recall&quot; residuals and left the corpse alone."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This omnibus edition of THE LEAGUE OF FRIGHTENED MEN, AND BE A VILLAIN, and CURTAINS FOR THREE contains 5 rather than 3 cases, like its sibling omnibus FIVE OF A KIND, because CURTAINS FOR THREE is itself a collection of 3 short stories: \\"The Gun with Wings\\" (1948), \\"Bullet for One\\" (1948), and \\"Disguise for Murder\\" (1950).The selection of titles is an odd assortment. For more detailed discussion of the individual works herein, see reviews of the 3 separate books; no changes were made to include them here. They have few points in common, not even being 3 back-to-back books in publication order. While they're no worse here than taken separately, this omnibus edition provides no added value.THE LEAGUE OF FRIGHTENED MEN (1935) was the 2nd Wolfe book, and first appeared in installments that summer in _The Saturday Evening Post_ as FRIGHTENED MEN. Wolfe's strict schedule and so on weren't rigidly enforced until several books into the series, and Archie's character has rough edges that will be smoothed as he has time to develop.Years ago, before the Crash, a gang of young Harvard students crippled Paul Chapin in a hazing accident. Ever since, they've watched over him out of guilt, although he was never likeable; even his fiancee jumped at the excuse of his accident to break their engagement. (She even added insult to injury by marrying one of his tormentors, although she wouldn't see it that way - Chapin's *very* self-contained.) But in spite of the pitying non-friendship of the self-styled \\"League of Atonement\\", Chapin has managed to make a life and a career for himself; he's now a successful and controversial author.Now various accidents(?) have struck down apparently random members of the League, and they're finally giving Chapin some respect - they believe he's finally taking his revenge, and as a group, they want to engage Wolfe to make it stop. (Archie privately calls them the \\"League of the White Feather\\" rather than the name in the title of the book, being far from impressed. Handing someone a white feather used to be one way of accusing the person of cowardice.)AND BE A VILLAIN (1948) was the 13th Wolfe book, and the first of his recorded brushes with his nemesis, Arnold Zeck. The story would more logically be grouped with the other two Zeck books, and in fact this was done years after the publication of FULL HOUSE with the omnibus TRIPLE ZECK. AND BE A VILLAIN is one of the cases in which Wolfe drums up a little business rather than waiting for clients to come to him - in this instance, after Archie fills out Wolfe's form 1040.Archie always referred to this case in later years as \\"the Orchard case\\". Cyril Orchard died from drinking a poisoned glass as a guest on the Madeleine Fraser show - not only during a live broadcast, but during a live commercial for the product in question. *Ouch*. It's no wonder that when Wolfe sends Archie to Madeleine Fraser suggesting that she hire him, her network and the sponsors' council fall over themselves asking why he didn't come to them *first*. As usual when Wolfe has corporate entities as clients, they're facing a publicity disaster of magnitude one, and their *real* concern is to handle *that*; solving any murder or murders is a side issue. And as usual, this brings up potential conflicts of interest.CURTAINS FOR THREE (1951) was the 18th Wolfe book, but the individual stories were first published in magazines.\\"The Gun with Wings\\" (1948) was found beside the body of Albert Mion, one of the Met's top tenors, and a matching bullet was found through the roof of his mouth - an apparent suicide. His widow and her would-be fiancee - the Gazette's music critic - can't help suspecting each other of murder, and want Wolfe to uncover the truth. Some of the characters' attitudes make this a period piece.\\"Bullet for One\\" (1948) is a case saddled with timetables: the victim was shot while riding through Central Park, and was seen by a mounted patrolman only half an hour before his horse came in riderless. Leavening the usual dryness of timetables, however, we have not only a snakepit of motives among the 6 main suspects, but Cramer's reaction to Wolfe within range of a high-profile case, and the mounted patrolman, who can give Archie a run for his money in the smart-aleck department.\\"Disguise for Murder\\", a.k.a. \\"The Twisted Scarf\\", \\"The Affair of the Twisted Scarf\\" (1950) is one of several occasions when a murder takes place not only on the premises of Wolfe's brownstone, but in the office. In this instance, the victim was one of the few personable young women who came to call when Wolfe opened the plant rooms to the Manhattan Flower Club for an afternoon. Not only did Archie notice Cynthia before her death - she asked for a meeting with Wolfe, frightened after recognizing someone she thought was a murderer among the other guests. Finding her dead after she trusted him to help her made this a bit personal for Archie; Cramer's sealing the office as a crime scene made it personal for *Wolfe*. :)"},{"Title":"Mayo Clinic On Healthy Weight","review":"I have been fighting excess weight all of my life, and have lost the same weight numerous times (then gained it all back, plus more).

To me, they are some of the best in the world in giving wanted information in an easy-to-read and enjoyable style and format. HEALTHY WEIGHT is divided into three parts: Getting Motivated, How to Lose Weight and When You Need More Help. At the beginning of each chapter there are about ten short sentences in bold print the key you in on the main points of the chapter which are very helpful and motivating.Here are some key points that I have gained from reading that I'd like to remember and share:&quot;You have to cultivate a positive attitude about making lifestyle changes.&quot;&quot;Muscle burns more calories than fat does.&quot;&quot;Strength training can help burn calories at rest by maintaining muscle mass.&quot;&quot;There's evidence that being satisfied may be more strongly determined by the volume and weight of food you consume rather than the number of calories. In other words, fruits, vegetables and other high-fiber foods are bulkier...and fill you up better without the extra calories.&quot;&quot;If you focus on your health, then you'll develop healthy habits. If you develop healty habits, then the pounds will take care of themselves.&quot;We could learn a lot from the Chinese: &quot;The Chinese in Asia consume significantly more calories than do the Chinese in North America, yet they get a much smaller percentage of their calories from fat, weigh less, and are leaner. Their diet is predominantly plant-based, and the get about 90 percent of their calories from nonanimal sources. They also spend more time in vigorous activities.&quot;&quot;To limit calories, go easy on portion size and high-sugar and high-fat foods.&quot;&quot;Eat half the amount of food you normally eat, and eat more slowly.&quot;&quot;Eat when you are physically hungry, not when the clock says it is time to eat.&quot;&quot;Eradicate the &quot;D&quot; word...maintaining weight loss requires permanent change in activity levels and nutritional habits.&quot;These tips are from just the first five chapters.

There's a wealth of information for all so enjoy reading this book and learning great tips to help you lose weight and maintain your loss successfully.Soar!"},{"Title":"Mayo Clinic On Healthy Weight","review":"I've fought my weight my whole life. I've always been afraid of \\"fad\\" diets or diets that exclude one particular food. I think they are not a healthy way to lose weight. Everyone kept telling me to \\"eat a balanced diet\\" but no one explained what that meant. People talk about saturated fats, trans fats, etc and I felt like they were speaking a foreign language. My friends would count calories or carbs and would become frustrated. I didn't want to do any of that.I bought the \\"Mayo Clinic Healthy Weight for Everybody\\" when we moved and I had plenty of time for a \\"project\\". It is a 12 week program designed to get you into the habit of eating healthy. The first three weeks were a lot of work and took a lot of dedication. I had to weigh and measure everything. After the first three weeks, my eyes adjusted and were able to do the measurments without the scale and cups. Some of the recipes are a lot of prep and there is a lot of cutting of vegi's and fruits. My husband and my 2 teenage kids didn't mind the changes (except brown rice) so after the first 3 weeks \\"learning curve\\", it all worked out well. I lost 25 lbs in 12 weeks and I never even got into the exercise part. After the 12 weeks, I stopped tracking my number of servings for 3 months. I still ate the same foods and made sure I didn't eat \\"A LOT\\" or high calorie foods. I stopped losing weight but I didn't gain it all back either. I have started tracking my servings again and have started working on the exercise. I have set my goal to lose another 25 lbs in the next 12 weeks.I agree with everyone else here that the information is presented in a way that is easy to understand and explains it all. The book gets indepth but it is presented in a way that if you don't care what \\"trans fat\\" is, you can skip that part. I've even gien this book as presents to friends and family.

If you are like me, and need someone to guide you along so you don't lose track of your goal or cheat (oh, come on, we all do it!), this is the book for you. A full twelve-week menu is laid out for you, with a food pyramid where each serving is shown by an empty box that you check off as you eat it. A weight chart and activity chart are also available for use. The main goal is to eat more fruit and veggies, which it gives great suggestions for. If you are willing to invest the time, you will get results. I found that I am starting to feel comfortable switching out options for other alternatives, but the guide still makes sure that I am getting what I need each day. I have already lost 5.8 lbs in three weeks--your goal will typically be 1-2 lbs a week.

I was fairly successful on the Body for Life program, but it took too much time. All I did on that program was eat and workout. I have a life.

I then ballooned back up to being obese. My doctor tried to talk me into a gastric bypass because my weight was getting so bad.

I was training to compete as a triathlete, and considered myself pretty healthy and in good physical condition. I assumed that if I lost 5 - 10 pounds, I would be hard as a rock. When my rock-hard abs didn't appear on schedule, I decided to keep on losing weight until they did. Such is the male ego.For me the Mayo Plan has turned out to be a good basic program for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. It also made me much more competetive as an athlete --- 30 pounds is a lot of excess weight to carry on a bike or on a run!(..)I'm quite enthusiastic about the Mayo Plan.

So many cookbooks have healthy recipes; single meals that may or may not be easy to prepare. Those of us who are nutritionally (or behaviorally) challenged may find more benefit with an approach that more closely resembles a battle plan. This book provides one in the form of a 3 month menu chock full of healthy, 1200 calorie per day, meals. For example:Breakfast: 1 piece of toast, 1 cup milk, and an applie.Lunch: Turkey Sandwich.Dinner: Beef Stew (Which I usually make on Sundays and my family of 3 gets 3 meals out of)Throughout the Day: Make sure to get 4 fruit servings and 4+ vegetable servings.I'm no cook, but even I can follow simple instructions in the kitchen.Battle plan in hand, I took this book to heart. For 3 months I journalled all the food I ate, I exercised, and I closely followed the menu plan in the appendix. In a 3 month period I lost 30 lbs and each day felt increasingly energetic. I have maintained my weight, mealplan, and a high level of energy for 2 years now. I stick to the basic 1200 calorie diet and do not really feel hungry. In fact, my old ~3000 calorie per day sugar habit had me feeling much hungrier than the high fiber high nutrition lifestyle presented in this book.Whenever I get to talking about health and nutrition with a friend I bring this book up. I think it is an invaluable aid. Anyone wishing to lose weight or increase their energy level might benefit from this book.

He partakes of everything to extremes in his marvelous palace - food, wine, women, and most importantly, knowledge. His mother Catharis encourages and fosters his love of the dark arts, by which he comes to summon a Giaour, a foul demon.The Giaour promises the voracious Vathek to grant him access to the realm of Eblis and Soliman, where he will command all demonic forces and be privy to enough knowledge to satisfy his curiosity. To this end, Vathek engages in wanton and reckless murders, seductions, and blasphemies against the patient divinity 'Mahomet' and his benificent spirits.One sees in &quot;Vathek&quot; a comparable theme with Montesquieu's &quot;Persian Letters&quot;. In both, we have a tyrant, (Montesquieu's Usbek is a domestic tyrant) who abandons, and ultimately relinquishes all capacity to control their dominions or themselves - All for the pursuit of knowledge.Vathek can thus be seen as a critique of the Enlightenment and of enlightened despotism, so much the rage in Europe in the late 18th century. Beckford seems to rail at knowledge being held above respect for a common humanity. Overall a very interesting novel in many respects and aside from Beckford's unnecessary authorial interruptions, a solid read."},{"Title":"Vathek,","review":"The tale of Vathek is undeniably a wonderful oriental fable, where enlightenment ethics are presented and critiqued. If read in conjunction with Samuel Johnson \\"Rasselas\\", Montesquieu's Persian Letters and \\"Arabian Nights\\" one may be able to better understand the landscape upon which orientalism (a term used by Beckford himself to illuminate the period's infatuation with the orient, not to be confused with Said's) and enlightenment values where divulged. Beckford's tale however speaks of a more prescient sphere where the author's inner struggles and thwarted tragic desultoriness devolves. As with all literature this compact gem stands on her own; however many have tried to extract a moral import and some have even described a mystique of knowledge and a system of ethics with undue fastidiousness. In a more likely scenario we have a wonton fable whimsical and indulgent, crafted as a parody of \\"orientalism\\". Knowledge of Beckford's life may serve the reader well but should not hinder her enjoyment. The author's disquietude trumps an increasing distance from the absurd drive and hedonistic tendencies of the protagonist, while we feel a sympathetic kinship laxed the more into the novella we proceed. The author wrote this fable in French and supervised the translation as best he could. The grotesque and the sublime are here married insolubly but tend to find a balance suspended over a void that derides and insinuates the emptiness of a spiritual fantasy in turmoil.The ending paragraphs are singed with a sad glow that seems to recriminate as much as it moralizes: much like a father that punishes a child only to feel remorse over the fact that his own blood cannot enjoy what is most enjoyable. He is not convinced and Beckford created a wonderful fable where much is exposed, but the simplicity, the arrogance and the conviction are to be regaled with the same comic grotesque sprightliness with which he infuses his narrative.A quick fun read that demands little of us, but in degrees can disclose a sensibility we may be dismissive of if we are to package it as a tale where orientalism meets enlightenment values."},{"Title":"Vathek,","review":"Leaving aside the question of whether this book is a 'gothic' novel or not, it is a dark fantasy. It shares with its more conventionally gothic brethren a tale of dark deeds in an exotic setting, where an alien and exciting religion is practised.In the standard Gothic tale, allusions to Roman Catholicism, thought of by respectable Englishmen as a dark, oppressive, and half-pagan faith, were part of the conventional apparatus. Beckford chose instead to imagine the world of Islam, an even more exotic milieu that added some flashes of bright colours to the dark and sorcerous background of his book. His choice of an even more exotic setting allowed him greater freedom in portraying characters who defied social convention and fell into exotic habits of mind.My understanding is that it is a matter of some debate to what extent the English text of -Vathek- is a translation from the French, or an original English composition. I do not have the French text in front of me, but it has been represented to me that Beckford's &quot;original&quot; French is rather like the French of Oscar Wilde's -Salome-, and needed extensive editing to be acceptable to a French readership.At any rate, -Vathek- is a prime example of early dark fantasy. The description, of course, will be richer than you are used to, but Beckford's prose actually seems to move quite quickly. Fans of H. P. Lovecraft or Clark Ashton Smith will find that it is quite easy to slip into. And the tale is indeed a vivid one, right up to the exceptional ending when Vathek and Carathis are damned to the halls of Eblis, their hearts seared with unquenchable fire.This is a good edition of the story, and the notes and maps are helpful."},{"Title":"Vathek,","review":"Vathek is another work in an endless series with the Faust myth as its backbone. Except here, instead of being set in Germany, the setting is the ancient middle east in which genies and devils inhabit the land.Vathek is a caliph who is loved but also feared by his people. In fact, if he really loses his temper, just the sight of his gaze can cause death. His court makes The Satyricon look like a sunday school with its voluptuousness and excess. There are even five wings of his palace, with each one dedicated to a sense with names such as \\"The Delight of the Eyes\\" and \\"The Palace of Perfumes\\". Oh, the decadence! Of course someone as attached to physical gratification as Vathek is sure to stomp on the moral and religious boundaries of Allah and get in trouble.Much like God and Yahweh in the Book of Job, Allah allows Vathek to be tempted and tried by demons as a bizarre test of his faith. Actually, maybe in both cases it was a test of God's faith in man. The faith that man will do the right thing in the end. That he will turn away from evil. That he will have an epiphany which will redeem him. Vathek isn't so lucky.An evil being in the disguise of a man, called the Gaiour, comes to Vathek's court with all sorts of magical artifacts which seem to give their bearer otherworldy powers. Vathek becomes entranced by the thought of having powers over spirits and other men and begins to follow a direct line to eternal hell. In order to court evil spirits, Vathek becomes a mass murderer, a blasphemer, a betrayer, a killer of his own people. He is helped in this by his mother, Carathis, who hasn't even heard the word goodness. She constructs a tower much like the Tower of Babel, in order to reach to the gods and to serve as storage for her arcane items.The book, much like Dante's Inferno, becomes a little much at times. I mean, how many deeds of evil can we experience before we go, \\"ok, he's going to Hell now!\\" Sometimes you sense that some of this is intentional and tongue in cheek. At other times, you're horrified at the evil that most of the characters do. Any characters that are good are trampled upon by the evil. The last couple of pages are truly disturbing. I liked this book and would recommend it to anyone that keeps an open mind about fantasy or who is interested in the question of how much knowledge is too much knowledge."},{"Title":"Vathek,","review":"Vathek was Caliph in the area of approximately present-day Iraq, at some unknown time in the past. He was generally a fair person, but woe unto him who got Vathek angry. He lived in an immense castle, with the absolute finest of everything. One day, a very strange, and very ugly, man stood before his throne. He had a hideous laugh, but didn't speak. He showed Vathek all manner of rare and exotic items, including sabers inscribed in an unknown language, inscriptions which kept changing from day to day. The stranger was thrown in prison for his unwillingness to speak. The next morning, finding the stranger gone, Vathek totally blows his top.Finding himself outside the castle, at the foot of the nearby mountains, Vathek hears a voice coming out of a huge crevasse. It is the stranger, called a giaour, who promises Vathek all the powers of heaven in exchange for the blood of fifty young boys. Vathek provides the boys, through the guise of a sporting competition, then the giaour reneges on its part of the deal. When the people, especially the parents, understand what's happened, Vathek has to get back to the castle and lock the doors, until the anger subsides.Later, Vathek commands the creation of a great caravan to a place called Rocnabad, home of famous springs. For various reasons, he needs to get away from the castle for a while. This is going to be the biggest, and grandest, caravan ever. On the journey, the caravan is attacked by wild animals, with a number of casualties. Vathek, his wives and senior advisers, can no longer be carried the rest of the way, because of lack of personnel, but actually have to walk to Rocnabad.At Rocnabad, there is a castle as big or bigger than the one that Vathek left behind. He meets a young woman named Nouronihar, who he wants as one of his wives (as Caliph, what Vathek wants, Vathek gets). She is promised to a man named Gulchenrouz. The lovers drink a potion that will make them look dead for several days, then, the idea is that they go and live somewhere else, away from Vathek.This is one of the very few novels set in the world of the Arabian Nights, a world of eunuchs, slaves and harem girls. It was first published over 200 years ago (in the 1780s), so the style of writing is very different than what is normal for a modern reader. Therefore, it will take some patience on the part of the reader. If you can find a copy, it is time, and money, very well spent."},{"Title":"Vathek,","review":"The tale of the caliph Vathek is certainly the strangest thing I've read lately, and that is an accomplishment since it had to beat outThe Blind Owl: no mean feat, that.I think I would be doing anyone a disservice to spoil the plot, especially since it doesn't make much sense anyway. I will give away that it is basically a variation of the Faust legend, with huge helpings of oriental exoticism. The story's mood is sometimes dark and moralistic, sometimes light and fantastic, sometimes ironic. Sometimes the narrator seems to sympathize, or to want us to sympathize, with the anti-hero; other times we are clearly to be repulsed or, at the least, startled.Who should read this book?First of all, any fan of early gothic. Its mood is less consistently dark than the genuinely gothic novels, but I'm sure the relations are obvious. The deepest sympathy, I think, between Vathek and more famous gothic stories, is in the mingling of attraction and disgust at the superstition and cosmic moral drama found outside the orthodox Protestant or rationalistic Enlightenment worldviews. The reader should indulge in a Catholic or orientalist fantasy for awhile, come to appreciate its danger, and return gratefully to the supposedly well-ordered English society. Escapist literature at its best! Beyond that, however, the similarities pretty much end.If you are a fan of early gothic novels, of course you should read whatever you feel like, but I would gently recommend readingThe Castle of Otranto: A Gothic Story,The Monk (Penguin Classics),The Romance of the Forest, and of courseFrankenstein (Norton Critical Editions), maybe even (for some lighter fun)Northanger Abbey (Penguin Classics)before turning to Vathek. They are each more famous, more coherent and arguably more entertaining.Fans of H. P. Lovecraft might enjoy Vathek as well.Secondly, anyone interested in the later stages of the Enlightenment, or early romanticism. Here again I would suggestFaust: A Tragedy (Norton Critical Editions), and I agree with the reviewer who suggestedThe History of Rasselas: Prince of Abissinia (Oxford World's Classics)as works that you might like to read along with, and probably before, Vathek.Thirdly, anyone interested in orientalism. Here of course the key thing to read first isThe Arabian Nights, Volume I: The Marvels and Wonders of The Thousand and One Nights (Signet Classics)is the place to start, and Johnson's Rasselas would be a good follow-up, and then Vathek's place will be well appreciated.The connections to gothic, romanticism and orientalism are obvious, but I'll go out on a limb that may surprise: Kafka fans will probably enjoy this. Now Kafka's stories have brilliant subtleties that Vathek lacks, but I believe there is a definite affinity here in spirit, if not in technical execution. Kafka couldn't have written the way he did in the 18th century, but if he'd been there to try, perhaps he would have come up with something like Vathek.So, in sum, there are a number of works with a greater claim to most people's time and attention than Vathek; however, there are a large number of readers out there who are unfortunately missing a work that they would certainly relish. By all means, give this fascinating little book a shot."},{"Title":"Vathek,","review":"Those are the three categories that I've seen this story put in. Vathek tells the tale about a man with an exceedingly high tower. This man named Vathek is very greedy. The reading can be a little rough at times, which is why I took off one star, but there are some very memorable scenes. Two that really stick out in my mind are: When the stranger in the dungeon escapes. And when Vathek ascends his tall tower, thinking how tall he stands over his minions--then he looks up at the stars and grimaces, because the stars are still the same distance away. Both of these scenes are towards the beginning, which I think is the best part of the book. The middle details Vathek's journey to some far off place. But then it picks up again towards the end. I don't normally read Gothics--if this IS a Gothic, opinions vary--but it is a very good book and definitely one I plan on adding to my permanent collection. Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges gave enthusiastic mention to this book in one of his works."},{"Title":"Vathek,","review":"Beckford's story is what is known as an Oriental tale; it falls into the sub-division known as 'Satanic.' The reader will easily see why. Vathek kills casually, his mother Carathis positively gleefully; they hold traffic with evil spirits, Carathis raising them up when necessary. What they do, they do to gain access to the Palace of Subterranean Fire. This story moves along well, with plenty of darkly humourous comments. The translation process does not seem to have impaired the book's readability; if so, it was probably due to the fact that Beckford and a colleague only worked on it sporadically--Beckford kept on having to remove himself from England to prevent unpleasantness. His tastes are reflected in his fiction."},{"Title":"Vathek,","review":"The book itself is absolutely wonderful, and I'd reccomend it to anyone. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the readability (if that's actually a word) is somewhat damaged by the fact that it's a translation from French. I also would warn anybody who is attracted to 'gothic' novels (i.e. The Monk, The Castle of Otranto). It's set in the Middle East and, although there are certain moments of gothic quality horror, over all, the setting somewhat ruined the classification under which it was reccomended to me, and, as any true gothic fan will know, setting is crucial to such novels."},{"Title":"Death at a Dumpster : The Stabbing, the Sex & the Sequel","review":"Linda Ellis has put it all together in this easy-to-read, fact-based crime novel. What more could you want - murder, sex, good police work, suspense and a surprise ending. A great read for a rainy day or long plane ride."},{"Title":"Death at a Dumpster : The Stabbing, the Sex & the Sequel","review":"Linda Ellis is a business writer who specializes in writing columns for daily newspapers. Death At A Dumpster is her first book, and is a fictional crime novel cobbled together from extensive research of police files and medical records. The story is set in New Jersey, and covers the period from 1982 through 2000.Felicia Cusack, 44 years of age, who is a housewife, mother, worker, community organizer, and beloved citizen of Cullwing Cove is brutally murdered in an alley on March 20, 1982. Felicia's husband Larry, who was a police officer, was present, but not nearby. Larry left Felicia alone when he discovered that his keys were missing. Someone stabbed Felicia 22 times and fled with her purse. She died in the hospital, but not before suffering tremendous pain and suffering. Her husband Larry could not explain why he was unable to come to her aid when she was attacked. Cullwing Cove had a population of 5500, and nearly everyone knew and loved Felicia.The citizens of Cullwing Cove, however, did not love Larry. It soon became apparent to the investigating officers that Larry was having an affair with a young woman named Amy Lee Halford. This was the beginning of a series of discoveries that would ultimately lead to the arrest of the murderer: &quot;Law enforcement personnel were more troubled by the fact that Cusack had done nothing at all to help his wife as she lay dying in the gravel and dirt of the alley, brutally pushed against an overfilled garbage trough. It was despicable, but it was impossible to make any assumptions from that failure to act other than that Cusack didn't care about his wife, alive or dead. Police couldn't invent a charge against a fellow cop because of something he did not do, but they would sure make him pay if they discovered any evidence against him.&quot;Written as a docu-murder, Death At A Dumpster immediately stands out as a sort of documentary similar to the Dragnet television series in the 1950's. All that is missing is Joe Friday's dry commentary. Ellis herself adopts a straightforward narrative, which grows steadily in scope as she patiently makes her case against the murderers. Death At A Dumpster is not a whodunit...it is rather a case report which includes the crime, the sex, and the revenge."},{"Title":"Death at a Dumpster : The Stabbing, the Sex & the Sequel","review":"Interesting, suspenseful, and filled with terrific characters! Ms. Ellis' fact-based crime drama was an excellent read, &amp; I couldn't wait to find out how the investigation would finally be resolved. You'll probably think that you've figured it all out, but will be very surprised by the turn of events &amp; final climax."},{"Title":"Irish Immigrants in New York City, 1945-1995:","review":"She is a wonderful author. Her insight is terrific and the depth of her research is impressive."},{"Title":"The Manufactured Crisis Myths, Fraud, and the Attack on America's Public Schools","review":"Whether you are reading reviews HERE or the Stedman's review and subsequent heated debate in the reviewed journal (check ERIC database), you couldn't help but get the feeling that THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE and ENOUGH ANALYSES to justify EITHER sides of the argument, depending on your political and educational convictions. I am a cognitive psychologist and does research in schools. I felt that, short of checking up on every source and reading every cited papers by myself, I won't be able to draw a clear conclusion. However, maybe the differing points are not the only important part here. If we listen to what people do not argue, there lies the agreements between authors and reviewers.1) Leave the issue of whether our overall aggregate achievement is declining or not, we can agree that schools in poor areas are funded poorly, and their students are achieving poorly by most standards.2) Leave the political argument aside, we can agree that it is NOT FAIR to entirely blame (or credit) teachers or schools for underserved students' achievements. Our political system and culture must take a compassionate stand along with the accountability perspective in order to help these students.3) Teachers can make differences in achievements if properly supported, but not overly burdened, tested, pressured, and mandated.Let's put down the liberal or conservative or neo conservative hats for a bit. I think most Americans with good hearts agree that we should do what we can to help even the poorest child achieve. Common sense says that slapping more tests on that poor child isn't going to do it. Common sense says that slapping the child's teacher in the face for the child's failure isn't going to do it. Common sense also says just handing bundles of cash to the teacher or school isn't going to do it either. A problem inherent in the system must be addressed systemically, on all fronts.The authors did favor one particular point of view and did selectively represent the evidence. But they are justified, given how one-sided the debate had been from our government to television to homes to even education circles. The defense tends to rise to the level of the offense, and we can mostly agree that the offense has been vicious and just as biased, if not more.All in all, this book is WORTH reading. The debate between Stedman and authors are worth reading too. If you read both, I think that you would walk away less opinionated in either direction, and more compassionate towards the poor and low-achieving children of our country."},{"Title":"The Manufactured Crisis Myths, Fraud, and the Attack on America's Public Schools","review":"Several reviewers make criticisms of the book, but to tell you the truth, they are just nibbling around the edges. None of them is able to make inroads against the premise. Moving the U.S. from the bottom of the middle to the top of the middle is not very meaningful. We are solidly in the middle of performance by most measures.Too many graphs? Only if you think people shouldn't understand the content!The book's arguments could have been attacked differently, I suppose. On the other hand, if people were kicking you in the shins and calling you names, I would give you a pass on being grumpy. \\"Climategate\\" baloney comes to mind.When the dust settles on think tank sociology, there will be some horribly disfigured reputations at places like the Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute, and Competitive Enterprise Institute.In the meantime, we need to quit believing certain people and quit mistaking FUD for reality. As old as it is, this book helps you distinguish the major players. It also helps you learn to think critically about the dialog surrounding education.Just last week, Klein said he was going to close 13 public high schools in New York. Some of the schools are not making great progress, but the population of special needs students has burgeoned because they are NOT put in the charter schools the chancellor is so proud of. This book puts it in perspective. The special needs population has double the overhead of normal population, so these schools are suffering about a 30% hit to their budgets.If they are doing 5% worse than the mayor's precious charter schools, he should die of embarrassment."},{"Title":"The Manufactured Crisis Myths, Fraud, and the Attack on America's Public Schools","review":"Berliner and Biddle have written an excellent book about the &quot;manufactured crisis&quot; in American schools. They show in great detail the ways in which standardized test data can be very deceptive and also how the tests themselves are not nearly as significant as they are made out to be by ivory tower policymakers. They accurately notice that the most pressing problems facing the public schools in America today are not the lack of standardization but the enormous disparities between the haves and the have nots which are magnified in schools. They have come to the common sense conclusion that public schools which are racially segregated, underfunded, understaffed, dilapidated, and/or overcrowded will produce lower expectations and results than those schools which have ample resources. Though the authors take cheap shots at private schools, this book is nonetheless a valuable rebuttal to proponents of excessive standardized testing and school vouchers."},{"Title":"The Manufactured Crisis Myths, Fraud, and the Attack on America's Public Schools","review":"Excellent analysis of the issues. Americans have been inundated with government instituted shock doctrine regarding the supposed decline of US Education for decades, with corporations jumping on the bandwagon. 30 years since the manufactured crisis of \\"A Nation at Risk\\" under Reagan and prescriptive fixes like a \\"back to basics\\" narrowed curriculum and high-stakes testing have only served to eviscerate education, when the real problem is poverty but that has been largely ignored."},{"Title":"The Manufactured Crisis Myths, Fraud, and the Attack on America's Public Schools","review":"Berliner and Biddle are obviously coming from the opposite end of the spectrum than the writers of A NATION AT RISK. While it is refreshing to read a critique of American education that doesn't blame everything on the teachers, one must read this book as critically as Berliner and Biddle read the Bush administration report. Certainly, as an education grad. student, I found the idea that our government, by publishing A NATION AT RISK, falsified statistics, and, basically, made a flawed educational system seem disasterous. However, I feel it necessary to consider B & B's agenda--very liberal, and as another reviewer pointed out in discussing exchange rates and the per student expenditure of foreign countries, the pair may be as guilty of \\"shady statistics\\" as they accuse the authors of A NATION AT RISK. In all, I find this book provides a nice balance to all those education doomsayers, but must be taken with the same grain of salt."},{"Title":"The Manufactured Crisis Myths, Fraud, and the Attack on America's Public Schools","review":"This book has a shrill conspiracy theory tone that is not completely muted by its exhaustive documentation, and its repeated sneering references to \\"neoconservatives\\" and the \\"religious right\\" are both irritating and unnecessary. However, it convincingly refutes, point by point, the scathing criticism of public school education that I have read and heard for over twenty years. More importantly, it clearly articulates todays most serious and ignored problems in American education. I wish every policy maker from the local school board member to the President of the United States would read it."},{"Title":"The Manufactured Crisis Myths, Fraud, and the Attack on America's Public Schools","review":"David C Berliner and Bruce J Biddle wrote a book titled \\"The Manufactured Crisis: Myth, Fraud and Attack on America's Public Schools\\". The authors assert that it is a \\"myth that America spends a lot more on education than other countries\\". To back-up this claim, the authors present a chart on page 67 of the book which gives \\"k-12 expenditures for education in 16 different nations in 1985 (based on 1988 exchange rates)\\". All expenditures were given in American dollars. Since the fifteen foreign nations do not use the American dollar as their currancy, exchange rates were used to convert their spending levels to American dollars. Please note, however, that the year that the expenditures occured(1985) and the year of the exchange rates (1988) are different. Since exchange rates constantly change, the reported level of expenditures will vary depending upon which years exchange rates are used. If the 1985 exhange rates are used, the average level of per-pupil expenditures would be $2,523 for the fifteen foreign nations. If the 1988 exchange rates are used, this figure is inflated to $3,780. That is an increase of 49.8 percent. If the 1985 exchange rates are used, the United States ranks fourth among the sixteen industrialized countries in terms of per-pupil expenditures. Because this book uses the 1988 exchange rates, it asserts that the United States ranks ninth among these countries in terms of per-pupil eductational expenditures. Between 1981 and 1989, the dollar reached its lowest value in relations to other currencies in 1988. Therefore, the 1988 exchange rates inflate the foreign nations spending levels by the greatest amount.Most economists do not consider exchange rates to be the best measure to compare levels of spending in different countries. This is because price levels differ between countries. In 1988 for example, the avereage price of a product in Switzerland was 54.5% higher than it was in the United States. Therefore, if an American school was given ten thousand dollars, it would be able to purchase more than would a Swiss school that was given a comparable amount of money. To compensate for these price differences, economists try to determine what the exchange rate would be if the price level were the same in each country. Economist refer to this rate of exchange as purchasing power parity (PPP).To demonstrate how the purchasing power parity exchange rate would affect the comparisons, one only needs to examine the authors claim on page 67. The authors state that \\"the United States ranked only ninth among sixteen industrialized nations in per-pupil expenditures for grades k through 12, spending 14 percent LESS than Germany, 30 percent LESS than Japan, and 51 percent LESS than Switzerland\\". If the purchasing power parity exchange rates are used, the United States ranks fifth among sixteen industrialized nations in per-pupil expenditures for grades k through 12, spending 17 MORE than Germany, 23 percent MORE than Japan, and only 21 percent LESS than Switzerland.No where else in the book do the authors make comparisons by mismatching exchange rates. For example, on page 225, the authors quoted a book which compared the per capita gross domestic product of various countries. The authors of that book did not mismatch the year of the exhange rates to determine a given country's per capita gross domestic product. On page 93 of the book, the authors quoted a report which compared American worker productivity with worker productivity in other nations. This report used exchange rates that are based on the purchasing power parity method that was described above.The book states that it is a \\"myth that America spends a lot more money on education than other countries\\". This is not a myth. The real myth is the book's assertions about education spending. It should also be noted that most of these other countries have higher academic standards for their students in high school.Because the authors do not deal properly with economic data, I also wonder about the accuracy of other data that is presented in this book. Consequently, I would not recommend that anyone buy this book"},{"Title":"The Manufactured Crisis Myths, Fraud, and the Attack on America's Public Schools","review":"Authors Berliner and Biddle take up the subject of how bad our schools really are and pronounce them to be pretty darn good, thank you. From a statistical point of view this may be true and probably is true. This reminds me of Westmoreland's argument that we were winning the Vietnamese War. \\"We are killing more of them than they are killing us.\\" Yes, well, we all know where statistics can take you. I don't dispute their argument. At one level, they are right. What they can't find a chart for, however, is that fact that our kids can't write. They don't read. They come to college with junior-high school educations. Their counterparts in Asia and Europe, and possibly elsewhere, learn foreign languages, can do math, and are literate in their own languages. It is true that the schools are not to blame for every ill, but they are to blame for much that admittedly cannot be easily measured. Note the lack of manners in our young, their lack of curiosity, their unfiltered adoration of pop culture (rap, TV, commercialism), and their ignorance of fine culture. They have been to school, but curiously remain unschooled. Part of this is surely the degenerate households they come from, but an equal part comes from the low standards to which they are held at schools where they are allowed to cultivate, shall we say, their baser selves. Many teachers condone this vulgarity so as to appear hip and cool to their younger charges. Whatever it is, America's youth are to be avoided at all cost, locked out of malls by appalled shoppers, and shunned if not feared by their own parents. Schools are not to be fully completely blamed, but what have they done to help?"},{"Title":"The Manufactured Crisis Myths, Fraud, and the Attack on America's Public Schools","review":"Few subjects have been more lied about than the issue of the state of public schools. Berliner and Biddle, two academics in the field of education, methodically demolish every single lie, every single myth that's been perpetrated by the right wing in the past two decades. They dispel the myth of &quot;declining&quot; SAT scores, they take on the Reagan administration propaganda piece A NATION AT RISK, they dispute the notion that private schools are inherently superior than public schools... and they repeatedly show, with a truckload of documentation, what is right with public schools.One of the most notable parts of the book concerns a governmental report conducted during the Bush administration called &quot;The Sandia Report.&quot; The report's researchers looked at existing studies about such diverse areas in education as teacher preparation, SAT scores, funding of schools, postsecondary education, and dropout/retention rates. Contrary to the gloom-and-doom of A NATION AT RISK, the researchers found that our educational system in the United States was, on the whole, in far better shape than the propaganda had claimed. Unfortunately, the Bush administration squelched the report as it did not support its preconceived notions on the state of education in America. It wasn't until 1993 when the report was finally released. Berliner and Biddle describe how the report had to be rewritten and rewritten to fit the Bush mold. Still, the results of the study weren't good enough. This was a major and unreported scandal during the Bush years....Berliner and Biddle do acknowledge there are problems in the public schools; for example, the increased numbers of immigrants and the disparities in funding of different school districts in different states. These are REAL problems which require increased spending, unlike the anti-public school propaganda which states the public schools are failures and the only way to save them is to give taxpayer money to private schools via vouchers, which in turn starve the public schools even more for funding and the quality goes down even further. At bottom, the anti-public school propaganda campaign is a campaign against our very form of democracy and social mobility which has made this country great. Berliner and Biddle provide ample ammunition to counter the anti-public school lies."},{"Title":"The Manufactured Crisis Myths, Fraud, and the Attack on America's Public Schools","review":"Berliner and Biddle have written a badly needed antidote to conventional wisdom about pubic education in the United States. At least since publication of the polemical pamphlet A Nation at Risk in 1983, public education has taken the blame for virtually every social and economic problem faced by the U.S. Berliner and Biddle seek to set the record straight, and, for the reader who had not already made up his or her mind, they do a good job. I think, however, that their book would have been even more compelling if they had avoided what I take to be rather serious errors.First, Berliner and Biddle let stand the notion that education is a leading institution rather than a secondary one, over-shadowed by the economy and polity. As a result, readers are left with the badly mistaken notion that if payoffs for investments in public schooling are diminished, the fault must be with education. In truth, however, since the demise of the Era of the Social Contract, which ran from 1946 to 1972, the supply of good jobs has been dramatically diminished due to outsourcing, down-sizing, internationalization, and technological developments. Prospective employers are seeking to reduce labor costs, they are doing so in ways which dramatically degrade the U.S. labor market, and there is nothing that schools can do about it. In short, labor market degradation is taken to be evidence of decline in the quality of schooling, and education as an institution wrongly gets the blame.Second, Berliner and Biddle sometimes mistake friends for enemies and enemies for friends. In this vein, they are quite hostile to what is sometimes referred to as the first Coleman report, published in 1966 under the title Equality of Opportunity. It is true that in his later work Coleman joined the ranks of the school bashers and became a champion of private schooling. But what did he and his co-authors say in 1966: schools do all sorts of good things, but they are not agents of upward social mobility and they do not sever ties between background factors and subsequent achievement both in school and beyond.Rather than reject these findings as hostile to schooling, Berliner and Biddle would do well to embrace them as helping to make their case: schools work and they work well; just don't expect them to accomplish the impossible, to achieve ends they were never designed to achieve. In other words, again, schools cannot overcome the limitations imposed by over-arching contextual factors.Third, in a really odd move, Berliner and Biddle embrace the findings of Chubb and Moe as presented in Politics, Markets, and America's schools. They do so because Chubb and Moe find that certain patterns of administrative organization, which they claim can be adopted universally, will make schools more effective at promoting achievement. But Berliner and Biddle fail to acknowledge that the organizational pattern espoused by Chubb and Moe is that which applies to private secondary schools. Fundamental to Chubb and Moe's model is complete rejection of all higher order values which might interfere with market forces. I can see why Berliner and Biddle would welcome a finding that schools are subject to improvement, but at the sacrifice of higher-order values, specifically equality of educational opportunity ...? (For what it's worth, Chubb and Moe's empirical work is dubious at best.)Fourth, Berliner and Biddle never really come to terms with the current over-emphasis on accountability and the limitations of standardized tests as the one and only way to gauge school performance. Since the Manufactured Crisis was published, we have seen even further exaggeration of the role of standardized testing, and the results, for people who work in schools and see the consequences first hand, have been disastrous.Berliner and Biddle have written a good book. I am grateful to them. Yes, it is polemical, but far less so than histrionic diatribes such as A Nation at Risk."},{"Title":"The Manufactured Crisis Myths, Fraud, and the Attack on America's Public Schools","review":"I found this book at the library, and checked it out with the highest of hopes. Having seen two sisters through high school, and worked for several years as a Substitute Teacher, during the 1980's-90's, I have had some opportunity to contrast the myth of American education's failure with the more complex details of reality. Berliner and Biddle, who begin by saying &quot;This book was written in outrage&quot;, go to great lengths to show the not only the usually unnoticed ways in which American education is better than it is usually reported to be, but also to show the ways in which it does indeed fail (did you know that mathematics proficiency scores in Misissippi are lower than those in Jordan?). I commend their effort. I applaud their desire to see us spend our education monies more equitably, to show more respect for the efforts of educators and administrators, to cease using the &quot;Education is failing!&quot; cry as a way of condemning the rising younger generation. I only wish I could say that I finished reading this book. Frankly, I got bogged down in the third chapter. It wasn't so much the unnecessary proliferation of graphs that got me. No, it was the fact that Berliner and Biddle do not seem to have passed beyond the basic prose writing technique of &quot;First say what you are going to say, then say it, then say what you have said&quot;. They do this in spades. They do this even if the whole arguement is only a paragraph long. Frankly, I wish someone would produce a digest of this book, containing only one telling each of each argument. Then maybe I would be able to stick through to the end"},{"Title":"The Manufactured Crisis Myths, Fraud, and the Attack on America's Public Schools","review":"This is by far the most useless book on the subject of the state of education. For instance, while the authors make much of the relative stability of SAT scores, they ignore the decline in scores from the NAEP, CTBS, and MAT scores (to name a few) from the same period. They also keep silent about the fact that calculators were once forbidden from the math portion of the SAT, playing a role no doubt in said stability. Dr. Lawrence Stedman, an Associate Professor of Education at the State University of New York at Binghamton, Ph.D. in Educational Policy Studies, and self-decribed progressive &quot;sympathetic to their concerns,&quot; wrote an article in the PEER-REVIEWED Education Policy Analysis Archives. He pointed out numerous examples of the fudging-- whether out of duplicity or incompetence, you judge-- of &quot;facts&quot; to support the authors' farcical claims, and where such claims went unsupported. In other words, while criticism usually comes from &quot;the enemy,&quot; ONE OF THEIR OWN blasted this book for its inaccuracies. Since it could not possibly have been written with a straight face, I recommend spending your money on something written with more integrity. There IS a real crisis in education, there ARE manufacturers, and this book rolled straight off their assembly line."},{"Title":"The Manufactured Crisis Myths, Fraud, and the Attack on America's Public Schools","review":"This is an angry book, written by two angry authors. Very difficult to read as a serious work because it seems to have more emotion than fact. The authors present \\"data\\", but their interpretation of the plain data seems off at times, and quite twisted at other times. They attack the thoroughly documented \\"Nation At Risk\\" as though it was pulp fiction, and belittle other noteworthy studies in a similar manner. Berliner has a tremendous religious bias (blatantly anti-Christian) that is extremely unsavory, if not unscholarly, and seems to have so many \\"Aha!\\" moments that one begins to doubt anything he says. His classic \\"...but IF you read the data carefully, it REALLY means....\\" just gets old. Facts are facts. SAT scores have been in a serious decline since the 1960s. The ETS people changed the test under dubious pretenses in the 1980s, and did so again this past year. Why ? The reasons vary, but when you find yourself measuring up, get a smaller stick! Berliner's work tries to hypnotize its readers into believing what common sense observations have told us all for years: public schools are violent places; drug havens; mediocre learning institutions full of over-paid and undereducated 'teachers'. Newspaper stories we see nearly every day corroborate this. If the newspapers are guilty of anything, it is under-reporting of these problems.One final note: I taught at an American public high school last year that was considered quite good by the community, and we had nearly 200 arrests on our campus that year !Parents: if you had 200 arrests at your place of business last year, what conclusions would YOU have about your place of work ? Is your place of work so prone to outbreaks of violence and illegal drug use that it requires the work of several on and off-site police officers? Would you tolerate this situation yourself ? I didn't think so.Then why do you tolerate it for your adolescent son or daughter ?"},{"Title":"The Manufactured Crisis Myths, Fraud, and the Attack on America's Public Schools","review":"Whether Berliner and Biddle are discussing the &quot;myths&quot; about achievement and schools, the power of right- wing disinformation, or the contrast between neoconservative and progressive reforms, they repeatedly offer a one-sided treatment of the evidence. They accept at face value any information that supports their viewpoint, while they dissect and reinterpret any information that challenges it. The purpose of academic training and scholarship is to rise above such flawed rationality; to learn how to critically analyze the evidence that supports your own favored arguments--and to treat fairly the evidence that contradicts it. It is also a matter of learning to accept the complexity and ambiguity of evidence--and to fairly present that. Unfortunately, Berliner and Biddle failed to do this.They ignored or dismissed entire areas of relevant evidence--such as the extensive data on students' low levels of achievement and knowledge--and, in selectively presenting other evidence--such as the data on test score trends--they winnowed out only that which supported their viewpoint and discarded the rest. In several cases, they have even directly misrepresented the actual data. The actual evidence on student achievement is crucial to their argument. It directly addresses their claim that U.S. students are achieving well and that the educational crisis has been &quot;manufactured&quot;. Instead of systematically reviewing the evidence, they selected a few pieces of data on each topic and reinterpreted them to suit their argument. They concentrated on trends (mostly stable) but ignored levels of achievement (mostly low). They ignored a large and growing body of research which shows that student achievement has been weak for several decades. Our high school students lack important knowledge in history, civics, geography, and English; they have done poorly in mathematics and science and few write well. The evidence is overwhelming that the achievement crisis is real. In the next section, I report on the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) results. They analyzed the test score decline in a misleading fashion. Although they rightfully criticized the myth of a RECENT general achievement decline, they ignored the 1970s decline and failed to present any of the contradictory evidence from the 1980s. They clearly overstated the case when they claimed &quot;only ONE test, the SAT&quot; ever suggested a decline (p. 35 emphasis original).Worse, they then overreached and tried to cast current achievement in an historically positive light. Without the needed evidence, they claimed that this generation of students achieves &quot;substantially&quot; higher than previous ones on &quot;virtually all&quot; commercial standardized tests--a contention that is directly refuted by the major reviews of historical trends on such tests."},{"Title":"The Manufactured Crisis Myths, Fraud, and the Attack on America's Public Schools","review":"This author gave me much to think about.

This element in our culture has always struck me as odd, seeing as how my public school education was above average. Apparently, these Americans who write editorials and books about the public schools must have somehow scratched by as well--they are, after all, writing books.Needless to say, I was surprised when I saw this book because it contravenes conventinal wisdom. As the writers say, their assertions are going to be hard to believe. They are, but the facts bear them out. I would not be able to accuse these writers as using a dearth of evidence, because there are charts and graphs of documented, peer reviewed studies on just about every other page. The arguments in the book range from the basic point that since SAT scores only test verbal and math skills (duh!)they are not a good indicator of overall student achievement. Besides, the test was created to predict success in baccalaureate programs, not in life or high school or to test general knowledge.The authors go on with several relevant factors about testing and the good sense of comparing apples to apples. For example, a government study that said we paid more per student than other nations was due to the fact that we included higher education in the figure (other nations did not include that figure). Take that out, and our expenditure per student is middle to low. American eighth graders who did poorly on algebra tests when compared to Japanese eighth graders? Considering the fact that much of the sample of our students did not have algebra, a good comparison could not be made. When you took the sample of American eighth graders who had taken Algebra, our mean scores were actually higher than the Japanese.The book goes on and on like this. Definitely arguments worth looking at seriously. The book is a call to focus on the correct problems in American education (financial disparity between affluent areas and non-affluent areas), and to be in awe that our school system serves people and achieves despite some tough odds.Some readers will certainly charge that these writers manipulate data. If that is what you believe after reading this book, then fine. But in defense of Berliner &amp; Biddle, I must commend them for at least using data, and not just assertions to bolster their arguments. Which is more than I can say of the likes of many of the right-wing political administrations who started the trend of criticizing public schooling. In America, we are committed to equal opportunity in education. That is a value that other countries, such as our 'media rival' Japan, do not necessarily share."},{"Title":"The Manufactured Crisis Myths, Fraud, and the Attack on America's Public Schools","review":"Too often, the media finds some tidbit of information that speaks to the public concerning the deplorable condition of our schools.

The current No Child Left Behind Act and so-called educational crisis create this manufactured crisis through the manufacturing of myths and the misuse of culturally, linguistically, and economically biased tests. The so-called crisis then makes it so much easier to dismantle public schools and replace them with charter schools.

This is exactly what Tina Bryson and her husband Sebastian do in the book PERFECT IN WEAKNESS. Tina delivered her twin boys, Ethan and Elliot, 17 weeks early, and by the end of a long, emotionally draining five months, both of children died. The book is as much a biographical piece as it is a self-help book. In each chapter Tina, drawing from entries of a journal she kept at the time, writes about her experiences, shares scriptures and sometimes hymns that encouraged her during that particular period. At the end of each chapter, she includes a section titled \\"Think About It,\\" where she she lists questions and activities for readers going throuh their own periods of grief to complete.One of my favorite chapters in the book was called \\"Men and Grief.\\" This chapter includes Tina's thoughts on how the illness and subsequent death of her children impacted her husband and their marriage. She explores how her husband Sebastian grieved diffrently, and her struggle to understand and accept those differences. In addition, a passage written by Sebastian himself is included, so readers are privy to his thoughts and feelings. The chapter concludes with Tina commenting on their continued struggle as a couple to cope with the loss and move on with their lives without forgetting their common loss.PERFECT IN WEAKNESS is a moving account of one family's loss and it highlights the spiritual and emotional journey that resulted from it. In addition, it provided general information about the grief process (specifically the loss of a child), activities, scriptures and general encouragement for readers experiencing similar situations. Most importantly, the book is a fine resource that will be extremely useful for those looking to take a difficult situation and grow as a result of it. Having lost my mother when I was a child, I recall hearing my grandmother recount that there is no loss like losing a child on any number of occaisions. When I became a mother myself, I thought I better understood what she meant by that, but after reading Tina Bryson's book, I now realize that my understanding was limited. She presents the experience with such heartfelt intensity that I couldn't help but empathize in a much deeper way. As such, I would also recommend this book to friends and extended family members of persons grieving the loss of a child.Reviewed by Stacey Seayof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Perfect in Weakness","review":"No matter what your beliefs,you WILL walk away from this book with a renewed spirit.

I know others who, even though they admire Rilke above all other poets, prefer other \\"Rilke\\" poems, such as \\"Evening.\\" For me, however, it has always been, and always will be, the Elegies. Certainly they are the most extravagant and elusive of Rilke's poems, even for those who count others among their favorites.Rilke, who longed for a place of solitude in the country, arrived at the fortress-like Castle Duino, high above the Adriatic, near Trieste, in December 1911. His hostess was Princess Marie von Thurn und Taxis-Hohenlohe, who had invited Rilke to translate Dante's Vita Nuova with her. Princess Marie, however, soon left for more sociable climes and Rilke was left alone on the stormy, wind-swept cliffs of Duino. Rilke, at this time of his life, was known to commit himself to a strict regimen of work. Nevertheless, his poems, he has written, always seemed to burst upon him suddenly, like a thunderstorm on a hot summer's afternoon. And, one afternoon at Duino, the opening line of the first elegy burst upon Rilke like a flash of lightening.There is no problem with the Duino Elegies...if one reads and comprehends German. If one doesn't, however, the problems of translation can be enormous. Translation, always a fragile task, becomes even more so when it involves poetry, and reaches its zenith with a work as sublime as Rilke's Duino Elegies. So many versions of these gorgeous poems exist (at least twenty), that the Elegies are certainly suffering from a case of \\"translation overkill.\\"In the original German, the Duino Elegies are the most sublime expressions of awe, of terror, of love, of splendor, of Life, that have ever been set down by the hand of man. In hands other than Rilke's, however, they can seem clumsy and more than a bit melodramatic. Rilke wrote delicately-calibrated poetry, without excess words and, the dread of all translators, the hyphenated word. But, all that aside, reading the Elegies in translation, any translation, is better than not reading them at all.No matter how \\"angelic\\" these poems may seem, never doubt that they are expression of life in the here and now. As Rilke, himself, tells us, \\"the world exists nowhere but within us.\\" These gorgeous poems are about the difficulties of living in this world, of not being heard by the angels, and of the tragedy that can so easily befall us. They are about Rilke's desire for solitude and his desire to escape it, i.e., the need and the utter impossibility of understanding and being understood completely in this life.Although many of the translations are flawed, as translation by its very nature must be, the Duino Elegies remain the epitome of poetry. They are a cry of terror, of awe, of joy, of splendor at the lonely and solitary condition of man."},{"Title":"Duino elegies","review":"Rilke's &quot;Duino Elegies&quot; form one of the most perfect collections of lyric poetry you can ever hope to get your hands on. Unfortunately for the David Young translation, however, there is much less Rilke than there ought to be; a series of strange decisions on Young's part casts a shadow over even the brighter moments of his rendering of this masterpiece.For example, Rilke was a genius at enjambment; that is, he was a master at placing his most important words at the very end or very beginning of a line, in order to highlight them. Think of the first line, which ends with &quot;Engel,&quot; splitting it from the first word of the next line, &quot;Ordnungen.&quot; (Young merely gives these words together, as &quot;angelic orders,&quot; at the end of the third line.) By divorcing the angels from their orders in the poem's very first line, Rilke sets the tone that not all is right in the heavens.And Rilke's line breaks are even more important than those of other poets, because they are few and far between, since his lines are nice and fat, often more than 13 syllables. Young's lines, on the other hand, are broken up into tiny 2- to 8-syllable, bite-sized chunks. This changes not only the rhythm of Rilke's verse--which obviously would have changed anyway, in translation--but its compositional emphases, as the structure of the most important lines is simply whisked away. And that is a tragedy.Young's excuse for this unfortunate decision? He happened, while he was working on the translation, &quot;to re-read some of William Carlos Williams' late poetry,&quot; and he liked Williams' stubbier, tri-partite lines. Rilke, however, is not William Carlos Williams, and Young's rendering of Rilke as Williams suffers because of this incongruity. (Oddly enough, though, Williams is another poet for whom every line break bears an awful lot of weight; too bad Young didn't carry that respect for enjambment into his work on the &quot;Duino Elegies.&quot;)Those interested in Rilke should do themselves a favor and pick up Mitchell's translation. I simply can't recommend this edition. It gets three stars because, despite the muddle, there are SOME beautifully rendered lines, and some of the power of Rilke manages to squeeze through. And that's always a wonderful thing."},{"Title":"Duino elegies","review":"I ordered what I supposed was the translation by MirandaI (I had never heard about it, I have to say) and what did I receive?

And what we see is what we dont. The universe is covered with dust. He is coming from mountains and through the lakes. Rilke has written like somebody is whispering to your ears. Those are the concertoes of Mozart and sculptures of Michaelangelo. You can see Rilke in the lines. You can see God whispering to your ears. And the whole tragedy is this: He is telling those words. There he is writing all alone. Looking to the mirror. Wishing that all his poems are telling the truth. He is crying for the others who had gone before him.

They are other-worldly (a ghost who gets killed--?); an air-breathing squid-like Martian who is a brilliant bartender of mixes for two humans who revolutionize the use of robotics and androids; some mummified creatures who have a cannibalistic way of coming alive when unexpected; a Lilliputian demon who can't manage the simplest of tasks when asked; and of course, the title player, a college professor-turned-werewolf for love.Not enough? How about a murder that costs the killer more than his life by summoning a creature from his own imagination? Just ask Gorgo, Dugg Quinby, Wolfe Wolf, Guzub, and Snulbug (but don't ask the latter for tomorrow's newspaper. He might bring it and a lot of surprises too.)"},{"Title":"The Compleat Werewolf and Other Stories of Fantasy and Science Fiction.","review":"I checked this book out of the local library when I was was MUCH younger and enjoyed it immensely. A nice grouping of short stories that keep your interest and allow you to pick it up and put it down at will without losing much. The characters are delightfully put together and fun to think of, even though they're all fictional."},{"Title":"The Compleat Werewolf and Other Stories of Fantasy and Science Fiction.","review":"\\"The Compleat Werewolf\\" gathers together 10 short stories and novellas from the pen of Anthony Boucher, all of which originally appeared in various pulp magazines (such as \\"Unknown Worlds,\\" \\"Adventure Magazine,\\" \\"Astounding Science Fiction,\\" \\"Weird Tales\\" and \\"Thrilling Wonder Stories\\") from 1941-'45. Boucher, whose real name was William Anthony Parker White, was a man of many talents, and during his career, which lasted from the early '40s to the late '50s, he worked as a magazine editor, a book reviewer (for \\"The New York Times\\" and \\"New York Herald Tribune\\") and an author of science fiction, horror and mystery. I initially learned of this \\"Compleat Werewolf\\" collection of 1969 from the excellent overview volume \\"Horror: 100 Best Books,\\" in which author Neil Gaiman sings the book's praises. But even Gaiman is compelled to admit that the Boucher collection is an unlikely pick for a Top 100 Horror list, as only about five of the book's tales are even vaguely horrific, and all but a couple are leavened by a goodly dose of humor. Still, he tells us \\"it contains at least two stories worth their weight in chilled blood,\\" and indeed, all 10 stories are perfectly produced little gems of either horror, fantasy or flat-out sci-fi. A recent rereading of the collection, after a period of around 12 years, has served to remind me of what a wonderful and amusing writer Boucher could be.As for the stories themselves: The collection opens neatly with the novella-length title work, \\"The Compleat Werewolf,\\" in which a German-language professor, Wolfe Wolf, learns--thanks to his new drinking buddy, the magician Ozymandias--that he is a full-fledged werewolf, capable of change at will. Much of the situations are played for laffs, but this longish tale ultimately manages to conflate devil worshippers, G-men, Nazi spies, a Hollywood starlet and a talking cat, culminating with one extremely suspenseful action siege indeed. The tale wraps up in a manner that could have easily led to an entire series of tales about our werewolf hero working for the FBI; I wonder if Robert McCammon was influenced by this classic story when he wrote his 1989 novel \\"The Wolf's Hour.\\" Next up is \\"The Pink Caterpillar,\\" a story of pure horror that is told by one of the G-men characters of \\"The Compleat Werewolf.\\" Here, a \\"doctor\\" residing in the Mexican countryside learns that pacts with rural medicine men don't always come off as planned. This little chiller is one of the more grisly tales in the bunch. An example of Boucher's skill as a sci-fi writer, \\"Q.U.R.\\" tells the story of a trio of men who come up with the strictly utilitarian, \\"usuform\\" robot to replace the humanoid androids then in use. This is a charming story, filled with likable characters, both human and alien. Written in 1942, the tale features a black president (here, actually, as Council Head, more of a world president) 66 years before the Obama fact. In a really right-on passage, Boucher writes \\"...ten centuries ago people would have snorted just like that at the idea of a black as Head on this planet. Such narrow stupidity seems fantastic to us now. Our own prejudices will seem just as comical to our great-great-grandchildren.\\" Let us hope! \\"Robinc,\\" up next, is a direct sequel to \\"Q.U.R.,\\" and just as entertaining, as our trio of inventors gets into major-league trouble after their new robots become a success. Really wonderful Golden Age sci-fi, this. In \\"Snulbug,\\" the first story that Boucher ever sold, a research scientist uses the inch-tall titular demon, raised by necromantic means, to assist him in amassing a small fortune. But naturally, things go consistently awry, in this highly clever, time-paradox tale.\\"Mr. Lupescu,\\" the shortest story of the bunch, finds a child's imaginary playmate to be not so imaginary as it first appears. Boucher skillfully manages to cram two major surprises into this five-page affair! Up next is \\"They Bite,\\" easily the most horrifying and grisliest tale in the collection. Here, a louse of a human being, a seller of wartime Army secrets, discovers that the legend of the Carker clan--cannibalistic desert dwellers in the American Southwest--may not be a legend after all. The denouement of this horrific tale--an inspiration for Wes Craven's \\"The Hills Have Eyes,\\" perhaps?--should linger long in the reader's memory. \\"Expedition,\\" a humorous tale of the first Martian voyage to Earth, told in the form of radio transmissions, comes next. This straightforward sci-fi story features some interesting protagonists (the Martians are described as being hexagonlike bugs) and a rather clever conclusion. The story that follows, the 70-page novella \\"We Print the Truth,\\" is the longest tale of the bunch, and a real winner. In a setup that Rod Serling might well have approved of, a small-town newspaper editor is granted a wish by his mysterious typesetter (who may or may not be a fairy of the Oberon variety). He wishes that his paper, in the future, will tell nothing but the truth, and soon enough, anything that is printed therein has the power to alter reality. What an opportunity for effecting change, for ending wars and bettering lives! But our harried editor soon finds that this godlike ability comes with some serious problems, in this extremely ingratiating tale. Filled with loads of interesting characters and conversations, convincing details of small-town Americana, and endless invention, this might be my personal favorite story of the bunch. The collection wraps up with \\"The Ghost of Me,\\" another clever, short tale. Here, a man's ghost comes back to haunt his house...even though the man is not quite dead yet! The ghost has made a slight miscalculation as regards timing, in this decidedly loopy story...one that yet still manages to pull off a rather suspenseful ending. So there you have it: 10 stories of varied subject matter in varied genres, all with only one thing in common...the ability to mightily entertain the reader. As far as making the case for Anthony Boucher being a writer of great and manifold talents, I would have to say that the collection is a complete--or, rather, compleat--success. More than highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Compleat Werewolf and Other Stories of Fantasy and Science Fiction.","review":"I found this to be a rather fun anthology and quick read. Unless I am mistaken all the stories here date originally from the early to mid 1940s, which places them towards the end of the Pulps/beginning of the paperback era. Like any anthology, some of the stories are stronger and more appealing than others,with a sprinkling of horror, sci-fi,fantasy,etc.. I found that several of these tales have a distinctive element of humor which I thought was, for the most part, balanced well with the fantastical and sometimes horrific nature of the stories. Sure, some of these are rather dated (they are over 70 years old after all!), but then a lot of it stands up pretty darn well and remains quite entertaining. The namesake story (\\"Compleat Werewolf\\") is well worth the price of admission alone!

Among their authors, we thoroughly enjoy books by Maria Goodavage (The California Dog Lover's Companion), Tom Stienstra (California Hiking), and Ann Marie Brown. Ann Marie Brown writes fantastic hiking guides; especially for folks like us that love to do dog friendly, easy day hikes while on vacation. It's a great way to enjoy an area. All hikes include information as to whether or not they are dog friendly (wonderful for planning purposes). All are from one to a few hours. The hikes are graded as to their difficulty, from easy to strenuous, and, yes!, the hikes are rated with two to four stars for overall quality and scenic beauty. Icons are included to provide additional information on the trail. All these features are great for planning, especially when you're a visitor to the area and want to find those hikes that are most appealing to your interests. The directions to the trailhead and for the hike are clear and easy to understand. Areas covered are the San Francisco Peninsula, the East and South Bay, Marin, Napa, Sonoma, and the Santa Cruz Mountains. We've done some of these hikes and have picked out more for our next trip. They truly are the 101 Great Hikes of the San Francisco Bay Area. If you are heading to the Bay area and like to hike, we highly recommend a copy of this book to accompany you on your travels."},{"Title":"Foghorn Outdoors: 101 Great Hikes of the San Francisco Bay Area","review":"I've lived in the Bay Area for 7 years now, and I never thought of it as anything but and urban and suburban mesh. I wanted to start hiking, but I felt that I needed to travel to national parks far away to enjoy it. I was really mistaken. This book is beyond amazing.I'm not going to say this is the bible of hiking, but whenever I open it, a beacon of light shines upon it and the air is filled with cathedral like chanting.I was totally unaware of the natural beauty and ambience that was located locally. Some of these places described are amazing. I went on all the strenuous hikes described in this book, and I enjoyed each one. From redwoods, to waterfalls, to beaches, to mountain vistas, it's all there.The author provides ratings, directions, description, difficulty, approximate times, pricing, and weather information for each hike. If it weren't for these descriptions, I would never have seen the huge redwoods in the peninsula or the amazing beach and postcard views at Point Reyes.There are only a few minor flaws in this book. The strenuous hikes are pretty easy for anyone is shape, and only take about 3/4ths the time suggested. The directions are sometimes a bit bare, but I never was really lost so it's not too much of a problem.If you want to enjoy the outdoors, no matter what fitness level, get this book. It's everything you need to have many nice enjoyable day hikes."},{"Title":"Foghorn Outdoors: 101 Great Hikes of the San Francisco Bay Area","review":"Day hiking is one of my passions and I have been looking for this kind of book ever since I moved to the bay area.

Finally I have started to put some miles on my boots again.What can you expect from this book? Well, you will find a wealth of information on the trails in this area. Each trail comes with a pretty detailed map with short but good directions. The book also rates the level of each trail, elevation change and distance. It also points out things like pet accessibility, parking and times to go. The information is precise and detailed. There are also additional hiker information for the trails.

Those sympathetic to Grant correctly point to errant assumptions and mistakes in character analysis. Most glaring is McFeely's insistence that Grant gloried in carnage, was insensitive to death and suffering, and was an incompetent chief executive.Actually Grant was one of the most exquisitiely sensitive men ever born and was nothing like the 'butcher' that McFeely describes. However, the research in the book is quite good and there are very few factual errors to be found, though his chapters on the civil war are relatuvely weak. This contrasts markedly to Geoffrey Perret's 1997 Grant biography, which contained inaccuracies on nearly every page. McFeely is most solid in the period of Reconstruction, though he is usually overly prone to criticize the hapless Grant. Throughout many chapters, it seems the General can't buy a break.McFeely's greatest admiration for Grant is contained in two areas of his life: his family relationships, specifically his loving marriage to wife Julia, and his abilities as a writer. McFeely leaves no doubt that he regards Grant's 1885 Memoirs as one of the great books ever written and the best part of this biography is in explaining the processes Grant used to produce such a masterpiece, while dying of throat cancer.With its flaws and uneven treatment of Grant, McFeely's book cannot be considered definitive, but it is still the only complete biography of Grant written in the past 30 years. Perret's limping entry isn't even in the same league as this book, in accuracy, writing or research. To sum up: overly critical, but a must read for Civil War buffs."},{"Title":"Grant: A Biography","review":"William S. McFeely's book Grant attempts to be an objective look at the life of one of the most well-known of US generals. It is a good account, full of details into Grant's life and quick to dispel many of the popular myths (both positive and negative) which have been spread about the general. The treatment of the Civil War does not take up the majority of the work, but instead comprises a part of the career of a man who went from tanner to army man to President to writer, with various stints as a failed businessman and bored peacetime army officer in between.In his quest for objectivity, I think McFeely has overstepped his bounds just a bit. He greatly downplays Lincoln's affection for Grant, claiming that the President was never quite sure if he could trust the general. Early on, this may have been true, but the fact is that Lincoln many times defended Grant when rumors came to his ear, saying he liked Grant because \\"he fights.\\" Also, McFeely calls Grant's wilderness campaign a \\"hideous disaster,\\" and insinuates that Grant did not care much about the colossal loss of life at Cold Harbor. The overwhelming fact about the Wilderness Campaign is that it was, indeed, very costly in terms of human life. Still, Grant got things done. He defeated Lee--something McClellan and the other commanding officers could not do. Grant did what he had to do, terrible though it was.Still, these are matters of opinion, and the book remains a wonderful treatment of Grant. One of the things I like most is that is gives equal treatment to all aspects of Grant's life, not just the Civil War. I learned a great deal about the Grant administration, which is usually regarded as one of the most corrupt in our nation's history. That may be true, but McFeely convincingly argues that not all of it was Grant's fault.Overall, this is a great work on Grant. It has its flaws, but it still remains an adequate overview of this man's life, and should provide a good companion to Grant's personal memoirs. I would recommend this book to anyone studying the Civil War, as it gives a great account of Grant's part, though it lacks details (which can be obtained in other studies of the War itself). This would be a great addition to any Civil War library, as well as a"},{"Title":"Grant: A Biography","review":"Grant is a figure who has snaked in and out of my consciousness of Civil War history without ever becoming more than an icon. My father had a picture of him at home-- a great admirer. Before reading this book, if I thought about him at all, then it was the image of a quiet ordinary man with slouched shoulders around the campfire. A general much more than a president.McFeely's 1982 biography of Grant won both the Pulitzer Prize for Biography and the Francis Parkman Prize (for the best non-fiction book on an American theme). It is still one of the most admired of the Grant biographies, although it also has (apparently inevitably in history) many detractors. Most of the levied criticism seems to boil down to McFeely's lack of admiration for his subject and an ongoing argument amongst historians about how far to rehabilitate Grant's image as a President. I suppose that this kind of discussion is inevitable, if you consider the number of troubling issues over which is administration provided: Native American affairs, the reconstruction of the south and the rights of the newly freed African Americans, the panic of 1873. There were plenty of difficult decisions to be navigated and many associated political axes to grind, and that hasn't changed to this day.Happily, this reader is not well enough versed in any of the historical bunfights to have a horse in that particular race. I found the McFeely biography balanced and quite human. Grant is a fascinating character-- a life-long failure until the war gave him a chance to shine; an ordinary man who was never quite comfortable or at home in what he perceived as the halls of the great. McFeely is unsparing of Grant's mistakes, but quite generous as to Grant's intentions. I found myself with a great deal of affection for the President, and a sense of deep regret for opportunities missed during the post-war period. It illuminated a period of history for me of which I knew very little, and opened up a world of subjects for further reading.Very glad that I read the biography. Really interesting and well-written. I appreciated the Selected Bibliography, and only wish that it had been annotated or categorized."},{"Title":"Grant: A Biography","review":"Grant neo-phytes may hate this book for its faults (and there are faults in some conclusion McFeely makes), but there are few histories of Grant which are as lively or informative as McFeely's. If you're interested in Grant and not afraid to confront the assumptions of an author there may not be a much better place to look for the whole of Grant's life experiences than here."},{"Title":"Grant: A Biography","review":"McFeely writes with the same slant that infects many books about the CIvil War -- an assumption that the Confederacy was a noble, though misguided, enterprise, interested in \\"states rights\\". Only when you know that the South went to war to spread slavery by force, can you understand anything else about the conflict. In an effort to demonize Grant, McFeely doesn't even mention the cause of the Civil War, and in that light, you can make Eisenhower look like a boogie man. If the South didn't want a war, they shouldn't have pushed slavery like the maniac lunatics they were. The not only enslaved millions, tortured, raped, sold children, whipped women, they terrorized the US, much like religious fundamentalist do in Islamic nations. We have completely covered up the vile truth of Southern Confederacy. The Confederacy was led by bullies, traitors, and slavers. Yet when someone stood up to them, they cried like babies, and have cried for 150 years. Grant did his job, a job the Southern lunatics made necessary."},{"Title":"Grant: A Biography","review":"I am currently reading a biography of every President in order. I must say that none of the preceding Presidents (even Lincoln) seem to be as difficult to pin down as Grant as to their \\"definitive\\" biography. In addition to McFeely's Pulitzer prize winning effort is Geoffrey Perret's offering, which seems to be universally derided as a scholarly farce, Jean Edward Smith's biography of Grant is clearly meant for a more popular readership (indeed Smith's commitment to scholarly research is somewhat dubious himself given he was able to produce a 1,000 page biography of FDR in less than 5 years after writing his Grant bio), and finally Brooks Simpson's projected two volume biography which when complete will certainly be the most comprehensive modern effort. McFeely's biography was the Pulitzer prize winner and that ultimately swayed me in favor of it, although I was a bit concerned about some of the poor reviews it received.I will state from the outset that I think most of the criticism of McFeely's biography I have read in other reviews is either unwarranted or overstressed. This is a straightforward \\"old school\\" biography that is directed by the research and not by some new spin that the author believes will help sell the book. McFeely won the Pulitzer Prize for this work and rightfully so. This is a comprehensive and balanced biography of Grant that is a highly enjoyable read on top of that.I'm not sure what the negative reviewers expectations were before reading this book. Obviously most feel that Grant is somehow misrepresented by McFeely, however I definitely did not reach that conclusion. I believe this is the best comprehensive one volume biography of Grant available based on extensive research and solid writing."},{"Title":"Grant: A Biography","review":"The best attribute of this book is the manner in which the author allows the reader to explore the human drama of Grant's life. Grant, who loved and commanded massive attention from the American public from his days as a general until his death, was in reality an average person, perhaps not as intellectual or politically astute as other presidents. Whereas the man was a successful military leader, he was a failure in every busines endeavor his entire life, and was, at best, an ineffective president. Grant too often allowed his personal relationships with his cabinet members and advisors cloud his judgment when dealing with the unethical behavior of those close to him. Grant somehow managed to survive eight years of scandals but was for years thereafter labeled as an incompetent and naive president.Having not read any other account of Grant's life before this one, I don't have anything on which to judge the objectiveness of this book. However, I believe the author balances the successes with the failures of one of the most fascinating American leaders this country has produced."},{"Title":"Grant: A Biography","review":"The great stregnth of this book is that McFeeley remembers that Grant had a lfe after the Civil War and devotes much space to Grant's presidency and and post presidential life. Grant was a great enigma in that he was able to succeed in managing the conduct of the Civil War yet was a failure in business and had serious shortcomings as President. McFeeley tells a story of Grant as a young man going into a business partnership. His partner asked him to advance a sum of money and Grant demamnded a promissory note to assure payment. The man said that a note would make him extremely nervous and that he would always be looking over his shoulder. He told Grant that Grant could trust him and the naive Grant loaned the money. Without my going into it, I am sure you can guess as to whether Grant ever saw the money again. Late in life, he went into a business partnership with two individuals, one of whom was his son. The partners illegally pledge securities as collateral for multiple loans. If the loans could have been paid off there would not have been a problem but when the firm went under, the trusting Grant suffered severe financial hardship.The stories of his business failures are illustrative of Grant's willingness to trust others. McFeeley illustrates the famous scandals that took place all around him during his presidency. He had no clue about monetary policy so advisors would advise him and then speculate in gold based upon what they figured he would do. Of course, such dealings caused economic panics. Grant, as President was well meaning but, as McFeeley illustrates, was too loyal to his cabinet members and aids. Well over a century before President Clinton committed perjury, Grant may well have done so when out of loyalty to a close aid, he testified in the aid's behalf in a criminal trial.Grant was also well meaning as to Recontruction. His instincts were right in that he wanted to protect newly freed blacks in the South yet, he was manipulated into replacing his attorney general who was very active in prosecuting those who denied blacks their rights. Because Grant did not impliment what he believed, Reconstuction was basically a failure.McFeely takes some risks. For example, when Grant was stalled outside of Petersburg, slowly tightening the vice on Lee's battered army, McFeely posits that he was concerned that Sherman would eventually join Grant's army. Accordingly, Grant was concerned that Sherman, not he, would have gotten the credit for any ultimate victory. The conventional view is that Grant would have welcomed having Sherman hasten the end of the war. Some would accuse McFeeley of historical innacuracy but I like this sort of educated conjecture. Grant may have realized he could ultimately become President and may well have been concerned that Sherman could have been advanced as a candidate if he was perceived to be the agent of Petersburg's fall.I really enjoyed this book and I think it richly deserved its Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"Grant: A Biography","review":"with no pretense & easy to understand. It is also a whole life biography rather than the well trod grounds of Grant, the general or Grant, the president. They are an important part of the biography, to be sure, but there is so much before & after that is less known.The point is made several times By Mr. McFeely that if there had been no Civil War there would have been no Grant. That is, he was a loser & would have been a nobody. It seems to bother the author that it takes the horrors of war to raise some men above others. However, Grant is not the only person that the Civil War elevated to greatness. Grant also knew this but didn't dwell on it enough apparently for Mr. McFeely liking. He was what he was.Grant disliked his West Point years & was indifferent to the military as a peacetime career. But he was good at war. What he wasn't, was rich & he spent his time before the war & after his presidency chasing get rich quick schemes. They all failed. Ironically, writing about the war revealed a hidden talent. His memoirs written at the end of his life made Julia a very wealthy widow. The long passages concerning the scandals & corruption in his presidency are tedious at times. He was basically an honest man who didn't know how to stop it. His dream of annexing the Dominican Republic as a state & his plans for Reconstruction were abysmal failures. Especially interesting was his 26 month around the world tour after his eight years as president. He came back too soon & attempted to recapture the presidency in 1880 after a four year absence. But although he was was still loved & revered by most Americans there was no groundswell for him to return to the White House. His years in the White House were not his finest hour.

McFeely is very in depth about Grant, but there is so much extra information to get through to reach Grant. About half of the book was devoted to Grant's associations with people, places, and things. The book contains very little literary devices if any. It is very stale at some points. The book is not for people seeking to enjoy a book about the life of Grant. Instead to book appears to be more of a reference text for historical studies, not enjoyment. If you are wanting a personal view of Grant, this is simply not the book for it.

McFeely's book Grant attempts to be an objective look at the life of one of the most well-known of US generals. It is a good account, full of details into Grant's life and quick to dispel many of the popular myths (both positive and negative) which have been spread about the general. The treatment of the Civil War does not take up the majority of the work, but instead comprises a part of the career of a man who went from tanner to army man to President to writer, with various stints as a failed businessman and bored peacetime army officer in between.In his quest for objectivity, I think McFeely has overstepped his bounds just a bit. He greatly downplays Lincoln's affection for Grant, claiming that the President was never quite sure if he could trust the general. Early on, this may have been true, but the fact is that Lincoln many times defended Grant when rumors came to his ear, saying he liked Grant because \\"he fights.\\" Also, McFeely calls Grant's wilderness campaign a \\"hideous disaster,\\" and insinuates that Grant did not care much about the colossal loss of life at Cold Harbor. The overwhelming fact about the Wilderness Campaign is that it was, indeed, very costly in terms of human life. Still, Grant got things done. He defeated Lee--something McClellan and the other commanding officers could not do. Grant did what he had to do, terrible though it was.Still, these are matters of opinion, and the book remains a wonderful treatment of Grant. One of the things I like most is that is gives equal treatment to all aspects of Grant's life, not just the Civil War. I learned a great deal about the Grant administration, which is usually regarded as one of the most corrupt in our nation's history. That may be true, but McFeely convincingly argues that not all of it was Grant's fault.Overall, this is a great work on Grant. It has its flaws, but it still remains an adequate overview of this man's life, and should provide a good companion to Grant's personal memoirs. I would recommend this book to anyone studying the Civil War, as it gives a great account of Grant's part, though it lacks details (which can be obtained in other studies of the War itself). This would be a great addition to any Civil War library, as well as a good book for anyone studying American History as a whole."},{"Title":"Grant: A Biography","review":"This is one seriously irritating book. There may be relatively few factual errors (at least, compared to Geoffrey Perret's work on Grant, a masterpiece of unintentional humor,) but McFeely's work is riddled with what I can only believe are deliberately insulting mischaracterizations and misrepresentations, tiresomely pretentious writing, and amateur psychoanalyzing of the most obnoxious sort. McFeely is particularly fond of quoting the words of Grant or his wife on some matter or another, and then proclaiming that--no matter how clear their meaning may have been to us poor dumb non-historians--what they were REALLY saying and thinking was something else altogether. If there is anything I can't abide, it's a biographer who persists in reading a subject's mind and putting words into his or her mouth and thoughts into his or her head that were never said and never thought. McFeely not only obviously believes he is much smarter than Grant (hah!) but more percipient than his readership, as well.If this book is worthy of a Pulitzer, then I trust my next grocery shopping list will earn me a Nobel Prize for Literature."},{"Title":"Grant: A Biography","review":"As the author of a book on the Civil War and another on the Reconstruction era, I highly recommend McFeely's biography of Grant. McFeely is not only a fine historian, he is a first-rate writer, offering sharp portraits of Grant and the figures who surrounded him; clear, insightful expositions on important issues; and a compelling narrative. The great strength of this work is its coverage of Grant's rise to the presidency and his two terms in the White House--one of the finest portraits of this dramatic, pivotal era, filled with everything from Indian wars to staggering political corruption to the first great struggle over civil rights. The book is weaker on Grant's military career during the Civil War; as McFeely draws out information about the general's personal life, he seems to neglect both the details and the grand scale of Grant's achievements on the battlefield. All told, however, this remains a classic biography--and a pleasure to read.--T.J. Stiles, author of IN THEIR OWN WORDS: ROBBER BARONS AND RADICALS"},{"Title":"Grant: A Biography","review":"Any good biographer has to have, if not sympathy, at least some understanding of his or her subject. Unfortunately, although this book is well researched, you get the uneasy feeling that Mr. McFeely is examining Ulysses Grant like a bug under a microscope. This is the classic example of an academic who lacks understanding of real life and as a result cannot grasp the dynamics of a man of action, as Ulysses Grant certainly was.Mr. McFeely also unquestioningly adopts the prejudices of prior historians without thinking for himself. As a result, an historian who DID think for himself, Frank Scaturro in President Grant Reconsidered, has rendered Mr. McFeely's book obsolete. Every biography since Mr. Scaturro has reviewed the Grant Administration with a fresh and generally favorable eye. As the last civil rights President before Harry Truman, Grant certainly deserves that revised opinion.Mr. McFeely's book is no longer worth reading, if it ever was."},{"Title":"Grant: A Biography","review":"It didn't take long for the negative tone of this book to make me ask, \\"Isn't there something better?\\" So I put it down, picked up Grant's Autobiography instead, and found this delightful, funny, humble man, whom I wish I could have known personally. Like others, I went on to read Bruce Catton's books. Those, I can heartily recommend, as they provide the facts that make sense, given what Grant accomplished. As a newcomer to the Civil War, through Grant, I finally understand why the strategy and politics of what he called the Rebellion, are so engrossing."},{"Title":"Grant: A Biography","review":"Ulysses Grant is basically unknown today, but he was the nation's colussus when he led the Union to victory in the Civil War and for at least a decade afterwards. After his death, his reputation took a big hit when the depths of political corruption during his 8 years as president were revealed and when the country struggled with numerous economic crises to close out the 19th century. Grant was ultimately seen as a plodding general and an out-of-touch executive.This book is one of the correctives to that picture. Author William McFeely takes a personal look at a president who felt things deeply, but kept them effectively hidden for his entire public life. And while the biographer discusses Grant's weaknesses at length, he comes back again and again to a sympathetic view of a man who maneuvered through some of the toughest times this nation has ever seen.Grant's first 40 years have been brushed off by most Civil War histories in a few sentences. This book fleshes them out. Grant went to West Point, had a decent record, and served without distinction in the army for several years in Mexico and California. He quit in order to make his fortune, and he failed at numerous businesses, from farming to tanning to store-keeping. He returned to the army at a fairly high level and got a significant assignment simply because so few officers were available (half were fighting on the other side). Gradually, in campaigns in Tennessee and Kentucky and along the Mississippi, he proved his worth and honed his strategies. Eventually, he leapfrogged numerous generals who had more dash and social standing, and he proved to be the inspirational rock on which the war was won.But how did he develop the fortitude to do that? That's where this book is a gem, as it uses letters and records to document the people skills and confidence he picked up along the way that made him an extraordinary leader. He had organizational skills, and he had the common-man touch, the latter of which the biographer suggests comes from Grant's own deep-rooted lack of confidence about himself.Grant couldn't stand up well to his father or his wife; his life was one long effort to prove himself to both of them. But he could show a steely side to the rest of the world. And he could think strategically in battle, both about tactics and especially about logistics, the latter of which was the North's big advantage.A few years after the war, Grant swept into office on a tide of patriotic gratitude. He'd never held public office. He tried to pursue policies of civil rights for Blacks and Indians, but neither really came to pass. The best that can be said is that he temporarily blunted the worst instincts of others in the nation. And he presided over a terribly corrupt period, though he personally didn't seem to benefit from the rampant stock speculation and self-dealing of political leaders and their business cronies.When Grant left after two terms, he and his wife embarked on a round-the-world trip of more than two years that took them across Europe and Asia. He was feted endlessly, and, to some extent, he was an effective ambassador for an emerging world power. But when Grant returned to America, his time in the limelight had passed, and he fell into two more dubious financial schemes, ultimately needing a huge loan from the Vanderbilts to avoid bankruptcy. His final legacy was a two-volume memoir, started with an eye to rebuilding a nest egg for his wife, but then becoming deeply meaningful to him. Grant finished the book literally weeks before he died from throat cancer.The biographer tells the story of Grant's post-military career with great care. He's sympathetic to Grant's efforts on behalf of the downtrodden, but he notes that Grant ultimately was a striver, seeking to reach the upper levels of society and the security they represented. He shows Grant's loyalty, which was of great value in battle, was a detriment politically because so many of his Cabinet members were cheats and frauds who Grant wouldn't abandon. And he shows how Grant's wife Julia was truly the love of his life and his lodestar, but that her warped values (grew up a slave-owner, had visions of grandeur about herself and her children) also led Grant to make dubious decisions.All in all, it's a fascinating portrait of a great, but flawed, man. And it ends with the remarkable memoir, which turned out to be one of the most enduring pieces of writing of the l9th century: influential as history, memorial, and even stylistically. The fact that Mark Twain published them (the firm Twain had recently launched) and was a friend of Grant's late in his life makes the twists of history even more fascinating.Now, criticism. Though the book is hefty, it skims over major events very quickly. There's almost no Civil War strategy, especially battlefield strategy, in the book. There's a bit of the political strategy, but it's spotty. Anyone who didn't already know a fair amount about the war would not understand the scope of what Grant did or even where he was moving in battle. The same criticism can be leveled at the discussion of his years as president. Though there's more attention paid to some issues -- Reconstruction, in particular -- it's still not enough to really understand the pressures. Time and again, the biographer refers to reports that were in the press or in Congress about the treatment of blacks or the treatment of Indians or a financial scandal, but the actual reports are not summarized, even in footnotes. That additional layer of detail would be helpful.Best bet. Read a couple of military histories and political histories first, and then dive into this book."},{"Title":"Grant: A Biography","review":"William McFeely's book Grant: a biography, in my opinion, is a one-sided view of Ulysses S. Grant the man, the soldier, and the President. McFeely takes bits and pieces of Grant's life and Presidency and uses the information to go on all out personal attack of Grant and his wife Julia. McFeely, without any pause in narration, accuses President Grant of committing perjury at a White House deposition during his associate Orville Babcock's Whiskey Ring trial. Grant's presidency had many triumphs that McFeely purposefully ignores. McFeely points out in one instance that Grant refused to help Cadet Smith, the first black, at West Point. Grant could have done a better job protecting Smith from hazing, however, McFeely leaves out information. Another Superintendent of West Point was appointed in 1871, Ruger, who reduced hazing at the Academy by 1873, allowing blacks to graduate. Leaving out this bit of information makes Grant look like a monster. McFeely is a great writer and is able to weave history into his own personal creation. I believe that readers need to be wary concerning what they read in historical biographies. Grant's accomplishments include successfully handling the Virginius Incident and preventing War with Spain. Grant resolved the Alabama Claims and prevented War with Britain. McFeely comes close to mocking Grant and his Secretary Hamilton Fish, making fun of 19th Century conduct and diplomacy. Grant launched America's first expedition to the North Pole. McFeely forgot that one too. McFeely is a good source, but I recommend read his book with caution and to discover Grant through other independent historians."},{"Title":"Grant: A Biography","review":"When reading and then reviewing references McFeely used, many assumptions were made and facts were left out.

So, it can be difficult to find supplementary information. Also, I planted all six seeds and only got one to sprout. Now that I've done more research, I am a little surprised that I got even one. Most trees that need cold stratified stay in the refrigerator for 90 days, not one week.However, I did get my one tree from this kit, and he seems relatively happy. He's nothing like a tree yet even though he's more than a year old. He looks more like a pom-pom on a little twig and doesn't have any real branches yet. This leads me to think that this is not the best species of tree for a beginner. There are so many things that can go wrong, and having a tree that takes forever to mature makes it even more stressful.This book tries to make the process sound easy and short when it's actually a fairly long process. Some of the shortcuts in its directions probably greatly reduce your chances of getting a good tree established.A better place to start would be: http://seedrack.com/bonsai.html. All of their seed packs cost less than $5 and come with ten to fifty seeds and documentation specific to the kind of seeds with step by step directions. You'll be just as good starting there if you want to start growing a bonsai tree from a seed."},{"Title":"Mini Bonsai Kit","review":"The Mini Bonsai kit caught my eye at a local bookstore because I've always wanted a bonsai, but I'm very good at killing plants. I figured I'd pick this one up and take a look at it. While it's rather neat, it's still a bit of a disappointment. My first complaint is with the box, it says it contains everything needed to grow a bonsai garden. The kit contains everything needed to grow a bonsai tree, but not a garden. Small difference, but still somewhat puzzling.I'm having the same problem with this book that I'm having with the mini Zen Gardening Kit. When you open it fairly flat, you can see where it has been sewn, which make me worry that I'm going to destroy the book by reading it. The instructions for getting your bonsai tree started are very clear and are explained pretty well. It takes eight days to get the bonsai up and going, but at least you're told that in the first 2 instructions. The book also goes through caring for a bonsai, and the science and art behind it.The rest of the kit is pretty straightforward and decent. More than one jack pine seed is included, so you're not out of luck if one doesn't sprout. The pot is some kind of non-plastic, non-metal pot, standing about an inch tall and about 2 inches across. There's a peat pellet included so you don't have to go buy soil or dig up your neighbour's yard, and there is a set of miniature scissors included as well. The scissors are little plastic cheap scissors, but they cut paper, so they will probably work in pruning a bonsai."},{"Title":"Mini Bonsai Kit","review":"A lot of people claim that their bonsai hasn't grown because of the instructions, but I've also noticed that a lot of amateur bonsai enthusiasts go against the instructions in the tiny book by way of cold stratifying beyond suggested time, using techniques too advanced for this particular kit, et cetera. However, it's been a couple of months and my bonsai is thriving. Call it luck, but I planted it during a less than forgiving summer (rather than spring), watered it with tap water, kept it indoors for weeks at a time, and yet it's becoming a little masterpiece on my desktop.I have actually owned this kit twice; the first being when I was just 11 years old. The first time I threw away the instructions by mistake and planted the seeds without cold stratifying, and it sprouted shortly before wilting to death due to my childhood apathy of growing stuff. Today my desk is graced with the company of a maple bonsai I found (bonsai are everywhere, even if the kit were to fail), and the included pine that, currently, vaguely resembles the unknown variety of pine in my yard.The kit itself doesn't come with everything for a beginner, however. There are many more tools used in the delicate art of bonsai other than the tiny scissors. Perhaps this the one essential that should have been added would have to be training wire."},{"Title":"Mini Bonsai Kit","review":"I also purchased this when it caught my eye at a bookstore.I cold stratified the seeds for 1 week, planted them on 9/12/04, and 2 weeks later, I have yet to see any results.It would have been nice if the book would have given a hint about how long I should wait to see sprouts. All that's in the book is \\"when the plants have grown\\".Maybe some companies just make their money on impulse shoppers. After one product is sold, they move on to the next one."},{"Title":"Mini Bonsai Kit","review":"I'm an outdoor hobbyist that lives in the extreme heat of Las Vegas, so I figured it would be nice to have a bonsai since it is difficult to cultivate outdoor plants in the extreme heat with water regulations. I bought this kit around the same time I bought a four year old juniper bonsai and my bonsai collection started.There are several things any bonsai beginner should know:1.) Any tree acquired through a seed will not become a full fledged bonsai for at least 2-3 years. This meaning, you won't trim it, though it may be easier to train into a desired design.2.) Conifers, which the Jack Pine is, need to be outdoors to grow properly. This applies even to bonsai.3.) Pines are not the best beginner bonsai, nor are seedlings. Don't feel discouraged at buying one from a store, many bonsai sensei never grow their own bonsai from seed. I bought a money tree bonsai at the 99 cent store and have been growing it mainly for cuttings for friends to start their own bonsai fetish: money tree bonsai are fairly easy to tend to and are indoor bonsai.Bonsai Boy is a good place to look for good beginner trees, for semi-cheap prices. In any case do a bit a research into bonsai before deciding; Jack Pines live for a couple hundred years.For anyone who has purchased this kit, I suggest leaving the seeds in the refrigerator, but changing the paper towel weekly until the seeds have sprouted and become tangled in the towel, then gently place all the seeds about 1/2 inch in the bonsai pot. When the following spring comes and it is time to repot it might be best to repot ALL the seeds either in the same pot separated areas or in separate pots entirely. I suggest this because its nice to experiment with different styles of bonsai. When, in time, pruning is needed forget the scissors- gently pinch/pull off new buds to encourage more compact growth needed for bonsai.Good luck, may your soil stay moist, but not rot the roots."},{"Title":"Mini Bonsai Kit","review":"My sister received this as a gift, and she in turn passed it on to me.

I stuck them in the freezer for an hour, then back into the fridge for two hours. I prepared the soil and planted them immediately. A week passed and nothing had sprouted so I just put the remaining three seeds in the soil too. I kept the soil at a steady temperature on a window sill just above my electric room heater. In about two weeks 2 of the seeds had sprouted. I presumed these were the two I had treated. I immediately split them into two separate containers when the 3rd sprouted a week later. Over the next few weeks the remaining two seeds sprouted, but I killed them because I didnt want to thin my remaining soil. So now I have two bonsai trees growing rather well. One is substantially weaker than the other. The weak one is in its origional bonsai pot, the strong one is in a miniature tupperware dish. lol.

For every letter of the alphabet there is a gorgeous, vivid, and quirky scene precisely arranged with toys and paper cut outs. In each picture there are many different objects that begin with that particular letter of the alphabet. This makes it somewhat of an \\"I spy\\" experience and in the back you'll find an index of all the hidden objects. Underneath each picture is a sentence which uses alliteration and assonance to emphasize the sound of each letter. My kids love to look at and listen to this book. Now that my son is getting ready to learn to read, I'm rediscovering it as a useful tool in teaching him phonics. Also, I truly adore the photos.

He had got in on Tuesday; he had spent Wednesday for the most part down town, looking into the dismal subject of his anxiety -- the anxiety that, under a sudden decision, had brought him across the unfriendly sea at mid-winter, and it was through information reaching him on Wednesday evening that he had measured his loss, measured, above all, his pain. These were two distinct things, he felt, and, though both bad, one much worse than the other. It wasn't till the next three days had pretty well ebbed, in fact, that he knew himself for so badly wounded. He had waked up on Thursday morning, so far as he had slept at all, with the sense, together, of a blinding New York blizzard and of a deep sore inward ache. The great white savage storm would have kept him at the best within doors, but his stricken state was by itself quite reason enough.He so felt the blow indeed, so gasped, before what had happened to him, at the ugliness, the bitterness, and, beyond these things, the sinister strangeness, that, the matter of his dismay little by little detaching and projecting itself, settling there face to face with him as something he must now live with always, he might have been in charge of some horrid alien thing, some violent, scared, unhappy creature whom there was small joy, of a truth, in remaining with, but whose behaviour wouldn't perhaps bring him under notice, nor otherwise compromise him, so long as he should stay to watch it. A young jibbering ape of one of the more formidable sorts, or an ominous infant panther smuggled into the great gaudy hotel and whom it might yet be important he shouldn't advertise, couldn't have affected him as needing more domestic attention. The great gaudy hotel -- The Pocahontas, but carried out largely on 'Du Barry' lines -- made all about him, beside, behind, below, above, in blocks and tiers and superpositions, a sufficient defensive hugeness; so that, between the massive labyrinth and the New York weather, life in a lighthouse during a gale would scarce have kept him more apart. Even when in the course of that worse Thursday it had occurred to him for vague relief that the odious certified facts couldn't be all his misery, and that, with his throat and a probable temperature, a brush of the epidemic, which was for ever brushing him, accounted for something, even then he couldn't resign himself to bed and broth and dimness, but only circled and prowled the more within his high cage, only watched the more from his tenth story the rage of the elements.\\""},{"Title":"The Color of the Soul (The Penbrook Diaries, Book 1)","review":"The Color of the Soul by Tracey Bateman is about a young black man's struggle to find his identity and carve out his own niche in a world where only whites are regarded with respect. Along the way, he discovers the truth about his own past and family heritage.As a northerner transplanted to the Deep South, I was impressed with the author's handling of the subject of Southern race relations in both 1948 and the 1800's, and with her attempt to bridge the gap between whites and blacks.But this is far more than a story about being black or white-it's a powerful illustration of God's ability to redeem tragedy and heartbreak. The book drew me in from the first page, and at the last kept me up till 3 AM. I wept through the last pages, then found myself thanking the Lord for His similar mercy in my own life, and for allowing me to experience what love and happiness that I have.When a story can turn us so fully to praise of God's redeeming hand, it doesn't get much better.

Gritty and true-to-life, once you start reading it's impossible to put this book down. The novel has the flavor of Roots by Alex Haley with a twist of the modern pre-civil rights feel of the deep south. A young black man discovers his true heritage as he learns family secrets through reading the Penbrook Diaries. Intricately woven detail, excellent characterization, scandal and intrigue all set this novel apart from most. The author clearly has a gift for writing historical fiction and probing deep issues of the heart. She does an excellent job at making the reader think about all that they hold dear and will have the reader choked up through half the book. The strongest emotion I experienced while reading The Color of the Soul was regret. I wish Cat had made different choices in her life and I totally identified with her plight and the plight of the men who loved her. This story is an excellent portrayal of how people think they know what's best. If only Cat had trusted in God rather than trying to manipulate things herself, she may have had the love she longed for and the life she dreamed of. Unfortunately, by the time she discovered all that she had lost, it was too late.

The story pulled me right into the Southern world of Andy, his ancestors, and a mysterious 100-year-old woman.The author does not hold back the brutality of slavery and racism. Though it's hard to take at times the violence is never senseless. In fact, the horrors and injustices that Cat, Andy, and other characters face add power to the message of redemption and healing. Instead of my typical \\"I'm sure glad that I didn't live back then\\" response, I found myself with a deeper appreciation for those who endured such dark periods of American history.This is the first book that I have read by Tracey Bateman-the first of many I hope.

Though this is the first book in a series, it didn't leave the reader hanging at the end (like too many series books do).

However for Andy and Miss Pembrook, it is what is inside that truly matters as shocking secrets of heritage and ancestry are discovered.Have you ever read a book that after you finish reading you feel totally drained? That's what happened to me after reading this book. I got so caught up in the characters and in the story that I felt like I was in the book. This was one of the most powerful books that I read this past year. The story just hooks you from the beginning with a mystery that is throughout the book. If you are a fan of happily ever after historical fiction, do not read this book. If you are not prepared to face the reality of racism in this country, you are not the right reader for this book. The characters' stories in this book just break my heart with their plight. I am so glad that I was not born during this era. The prejudice and cruel treatment that was suffered just because of the color of skin sickens me. There would be parts in this book where I wanted to scream with anger because of how the characters were treated. What was worse was that these were people who would claim to be Christians and then turn around and act in ways that disgusted me. But really, this just shows how well the book was written to evoke such a powerful response in me. I do love the time period that this book takes place. The late 1800s to early 1900s is the time period in American history that fascinates me the most. If you read any historical fiction book next year, this book needs to be on your list. It's a story that's unforgettable and needs to be read by all. Thank goodness I have the sequel in my TBR shelf. It's definately on my list to read next year."},{"Title":"The Color of the Soul (The Penbrook Diaries, Book 1)","review":"[...]1948 Georgia is not exactly a welcoming place if your skin is the wrong color, but invited by a dying old woman to write her biography, Andy returns to the home of his youth just the same. Over a hundred years old, Miss Penbrook has seen the worst part of Georgia's history. A young woman during the last days of slavery, she survived the chaos of the Civil War and the long rebuilding of the South. This is the story she tells with a little help from three diaries written by three very different women.\\"The Color of the Soul\\" is a split storyline jumping back and forth in time over the span of one hundred years. As the clock rolls back, Andy learns about Camilla and Catherina both white...at least on the outside. However, a drop of Negro blood has destined Cat to slavery. Will her secret be revealed, or might she pass her illegitimate son off as a wealthy plantation owner?Camilla, filled with hatred toward the white slave girl that her mother holds as dear as her own flesh and blood, sees no other recourse than to end all possibilities for Cat's happiness thus furthering her own.Jumping forward to 1948, Andy sorts through these women's past in an attempt to write the biography that will win him a name. In the process, his own shameful past is unburied.His wife in Chicago doubts his fidelity and with good reason. The KKK is breathing down his neck, and God pounds incessantly on his heart's door begging admittance.In this intense historical novel, Bateman unashamedly unearths the most disgraceful segments of America's past--its slavery, and later, its bigotry toward blacks. Unafraid to write how it was, her characters are both extreme and impassioned, either in their racism, or their hatred of it. She has also not ignored those caught in the middle who were \\"too black to be white and too white to be black.\\"Not having been slack in her research, Bateman has produced a work expertly written. Each character leaps off the page, straight into the reader's heart leaving an impression that will not be soon forgotten.Her dual storyline divided by such a broad span of time is such a creative and unique approach to the Christian novel that the reader cannot help but pull an all-nighter.Society has set its standards, yet Bateman accurately challenges them burrowing under the skin of the matter and revealing the true qualifier--the color of the soul.Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Color of the Soul (The Penbrook Diaries, Book 1)","review":"This was a great book!

It makes you rethink just what the black people went through over the years.If you are looking for a book that has a lot of turns, mysteries galore, and many interesting people--read this one, it is worth your time.Wanda writes other type books (especially Amish) that I have enjoyed, but I think she did even a better job on this book.

It is mostly for very advanced learners who want to understand and see in depth how this languages has changed in a couple of decades.

Lewis?s Turkish Grammar is by far and away the most useful book on the subject I have come across.My first exposure to the book was when I signed it out from our public library ? and overnight after just glossing through a few sections I felt my understanding of Turkish grammar had doubled compared to what I had learnt in the past couple of months. The layout is such that you can pick things up very quickly.Turkish Grammar has an excellent layout which allows it to tackle the subject in a quite thorough manner - yet remaining concise with numerous examples with accompanying English translations to prevent the new student from getting buried under a mass of mind-boggling grammatical terminology. The terminology is still there for those who know it ? but not essential knowledge to find one?s way through the book. It is very easy to look up and locate specific details and find a quick answer to any questions or concerns.Turkish has a notorious reputation for being a difficult language ? where in fact it is so analytical, consistent, regular and logical that (after mastering the basics of Turkish grammar) one has to seriously wonder just how foreigners are able to acquire even a working knowledge of English ? a language overflowing in inconsistencies and irregularity.My only complaint ? and a minor one, at that ? is that it does examine some of the obscure stuff like the older Ottoman forms imported from Persian and Arabic which have become obsolete or rarely encountered in general daily language since the Atat?rk language reforms in the 1930s. Such material should have just been compiled together and included in a separate reference appendix ? because the general modern student really has no need to know about obsolete Ottoman usages. That all said, but if the book was going to look at the Ottoman language, it would have been interesting to have included for reference the old Arabic script which the Ottomans used. But this complaint is just a minor point and in no way blemishes this outstanding work.If you only have one book on the Turkish language - this is THE ONE!"},{"Title":"Turkish Grammar","review":"Excellent grammar book! Mr. Lewis' book is supremely logical without being unnaturally systematic. The book covers the breadth of the lanuguage in a thorough yet extraordiarily concise manner. He, on occasion, will grace the reader with a bit of modest humor while remaining pertinent. Obviously an intelligent man who has an impressive grasp of the language and who from this learned perspective is able to break-down and effectively convey the grammar of the Turkish lanugage.

(Note: It is not a textbook, but a reference grammer intended to clarify and expand on what one has learned from a textbook or course. Also, it is a traditional grammar, with little of the jargon or theoretical speculation of &quot;modern&quot; linguistics.)Its strength is the incredible richness of the material it contains, and the way that this material is explained. Lewis clearly loves the Turkish language, and has been collecting material and thinking about it for many years. He thus covers very many constructions that are simply not dealt with at all in other books. Moreover, he writes beautiful (British) English, and has a particular gift for finding an English expression that parallels the Turkish one so closely that the reader both gets and is able to recall the point.Beginners in Turkish will likely find this book too much at first, but after getting their bearings in the language and looking to learn more, they will find this one a treasure-chest of information that is a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Turkish Grammar","review":"This book is an excellent resource, but not a good introduction to the language for a beginner.

However, I'd advise against getting the first edition that this listing describes.Besides the usual paradigms of substantive declension and verb conjugation, it covers a host of other concepts that present a challenge to the foreign learner. The chapter on word formation is excellent, and understanding word formation is vital after nearly a century of commonly deriving new lexemes from pre-existing Turkic roots. The chapter on number, case and apposition cover matters which prove very difficult for English speakers to tackle, things like agreement of plural nouns and verbs (or lack thereoff) and when to use izafet linking (and when not). A very nice extra is a chapter which gives a word-by-word demonstration of how one sets about translating a complicated sentence. Would that more grammars include such material.Why do you need the second edition? Because Turkish changed immensely over the course of the 20th century, and the material you'll find here, though barely four decades old, is already archaic to contemporary ears. The second edition of the book gives a vast view of the impact of language reform on contemporary Turkish, much of which is distilled from the research which led to Lewis' great monograph of 1999: THE TURKISH LANGUAGE REFORM: A Catastrophic Success. It's a pity that Oxford set the second edition in a sans serif typeface, which is rather hard on the eyes. I enjoy so much the typesetting of the original edition.Basically, if you study Turkish, you need this book, but in the second edition."},{"Title":"Turkish Grammar","review":"I'm living in France and I already know the Turkish Grammar books that we can find in French.

This way it can be considered as a grammar of modern Turkish.This is a must have for anyone speaking English and starting to learn Turkish language."},{"Title":"Turkish Grammar","review":"Geoffrey Lewis' TURKISH GRAMMAR, first published by Oxford in 1967 with a second edition in 2000, is *the* reference grammar of Turkish for speakers of English. Besides the usual paradigms of substantive declension and verb conjugation, it covers a host of other concepts that present a challenge to the foreign learner. The chapter on word formation is excellent, and understanding word formation is vital after nearly a century of commonly deriving new lexemes from pre-existing Turkic roots. The chapter on number, case and apposition cover matters which prove very difficult for English speakers to tackle, things like agreement of plural nouns and verbs (or lack thereoff) and when to use izafet linking (and when not). A very nice extra is a chapter which gives a word-by-word demonstration of how one sets about translating a complicated sentence. Would that more grammars include such material.The second edition of the book gives a much vaster view of the impact of language reform on contemporary Turkish, much of which is distilled from the research which led to Lewis' great monograph of 1999:The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success. It's a pity that Oxford set this section edition in a sans serif typeface, which is rather hard on the eyes.Basically, if you study Turkish, you need this book. Yes, it's an academic book and goes for a high sum, but you'd be wise to make the investment."},{"Title":"Turkish Grammar","review":"I have begun to study the turkish language and this grammar has help me to know better the structure of this language. It is easy to read, with examples and by this way, you can understand the theorical principles."},{"Title":"Turkish Grammar","review":"Lewis's Turkish Grammar is advancing in age, and Turkish is evolving rapidly as ever; however, the material presented is as important as ever. This book is excellent for a second or third year student that wants to use the variety of Turkish postpositions and subordinate clauses more naturally. Along the way, they'll also probably correct a few incorrect artifacts that remain in their speech. There are plenty of examples to make every point clear. The book is an excellent reference."},{"Title":"The Christian Theology Reader","review":"A helpful compendium. For nearly three centuries the standard theological textbook of the church was comprized of the &quot;Sentences of Peter Lombard&quot;. More commentaries were written on it than on any other book (the Bible alone excepted). The &quot;sentences&quot; were comprized of sentences (short excerpts) from classic works - along with pithy comments on each &quot;sentence&quot; by Peter Lombard. This book provides the opportunity for modern readers to interact with sentences from the past. In our dialog with &quot;The Sentences of Alister McGrath&quot; this reviewer is hopeful that a new genre of theological literature may emerge that transcends both theological hobby horses and the campish editorial opinion of the &quot;schools&quot;."},{"Title":"The Christian Theology Reader","review":"I am tempted to fear that I would be struck with lightening if I gave this any less than five stars, given the subject. But I have given other theology readers less than five and I am around to tell about it. This reader deserves five stars with a bullet, for at least four sound reasons.First, it is BIG. If necessary, it could provide material for two semesters, if necessary. And the subject is so broad that one feels shortchanged if it is done in one. This was the text for the 1 semester course I took, and unlike the stated object of the course, no one theologian, with the possible exceptions of Augustine and Luther got the full treatment.Second, there are selections of works in here which are simply not available anywhere else. They were translated, probably, by McGrath's army of graduate assistants. That alone may be worth the price of admission. My only reservation is that some theologians, such as Albrecht Ritschl, who wrote several bit, multivolume works, is represented by only a short selection.Third, on the other side of the coin, non-theological writers whose work influenced Christian theology are included such as Wittgenstein and Dorothy Sayers.Fourth, it is organized so that one could approach matters either topically or chronologically, as we did in our class.The forewords and afterwords to each section are illuminating and go far to place the reading in its time and place. It is possibly the only reasonable alternative to buying twelve books, one for each of twelve major theologians, let alone the dozens represented in this edition. One warning. It seems that McGrath and Blackwell put out new editions every two or three years, which changes the order and number of things. If you need it for a class, pay close attention to which edition is being assumed (That is especially important for instructors as well.)"},{"Title":"The Christian Theology Reader","review":"An excellent companion to the text. A wealth of resource! I recommend this volume highly to anyone who loves theology."},{"Title":"The Christian Theology Reader","review":"This book has been very enjoyable to read as part of my Theology II class. I like reading the original church fathers directly, but also being able to digest it in small chunks."},{"Title":"The Christian Theology Reader","review":"\\"The Christian Theology Reader\\" is a helpful collection of excerpts of theological writings from throughout the Christian era. Organized into ten topics, it enables the reader to seed differing perspectives ranging from the interplay between philosophy and theology through to the Last Things. Reading from cover to cover provides the reader with an overview of much of Theological thought.I found this book to be interesting in that it brings to the page writings that I have heard spoken of but have rarely actually seen. On the question of the proof of the existence of God we are able to read the explanations of St. Anselm, and Guanilo' response thereto, along with later proofs such as those by St. Thomas Aquinas, Rene Descartes and Blaise Pascal. By reading the works of saints and scholars about whom I knew little more than their names I was able get some sense of why they were important and to what issues. The ability to compare and contrast conflicting opinions helps the reader to better understand each point of view.The list of \\"Conciliar, Creedal and Confessional Material\\" and the \\"Glossary of Theological Terms\\" at the end help to put the selections into context. My one complaint about this book is that it rarely identifies the denominations of the authors, thereby making it more difficult to determine the authority to be attributed to each. Checking the \\"Details of Theologians\\" in the back would have eliminated much of the uncertainty. I recommend that the reader consult it as he goes along, rather than reading it in turn at the end, as I did. Having read it through I plan to keep it as a reference for when I want to revisit a particular question or the work of a particular scholar."},{"Title":"The Christian Theology Reader","review":"This book is a great resource for theology study and research.

Particularly because many Christians have a limited scope, based entirely on one &quot;school&quot; or tradition, this book, and its highly readable companion volume, is enriching and enlightening. Since the books do not presume a knowledge of the various writers (as would many theology texts), but present a continuous historical perspective, either the student of religious studies, the historian, or one merely seeking to enrich his understanding of Christianity will find these texts &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; of the great richness in Christian thought throughout two millennia."},{"Title":"The Christian Theology Reader","review":"Wow is all I can say. I order books from amazon on a constant basis and none have come close to this one. I love how it is sectioned off into short chapters jammed pack with 1) info including an introduction and background for the writing, 2) the original excerpt from the writing, 3) comments that further explain or sum up the excerpt, 4) questions at the end so you can research some more on your own. I love it, especially the fact that each lesson (there's 362 lesson by the way) are ALL short, limited to 1-2 pages. This is perfect for those with wandering minds like myself to fit a solid lesson in a day with full concentration. I've even managed to keep a notebook in which I dedicate one page to each lesson, leaving room so I can come back and add things I learn later on.

As do all his works."},{"Title":"The Flowering of Human Consciousness (Power of Teaching Now)","review":"First off, this is excellent spiritual teaching as is the rest of the Eckhart Tolle lecture series. I have found his work to be most helpful in my own quest to become (and much trickier, remain) present. Because Eckhart is completely present as he speaks one is drawn deep into the moment simply by paying attention. The content is simple and straightforward, there is not much fact or idea to get lost in. This is what makes Tolle a top-notch teacher. He is a rare gift as he is completely authentic.Why then only four stars? Well, I put the first cd into my computer (the only way I listen to them) and it sounded like he was talking in an echo chamber. I have the same lecture on videotape and the audio portion of that is fine. I suspect this has something to do with copy protection. I will be taking the cds to listen on my office stereo to see if it's normal there. Anyway, Tolle is fabulous but I might recommend you try a different lecture if you're listening on computer."},{"Title":"The Flowering of Human Consciousness (Power of Teaching Now)","review":"Clear, wonderful, humorous and supportive guidance.

I was profoundly moved by the simplicity of the language, the clarity of the message, and the hope that is offered. My road from depression to wholeness was greatly facilitated by the reading and putting into practice,of the gentle message , given two thousand years ago,by Jesus,and illuminated by Raymond Cramer. Three of my children have died in tragic accidents. My depression nearly drove me to the brink of insanity. With pathos and clear scientific logic, Cramer points out that &quot;our frozen rage has melted unter the powerful love of God, we have been comforted-restored, changed, made able to live life at a highter, more creative level than ever before.&quot; So true.... Aha!"},{"Title":"The Psychology of Jesus and Mental Health","review":"Writing in easily understood laymen's English, the author unlocks the hidden messages about human nature buried in the words of Christ within the Sermon on the Mount. Mr. Cramer, by carefully researching the original Greek language used in the Biblical text to determine the most accurate meaning of each passage, gives the reader, without being boring or dull, practical and unique insight into how to achieve optimum mental health and enjoy life.One brief example is the meaning of &quot;Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth.&quot; A meek person is definitely not a &quot;casper milk toast&quot;, doormat, type person. The Greek stresses a meek person is one who is content and therefore can truly enjoy the material blessings (&quot;earth&quot;) of life; in fact, the meek person has a strength of character that controls materialistic impulses rather than being intimitated by them. As a result, they stay on budget and keep their finances in line. Sinc! ! e finances can be one of the major areas of conflict in marriage, the meek person usually does not have this problem and, therefore, has a stronger marriage because of being meek.This book should be read by anyone interested in balanced emotional and mental health and how to achieve it. In my opinion, business managers, teachers, and parents are among those the book will help. It would be especially helpful for psychology majors in college (great for those papers or extra credit projects) and professionals in the counseling and mental health field."},{"Title":"Deceit at Pearl Harbor: From Pearl Harbor to Midway","review":"Ken Landis, being the lone survivor of Adm. Kimmel's staff is in a position to know what Kimmel knew and what Kimmel did not know. Ken was Kimmel's communication officer and encoded/decoded all messages to Kimmel. More than that, extensive research by Landis has recently revealed some incredible facts about what Roosevelt and Churchill knew well ahead of the attack.This book goes beyond Pearl Harbor and delves into Naval Intelligence and how various Admirals did and did not respond to this information. Battles were won or lost on intelligence.This book is a powerful piece of history and a must read for anyone interested in World War II and the Pacific Theater of Operations."},{"Title":"Deceit at Pearl Harbor: From Pearl Harbor to Midway","review":"Clearly an interesting text and well worthwhile the time for any one keen on Pearl Harbor lore. While the writing shows the need for some more editing, overall, an excellent addition to those many Pearl Harbor bookshelfs out there.A \\"firsthand\\" account of two survivors of the Pearl Harbor attack provides some topical perspectives not brought to the fore previously. While much of what is related is \\"old news\\" for many, there are some new tidbits. Of course, the text does, yet again, highlight that many known documents and other WWII materials are still classified even today.The revelation of the \\"tapping\\" of the Churchill-Roosevelt trans-oceanic telephone conversations is one such new item for some, as apparently this was not very well-known to some Pearl Harbor buffs. This is based on the release, by the United States in the mid-1990s, of some of the transcripts the German \\"wire-tapping\\" which indeed supports the \\"We knew.\\" sentence which is how Stinnett's ends his highly-regarded earlier \\"Day of Deceit\\".There are several other things of importance in this text, but two in particular are notable and even not mentioned: (a) these conversations and other correspondence began before Churchill became Prime Minister; these relate directly to Tyler Kent's imprisonment in Britain. And (b) all of Churchill's conversations were transcribed (yes, copies were made and are extant today; and very importantly they are not subject to any of the UK-USA crypto agreements); all of those Churchill-Roosevelt transcripts remain classified, but perhaps not much longer.As \\"reader\\" from earlier seems unclear, or ignorant of well-known facts, a primer here may help:As to the vulnerability of the A-3 scrambler; a scan of Marshall's Joint Congressional testimony will show that he ordered \\"induction\\" testing to be done by the US Army Signal Corps (HQ: Fort Monmouth, NJ). This was done off Gardiners Island (eastern end of Long Island, NY). The A-3 relied on random voltage inverters ... not very complex and not very hard to deal with. Now, the later SIGSALY was an altogether different beast ... synch those 78 rpm LPs.As to the German capabilites, consider just two examples: (a) See Kahn's \\"The Codebreakers\\" (1967 - yes, a text from now almost 40 years ago, and well prior to Prange's publications), Chapter 16 \\"Censors, Scramblers, and Spies\\" on page 557 is shown a \\"Transcript of a German descrambling of an intercepted Churchill transatlanitc conversation.\\" and (b) See Irving's (2001) \\"Churchill's War\\" Volume Two \\"Triumph in Adversity\\" Appendix II \\"Telephone Jobs\\" beginning on page 841 - \\" ... this 'Forschungsstelle'(research unit) at Wetterlin was capable of intercepting both ends of the transatlantic radiotelephone traffic. They were scrambled, but the scrambling technique employed was one originally devised by Siemens, a German firm; the Nazi readily created a device for unscrambling the conversations. ...\\" Many of the Wetterlin Transcripts remain to be reviewed by historians.Finally, as some might know, Truman (via an Executive Order signed on September 28, 1945) had sealed in perpetuity certain \\"conversations.\\" For those interested - RG 216 (Record Group 216) at the National Archives is a good place to start. The PRIME-POTUS telephone conversations ...Who knew?"},{"Title":"Deceit at Pearl Harbor: From Pearl Harbor to Midway","review":"1996 marked the 50th Anniversary of the end of WWII and also marked the date that most WWII era documents became declassified. Among those that remain classified are the American and British official documents. However, when they declassified all German documents in 1996, the US Government inadvertently released proof that FDR and Churchill knew about and discussed the attack on Pearl Harbor on November 26, 1941.Churchill and Roosevely, against the advice of their security staffs, liked to use a telephone scrambler to talk and often they discussed highly classified material. The Germans had a listening station in line with the Washington-London radio-telephone line in Denmark and had installed an A-3 scrambler so they could eavesdrop on the routine conversations done over this line.In the early morning hours of November 26, 1941 Churchill called Roosevelt with urgent information about the Japanese intentions in the Pacific. Churchill said that they had a high level source that informed them the Japanese intended to attack the US. FDR said he knew about the fleet headed south to the Philippine Islands. But Churchill interrupted him and said, no it was headed for Pearl.After discussing the trustworthiness of this information, and Churchill assuring FDR that it came from the same individual who helped them with the naval codes, they then discussed how much damage could be inflicted and what to do. Churchill suggested they \\"do nothing\\" and if it came to light that they knew, they could always claim to have \\"misinterpreted intelligence\\". They even discussed the day of the impending attack, December 8, 1941, which they puzzled over, it being a Monday. Of course, their intelligence people would have instantly known that the Japanese were using their own date/time system, not that of the locality of their attack and in Japan the attack did occur on December 8.Anyways, buy the book and read the entire transcript of the conversation for yourself. And while this is only one source, remember that the official sources remain classified, indicating that they contain information that has not yet been divulged. And the only reason to retain classification over this information is that it contains information the government is ashamed of."},{"Title":"Deceit at Pearl Harbor: From Pearl Harbor to Midway","review":"Such an important piece of our nation's history.

How Ken and his staff cracked the Japanese codes to the great photos taken by the author during WW2, this is a great read."},{"Title":"Deceit at Pearl Harbor: From Pearl Harbor to Midway","review":"Well-written and an easy read.........But just another book attempting to prove what others have tried to do before....show that the nations leaders knew about the Pearl Harbor attack and just let it happen so the US was forced to join WWII. Anyone well read on the subject will see that without a list of sources with footnotes all of the &quot;facts&quot; given here can't easily be traced to their source. So you have to believe what you read. I've seen all this info before elsewhere.Ain't history great...you can write whatever you want if everyone you drag down with your &quot;proof&quot; is dead and gone.....well thats show-biz.Most would agree that Kimmel and Short, especially Kimmel, got a raw deal by taking the brunt of the blame for the attack, when the leaders in Washington should have shouldered as much or more of the blame. But why can't people just accept that the Japanese completely fooled everyone and carried out a bold and successful attack??But I guess that won't sell many books."},{"Title":"Deceit at Pearl Harbor: From Pearl Harbor to Midway","review":"Authors Landis and Gunn were on Oahu on 7 December 1941 and were thus witnesses to the Japanese attack, Landis at the Pearl Harbor Sub Base as a junior member of Admiral Kimmel's staff and Gunn at the Signal Corps Radar Filter Center at Fort Shafter. Unfortunately, their small roles in these events do not provide them any special insights and these shortcomings are all too obvious in this book. Lt. Cmdr. Landis uses two events as the centerpieces of his thesis that President Roosevelt knew the exact details of the Japanese attack and chose to ignore them so that America could use the attack as our excuse to enter the war-he goes on to suggest it was really Hitler and Germany that Roosevelt wanted to defeat, and he used Japan's attack to bring Germany into the war because of their treaty obligation to Japan. He cites \\"the President's\\" direction that three picket vessels be prepared and sailed to the Far East in hopes the Japanese will sink them as one example of Roosevelt's determination to precipitate congressional outrage and a declaration of war. Only one of these vessels actually sailed and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor negated this supposed ploy. The other example of Roosevelt's alleged conspiracy is a \\"transcript,\\" supposedly taken from German espionage files after the war, of a 26 November 1941 scrambler phone conservation between Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill in which Churchill relates exact details of the December 7 attack. Neither of these two supposed acts of complicity and deceit are supported by citations or research in a manner that even remotely validates their authenticity. In fact, the Japanese decision to attack and the exact date were not decided until 1 December 1941. Virtually everything that follows is ground already plowed many times. While Landis cites several books about the attack and rehashes the theory that Roosevelt allowed over 2,000 American to die rather that meet the attack he knew was coming, his research is virtually nonexistent. From the very outset author Landis makes clear he is fatally biased; he can find absolutely no fault with Admirals Nimitz or Kimmel, and can find nothing good in Admiral King or Generals MacArthur or Marshall. He asserts that, despite a number of Congressional and military investigations over the past 50 years, a clever and massive conspiracy led by \\"The Democratic Party\\" and facilitated by King, Marshall, MacArthur and literally thousands of others, has covered for Roosevelt's duplicity. The text suffers significantly from poor editing, with grammatical, format and contextual errors detracting from both credibility and readability. While there is some interesting anecdotal reading here, the total lack of scholarship and definitive research, coupled with the many editorial lapses, completely cancels any objectivity the book might otherwise have contained. This book cannot be taken seriously by those interested in the Pearl Harbor attack."},{"Title":"Shadowheart","review":"The hostile debate between the four colleges of magic finally explodes into open warfare as Xetesk seizes the opportunity to take the first rung on their vision of dominion with an assault on the depleted Julatsa, who sacrificed so much in the Wesmen wars (see Chronicles of the Raven trilogy). The Julatsa know they must find a way to survive the invaders, but to do so they will need the interred Heart of Julatsan.The other two colleges Lystern and Dordover discuss what to do when a somewhat depleted Xetesk turns to them and how to control what is left of the Raven. They forge an alliance with a plan to invade Xetesk after it wastes much of its magic, but to do so they must lock away or assassinate the Raven survivors. However, way to the west, a power is surfacing whose vision is that of a Balaian continent with no magic or eastern mage-rulers. In a ploy to conquer the other three colleges and thereby the continent, Xetesk has turned to the Balaian as an ally especially with the alliance and Raven in the way of their manifest destiny.The second Legends of the Raven fantasy (see Elf Sorrow) is a terrific middle tale as the hostilities that remained outward towards the anti-magical Black Wings (their mass grave as described in this thriller is simply grim and eerie) turns inward between the colleges. Readers will appreciate the continual saga of the Raven as the exhilarating story line is filled with action, but it is the political intrigue that makes for another great entry by James Barclay.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Shadowheart","review":"Don't think about it...just download them all.

She loves little cat even when little cat is being naughty, even when little cat screams, even though he paints pictures and when little cat picks up the toys. Yet none of these are the main reason why Mother loves little cat. I don't want to give away the ending but it is truly inspiring.Fathers should not be deterred from purchasing this book simply because of the title. The message is appropriate for all family members."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I read this Book in School, and I must say, this is one of the BEST WRITTEN Books in History.

One day, something happens that can change his life forever, and he and his friend Johnny flee to escape it. But they can't leave behind what they left. This book will keep you spellbound until the very last page! Read this book! You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I first read this book in 7th grade; I couldn't put it down then and still enjoy it now. What makes the book amazing in its own right is that it was written by a perceptive, gifted 16 year old and it was written from the heart. Some aspects of the book bugged me when I first read it, such as why Ponyboy felt his older brother despised him when it is clear from the beginning of the book that Darry loved him. Big brothers who despise you don't make you put Band-Aids on cuts, make you come home on time, or go out of their way to pick you up from the movies. Yes he hit him when Pony came home late, but only because he was so worried. Pony is 14, after all, and therefore a little egocentric. Darry is harder on Pony than he is on other brother Soda because Pony is the youngest, and also has a lot of potential if he would start paying attention. Soda is the big brother everyone would love to have-a lot of fun, good looking, and willing to listen to your problems without making fun of you. We are also as shocked as Pony to find out that even Soda has problems; he just keeps them to himself. Though hardened Dally blows up and gets himself killed when buddy Johnny dies, one wonders that even if Johnny had lived if Dally would have ended up differently. Hinton does a good job convincing us that rich kids have just as tough a time as poor kids, though admittedly in different ways. Pony is an orphan, but he is shown more love and concern by his two older brothers than the Socs are shown by their own parents, and certainly more than Johnny and Dally received from theirs, which is none at all. One wonders what Pony will become in the years to follow, and what sort of father he will be to his own children. We can only hope they do not have green eyes-those who have read the book will know what I mean. :-)"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"It was really good. I liked it.

In fifth grade, i moved to a new city and I had moved from a cathloc school into a whole new enviorment: Public school. People didn't like me because I was diffrent. I didn't swear, listen to they're type of music, or learn they're type of 'hood' vocabulary. I can understand what Ponyboy (what kind of name is that?)

The kids find it very engaging. They can't believe it when they find out that Susan Eloise Hinton wrote this book when SHE was a teenager!The basic conflict of the novel, Greasers vs. Socs, is a conflict you will find in almost any school in America. The labels may be different, but the premise is the same.

The book has one part when you can kind of tell that it was written by a 16 year old pupil (and it was when it was written) because the story kind of penetrated the set stage and was somewhat hrad to follow.

Even today, there are the rich kids, who wear nice clothes and have nice friends and family, and then there's the poor kids, who have less than their share. To me, Ponyboy doesn't seem rough and ready to fight, he's just trying to protect his fellow Greasers. It's amazing how they stick up for each other like that. Most &quot;friends&quot;, as they call themselves, don't have enough guts to stick up for their friends nowadays. It takes true courage to be a Greaser like Ponyboy and Johnny. Pony's willing to help Johnny even though he didn't do anything to kill that soc. That, to me, is a true friendship.

It has been about ten years since I read The Outsiders, and although I hadn't thought about the book much over the past few years, it has recently caused me to reflect on many things. Most importantly, this book affected a change in my life. While quite good, I'm not speaking of the plot or the content of the book at all. Although I have not read the book in some years, I can attest that it has made a serious impact in my life.Prior to reading The Outsiders in junior high, I had never found a real interest in reading. Not just a mere interests, but a real appreciation for reading. Now that I'm in graduate school, having read numerous books, both fiction and non-fiction, I can honestly say that it was this book that really spurred on my desire to read, and for that, I thank the author."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Are you a spoiled kid who has a lot of money, cars, girls, and almost everything you want? Or are you a kid who has no family, the only thing you&iexcl;ve got is your friends? Well Ponyboy was a greaser, the same as having no family and only your friends. Ponyboy didn&iexcl;t mind this, actually he was proud of being a greaser. Things were going great for him and his gang, until this one night when a couple of Socs, (the rich kids) jumped Ponyboy and his friend. The most unexpected thing happened, his friend killed a Soc, the guys panicked and bailed out. Undercover, where nobody knew where they were, Ponyboy and his friend think of what to do, and after some time they go back home. Although things get even more worse&iexcl;KThis book was an excellent book. I couldn&iexcl;t stop reading it. This book is about the life of the people in the hoods, the people who don&iexcl;t have a family, or any money. This book is about differences between the rich and the poor. However at the same time this book is about the things common teenagers go through day to day. The author, S.E. Hinton was 16 years old when she wrote this book. Somehow it feels as if she knew everything about the life of a greaser, like how they lived, how they dressed and looked. She went into so much detail about their appearance that you can easily picture how they looked and acted. For example, the character Darry, she made him a strong, good looking, smart, and kind of fatherly like type of figure. The way she expressed him was so realistic. Anyways, enough said. If you want to know more, read it for yourself."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books ( the other favorites by S.E. Hinton).

The book is packed with emotion and adventure and the ending is awesome. My cousin told me to read this book and when i started, I COULDNT PUT IT DOWN! this book really makes you think about yourself and especially about your friends and others you know. Just get the book and I almost guarenty you will love it.

It goes through many situations that some teens face every day or will at least face at some point in their life. The plot was lined up in a correct manner for the book. The author followed the sequence of events in which they happened. I believe that if she were to try to tell the story by jumping around to main points, like some authors do, it would have confused the teens it was meant for. I liked the way she told about the characters as they came into the story line. She gave some background information on all of the greasers as they were asking Pony if he was all right. The style seemed like it was meant to be portrayed as if this were a scene from the 50's or 60's. This is shown when the author uses hair grease as a boundary between the two social groups. The book stirred little emotion from me due to the fact that I'm not caught up in the social standards that most people live in today. Whether it's due to money, gender, race, or something else most people have a way of making their own &quot;gangs.&quot; Overall, I thought the book was interesting and it was able to keep me in the mindset of being one of the greasers.

This story is a great reprecentation of the life of a typical teenager in the 1970's and presents characters that everyone can relate too. I highly recommend this book for anyone that is looking for action and adventure in a book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Susan Hinton's novel &quot;The Outsiders&quot; is an excellent story which uses many diffrent levels of wtritting techniques. Her effective style she and symbols used throughout the book our very well defined. The most important facts in determining whether or not a work is effective in through the author's style. Another literary technique known as symbol also adds to the overall value of the novel. In Hinton's novel she overall uses excellent literary devices throughout the whole novel. Hinton's use of the first person narrative throughout the novel adds to the effectiveness of the story. By telling the story through the character of Ponboy, Hinton can make her story sound more believable, while at the same time illicid great emotion from the reader. If the novel had not been written in first person, it would not be such a compelling story. Hinton uses many symbols throughout her novel. The most significant symbol is her use of the diffrent gangs. The &quot;greasers&quot; are the lower economic class and struggle on as peoples whose lives are on the outside. The &quot;socs&quot; represent the wealthy upperclass who are hated by the &quot;greasers.&quot; The two diffrent gangs symbolize two totally diffrent groups in the world. Another symbol frequently used is the adolescents always drinking,smoking,and breaking into the movie theatre just to defy society. In conclusion Hinton uses a variety of ways to represent the teenage society of the 60's and of the present. Society in teenagers has not changed from the time she wrote this novel. Adolescents are still doing things to rebel, or things that make them feel good about themselves. She is a very good author who uses her sense of writting to show how society really is, and how people really act. I am not saying that every teenager does these types of things, but what she is talking about takes place in most every town in America."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This was an all around good book.

Johnny's best friend is Pony boy. Johnny and pony came home late one night and Johnny's parents didn't even know that he was gone and him and pony fell asleep at one of the places that they hang out. Pony Boy is another one of the main characters. Him and Johnny always are getting picked on by the Soc's. One of the times after a movie when the Soc's were drunk the were picking on pony boy and Johnny was going to help him but he went a little to far. He killed a Soc's named bob. Pony boy and Johnny ran away to a different city. Derry Was Pony boys brother and he took care of him. He was mean to Pony in the begging but then he starts to be nice to him when the book starts to be exiting. Dally was another was a friend and he gave Johnny and Pony the gun and told them were to go. Cherry was a Soc's but she was a nice one and Pony liked her. Dally was very mean to her because she didn't like them.This book was kind of slow in the beginning but then it got cool in the middle. This book was mainly about Johnny and Pony running away and living in the church and then when it is time for them to come bake the Dally comes to get them. When Dally gets them and they go back to the church to get there stuff the church is on fire and Johnny And Pony go to help little kids in the fire.

I first read it 5 years ago, and I have re-read it so many times since then. I just got finished reading it again, and I felt the urge to go out and tell the world. It is a book that no one should miss.The story is about Ponyboy Curtis, who lives with his two brothers, Darry and Sodapop, because his parents died. This little family is also part of a gang, with people that are classified as greasers. They are poor and are not liked by the public. On the other side of town, are the rich kids, the Socs. These two groups war against each other all the time, jump each other. It is a rough life. One day, a Soc goes too far, and Ponyboy and another member of his gang, Johnny, find themselves in a world of trouble. From here the book takes flight in a fast-paced and convincing style. Ponyboy conquers all that he goes up against, in one way or another.

This one and S.E.Hinton's book RUMBLE FISH are being used in the district where I do a lot of my work. There's a reason. They're excellent quality. This book was published three years after I graduated from high school. Where I graduated, we didn't have the terms \\"soc\\" (pronounced sosh, long O)and \\"greaser,\\" but I identified the two groups immediately. If there was any \\"rumbling\\" going on between the two of the groups in our school, I didn't know about it. But I know from painful personal experience what it is liked to be picked on by the \\"cool crowd.\\" And after I graduated I learned that when it came to the \\"cool crowd,\\" not all was gold that glittered. Those young people had a lot of genuine problems to deal with, too.This author knows how to paint personality types and make a believable story. Even though I have long since ceased to be a \\"young adult,\\" I lapped up this story as if I had just dropped back into junior and senior high school There's action, suspense, humor -- and be warned -- lots of tears. Ms. Hinton paints us a believable story of young boys who are trying to make their way with little guidance from their families and not much else but their mutual caring for one another to support them. The story moves quickly and will keep you on the edge of your seat.The ending is one of personal triumph, the very best kind to have.So -- even if you're a kid my age (considerably over 21 years old) try reading the book! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"My students really enjoyed this reading of the book. I've never seen them so quiet."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Book Reviewed by:Scott N.S.E. Hinton's book, The Outsiders, really caught my attention. Basically, it's about a young protagonist, Ponyboy, and the rest of his friends. This gang of friends is called the \\"Greasers.\\" Soon, a problem escalates between the \\"Greasers\\" and the \\"Socs,\\" the opposite social group. After the death of one of the \\"Socs,\\" things turn to chaos. Ponyboy and his friend, Johnny, show their heroic personalities after saving a few kids from a burning church. Unfortunately, Johnny gets seriously wounded in the fire. Suddenly, Ponyboy is faced with a couple of questions. Will Johnny die? Will they go to jail for killing that Soc?After reading this book once, I would definitely read it again. Because it was written in the 1960's, it will catch the eyes of any historical fiction lover. The use of alcohol, drugs, violence, and profanity makes the book unsuitable for anyone under the age of thirteen. I'm sure that both males and females will like this book, too. Overall S.E. Hinton wrote an awesome, action-packed book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"A book review by D. WilliamsThis book is of course by S.E. Hinton that she wrote when she was only 16, deals with many emotional conflicts of teens or young adults, especially with a character from the book named Pony Boy. Parentless, he and his two older brothers, Darry and Soda Pop, must survive the brutality of city living with the Socs, the bullies from the wealthy. Pony Boy believes that there are only two kinds of people, Greasers (Pony, Dally, and Soda Pop) and Socs.Of course Pony, Dally, and Soda can't hold off the rich uptight gang. That's they have friends like Two-Bit, Dally, and Johnny, which are also greasers. Pony and Johnny then find themselves in a sticky, one-way situation.

Ponyboy is the youngest of his brothers and the youngest in his gang. The other characters are Two bit, Sodapop, Dally, Steve, and Johnny. Their rivals the Socs fight the Greasers just for fun. Ponyboy has never gotten bothered until the night Ponyboy walks home alone and gets jumped. This creates tensions for the two rival gangs. But somebody in one of the gangs takes it to far. And they are forced to leave town and hide out from the police. After this only two things that the two gangs want to do is fight. This book is equipped with a very dramatic ending.

What Ponyboy does not know is that he will get into a suspenseful situation that will put his and his friends lives in danger as well as keeping his family together.The Outsiders is a one of a kind book that all ages can enjoy. I have read this book a while ago and was my favorite book and is still my favorite piece of literature. I believe the reason for my liking of the book is that it is action packed and full of suspense.

I think it's a very interesting story about life for kids in such situation as Ponyboy and the rest of the gang. My favorite is Dally because his character is just so strong and realistic. The way he acts, his almost madness... how he hides his true feelings... The characterization of him is done very powerfully, i think. Hinton is a great author to me, and i look up to her very much, Myself i write stories in the same area as she does, just that i can't let it be read by someone like a teacher or somethin like that. But i sometimes wish i could publish it cause like Hinton i have so many points about life to tell about to the people, thoughts... that i somehow introduce in the story just like Hinton does. I think i know ihow she fetl when she wrote the story... you probably think i'm dumb or somethin but that's how i feel. I love writting and reading...

It is called THE OUTSIDERS, by S. E. Hinton. It is about a gang fight between the Socs and Greasers. Johnny, one of the main characters, gets beat up.Then Johnny and Pony boy run away. It tells what happens when they run away and comes back. They were having an argument with each other. To quote a part of the book, &quot;'How come you like fights Darry?' He gave me one of those looks to hide what he's thiking. But Soda piped up: 'He likes to show off his muscles. I'm gonna show'em off on you little buddy if you get any mouthier.'&quot; This shows that Darry is trying to be in charge of raising them as family. Ponyboy was a main character in the story. He was Soda's little brother. He liked movies and like to read. The story takes place in the slums or ghetto of a big town somewhere. The gangs in the slums or ghettos seem to be more violent toward each other than other gangs. I recommend this book to boys or girls over fifth grade and up because it deals with gangs that are more like the ones in high school. That's why I think over fifth graders should read it. I think almost everyone would enjoy this book. There is somewhat of a moral to it. I enjoyed it and I feel the book was very good. Some parts were sad, although most of it was enjoyable. It was a well-rounded book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders I just finished reading the book, and then I watched the movie. I think the book is more descripitive than the movie. The characters looked like how they were described in the book, but their personalities weren't. I liked how the author discribed the characters.

He was different from the others and was the smartest."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book was kinda stale... First of all it wasn't something ANYONE could relate with, the society was totally fake maybe the author was dreaming when he thought up that &quot;society&quot; and there was no real &quot;plot&quot; i think the author tried to get a message across to the readers, but the fact that it was SO OBVIOUS shows a lot about his writing skill... If u want me to pick up something leave it in there for me to think about, dont smash it on my head with a hammer."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Okay, first of all there were no gangs in the book. The greasers were called Greasers because that was their style, in the same way Elvis Presley was a greaser. The &quot;Socs&quot; was just a slang term for the folks on the other side of town and they only stalked and jumped the greasers the same way &quot;jocks&quot; pick on &quot;nerds&quot;. Except for the rumble over the &quot;Soc&quot; Johnny accidentally killed while saving Ponyboy, the struggle was not about gang warfare; it was social classes, between the lower-middle class to poor and the upper-middle class to rich. They may have hung out in groups of friends but that didn't make them street gangs, as we may or may not know them today. No codes, initiations, affiliations, nor obligations to anyone or anything, and anyone could come and go out of their group or circle as they pleased with no worrys of the circle's feeling betrayed. NOW, AS FAR AS THE BOOK IS CONCERNED: it's thoroughly readable, I don't know how many times I've read it myself but I'm sure I'd need more than 8 fingers and 2 thumbs to count them. Off-hand, I don't know anyone personally who hasn't also read it and/or seen the movie (which is almost identical to the book only they cut out just a small handful of vital parts. I.E. Ponyboy temporarily dropping his sensitivity and braininess, to name just one). Anyway, it's a good book and good story for the time it was written. Maybe some of the minute details are a bit outdated (back then switchblades, today machine guns) but it's still a good read. Two thumbs up for S.E. Hinton, who was about sixteen when she wrote this."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"i read this book after seeing the movie witch was really good and the book is ten times better. defenitly worth 10 dollars"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This is an outstanding book.

One was a biography about Angela Davis. The other was The Outsiders. I hated reading. It was evil to me. But not only did I read this, I wrote the best book report I've ever written. I read the book several times since. My kids have all read it too. Not because their English teacher made them, but because I own the book and told them to read it. It's a story about three brothers in a street gang, and their friends. There is violence. There is also strong a strong family bond, not only between the brothers, but between them and their friends.

Thank you so much, Amazon!!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book and \\"That was then this is now\\" were the books I could relate to most as a teen.

It is a very thrilling book about Ponyboy and Johnny on their adventure. It is a very interesting book. There are two very different groups of people the Greasers and the Socs.Johnny and Ponyboy are attacked by the Socs and Pony is almost drowned Johnny pulls out a knife and kills one of the Socs. Pony and Johnny run away to an abandoned church. Later they go to eat at DQ and there is a fire in the church and Johnny and Pony run in to save a bunch of school kids. Johnny is badly burned. Later in the hospital Johnny ends up dying. The greasers have a brawl with the Socs and the greasers win. This book is a very good story about teens in a rough neighborhood and they have a hard time getting through life. I would give this book 5 star on the way they portray the scenes. This is a very good book. It is a must read for you!!If you haven't read this book you are missing out. It is a very good book and a must read. The gang fights between the greasers and the Socs cause chaos in the city. People are getting killed as a result of their feud. It sparks a beautifully laid out novel by S.E. Hinton. If you are looking for a thriller this is the book for you. I think anyone who likes to read will like this book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book was not what I expected. It had a thorough story and plot, which was very satisfying for a young adult book, as well as good details of settings and events. The characters and their personalities are developed very well. You can relate to them, and you expect the events to have happened to a real-life person. When you read about the main character, Ponyboy, and his misfortune and all the difficulties he went through, you feel pity torwards him. And when you read about Johnny's death, you can feel Ponyboy's shock and sorrow. That is what I mean by well-developed characters. The themes are another high point of the book. The themes S. E. Hinton chose to write about, especially those about life and how to use it, are interesting and thought-evoking. They make you think about the characters' actions as well as your own experiences. For example, Johnny's letter written to Ponyboy is full of wise words, and is where the theme fully comes out.There were a few things that turned me down from reading this book. For one, nearly all of the characters smoke and many are under the legal age of 18. Another point is that the greaser characters, including the main character, are okay with stealing and breaking other various laws and rules. But overall, this book is a good read for anyone."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book is amazing! I absolutly love the theme which is to never judge a book by its cover, since looks can be very decieving at times. I also really like the characters & their personalities because they're totally believable. My favorite character is Dally. He portray's his image as tough & cold-hearted, but actually he has a soft-spot within him. He treats Johnny like his younger brother & helps him & Ponyboy when they're in trouble. Overall I'd give this book five stars:)"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The book on CD was really great! I used it with my junior high class.

You won't be able to stop turning pages as the gang experiences things that keep you both entertained and inspired by their bravery. S.E.

I think everyone can relate to atleast one caracter in this book. I related myself to Ponyboy (the caracter that's telling the story from his point of view.)The author made me feel like he really went threw all of this, and this book wasn't fiction at all. Many life lessons come out at you as you read...and you don't want to put it down. The main caracter is an intellegent, opinionated teenager who is willing to hide himself and his feelings in order to fit into the world he is forced to live in..but some people he'll trust to open up too.

It is totally amazing. This is definitely a book that will make you laugh and cry. It is told so well by S.E Hinton that you can almost feel like you are on this wild journey with the greasers. I just love the Dally and the Ponyboy characters so much that early in my teen years, I wished that I could step right into the book and become their friend. A regular old greaser. Tuff.

In other words, from your own experience. Ponyboy tried to write about his brother's horse, Mickey Mouse, but &quot;I couldn't get it right; it always came out sounding corny.&quot; That relationship didn't belong to him, but to his brother, Soda. Eventually, he finds the words starting to flow when he writes &quot;about something that was important to me.&quot; He remembers the three boys who had died during the past week. He was there.

It's about a boy named Ponyboy, who is also the narrator, who tells the reader all of the problems that go around living on his side of the town. See, he's a greaser (poor) Others on the other side of town are called the west-side rich kids or the socs.

During the middle, some problems arise, and Ponyboy starts to understand that people do care and no matter a greaser or a social you still have feelings."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"i thought the outsiders was a VERY good book. my 8th grade class read it together..so it was kinda weird..but it was a very good book! u should read it!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"THE OUTSIDERS TELLS ABOUT THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN TWO SOCIAL GROUPS, THE \\"SOCS\\" AND THE \\"GREASERS.\\" THE STORY HAS A 50'S SETTING AND A REALISTIC STORY LINE.I ENJOYED THIS STORY BECAUSE IT IS NARRATED BY A YOUNG BOY NAMED PONYBOY WHO LIVES WITH HIS TWO BROTHERS SODAPOP AND DARRY.

It has a real life feeling to it. For the situation that the kid was in. He and his older brothers handled their selves real well by both their of their parents being dead.

He realizes that he gets really lucky that he did not end up like his friend that almost got beaten to death. It was a good thing that his oldest brother got a job to take care of the family.

It's basically about a group of boys called the \\"Greasers\\" and they live in a rough area. The main character of the book is a young boy named Ponyboy. On the other side of town is a gang that is full of well-dressed preppy boys. The whole story is about a battle between two different worlds. The huge event in the story is when Johnny and Ponyboy get jumped by the preps and Ponyboy is getting drowned but Johnny saves him by killing the guy. After that, its just about how they survive the world by themselves. I loved reading The Outsiders. It was a great book.The main character in the book is Ponyboy. He's a youngboy living with his two older brothers. Ponyboy is the youngest of the gang. He has brown shaggy hair but in the book he has to dye his hair blonde to cover up his identity. Like most gangs, the people in them are usually tough and they think they're all big and bad. Unlike Ponyboy, hes a sweet young man that is harmless. In the book, Ponyboy smokes and so do all of his brothers and friends. The traits Ponyboy and I share are that he's harmless and I basically am too. He's also a sweet young man and the youngest of his friends and brothers. I am the youngest in my family and the youngest of all my friends. One way were different is that he smokes and I don't because I think it's wrong. Another reason I am different from is I live with my parents.My opinion of the book is that I loved it. The book relates to many people's lives in the world. It's not a fake story, it's real. People face gangs and poverty all the time. My favorite book in the part is when Johnny ( Ponyboys best friend) and Ponyboy rescue young children from a burning church. I would recommend this book to a friend.

After his parents died a few months ago, he and his brothers Soda and Darry were left to take care of themselves with not much money.

Things may be tough, but Ponyboy enjoys his life and he wouldn't have it any other way.However, one day things go way too far. Someone ends up dead. Ponyboy and Johnny--another member of the Greasers--are forced to run away from their loved ones. Now, they're forced to survive on even less money than they originally had. With things much harder than before, the boys must wonder, will they ever return home or will they have to start a whole new life?THE OUTSIDERS is an amazing novel, and should be read by all middle schoolers and high schoolers. It's a great way to teach about gangs and how much pressure they go through. I really liked the characters, and the author described them so well.

Hinton, was a very fascinating book about a boy in a group called the Greasers. His parents died in a car crash and he lives with his 2 brothers that take care of him. He gets into mischief with one of his pals, but something happens that isn't for the best. I'll let you read to find out! He is in a gang that is \\"low class\\", which fights with the \\"high class\\" gang called the Socs. One night it gets a little too rough.The setting of The Outsiders is not like the world I know at all because its based in the late/early 60's in a town with 2 different sides: the Socs and Greasers. S.E. Hinton really makes you feel like you're part of the story because she explains how it's rundown and not a happy place to be. She can make you picture it if you close your eyes. The author really makes you believe the characters are real people because they seem exactly like how these teens would be. I really liked all the characters because they all seem real, but other people might not like Dally and Steve. Dally thinks he's the best and the only thing he truly loves is Johnny. Steve just seems to be mean to anyone who is smaller than him especially Ponyboy.The themes of this book are always fight for what you want because Johnny fights to save Ponyboy's life. Also never give up on what you want because Ponyboy finally got what he wanted, for him to know his brother Darry loved him. The genre of this book is mystery and suspense. It might also be considered drama because of what happens.I loved this book because it was very descriptive and fun to read. I liked learning how life was back then. I think you should read this book because you'll really enjoy it. Every part of the story made sense, like everything happened and you knew why it happened. I really encourage you to read it to have a lot of fun even if you don't like to read like me.I would recommend this book to anyone who is up for a great book. If you don't like to read, I think you will like this book. I hate to read, but I couldn't put this book down. I'd recommend this book to anyone because it's just a good book and I think anyone would like it. I hope you use my review and maybe read this book because I know you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders by S.E.

There is constant violence between the two gangs and it gets to some of the boys. The fights between the two gangs usually consist of only fists. But one night someone takes it too far.The book takes place in the late 50s early 60s. It is in a rough part of town. If you've ever been to a rough part of town, you can relate to what it's like in the place The Outsiders takes place in.The Socs are the \\"enemy\\" in The Outsiders. S.E. Hinton makes you hate them.

It is a good story of friendship and brotherhood."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The boys in The Outsiders live on the rough side of town and have many struggles. Even though I don't have a rough life I can imagine it must be hard.S.E. Hinton does a good job by making you feel like you were there. It was easy to picture fights the Greasers and Socs get into, it made you feel like you were there. You could also picture what they all look like and when they talk it's like you can hear their voices.Since the Greasers live on the rough side of town and don't have much money they weren't as clean as the Socs were. The Socs were preppy and drove nice Mustangs, while the Greasers walked or drove rough beat up cars.In the book I liked Johnny and Ponyboy the best. They always stick up for each other and help one another with family and fights. Ever since Johnny got jumped by a Socs though he has been skittish. They both don't like fighting but if another Greaser was about to get killed or beat up they'd be there for them.I didn't like Darry so much though because he didn't handle situations with Ponyboy very well. His anger over powered him. Darry is a rough character, he went through a lot and he is the parent in their situation.Overall I thought this was a really good book. It showed that even though people do categorize others no matter what we all see the same sunset, and you would know what i mean by that if you read this book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The OutsidersBy: S.E HintonReview by: Nick ScarlettI thought The Outsiders was a great book overall, even though I'm not into the whole hoodlum scene. S.E Hinton really did a great job for her first book, which she wrote when she was 16! The setting was very realistic and well described, however I do not live in an urban city so that makes it harder for me to relate to the setting in this book.I found this book to be interesting, because it's tough to live without any parents. I think the 3 brothers did a fair job going from being protected by their parents to having to watch their back 24/7 and having only each other for support. I would suggest this book to anyone looking for an adventure through life and death, and happiness and sadness."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Her first novel, and it is impressive for a debut.

It's about finding family through friends, and having each others back. My favorite part of the book was when Ponyboy was with some other members of the Greasers at the drive-in movie theatre. They had met a couple of girls who later turned out to be the girlfriends of some Socs. Even though that would cause some trouble later, Ponyboy realized that the girls he met were really kind, sweet, and understanding people. That showed him that not all Socs (or rich people) were horrible people. I would recommend this book, i didn't think it was excellent, but it wasn't bad either. It had some really good morals and lessons, like loyalty and friendship. I thought the characters were realistic, and each had their own unique personality. I didn't care so much for the \\"battles\\" between the Socs and the Greasers, only because the book ever really explained why the two gangs were always fighting. I would consider this book to be more male oriented, simply because most of the characters were male.

The main character in this story is Ponyboy Curtis. He is a part of a gang named the Greasers, which is the low social group in this small town. The next gang is the Socs. It is made up of rich boys who are rarely suffer consequences of the things that they do.S.E. Hinton uses many writing techniques to show what kind of people the characters are. He uses lots of dialog and an extensive vocabulary to develop the characters. He uses descriptive words to create a feeling for the place and time. He even uses the names of the gangs to show what kind of people belong to them.Throughout this novel Ponyboy and his friends show amazing daring. Ponyboy and his two brothers, Darrel and Soda, show a remarkable amount of love for each other. Since their parents died in a car accident they have to stick together. Darrel serves as the father figure for Soda and Ponyboy. He keeps everything in line and never gives up on his brothers. Ponyboy and his best friend, Johnny, demonstrate the power of loyalty when they are jumped by the Socs; Johnny has to kill one of the Socs with a knife to keep them from drowning Ponyboy. They run away together so that Johnny will not be caught. They show their courage by going into a burning church to save some small children, an event that eventually costs Johnny his life. Once again, the protagonists demonstrate bravery and selflessness.I think this book is great. It is a moving novel in which courage and friendship are illustrated over and over.

Hinton's \\"The Outsiders\\" is an excellent book. The narrator, which is also the main character, gives a good view of all the problems in that time.The book is about the rivalry of two gangs. The Greasers and the Socs. The Greasers are considered ruffians but on the inside they are really actually good kids. The Socs (in latent terms) are over privileged snobs. They have everything they could every want. They look down on the Greasers because they are a lower class than them and also because they put grease in their hair (that's one way they got their name Greasers).This book has a lot of lessons in it but the main lesson Hinton is trying to teach is to just accept each other's differences and to just be a good kid. This book is excellent for kids 6th grade to 10th grade.The Outsiders has a good story line and good characters. They all have their own problems and they also have a way of working threw each others problems. The book moved at a fairly slow pace but if it moved any faster I think it might have lost some of its luster.

He is more sensitive and looks at the world differently, thats why he is my favorite person in the story.This book is very exciting, I defenently recommend it to the readers who enjoy danger and real life drama.

If I could grade this movie from 1 to 5, I would give it a 3. Maybe it's because I already knew everything that was going to happen. Also because it is kind of old and sincerely, some of the events were too fake. But the theme and lines of the movie are great and touching. I really like better the book, because it's more descriptive and touching. It is also longer and gives you an image that you can create however you want. The role of the characters was great. Soda was as described and so was everyone else, except Bob, I imagined him stronger and bigger, the same for Two-Bite. But Soda was handsome as described, Darry was strong, Johnny was small and so on. Also the fact that the dialogue was almost the same as the book, and mostly nothing was left out. The movie was similar to what I imagined it will be, though like always the image in your imagination is bigger than what can really be made."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"At first my language arts teacher handed us the book and all i thought was \\"Oh no, not another boring school book!!\\" But then we started reading it... When i read it, it was like the characters were real! I also liked it because there wasn't just good parts at the end and you had to read through all of the boring parts first, but every chapter had an exciting event.

If you like bloody senes, you will like this book and if you like fighting you would really like this book. The book is very interesting and exciting. It has a lot of lessons that are important in life. The Outsiders is a fiction book. The marin characters are Johnny, Ponyboy, Darry, Dallas, Two-Bit, Sodapop, Cherry, Bob, Randy, Steve and Marica.

This realistic firction novel has a really good theme. The storyline is packed with action and suspense.

Even though the two groups fight it is nothing really serious until all that changes, but by the end of the book things start to get better. there are many themes to this book but two that really stuck out were: stay gold and stay loyal to your friends. this book is interesting, memorable, entertaining, and a classic that has taught me many lessons about life."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"In my opinion i found this book to be pretty good even though it isnt normally the type of book i read.

This book does include important Qotes and idvise for your future. It does not matter if you have fancy stuff to be happy. This book first describes about eachothers life then people get into fights and alot of people get in to trouble. At the end is happy yet sad. This book is entertaining and instructive because there are alot of lessons to learn and a lot of advice to take. This book is entertaining because alot of important things have been happening all at once. I dont think this book left anything thats why this book is so interesting.

Hinton from 1967, is a quality piece of fiction for people who want to read about real life and not so much \\"happy ending\\" and everything working out perfectly in the end. Its theme is about respecting others who are different and about the importance of family and friends in our everyday life. To summarize the book, it begins with Pony walking home from a movie theater alone, but he finds that the Socs, a group of rich west-side kids, are following him and are about to beat him, a greaser, up until his brothers show up. But this is a normal thing to the poorer greasers. Later, after he went to the movies again and met two nice Socs, then driving them home, Pony falls asleep in the car and comes home late. His brother Darry, his guardian, yells at him for this and ends up smacking him. Then Pony runs off and meets up with his buddy Johnny to go down to the park to cool himself off by the fountian. He thought it would be a good spot to cool down...until the Socs showed up. Then, well, I'll let you read the rest. The book is entertaining and memorable because it taught me that friendship is one of the most important things in a human's life in a series of dramatic scenes that keep me engaged and teach me values. So, if you want a book that is real-life, keeps you engaged, and has many good morals, look no further. Read The Outsiders!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is a gerat book about greasers and socs. they get into fights and big rumbles. the socs are rich and preppy. the greasers are handsom and poor. the socs fight the greasers when there is only 1 or 2 of them. this is a gerat book filled with excitement. it is by far my favorite book and i can almost garuntee it will be yours.

Although written in the 1960's, it's just as prevalent now as it was then. In it, there are 2 groups of cliques, the Soc's (short for \\"sociable\\") pretentious and living off their parents' wealth, and the greasers, not so rich and shunned by society. Today, the Soc's would probably be called jocks and the greasers would be called freaks or heads. It's told through the greaser's point of view and Ponyboy Curtis is the narrator of the story. Since his parents passed away in a car accident, he and his older brother Sodapop are looked after by eldest brother Darrel. Darrel is a somewhat bossy perfectionist but he cares a lot about Ponyboy and sees a lot of potential in him (he also worries that if Ponyboy doesn't stay out of trouble, he could lose his brothers to a boy's home). Ponyboy's friends include vulnerable Johnny Cade who's ostracized by his parents and tough hood Dallas Winston who through the criminal record and rough image is an older brother figure to both Johnny and to a lesser extent Ponyboy. Without giving away too much, Ponyboy, Dallas and Johnny have a chance to see life on the other side when they briefly become heroes (much to the embarrassment of Dallas) after dealing with running away from home and an act of self-defense which could count against Johnny."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book was inspiring.

It turned out not to be the book itself, which was very well written, but I was just not ready for it when I first read it. I'd say make sure your son or daughter (yes, this book is for either gender) is at least in the 7th grade (6th if they are mature) before letting them read this book.

It also teaches a valuable lesson while keeping the reader entertained for chapters.In The Outsiders a group of rough around the edges kids just try to have a good time, but are in constant rivalry with the preppy socs. There are a number of fights and quarrels that go on between the groups throughout the book.

The soc's are the gang that lives on the opposite side of town and they are what you can call rich and spoiled. T he main characters are Darry. Darry is the oldest of the three brothers. He is also the oldest in the group. Darry is the strongest and he has the best built out of the group. His brothers are named Soda Pop and Ponyboy. Then there comes Soda Pop.

Hinton. SHe wrote this book about teenagers in her neighborhood. This book is nothing that any of todays children can realte to. The Greasers are a gang they are composed of Two-Bit ,Dally,Johnny,Darry,Soda Pop,and Pony boy. Their rival gang is the socs.This book is not what teenagers can not even relate to. The main character Ponyboy, yes that is his real name, has family problems. Both of his parents are dead and he is raised by his brothers Soda Pop , another real name, and Darry. Darry and Soda Pop both dropped out of school to give Pony Boy a chance at a better life. Johnny is an abused child who no one loves. His \\"real\\" family is the Greasers . Dally and Two-Bit are tough, not because the book portrays that but because all lthe author ever saids is Don't mess with Dally because he grew up on the streets of New York City. He does not do anything tough the whole book. Except when he is over run by grief and wants to die . He robs a conveinent store and when the police find him he turns a broken gun on the police. They of course shoot him.The Socs are the rival gang. They dont like the Greaers because they put Grease in their hair. So because of the way they do their hair the Socs attack and some times kill the Greasers. I having a teenage daughter know that this book is nothing like any teens life. A child is ridiculed in school because of the way they dress but you could never die because of it. So one night Darry hits Pony Boy and Johnny run away to a church. Dally helps them run away , yea thats real tough, and tells them how to lay low. When they leave the church with Dally to go to the Dairy Queen the church catches fire and children are trapped inside. Johnny and Pony Boy risk their lives to save them. Johnny breaks his back while trying to save these children. Johnny refuses to see his mother and only wants to see the gane because his mother hated him. If I was dying in a hospital and I hated my mom I would want to tell her I loved her before I couldn't tell her any more.Pony Boy starts to fail English and he writes this book so he can pass. The End....I don't really see where this book went. The author wrote it when she was a teenager, but it still does not change the fact that this was npt really a book . It was more like the prolouge.Many teachers force their Sudents to read this book and they often enjoy it because of the violence . I don't think this book should have been published. It was not well written because the Greasers don't think about life like teenagers will. Instead they have page long analysis's about why they are he way they are. Like Dally ,who the author claims is so bad because he has been to juvie,is said to be bad because he grew up in New York City and had a hard childhood. A child would see this as he wanted attention because if his behavior was because of his upbringing then why is he nice to his friends if he was a horrible person. The author portrays that the Streets of NEw York are so bad to live on, but I don'tsee how where the Greaers were living was so much better."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The main character is Ponyboy.

Since Johnny was wanted for murder the only thing Pony and Johnny could do was run away, that's what they did while they waited for Dally (a greaser) to come rescue them. Pony and Johnny stayed in a church while they waited. They had to disguise themselves so Johnny and pony cut off their hair and Pony bleached his. Finally when dally came he took Johnny and Pony out to eat. When they were all done and they got back to the church, the church was in flames with a couple of children in there.

Now it is 25 years later and I re read it and I still don't like it. The main protaogonsit in the book is a guy called Ponyboy(!!!) Curtis who belongs to a gang known as \\"greasers\\" i.e.dopey working class tough teenagers who wear leather jackets and smoke too much. What is even worse is that his brother's name is Sodapop Curtis!!! One has to wonder if their parents had a malicious streak in giving them such odd names.Ponyboy is a sensitive, caring teenager who loves sunsets and likes to read. One gets the impression that Ponyboy would last about 5 minutes on the Mean Homeless Streets of New York City.Ponyboy's best friend Johnny kills a member of the Upper Middle Class ( known as 'Socs\\") and they are on the run from the Law.It is kind of sad that none of the losers depicted in this book ever realize that they are fighting a System that was designed not to be beaten.There is another character worth mentioning in the book, namely a girl called Cherry Valance who is is a member of the Socs and yet is strangley attracted to one of the young tough guys in the greaser gang. No doubt Cherry will grow up to be a \\"Professional Victim\\" and marry an mean alcoholic who beats her up every night.If you like reading about Rampant Teenage Hormonal Desires and Violence then this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Let me just say this a bluntly as possible: The book stunk.

There three best friends trying to just get by and on the way they got into mischief.The setting of this takes place mostly outdoors. It is mostly outdoors because they don't have any place to live except their car. They always get into fights with other people who live on the streets to.

So hard to believe, yet it has staying power because of some timeless themes and teenage angst.It was a fantasy world, no question. Three orphaned brothers living together with a bunch of friends who seem to have absent or apathetic parents all clustered together to live their \\"tough guy\\" male bonding. They seem to have no cares but to have a good time and posture at the local hangouts. They discover that although they do not have all the material things or appear like the socs, they are all similar underneith. And, like a lot of people in their youth, they aspire to leave their own city and go someplace else where they can start afresh and there will be no problems or having to answer to any social pretense. Alas, they do this and it's a continuation of their jaded pasts only more lonely. I think Ponyboy and Johnny experienced that when having to hide out in the abandoned church in the country.It would be foolish, if not downright nieve, to assume that part of the appeal of this book was not fostered by the accompanying movie version. Patrick Swayze, C Thomas Howell, Ralph Macchio, Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Tom Cruise, Matt Dillon and all ushered in every pubescent girl's bedroom decor. Be still our hormones.

Much, much worse.Maybe you have to be a bigshot English professor to appreciate this book. Maybe you have to be a pompous \\"Top 1000\\" reviewer. Maybe you have to come from the setting and lifestyle it describes. I'd have been inclined to kill somebody who started calling everybody around me \\"Sodapop and Pony Boy\\". Names like that, in the schools I went to, were insults. Not cute nicknames or badges of honor. I never, ever lived in a neighborhood where the poor kids and the rich kids routinely beat the **** out of each other in \\"rumbles\\". Why was anyone even mildly surprised when somebody got killed in the middle of all this? I mean, seriously now.I think my biggest problem with this book is that what it ultimately seems to be trying to tell me is a message that I already learned a long time ago, and was rather annoyed to have to sit around for hours in English class being told it again. The whole book, I believe, is best summed up by the film version, in which a girl who runs with the Socs- whatsername- tells Pony Boy, \\"Things are rough all over\\" in that wonderfully generic Southern accent of hers. Things are rough all over? Really? I never could've figured that out had I not read \\"The Outsiders\\". S.E. Hinton is above average in my mind, and certainly has skill as a writer. But in some cases, the ability of a writer can be discerned from looking at their whole career rather than one book. Besides this one, can you think of a single other book S.E. Hinton has written? It's been over twenty years, and though I do know she's written some six or more books in total, I can't name any of the others.But I concede that, unlike \\"The Pearl\\" and \\"Brave New World\\" it may have some merit. Even if I can't see it. But among \\"coming of age\\" novels, there is better than this. And if the stuffy old English professors- or whoever it is- that keep making public school children read this kind of stuff would get their heads out of the clouds, stop yammering about \\"coming of age\\" and \\"socioeconomic issues\\" and so on and actually think about finding a way to turn students toward literature instead of away from it, America could make a lot of progress. And books like this would collect dust on the shelves where they belong. Or, they would spend less time in the hands of numerous resentful students and more in the hands of fewer interested students. I love literature too much to want someone to have a bad time reading a book. So if anybody, especially a high school student, happens to read this book and like it I'm glad for it. S.E. Hinton is not as good a writer as Shakespeare, Stephen King, Harry Turtledove, or my favorite writer of all time, Pat Conroy. Those writers have written far more famous works than just one, and surpass Hinton's skill in writing quite solidly. But even if no other book she has written ever become famous, this one has and despite my believing it to be mediocre is worth a look.One final note- remember this even if you forget everything else I wrote above- say a review was helpful, or that it was not, based on the quality of the review. Not whether you agreed with their assessment or not."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"It excites me that so many students have found this book so enticing and satisfying as a reading experience, but my excitement has everything to do with the act of reading, and not this specific book. I'm glad a book turned them on this much, but I hope they move on to better books, less insulting ones, and I hope other teachers feel this way, too. Look at some of the low reviews--by both kids and adults, and you'll see that there's a great deal of divided opinion, and not just because the book was the dreaded \\"assigned reading\\".The Outsiders is an absurdly weak novel. It is almost artless in its prose, and yet Hinton doesn't supply us with persuasive grittiness in its place. The tough scenes are tough because the book wants them be so, and because the facts of death and guilt have impact on us--but not because Hinton successfully locates the real, grinding forcve of these happenings. So we have a book that just lacks expressive force, making it at most a series of sometimes engaging incidents. The characters and dialogue are problems, too. Hinton's teeage kids alternately fail to see some of the most manifest, obvious meanings behind some circumstance and then fill a whole page with insight after insight about each other and the discriminatory society they inhabit. Near the end, in the course of a couple pages, we get a whirlwind of family revelations as Ponyboy understands something about Darry because of a little shouting match and then Darry and Ponyboy realize something about Sodapop's family anxieties. The rush of these sudden epiphanies makes them hasty and unconvincing, and the fact that Hinton was a teenager when she wrote it is a problem, not a justification.It isn't even clear that the book has compassion for its own characters. In the flashback that tells of Johnny's bad mauling by Soc kids, the other greasers show up (they always seem to know where to find each other immediately after something awful has happened) and they just sit around listening. So Johnny's supposedly gut-wrenching pain becomes merely a cause for character conversation, and that flashback just leaves him there bleeding, in the company of friends. He is the novels' maudlin spectacle. Frankly, Dally is dangerous because the book keeps saying so, not because the book really demonstrates or illustraes a dangerous quality in him. Many of the characters are just indistinguishable guys with unrevealing dialogue or action; they lack definable individuality.The theme of being judged by appearances has been done better in almost every work of fiction I have ever encountered. Heck, I read my own children a funny, spirited picture book called \\"I Stink,\\" about a garbage truck, and that offers the topic more useful examination than this does. The unremitting suffering and misuderstanding and misdirection these charcaters undergo in Hinton's novel is more punishing and melodramatiuc than revealing. The book is simply substandard reading that satisfies the way a bad summer movie does, and it cares about that much for its characters and is about as insulting to its readers."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Shipping took longer than I expected but the book condition was as I expected for a new book"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"hi,um yeathis book is not very good, b/c it is boring b/c i dont like it and b/c i dont like to read. and also it is just boring and not a good book. so you people that like this book keep reading it but please shut up bout it. haha. thanks for reading this.goodbye*~Melissa~*oh yeadont forget,i have selective hearing.

Socs are the richer kids who live on the west side and greasers are the less wealthy who wear a lot of grease in there hair and live on the east side. The socs and greasers never get along no matter what usually. They always fight with fists or some other things. Ponyboy is a greaser who relies on his brothers and friends. Both social classes go back and forth with their fighting. Pony and his older brother Darry get in a fight when after Darry hit pony boy he ran he ran as fast and as far as he could until he saw Johny. Both went together to the fountain in the town unil a group of socs comes. They stop and come over and start to drown Ponyboy. Almost as he is about to die Johny kills a soc. They have to get away far away so they won't get caught. They go to a far away town where they hide in a church with as many supplies as they can get. The church catches on fire and Johny and Ponyboy become heroes from their bravery to save a few kids. But wait, Johny got hit by a big flank of wood is he parylized or will he die? They are both injured so they go to the hospital to get checked on. The socs and greasers have a rumble for their dead gang members. Is it Johny for the greasers or is it someone else? Both gangs end up realizing it's not worth fighting it doesn't do anything no matter who wins the fight it has no influence on anyone. In my opinion this is a great book that everyone should read."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Writing about the perceived class differences she saw at her own high school, S.E. Hinton became a hit literary sensation and one of the groundbreaking authors of young adult fiction with the publication of THE OUTSIDERS. One of the characteristics of young adult fiction is that adults are rarely present and in THE OUTSIDERS outside of police officers, firefighters, and doctors and nurses, adults don't seem to exist. The protagonist of the novel is a young teenage boy named Ponyboy (yes that is his real name). His parents died a few years before and his oldest brother, Darry, didn't want to split the family apart and has been raising Ponyboy and his other brother Sodapop on his own. The three brothers grew up on the wrong side of the tracks and have had to mostly fend for themselves. They call themselves Greasers and have a close-knit group of friends who stick up for each other. After all when you're not from the right side of the tracks, rich kids, called Socs, like to abuse Greasers just for kicks. Ponyboy is the youngest member of his group. He's a handsome kid who's also highly intelligent. One night he meets a pretty redhead Soc and that cause Ponyboy's life to be turned upside down.THE OUTSIDERS was first published in 1967, yet not only remains popular, but continues to be relevant as well. The types of gangs that exist in major cities today simply didn't exist forty years ago. Yet the confusion and struggles that Ponyboy experiences are things that just about every teenager in America can relate to in some way. I've worked with a variety of high school students who are reluctant readers. I was surprised at how many site THE OUTSIDERS as their favorite book or the only book they've been forced to read that they actually enjoy. It was this interest in the book by students that led me to finally reading it. The book deals with many important issues that teenagers relate with, from cliques and gangs to difficulties of home life without one's parents. There is a great deal of sadness conveyed in the book, but it is honest and genuine. Despite this, the book ends with a message of hope. You can come from a rough neighborhood and have a tough home life, but those are things that can be overcome. Highly recommended for older children and young adults, especially for those who are reluctant readers."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This is my friend pony boy or as his friends call him pony.

Every year I debate where to place The Outsiders in my curriculum. If I start with the novel in September, the students fall in love with reading. They finish the book within the first few nights of assigning it. We have stimulating debates about cliques and stereoptypes. Even though the novel was written in the '60s students have their own versions of socs and greasers. They have preps versus goths. They love my stories about my high school experiences as well. We even had separate parking lots at my school: jock lot, boff lot, and band lot. S.E. Hinton created a story that is timeless. Students see this and appreciate it. When I start in September with The Outsiders, the material we cover the rest of the year pales in comparison to her stimulating story. If I end with The Outsiders, then I have to wait an entire school year to see my students come alive with this novel.S.E. Hinton is a great story teller. Is she a good writer? Will I be committing a sacrilege if I say, \\"No?\\" While I commend her for writing from the point of view of a fourteen year old boy, Ponyboy is not a realistic boy. My male students pick up on it more than my female students. The girls love the romance of The Outsiders. They love the 'hot' characters. The boys see through it a bit. Not to say they don't like the novel, but I see many raised eyebrows as we read some of her descriptions and dialogue.BUT, all in all, they do love the novel. Like I said, Hinton tells a great story. She just is not the best writer."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders was written by S.E. Hinton. The Outsiders was a very enjoyable book for me. I would recommend this book for any young adult like myself because it is written in the point of view of a young boy named Ponyboy. When S.E. Hinton wrote The Outsiders she was a young adult herself and so it is easy for young adults to understand what she is trying to convey in The Outsiders. There are in my opinion two important messages that S.E. Hinton is trying to say in her book. First, is how important love is to people and the impact that it has on brotherly love. Secondly, is about hate and the conflicts that people have towards one another because they are not willing to accept others because of who they are and where they come from. In telling this story S.E. Hinton tries to persuade the reader that just because someone is not like you that you should discriminate against them. The story does a good job in describing the differences among the two rival gangs. The \\"Greasers\\", which is the gang from the poor side of town and whose lives are full of bad experiences and a tough way of life. Then there is the gang who call themselves the \\"Socs\\". These kids are from the rich side of town and who have grown up having a fairly easy life. Over all The Outsiders is filled with many different emotionals. It has action, suspense, love, violence, and even some humor. This book I would surely not mind reading it again."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"As dramatic as this sounds, this book changed my life.I first read the book when I was in sixth grade. My cousin had checked it out of the library and read it. She brought it to my house and said you have got to read this book, it's the best book I have ever read. I thought she was nuts, it was a library book I knew there was no way I would finish it by the time she had to hand it in. But she insisted so I took it. The next day my parents had to drive to Tulsa (yes, the setting of the book, I'm from Oklahoma) which is about an hour from where we lived. I decided to read the book on the way. By the time we got to Tulsa I was hooked, every place we went I stayed in the car and kept reading while my parents shopped, by that evening I was finished. The next day I read it again.At a time when I was beginning to discover who I was and who I wanted to be the Outsiders spoke volumes to me. The ideas of real friendship, loyalty, and honor totally made me re-evaluate my life and ultimately to some degree helped to shape the way I live my life. Now as I sit here typing this, I am thirty-three years old I have a wife and a young daughter. I don't even know how many times I have read the book and how many copies I have owned over the years. I hope that someday around sixth grade, my little girl can read this book and enjoy it like I did.BUY THIS BOOK!!!!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"People may think of The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton as a story full of overwhelming violence and hatred. In reality, this adventure filled story is about a group of boys trying to find their inner selves. Throughout the story there is a never-ending battle between the Greasers, a gang of economically poor teenagers, and the Socs, (short for socials) another gang that is a rich, well to do group of teenagers. The Outsiders is a story full of love, horror, suspense, and reality that creates a story line that is a great read for all ages.In a small, beat-up town in Oklahoma, teens like Ponyboy suffer from societal pressures such as violence, drugs, and even more. Pony, a member of a small gang who call themselves the Greasers, struggles in life because of family situations as well as peer relationships. For example, Pony believed that his brother Darry, a serious and hard working man, hated him. Also, almost every member of the Greaser gang feels that they are not socially accepted by all of their peers. A few of the members do not care, but Pony and Johnny are affected by this and especially want to be equal with everybody. They were motivated to be in a gang and fight because they wanted to appear tougher than the other gangs, which in their eyes would make them be better as a person.One night, things are taken too far between the Socs and Greasers. Something serious happens and Pony and Johnny's whole life changes in an instant. They are filled with regrets and wish they could have that night back so they could make better choices. They are forced to run away to an old abandoned church in a small town in the country side called Windrixville. During this difficult time, Pony recites a poem called \\"Nothing Gold Can Stay.\\" By remembering this poem, Pony wants to teach his friends to stay gold by staying true to themselves like the poem says. This poem sets the stage for the rest of the book. In the middle of each turn of events, Pony and his friends take one step at a time and start to realize that violence will not take them anywhere in life. They also begin to realize this from their young 16 year old friend, Johnny. He is the first one to realize this and he tells them not to fight anymore because it does not help their circumstances in life.The Outsiders is a great book that is likely to catch any reader's attention. It is an awesome story throughout the entire book. In the end, Pony officially finds himself as a person and is able to keep his own personality with the help of his friends. As a result, this book comes close to reality and at the same time it teaches a lesson that everyone should know about life."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The book that I am reviewing is called The Outsiders, by S. E. Hinton. On the first page of the book, you, the reader, are introduced to Ponyboy Curtis, a fourteen year old boy with two things on his mind: Paul Newman and a ride home. Pony and his two older brothers, Darry and Soda (Pop) have been taking care of each other every since their parents died. They are all a part of a gang called the Greaser's. The Greaser life is filled with stealing, smoking, drinking, and fighting; however, Pony is not your average greaser. He enjoys movies, reading, writing, and yes, even school! Fellow Greaser's include Two-Bit, Dally and Johnny. Not only do Greaser's deal with the everyday struggles of being poor, but they also experience hatred and discrimination from the rich, upper class kids, better known as the Soc's. The main goal of a Soc is to make a Greaser's life miserable, or so Pony thinks. Like I said before, fights are common in Pony's neck of the woods, but he never imagined that something he was so accustomed to would change his life forever.This is by far one of the best books I have read in a long time. Its unique story line can appeal to virtually anyone. I rate this book a 5 (being the highest) because of the following things: its characters, description and message.You always know a book is truly good when you can get inside the main characters' head. When you read this book, you can literally feel Ponyboy's troubles, good times, and frustrations. For example, many times throughout the book you are shown how different Pony really is from the rest of his crowd. He's emotional, complex, and doesn't really have anyone he can connect with, except for Johnny. Johnny is like the poor, little puppy that's been kicked around too much. His parents beat him, and he was in a near death \\"rumble\\" against the Soc's. Pony and Johnny can both appreciate the less \\"macho\\" and \\"tough\\" things in life, such as sunsets.The Outsiders also has a ton of description. When an author writes a book about the streets, he or she can either tells the whole story, or part of it. S. E. Hinton definitely tells the whole story. We learn how difficult life is for Greaser's. How Darry has to work two jobs to feed his brothers, and how Soda had to drop out to help Darry, and also how sometimes stealing is the only way out sometimes. The constant threat of being \\"jumped\\", and the struggle simply to fit in with your friends.Finally, the reason I fell in love with this book is because of its message. Who would believe that two hoodlums could be heroes, or that two groups who seem so different on the outside really are the same on the inside. This book teaches you about discrimination, society, perseverance, and loyalty, all in 188 pages. Moreover, the biggest lesson this book teaches you is to \\"stay golden\\" and to realize that it doesn't matter if you live on the east or west, we all see the same sunset. The Outsiders take you inside their lives, and make you one of their own in this remarkable novel. It gives you a credible view into the lives of those less fortunate, and their constant struggle to come out on top in a world that always wants to push you down."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I had to read this book in my eighth grade English class and I really didn't enjoy it at first.

Hilton was able to write this book at the age of 16. By the end of the book, I had to fight back tears. The casual language and potent imagery portrayed by Hilton made me feel like I was there with the Greasers. I felt a special tenderness for the family relationship that existed between Pony, Soda, and Darry.

It's a cool 'guy' story, but at the same time is rivited with human emotion across the spectrum, manifesting itself in the usual places, life's circumstances and human relationships, usually betraying an inner suffering. It's a bummer that orphaned adolescents raise themselves on chocolate cake, cigarettes, beer, and pepsi, but by the end of the story, the main characters have shown promising growth through life's circumstances that the reader is left with a certain optomistic outlook that there could be something in the future for them.

You won't regret it, promise!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"In 7th Grade, I was required to read \\"The Outsiders\\" and absolutely detested reading. After reading about the first 20 pages, though, I ended up finishing the book in one night! It was a well-written story about the trials of growing up. It has several characters that paralleled people in my own life. I believe that it will have similar effects on early teenagers and can draw a powerful involvement within them."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I think I've seen this movie so many times that I can't count, and it doesn't hold a candle to the book. I loved reading this book, everything that the movie left out. You read this through the eyes of Ponyboy Curtis, and you learn what it is like to live life on the other side of the tracks, as greasers. You also feel a contempt for the socs, but also somewhat of a self pity for them as well. You read this and you understand his life, along with his brothers, Darrell and Soda-pop. This book also gave a more accurate description of Dallas Winston, and Two-bit than what the movie portrayed. You cherish the way Johnny is viewed in this book by the others in the gang.It is probably easy for people to believe, but my favorite chapter where the rumble occurs. It gives a lot more detail, and you can feel every punch, every kick and every throw delivered in this work of art.The movie was well made, will never exceed the quality of this awesome work. I could read this over and over and never get sick of it! It doesn't get much better when it comes to fiction like this."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Teenage boys get picked on by the school jocks. Because they don't have rich parents. They have 2 different groups and they hate eachother. And they're the east and west side groups. And if their seen on their territory they get beat up by the jocks. Almost or in the middle of the they have a rumble on whose the best on each side. I like it when they save the kids from the burning church and the the part I didn't like was where his friend burns his back and dies from it. Because of why he was saving the kids from the burning church. This book is really good and I do recommend other people to read this book, because it's about courage, and other emotional problems. In this book they can get courage from it and not to even be scared of the bullies. (...)I like Ponyboy, because he as not like those other guys in the group. He had more manners than the other guys and he was nice to this girl. I don't think I hate any character in the book. He made the readers feel what the characters felt when they were scared or having problems. The reason why i love this book, is because the teenage boys have many problem like us. And they don't know how to deal with it. He made me feel like i was their watching what they went through. He had a good writing for the book. The way he wrote it i could see what was happening in the book. i liked the writing because it made sense to me when i read the book. He may have interviewed someone with this kind of problems or wrote about his childhood life."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is my favorite book. It is an excellent book it's about three boys that live all by them selfs because their parents were killed. They are in a real close knit gang. A greaser, needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers. They get in lots of scuffels and arguments. Then one night when his friend kills a soc. The murder gets to him, teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser. I would say more but I don't wanna give the rest away.

I watched the movie before reading it, and I was ready to cry. I'm usually strong, so I don't cry because of movies and books. But I nearly had to make an exception. It was very moving, so I couldn't wait to read the book. I fell in love with the story right from the start. It reinforces my belief that you shouldn't label or treat people unfairly.It's about two greasers named Ponyboy and Johnny. Socs were in war with the greasers 4ever. But Johnny went too far. He killed a Soc trying to defend Pony's life. Then they were on the run for a week. Then a church set on fire, and little kids were in danger. Against their friend Dally's anxious warnings, Johnny and Ponyboy went inside to save the kids. Ponyboy and the kids get out OK, but Johnny got burned badly and had a broken back from a piece of timber falling on him. What happens to Johnny, Dally, and Ponyboy...

Imagine living not in a nice, clean house, but a small, old and rundown place. Ponyboy is an execellent example of a teen who has more to live for than fighting alongside his friends and brothers in a feud between rival gangs: Greasers and the Socials. The Greasers represent the less fortunate group of teens, who have no money, no adequate education, and most of all, a loving family. Ponyboy, as one of the youngest members of the Greasers, thinks about the reality he dwells in. He realizes that with his parents gone, it is up to his older brothers, Sodapop and Darry, to raise him well and love him. Sodapop, being the friendliest of them all, nurtures Ponyboy with love and dedication. Darry, on the other hand, is the oldest and most strictest of them all. Often correcting Ponyboy for his mistakes, Darry and Ponyboy sometimes have difficulty getting along. However, Pony realizes that Darrys' reason for his tough exterior is because he assumes the role as the man of the house. It is his responsibility to raise Ponyboy and Sodapop so that they may grow up to be successful. Ponyboy at first seems like a weak, stoic, and shy type of teen, but as this episode of the story progresses further, he becomes metally strong and sticks to what is right. In the midst of maturing into a young adult, he encounters enemies and friends. His best friend, Johnny, is younger, but is more like an older brother to Ponyboy. It is they who stick together until the end, evermore expressing how powerful their friendship is. Reading The Outsiders is a must for all kids of any age. It is books like this that will help young children and teens grow up heading towards a successful adulthood, because the latter stage in life is deeply affected by the former stage. Reading this, a person may come to realize that growing up is difficult and requires strength, sacrifice, honesty, and courage. This will help children prepare for whatever their life may unfold."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I think that The Outsiders is a very good book for older kids. This is one of the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I love this book it has the excitment of an action filled with well..... excitment it has been the best book i have ever read"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This review is going to be comparing Book to MovieThe Outsiders, the book and the movie are about gangs and clich&eacute;s. In The Outsiders your either a Soc or a Greaser. A Soc is a rich kid, Socs have fancy cars and nice homes. While Greasers have live in poor environments, beat up cars and don't make much money. The story about The Outsiders is mainly about Ponyboy and the previous events before a great big rumble that takes place between the Socs and the Greasers. The book and the movie both have the same plot, but some of the events are left out or have been changed.Some points in the movie were shot very accurate to the book. Like the Robert Sheldon murder (or you could call it when they whacked off poor Bob) That part was almost exactly like I imagined it in the book. The actor that played Dally performed him very well. Dally was the same cocky, tough, young, handsome and reckless greaser that was described in the book. When Dally was running across the lot away from the police, I thought that Coppola did that part beautifully. Again it was as though I was reading the book. Same exact pictures, it was so close to what I imagined it was scary.There are some things in the movie that I thought were different in the book. Like they left out Ponyboy being jumped in the beginning, the court hearing, Ponyboy and Johnny jumping off the train, they changed the part where Randy and Ponyboy talk and they also left out the teacher giving Ponyboy the school report. There was one more thing that really bothered me, all of the Greasers and Soc's looked like they were in their mid/ late twenties. I mean the book described everyone as high school aged kids and early twenties.I thought that movie and the book were both well done, and of course the book is better than the movie. The movie could be edited so that it is more like the book, only by adding in parts. I would also change some of the actors so they don't look like old people I mean god. It would be better if they were young kids, and looked like young reckless kids. Other than that the movie was a good version of the story."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The book I read was the \\"Outsiders,\\" by S.E. Hinton. This story takes place in a small city where there are gangs. One gang is labeled \\"Socs,\\" and they are basically the punks of the city who live with their parents. They are more on the wealthy side. The other gang, the Greasers, are more of the poor, less fortunate, and tough kids who grease their hair back. The narrator \\"Ponyboy,\\" lives with two other guys named Darry and Sodapop. Ponyboy's parents died in an automobile accident and now he is allowed to live with the two people he calls his brothers. He can only live with them if he stays out of trouble and keeps his grades up in school. The Socs go around and beat the lives out of the Greasers until they are unconscious or their faces are rearranged. One day all of that turns around thanks to Ponyboy and his best Johnny. They are on the run when Johnny did something not even he thought he would do. When they hop a train and reach their destination they realize what happened and it wasn't their fault and they turn around to go to the police after two days. On the way back they save kids from a burning building and their doing of a good deed pays off. I really enjoyed this book a lot. It taught me really good lessons in life. It also goes to show that if you get into trouble how to take the best path away from it. The last thing it shows to me is that your best friends can end up saving your life one day; and always hang on to what you have. I highly recommend this book preferably to male teens for better understanding. The reason why is because it has to do with fighting and more to do with male issues that females might not enjoy. This is an awesome book so read it."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I recommend that people read the Outsiders .It is one of my personal favorites .It is heart warming and full of action, drama , and feelings.

I feel like i know each character personally and i love them so much. Im not exactly a greaser myself, but whatever, im close to it. This book was sooo exciting that i really wished it was real. im surprised we're reading it in school.

In this book two boys named Ponyboy and Johnny who get into some trouble some bad trouble like killing someone not just anyone but a soc-Bob. Soon a riot begins between the greasers-a rough, tough gang with long greasy haired boys from the wrong side of the tracks, and the soc's- the rich kids with all the breaks. I think this book will make a difference to anyone that reads it.

His parents have died and he lives with his brothers Sody and Darry. These three and their many friends (Dally, Johnny, Two-Bit, and Steve) make up the Greasers, who are a gang in a constant 'war' with the Socs.

Hinton, many of lifes problems are symbolized through the actions of two groups of teenagers; one the Greasers and the other, the Sacs. The story is told by Pony Boy Curtis who belongs to the Greasers , who are placed further down on the pyramid of society. Pony boy reveals to the reader how tough life can get for everyone, and how it truly isn't fair. I am positive that all who read this book will definetly biuld a relationship with its realistic adventures. We have all shared a time when stealing and cheating felt like the only way out and in this book your are brought into the life of those who live this way day to day.It demonstrates the importance of character no matter who you are or where you live. Mainly this book shows the collision of both these groups and how among the many things they argue about there both really going through the same thing. Both sides demonstrate brotherhood and the ability to survive under harsh conditions. This book will attract all ages because not only does it symbolize the hardships we go through in our lives and how we all need to give up so much to get so little back. However, we learn how to be strong and most importantly how to win. For example Pony Boy Curtis tells the reader to \\"stay gold.\\" these two words show that no matter were we stand or what we beleive , we still share the same sunrise and sunset."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I enjoyed reading 'The Outsiders'.

The three have good and hard times even though both their parents have died. These three are also part of a gang called the 'Greasers' who are in an ongoing battle with the 'Socs'. Other members of the 'Greasers' are Dally, Two-Bit, and Johnny. This book contains realistic views of the life of teens and how they go through conflicts in school and at home.

The Curtis brothers' parents have just died and Darry the oldest is a carpenter. Sodapop the middle brother is a dropout and Ponyboy the youngest is still in high school. Also the problem is that one night someone takes things too far.Ponyboy is quiet like Johnny. Ponyboy likes books and movies. Darry says Ponyboy doesn't ever think.

This book was great it was about three brothers growing up poor and orphans. The main Characters in this story are Pony boy the youngest brother, Jonny a friend of pony boys, Darry oldest brother, Soda middle brother, and Dally gang leader. All of these guys are in this gang called the greasers, and they were poor kids. They always had a problem with this other gang called the Socs who were the rich boy. One time Pony boy and Jonny fought to of the Socs and Jonny ended up stabbing and killing one of the Socs. So then the boys leave town and run to some abandon church where they stay until it is burnt down. Jonny ends up dieing in the fire. Jonny's death teaches Pony boy that he needs to get his life in shape and be good. My favorite character was Pony boy because he is the one who changes the most in this book.I can relate to Pony boy because we both had major problems in school, but at the end we had someone to point us in the right direction. I kno exactly how Pony boy felt when he lost his brother because I have lost a couple people who are very close to me.I liked this book very much. It had great action and adventure. One of my favorite parts about this book was when the two gangs met at the end for a huge fight and the greasers won. If I could change anything about this book I would have made Pony boy not so much of a wimp because I mean he did grow up with his two rebel brothers.

Hinton, is about a 14-years-old boy named Ponyboy. Ponyboy lived in the east side of a large, unnamed town only with his brothers because his parents died from the car accident. His brothers, Darry and Sodapop, were members of the greasers same as Ponyboy. Dallas, Johnny, Two-Bit Mathews, and Steve were the other members of the gang. They had rivals, Socs, who were richer, and educated than the greasers. Johnny, who was Ponyboy's buddy, killed one of the Socs by self-defense because they tried to torture Ponyboy and him. Johnny and Ponyboy ran away to hide from cops, and saved little kids from the fire. They became heroes, but Johnny died because he got hurt really bad.I read the book for hours and hours when I started to read for first time. I could not stop reading! This book is not like the other books about fairy-tale or good life characters. The Outsiders shows readers about the different life than the readers may have, and some actions of doing bad things and good things. I recommend this book to the readers who like actions and adventures. The book that became my number one favorite book, The Outsiders, is not very difficult to read, so everyone can read without the pressure of not knowing what is happening in the book. The best parts of this book are when Ponyboy and Johnny spent few days in the hiding place, and when they saved the kids. I like the saving part because it shows the readers that they are not bad boys even though they do some bad things, and smoke. I choose The Outsiders for the assignment because one of my friends suggested this book for really good book and I heard from many other people saying that this book is fantastic.

It has so much anticipation. For instance, when Ponyboy is walking home from the movies, he notices a car following him. Socs get out of the car and jump him.The Outsiders is about a boy named PonyBoy Curtis that grew up on the wrong side of town. He is part of a gang, the greasers. One of the members is Johnny Cade, Ponyboy's best friend. One night, Ponyboy and Johhny were walking in the city park in the morning when some socs, their rival gang, tryed to jump them and tryed to drown Ponyboy. Johnny gots up and stabbed Bob, a soc, and he died. So they then decided that they needed a hide out. They heard about this place from Dallas Winston, another member of the greasers. There is a hideout in an abandoned church where Ponyboy and Johnny hid there for 5 days. Dallas cames to visit and took them to some place for a little food. While they were eating, Johnny explained to Dallas that he wanted to go back home and turn themselves in. On their way back, they realized that some kids were playing around in the church and it accidentally set ablaze. Ponyboy and Johnny ran into save the kids. When all the kids were out, they tried to escape but when Ponyboy got out, John tried to follow suitt but the ceiling started to collapse. It fell on Johnny. Was the collapse fatal? Will Ponyboy and Johnny get arrested for killing bob? Read this book and you will soon find out.I would recommend this book to teenagers and young adults that enjoy adventure and heartbreak."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"In The Outsiders, there are two gangs.

If you don't like to read much, then make this one of the few that you *do* read. I guarantee that you won't be able to put it down. Don't get the movie out first - read the book. The movie doesn't explain about the relationships between the brothers the way that the book does - and since this is the basis of the book, then it kind of misses the point. Don't get me wrong - it's still a good movie, but then since it's based on this, then it could hardly fail - especially with the cast that it has!! Patrick Swayze, Tom Cruise (pre caps), C Thomas Howell, Ralph Macchio... The list goes on...Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"When I first began this novel I was expecting very much not to like it. I was completely wrong. The book was one that I was not able to put down. The endless twists and turns kept the book interesting, and the conflict between the \\"Socs\\" and the \\"Greasers\\" was well developed.The book gave a good background on how gang life could be, as well as showing life from the eyes of a child who has lost his mother and father. Life at home was tough for Ponyboy having to deal his overprotective brother Darry. When it got real bad he ran away, or at least tried to before those \\"Socs\\" almost killed him. Ponyboy learned a lot about life and seemed to grow wiser as the novel went on.The two gangs were completely opposite in the novel. This is what caused the endless conflict between them. Every little disagreement ended in violence and at some points, death. In many scenes I had the urge to step into the book and stop everything because it was getting out of hand. It was ridiculous what these groups would do to each other, and they never held back. Although I disagreed greatly as to how they handled these conflicts, the outcomes were well written and believable.The book taught me a lot about how life might have been for kids my age at an earlier time period. I have heard a lot about how gangs were very preeminent in the past. The book showed a lot about friendship and how to stick up for each other. These kids did whatever it took to protect their fellow gang member, even if it meant getting in a whole lot of trouble. The book also made me think about what it would be like if there were gangs like this at my school. How tough life would be on everybody. Sure my school is very cliquey but it never really results in a rivalry between groups.I would recommend this book to anyone who is in for excitement and anyone wanting to learn about true friendship. The book keeps you guessing till the end, but amdist the rivalry there is one boy learning about life on his own the tough way."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"After you read the book The Outsiders you will find out that there is a lot more to life than being rich like the socials. Money don't run the world like the socials think. How would you like it if sum one shot your best friend over a stupid reason. There is a lot of lesson's to learn in this book.Bob and his gang beat up the greaser's because they are less fortunate and they get in a big fight over it the rumble. These guys where not playing .Later in the story two of the Greasers runaway because of what they did to one of the socials they return a week or to later.Poney and daily can't push what they did away. So just like with it you can try to fix it but you can't fix everything know mater how hard you try.Poney loved to go to the moves by himself of course every time he went walking home he had to watch his back. he let the life he had effect what he did. But should he have.Both of the gangs should had left each other alone and no one would had got hurt."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"My story is about The Outsiders. It is a very good book that has knives, guns, and fast cars in it. They are called The Outsiders because they are not really poor, but they are not rich either. They do not have the best cars in the world, but they are theirs. They like them. So, that is all that matters. Every time that there is a fight or a rumble the cops take them to jail, and not the soc's. They carry around knives, well all except for one. He is named Pony Boy. All of them do not like the sunset, but Pony does. He met a girl that liked him and liked sunsets. She had class. Well she was not like what he and the guys were used to.Johnny and Pony were walking the girls home from the movie. They saw the girls boyfriends and their friends. They said to get in the car to the girls and she started saying that he was drunk and she didn't want to. The girls got in the car to not get Johnny and Pony guys in trouble. They drove away. Johnny was still shaking because he saw those heavy rings that were Bob's prized possessions. They saw them later in the park that night. They started to fight and Johnny saw that Pony was getting drowned by Bob. So he stabbed Bob in the back. They ran over to Bucks to get Dally to help them. Buck's house always had a party going on. Buck said that Dally was in the bedroom. So Pony and Johnny thought that they knew what was going on, but Dally got punched in the ribs and broke some of them. Once they got on the train they both went to sleep. They got off of the train and then they saw that there was a farmer walking down the road. Johnny said to Pony to go and ask where the hill was. They had to go to that hill because it had a water spicate around the back of the abandoned church. I believe that they should have just said that it was just self defense instead of running away. I believe that they should not have gone in the burning building to save those children just because they started that fire.I believe that they should have just stayed in town and wait for the people to find them instead of panic and run away to that old church. They should not have went there because there will not always be an abandoned church to run to. I believe that in heart Pony does not like to be in all of the rumbles. I believe that when Pony thought that Darry did not love him I thought that it would have burned his heart out if he did not better. I believe that Soda likes to be in the gang just so he can have something to do. I believe that Darry would have told Pony if he would have known that he felt that way. I believe that they would quit the gang if they thought that they would die."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The book was about three brothers with without a Father or a mother, there names are Ponyboy, Soda, and Darry.

One day one of the Greasers kills a Soc with a knife. Everybody thought that Ponyboy did it but it wasn't. The person that did it was a hero and a murderer. He was a here because he saved all the children in a burning Church. But, then he get hospitalized because a big burning stick jabbed right into his back and made him paralyzed from his back to his legs. He dies a few days later of internal bleeding.I liked the book because it was very realistic. It was also scary, too, in some places. But most of all I liked it because it was a suspense book. It was realistic because it showed how the character acts and thinks. And another thing was when I read the book I couldn't stop reading it. I just kept on reading it.I chose the book because I found it on the shelf and I heard that it is a good book. Plus my teacher told me that it is good.

Hinton was one of the best books that i have read recently. The reason that I chose this book was that not one person said that it was a bad book, and i agree with them. The book is about two rival neighborhood gangs, the greasers and socials, who always get into fights. The greasers are low class kids with long greasy hair, are dirty and walk everywhere. The socs, which is short for socials, are higher class kids that wear kahki pants, white tee shirts, and drive around in expensive cars like corvettes. They always get into fights after johnny killed a social when he and ponyboy were attacked at the play ground. Read on to find out what happens in the rest of the novel.

I loved it right from the moment I had it described to me. It just sounded like it'd be full of conflict and emotion, the two things that--in my eyes--make a book good. And it was. Every part of it just draws you in, and it makes you think. It also teaches a good life lesson, which is something rare in books today. The only thing that sort of got on my nerves was that each conflict kept right on coming after another. It should've been spread out more, easier to take in. The book can be really intense, but I really recommend it."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is a great book which deals with important issues: poverty, death, and gangs. Ponyboy Curtis is a 'greaser' (someone who is poor and lives on the east side of town) and is constantly at war with the soc's (the rich people who live on the west side of town). Ponyboy lives with his two older brothers, Darry and Soda, and they watch out for little Ponyboy. The only other people Ponyboy can count on, are his gang/buddies. One night Ponyboy and Johnny commit murder and leave the town and go into the country. From this point in the book on, tragedy happens to people all around Ponyboy.The Outsiders shows the difficulties one can go through when someone a person loves dies. The book also shows the hardships people who live in poverty and bad neighborhoods can go through.I recommend this book to all teenagers. There are many points in the book where I could not put the book down. If you are looking for a book full of suspense and action, then The Outsiders is for you!HAPPY READING!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is a great book based in the day's of the Greasers. In the day's of when either you were rich and had it all in life, or you were from the other side of the tracks and were looked down upon. The book mainly focuses on the two gangs the Socs (the rich kids) and the Greasers (the poor kids). Booth of these gangs have to struggle to see who is better. This is a great book because it talks about how life was realy like back in those days. It wasn't all moon light and roses.

Well then grab the The Outsiders. This book taught me many lessons in life. It shows that people should solve their problems by talking to each other instead of fighting. You'll meet the main character named Ponyboy who is the youngest in the group. He is a strong thinker. He does not think it is right for people to kill each other, but all of his friends seem to want to solve problems that way.Ponyboy is part of a gang called the Greasers. They are always fighting with the Socs. It seems they have always been enemies. The first death is Bob from the Socs. Ponyboy's friend Johnny kills him in a jumping because Ponyboy was being harassed. Ponyboy felt horrible. Johnny and Ponyboy ran away to a church. Without giving away the rest of the book, you won't believe how the Socs and the Greasers end their war with each other.When my teacher first assigned the book, I felt overwhelmed. I felt like I was going to die because it was too much! But then after a while, I really got into the book and it was so realistic.

My favorite part of the book was when Ponyboy and Johnny were running away because Johnny had killed a boy that was trying to kill Ponyboy.

There are really social classes.She wants you to take a step back from your life and ask yourself,where do I belong? Am I the stuck up snob? Do I judge others who are different from me? Or maybe am I the \\"outsider\\"?Why this is important is because this is all to real. We treat those who are different than us less than we treat those who are just like us. If we were all the same the word unique would hold no value.I think that S.E. Hinton does an outstanding job recreating everyday life."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The OutsidersWritten By S.E Hinton...Period 3The Outsiders is one of the most exciting books I have ever read.It is full of danger, which kept me eager to read on to the nextpage. The Book is mainly about hierarchy. There is one group called the Socs, and another group called the Greasers. The Greasers were of the lower class, refering to being the less fortunate. The Socs were of the higher class, refering to being very wealthy. Between both classes they shared the same atitude. Which left anger and hate between each class.The Socs were as tolerant as Hitler was to the Jews, same as to the Greasers. Though the difference between the Greasers and the Socs in this book is that they the Socs would go out looking for trouble to make with the Greasers, and the Greasers were more than terrified to face these Socs. It is common in many movies that I've seen that the Greasers would always dominate over the wealthy crowd, such movies as Cry Baby and Grease. In this case the wealthier class dominated over the Greasers, which made them the Outsiders.This Novel had seriously changed my overall prospect of what I thought about life back in the 50's. The writer made me confused because the Greasers were terrified of the Socs. I always thought socs were just rich squares, as the Greasers would put in Cry Baby. This situation kept me reading on. Not only that but alot of action and danger kept me reading on. It would take me at least to the fourth chapter to get to the exciting parts, though it only took me to the second page and I was already leaping for the next page eagerly to know what would come next. The book was very interesting because the excitment took place before the rising action, and the climax. Thats one of the reasons why I like this book.\\"Johnny was one of the smaller guys in the gang, we kind of felt sorry for him because he got torn up by the socs, he was even pulled to his head with a gun, and the socs left him on a street, blood all over his body, the socs had given him a haircut\\"As Pony(one of the Greasers)described.\\"I had started to run though it wasn't untill I was grabbed that I noticed that they were the socs.They had threaten me, that they were going to give me a haircut, I reached for my pocketknife in my boot though it was too late.\\"If you are one of those people who hate reading till the next chapter to see if something exciting happens, read The Outsiders, it will have you leaping out of your chair in excitment.

It has many morals to it - it's about the social differences living in a society split in two - in this case, split into the Socs and the greasers - because of wealth or looks. It discusses the way some people find themselves superior and serious situations that arise.The book is written in the eyes of Ponyboy Curtis, a greaser who lives with his two elder brothers, Sodapop and Darry, who's in a gang. A lot happens in the story in little time, but it does portray real life situations, however uncomfortable they might be.The characters are all different, and my favourites are probably all the three main characters: Dally, Johnny and Ponyboy. This was the first book to make me cry in a long time - I'm quite apathetic - but it managed to do it because I related with the characters so much and understood the situation.In short, this is a stunning novel with good moral and social value."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book gave me shivers all up and down my back; it was just and it taught me how to be happy with what I have.This is about two gangs named the Greasers, who are poor, and the Socs who are preps and rich. Ponyboy is a Greaser. He murdered someone so he runs away with his friend Johnny to a place that nobody sees him. Also Ponyboy never gets along with Darry his older brother. For example that night Darry smacked Ponyboy on his face because he was late to come home. Anyway, they go live at an old church for a while and then Dally shows up and gives Ponyboy a note from Soda his middle brother. Dally invites both of them to Dairy Queen. While they were gone the church caught on fire because they forgot to turn of the flame after they were done smocking and when they returned there were children that were in the church. So Dally, Johnny, and Ponyboy save them and get badly burnt. Johnny later on dies because of all his bad burns bad so does Dally but before Johnny died he wanted Ponyboy to read his favorite poem,\\"Natures first green is gold,Her hardest hue to hold.Her early leaf is a flower;But only so an hour.Then leaf is a flower;Then leaf subsides to leaf.So Eden sank to grief,So dawn goes down to day,Nothing gold can stay.\\"This poem is so good and so is the book. It is terrific and it meant a lot to me."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"My class of eighth grade students just finished this book. I enjoyed teaching it, and for the most part, I believe my students felt the characters jump to life from the pages of this novel. For some students this was the first time a connection with a piece of literature has ever happened. The issues addressed in the book: group dynamics, gang violence, high school attrition, domestic violence, juvenile delinquency, friendship, family unity and many more are just as timely today as when the novel was written. While I think most older teens will enjoy the novel, I think it is best experienced and discussed in a group setting with an adult who can field questions and facilitate discussions that naturally arise from reading this book.Experiencing tough life lessons through the safe distance of a book can be an awesome thing. This is a great novel for young people who are beginning to see the real world past the walls of their homes and communities. The novel provokes examination of life, living, and human nature and encourages students to develop their own ideas about how things \\"should be\\" in contrast to how they perceive things truly are. It is a high interest level novel that lower level students are willing to invest time and interest into reading. The best part is that the book is relatively short enough to be finished with plenty of time to extend the novel into learning activities."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The outsiders\\"I reckon it never occurred to you that your brothers might be worrying their heads off and afraid too call the police because something like that could get you two thrown in a boy's home so quickly it'd make your head spin. And you were asleep in the lot? Ponyboy, what on earth is the matter with you? Can't you use your head? You haven't even got a coat on.\\"Ponyboy and Johnnycake are two main characters that are also best friends in this fiction book The Outsiders. They are part of a gang called the \\"Greasers\\". Everyone in the gang are all friends. There has always been this rivalry between the Greasers and the \\"Socs\\". The Socs are upper class teenagers that have everything, but there is still something missing in their lives. They love to beat up Greasers for the fun of it, until one day one of the Greasers takes it too far.The Outsiders is by S.E Hinton I would recommend this book to both females and males from ages 12 and up. Anyone younger will not understand the book; there is also foul language. I would have to rate this book a five out of five stars. I think that The Outsiders was the best book I have ever read! I thought that because I could relate to the book and what they were feeling. It also gave me a different outlook on people in general, and a different point of view on life.~Brooke Riley"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This has to be one of my all time favorite books.

If your into stories where it's like a team at first, and they stick together from beginning to the end, this book is for you!The beginning starts out as Ponyboy Curtis is walking out of the movie theater, and gets jumped by the rich snobs called \\"Socs\\". Ponyboy gets saved by his older brother Darry, and all is well. Or is it?At one point, Ponyboy sleeps at Johnny's house for a while, and Darry get's real mad at him.

It suddenly turns into a jumble of events with the Socs, such as a rumble, a girl, a fire, and even a murder."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is a miracle, in that this realistically raw story is the creation of a person's imagination; and this person was only 16 years old. Yes, S.E.Hinton was 16 years old when she wrote this book.Anyway, to make it short and to-the-point: the beginning of 'The Outsiders' is intriguing, the middle heartbreaking, the ending satisfying.To find out how so, read the book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"THE OUTSIDERS IS AN AWESOME BOOK! One of my teachers read it to me and the other girls in my class last fall. All 16 of us LOVED it! It's about a boy named Ponyboy, who is a greaser in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and gets mixed up in a murder rap. You'll have read it to find out what happens.

It wasn't just a book about gangs, it showed love of family and love of friends."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I loved this book. Its harsh reality shows that no one person should be considered an outsider. Everyone who feels that they are the only one that feels things in a certain way, should come to realize that there are others who feel that way too. Even when the other person seems to come from a different world. I have read this book so many times that I've memorized the first and last line!!:)"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders The Outsiders by S. E. Hinton is about a boy named Ponyboy and his family. Ponyboy is the only one in his family who goes to school. His second oldest brother, Soda Pop, works at the gas station and his oldest brother, Darry, works with roofing tiles. Their parents died before the story begins. Ponyboy belongs to one of two main gangs in the area he lives in. His gang is called the Greasers and the other gang is called the Socials. The main conflict of this book involves Johnny and Ponyboy killing someone and running from the police. While running away from the police Johnny, Ponyboy, and Dally save some kids from a burning church. After they save the children they go to the hospital to check their injuries. Ponyboy has minor cuts and burns, Dally has minor cuts and burns and a broken arm, Johnny is hurt the worst. He has a broken back and is paralyzed from the waist down. While reading this book I learned that gangs stick together no matter what happens. The Outsiders is very interesting because it gives the reader an idea about the gang world. This book contains lots of detail about fighting and other interactions that happen in gangs. The unique feature about this book is that any type of family especially a poor family, can live in the same environment as the rest of us. This book will be interesting to people who want to know what gangs are like. The language used is very easy to understand, gang members don't have big vocabularies, so they keep the language simple. The characters are very believable because they act like people I know. The book's message is that it is never good to get into a fight even if you out number the enemy. This book is appropriate for our age (13-14)."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is a great book. When I run out of of books I want to read I always pick up that one or when there are no good movies at the store I always look for that one.

S.E Hinton has shown me the part of the world I've never encountered in a teenager's language through a teen's view. i adore this book, the author and the good Ol'America in the 60s.

It can really make you think of the things we take for granted, family, friends, even food. These boys live off of what they have. And it is a very emotional and moving book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This is a classic \\"coming of age\\" tale of a boy who grows up on the \\"wrong side of town\\". Today, the \\"social groups\\" presented in the story 'socs' and 'greasers' are dated. However, they can easily be mapped to other competing groups that may exist today. The true strength of the story is the evolution of the relationship between the lead character and his \\"family\\". At times the events seem to be a little far-fetched, however, the strength of the character development helps to overshadow those.The lead character lives in a bleak world, where kids come from broken home, not knowing a world where everyone doesn't smoke, drink and fight violently. In spite of (or because of ) this, the \\"kids\\" have strong relations with each other. Even growing in this world, the lead character is smart, ahead in school, and would appear to have a bright future. However, he appears convinced that he will grow up to just be like the 'losers' around him. The events in the book are strong enough to help convince him to re-examine his views. The evolution in the book is convincing, without excessively trying to prove points."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The story was written more than 40 years ago. The author was but 16 years old at the time. But this story is still the quintessential adolescent coming-of-age novel, a story that essentially introduced the genre as we know it today.And it still holds its place at the top of the genre. A worthy read for adolescents and those parents that might need a refresher on the workings of the adolescent mind - maybe a quick view back into their perspective on the world. (Although the parents of today's adolescent generation probably read this book when they were adolescents.)Anyone who hasn't read this book has missed out on a classic, and those who have read it would do well to reacquaint themselves. Quick read and worth the time."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I bought this book for my 8th grade English class to read. It is an amazing story of hope and courage, and the kids were really able to identify with many of the characters. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is on my list of great reads. I always feel like an outsider at school so it's easy to care about Ponyboy Curtis. He's a lost and confused boy, stuck in a gang with his brothers. He's got no way out except good grades and the track team. His experiences with his friends feel so true you'd swear you were right there with him. The scenes happen quickly and leave you anxious to read more."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"After all these years of loving the movie, I finally decided to buy the book! What years I've wasted..From page one I got lost in S.E. Hinton's world of greasers and socs and how despite all the years that have passed and with the evolution of technology and science, this novel still applies to kids today. The names and name-calling may be different but the struggle has remained the same. The Outsiders truly is a classic in American literature. This isn't just recommended reading for schools, but for everyone. That's what a classic means - timeless and ageless. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I read this book as a classroom assignment at school, and I have to say that it was really interesting!! I was impressed of how good it was and the plot was amazing. Its a story of a misunderstood boy caught up in the world of gangs and the world of daydreams. But after things get too far between the Soc gang, and the Greaser gang(which the main character is part of), his world just starts crashing down. You'll laugh,and cry reading this novel and I highly recommend it to someone whos doing a book project, or if you just need a good book to read, the outsiders is for you."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Wow! Reading The Outsiders was the best thing I have done. I actualy picked The Outsiders book because of the way tha cover of the book was. I liked The Outsiders because of the way the author kept expressing himself he used so many old language like tuff ment cool in the old days. well I also liked the way the two gangs were fighting. Everytime the two gangs faught the Greasers always lost. Onece the rich kids wich were the socs found two greasers at the park, then they started an argument. That cause a big problem if you want to know what it was maybe you should read the book your self."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I remember my 7th grade English teacher handing me this book for the first time for an assignment. we were instructed to go home and read chapter one. I finished the entire book in one sitting.This book is a powerful story about prejudice and rivalry, and a young boy realizing that pain, no matter your class or friends, is the same for all of us.I have a 13 year old son now, and I can't wait for my copy so he can enjoy the experience as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I credit Susan Eloise Hinton with writing the book (THE OUTSIDERS) which really began the modern YA novel. Amazingly still, she penned it at age 16. The fact that the 1967 book still sells like johnnycakes (inside joke) today is testament to the book's merit. What's more, it appeals equally to boys and girls. The book focuses on boys' gangs (Greasers vs. Socs), so boys identify with it, yet it also demonstrates a degree of sensitivity and love between the boys (both between the Curtis brothers and the Greaser gangs) that girls find rewarding.At the heart of the novel is Robert Frost's poem, \\"Nothing Gold Can Stay,\\" which gives the book its signature line: \\"Stay gold, Ponyboy.\\" Ironically, Johnny's advice to Ponyboy goes against Frost's message, yet readers buy in totally as, by that time, they are as caught up in sunrises as Pony and Johnny.The very best of S.E. Hinton's works, THE OUTSIDERS will be around for a long time. By tapping into a problem that will never go away (youths and their feuding cliques), Hinton has given us a small-scale masterpiece and a YA classic."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I read this book a couple of weeks ago and immediately knew I had to see the movie. My english teacher gave it to my class as an assignment novel. I didn't think much of it. I just wanted to read it and get it over with. My teacher had told my class that once we picked the book up there was no way we'd be able to put it down. I thought she was bluffing, but after I started reading it I realized she wasn't! This book is heart warming and one of the best books I have ever read! It is definately my favorite book so far! I always said if a book made me cry...even once it was a good book. Well, this book made me cry about 3 times in two days. The main character and narrator, Ponyboy went through life altering moments! He was a greaser and proud of it! See, there were two types of people in town...the greasers, from the east side of town-the poor kids and the socs &lt;&lt;short for socials&gt;&gt; who were from the west side-the rich kids. Greasers and Socs did NOT get along and always ended up in fights- known as rumbles. The rumbles were always safe and never ended in anything drastic. Until one night, when Johnny &lt;&lt;one of the boys in the gang&gt;&gt; stabbed a soc and killed him. After that, they were on the run. Dally told them a good place to hide and so they went there. One day, the church they were hiding in burned down. Little kids were trapped in and Johnny and Ponyboy risked their lives to save them. Ponyboy came out alright, but Johnny wasn't so lucky. He broke his back and was going to be crippled for life, IF he made it. Dallas Winston &lt;&lt;Dally&gt;&gt; never loved anything, but after the BIG rumble that they beat the Socs in, Johnny died and Ponyboy finally realized that Dally did love something...Johnny. Afterward, Dally robbed a liquor store and was shot down by the cops and he instantly died. This story is heart warming, because it's not only about a rivalry or murder or violence, it's also about a boy trying to find a place where he could feel he belonged and wouldn't have to get pushed around. S.E. Hinton wrote this classical novel when she was sixteen and I guess that's why she captured the trials and tribulations of life as a teenager so well. At the end of this book, I don't know if anyone else who read it felt the same, but I felt like I knew the characters... personally. As if they were part of my gang and were all my friends! I recommend this book to anyone. Anyone who likes a story about hard times, friendships, loyalty and triumph...this book is a must-read!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book is very reality based,and it couldn't have been better written. We were assigned to read it in school. Usually, no one really reads the book, but everyone is reading it whenever they can, it even has the book haters reading! If you know someone who says they don't like to read, give them this book, it WILL change their mind! This is the second time I've read this, and I love it even more! The story of Ponyboy, who lives with his two brothers (Sodapop and Darry) after his parents die in a car wreck. There is an ongoing conflict between his social group (The Greasers) and the upper class group (The Socs, pronounced soshas). The story of choosing what's right, and the basic theme is: no matter how different we are, we all look at the same sunset. We all have some problems, everyone. You need to read this book, it is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book is about gangs. The West - Side gang are the Socs. The East - Side gangs are called greasers. The greaser telling the story is Ponyboy Curtis. The other greasers in Ponyboy's gang are Sodapop Curtis, Darry Curtis, Steve Randle, Two-Bit Mathews, Dallas Winston, and Johnny Cade. Most of the time the greasers were jumped by the Socs. One time Ponyboy ran away with Johnny to hide in Windrixville all because of Darry who hit Ponyboy. They didn't go back for a week. And when they did, they were in the hospital from a burning church. Ponyboy was out for a rumble against the Socs. They won and when Ponyboy went to the hospital to visit Johnny, Johnny died. A few days after that, Ponyboy went to Juvenile Court for a hearing. If you want to hear more about the story, then read it and see how fun it is!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"As an avid fan of track and field, I like things that are fast. In this case, I like books that are quick to get to the point. Never have I read a book so packed with action in only the first chapters of reading. Miss Hinton at the tender age of sixteen did a very good job keeping readers who hate slow plots very interested in the book. Pony is a very nice charter, who is sort of a mild thug. I say \\"mild thug,\\" because of his associates, the greasers; a group of people who Pony admits are often involved with stealing. Although Pony in involved with them, he is a very good student, and is a lot more articulate than his brethren. Pony boy, who is suppose to be part of a tuff gang of guys, enjoys getting up early to watch the sunset, and confesses to going to movies alone so he can analyze the plot and critique the acting without the worry of having to socialize with his friends. There was not a chapter that went by that did not leave me in suspense. Even the last chapter left me wanting more, I personally wish that S.E. Hinton would make sequel. This book has drama; it has murders, fires, and love. The best part of the whole book is the big brawl between the greasers and the socs, or \\"socials,\\" the greasers rival gang. It was while I was reading about the preparation of the rumble that I learned that \\"bringing heat\\", meant bringing guns. I recommend this book to anyone who likes lots of action in a well-plotted plot.Just for the record, my favorite character is Randy, a soc, and a very reasonable kid. After the death of his friend Bob, he tells pony that he is sick of the whole gang business, and people just need to live to enjoy life. I wish people just lived to enjoy life, or watch the sun set. He he."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This was a book I had to read in High School. Though I wan't anavid reader, I loved it!

Since his parents are deceased, he and hislaid-back older brother Soda are taken care of Darrel the eldest,who's a bossy perfectionist (really only worried that he might losehis baby brothers). There's Johnny Cade, whose family life isinsufferable. There's Dallas Winston, mean and gruff (but has a softspot for Johnny). And then there are the Soc's, the spoiled kids wholike to pick on the greasers for fun...

You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I'm a 7th grader and my teacher read the Outsiders outloud to our class and I really liked it a lot. My favorite character was Dallas because he liked to carry a gun and a knife with him. But I didn't like it when he shot himself at the end. We also watched the movie in clas too and I liked the movie because it should everything that was said in the book.

This is why we have graffiti all over the city. These kids have their own gangs and their own initiations and their own morality, and they are doing the best they can. But they are dangerous because their own laws are not those of the city.&quot;In The Outsiders, S.E. Hinton explores this theme of adolescents left alone without the guidance of adult role models and the tragic results that can ensue. The adolescents in this novel have fashioned a mythology of their own and modeled it after the gang leaders, who get druck, lift hubcaps and blow off steam in gang fights. As one might expect, when conflict arises the characters resolve thier conflicts, as some adolescents do, with violence; with little or no thought for the consequences of their actions.Through Ponyboy's eyes we see the growing resentment between Greasers and Socs that escalates into two conflicts between the gangs...both with tragic results. Ponyboy learns that Socs are no different than the Greasers, they are equally ignored by their parents.An excellent companion to Romeo &amp; Juliet and even West Side Story...all three are compelling works that can and should be used as springboards for teens to discuss their emerging independence, their beliefs and behavior."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This is my favorite book because is a great reminder of how life, as I see it, is. I enjoy this book because it doesn't try to be anything its not. Hinton's novel is about tension and strife at any level. S.E. Hinton's plot is extremely easy to understand and to relate to if you don't have problems with the reality that people smoke, use grease in their hair, are violent sometimes, and listen to Elvis. These habits may not be common place where you live or have lived but they happen and have happened.I also love this book because it is timeless to me. I can read it anywhere at anytime and enjoy it. Thank You."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is a good book in my view. It was about a gang of kids who depended on each other for their lively hood. Ponyboy Curtis, the main character, is a small, but feisty fourteen-year-old. He's got two older brothers named Sodapop and Darry, who look after him because his parents were killed in a car crash. The \\"greasers\\" as they are called, are rivals with the \\"Socs\\" the upper class people. They are always getting in fights with each other. And when the big \\"rumble\\" comes, they must learn to fight beside each other and to always \\"Stay Gold\\"."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I like the story because it is very exciting. The brothers try to keep out of the Soch's hangout, but they catch up with the Soch's everytime. The Soch's leader is killed by Johnny, one of the Greasers. He is known as the gang &quot;pet&quot; because he was beat up by one car full of Soch's that the group hated. The Greasers have smoked or are smoking, have criminal records, and are all a big major group of brothers as they call them selves. My summary for the book is that I kind of am two sided on it. I mean that I like some of it and I don't like some of it. But, I know one thing, that I think kids shouldn't run from there fears but face them like grown up's. So, if you think about getting the book for your kids, get it for them when they get older. That is what I think about the book The Outsiders."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I first read this book for Reading class. No one in my class disliked it.

The character in the story stands up for each other."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book is a good book about two different ways of living between the Socs and the Greasers. The narrator is a boy Greaser who shows us the good and hard times about being a greaser. However, if you do not like violence, I don't think you should read this book. There are a lot of situations in this book that contains violence. Overall, I really liked this book, because most books we read in school aren't very good. If you like stories with some violence and a lot of thoughts and emotions going on between the characters then you should read &quot;The Outsiders.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"OUTSIDERSThe book &quot; The Outsiders&quot; was normally a book I wouldn't have read. However I was assigned to read this book and found out it wasn't that bad. All though I found it a little hard to relate to the problems Ponyboy and the other characters had. However I found I could to some extent understand what was going on, and how they felt. This story is about two gangs of boys that are always fighting to earn respect between two social groups. This book isn't my favorite book, but I did enjoy it. It's easy reading, for all ages, and not that long. So try it I'll bet you'll like it. Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I thought this book was a good book that got better. This is a great book, and I highly recommended this The Outsiders to everyone. The thing that made this book real good is its great character development, super plot, and the climax. No, I won't tell you the climax. It's about two gangs in the 50's. The gang's names are the greasers, the hard nice guys, and the Soc, the rich punks. They always quarreling, and Ponyboy is caught in the middle of it. If you want to find out more about Ponyboy and his adventures, buy The Outsiders now."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The OutsidersThe outsiders was a great book, the reason is it a good book is that it is like a real-life event. It was a very interesting book because you were scared for the people like they were scared for themselves. The reason it's like a real like experience is because when you get in a gang you get in fights, and get beat up by other people for no reason. And if your in a gang you have that chance of getting killed by someone that was supposed to be your friend or by killing yourself or like how Bob got killed, by someone that hated him. But it's a very good book and I am going to recommend this book to other people."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"A Story of a lost young boy who is part of a gang with only two older brothers to look after him. When he gets mixed up with another rival gang, he and a friend must hide in an old abandond church with little food or money. When they returned to the old church, they were shocked to see the church on fire with helpless kids trapped behind the hot flames. This is a heroic story, but yet it is rather touching. The Outsiders is a descriptive book that details what gang life is really like and how this kind of life can damage a friendship. This is by far the best book I've ever read. I would definitely rate it a five on a one to five scale. This is a great book for readers who like action, but also a great book for the ones who like touching stories.Wesley"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"this is my all time favourite book. the first time i read this book i was in grade 8. it was an assignment for my english class. i didn't think i was going to like it, gee, was i ever wrong. even though the book was set in the late fifties / early sixties era it has a lot of the same struggles todays youth has, cliques or groups, and that sort of stuff. i highly, highly, highly, highly, highly recommend it. i feel so sorry for anyone who has never read this book. this book is a must read for everyone."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I was low on good books one day this summer, so my Mom dug up a box of her old books for me to read.

Hinton is a realistic and dramatic book. The Outsiders is about gangs and their problems toward eachother. There are the Greasers and the soc's. A lot happens with these two gangs. One of the Greasers kills a soc. This leads to a big fight that won't even prove anything. One of the soc told ponyboy,\\"And tonight...people get hurt in rumbles maybe even killed. I'm sick of it because it doesn't do any good. You can't win, you know that, don't you?\\"(p.103)\\"You can't win even if you whip us. You'll still be where you were before-at the bottom.

I liked the fact that they were such good friends. They watched out for eachother. The Greasers were Ponyboy, Sodapop, Darry, Dallas, Two-bit, and Steve Randle. The good thing about them was they didn't go around looking for trouble like the soc did.

Hinton was extravagantly written and greatly composed. A reader's first impression of the book is it's going to be stupid and boring, but have a little patience with it because it is very enjoyable. There is a little surprise at the end of the story that the reader will find enjoyable.Ponyboy Curtis, a kid who lives on the East side of town where all the poor families live, who are generally called \\"Greasers\\", walks out of a movie theater. And on his way he finds he is being followed, a few moments later he was jumped by the West side rich kids called \\"Socs\\". After being rescued by his two brothers, Sodapop, yes \\"Sodapop\\" is his real name, and Darry, and his friends: Johnny, Steve, Dally and Two-bit Mathews, yes that is his real name to. Ponyboy considered himself to have been lucky enough to only get a slash across the cheek, compared to his best friend Johnny who had been severely mugged four months earlier.Soon after words Ponyboy, Johnny, and Darry, a friend of theirs, went and broke into a drive-in movie theater even though they could have easily paid for the 25 cent entrance fee. There they meet two Socs: Cherry, and Marcia, and Two-bit Mathews, another friend. After taking the girls up to their neighborhood and leaving Two-bit Mathews, Ponyboy and Johnny went to the \\"lot\\" and lie down to look at the stars. A few hours later they started to head on home only to realize a group of Socs trailing them in a car. They drunkenly got out of their car and chased Ponyboy and Johnny down for giving \\"their\\" girls a ride. When they were caught they started drowning Ponyboy, when all of a sudden Johnny comes and kills a Soc named Bob.Now on the run from the law, Ponyboy and Johnny head to Blue Jay Mountain, which was suggested by Dally as a hiding spot. There they spend the next five days surviving on bologna sandwiches and pride taking disguise. When Dally comes to check on them he learns that they have decided to turn themselves in. On their way back they noticed a group of people around their hideout and they stop and they stop and see a fire. After a swift rescue of the kids that were trapped inside and nearly getting killed, Ponyboy, Johnny, and Dally were swiftly led to the hospital where a horrible event happens that changes everyone's life.This seemingly fictional, but amazing true story will keep everyone who reads this, hopefully, on the edge of his or her seat."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"All I can say is that it brought tears to my eyes.

It tells the life of Ponyboy Curtis, who is a Greaser,and focuses on the conflict shared between the Socs and the Greasers, two neighbourhood gangs. The Socs are very rich, and the Greasers are mostly hoods - apart from Ponyboy, his best friend Johnny, and Pony's two elder brothers, Darry and Sodapop. Pony's parents were killed in a car-crash when he was young. Darry,20, got a job so Soda and Pony wouldn't go into a boy's home. Soda and Pony have always got along well, but Darry is always shouting at Pony, telling him to use his head. One night, Darry hits him, so Pony runs away with Johnny. 5 Socs gang up on the two life-long friends, and almost kill Ponyboy. Johnny accidently ends up killing Bob, the leader of the gang, and boyfreind to a girl Soc called Cherry Valence. Dallas Winston tells them to hide out in an abandoned church in Windrixville, but it catches fire. Johnny, Pony and Dally manage to get some school kids out of the fire, but Jonhhy is hit by a falling beam and ends up with a broken back. The greasers try to avenge Johnny's near-death by having a rumble with the Socs. Johnny dies in hospital, his last words being &quot;Stay gold Pony, stay Gold...&quot;. Dally then manages to get himself killed by the cops under a streetlight, and everyone is grieving the death of two good friends. The only happy point in the story is the fact that Darry and Pony start to get along fine. Whenever they have a fight now, Soda agets really broken up, so they stop. This book isn't one bit depressing, it's really good fun.I thouroughly enjoyed this book, and became a typical soppy girl when Johnny and Dally died. My class also saw it on video, and all the girls cried their eyes out! I hope you enjoy yourselves like us!!!!!!! SE Hinton really went into the depth and feeling of the events in this book, and managed to include so much description that you could connect with the characters. I'd buy the video as well, that really brings it to life. It really opens your eyes to how bad things really are in most parts of the world. It also contains humor, which will keep you going the the sad times! Good reading all over!At the end of term, we had to write the whole book from Johnny's point of view, instead of Pony's. I enjoyed the depth of the feeling in the book so much, that I ended up getting an A*!

There were times in the book, near the middle, when I was yelling and screaming at the book, and times, at the end, where I cried.

When Johnny and Ponyboy went to Windrexvliie it showed that everybody tries to run from there problems. When dally goes and kills himslef shows that all people care about somone.

She also does a good job of explaining, in rich detail, how Ponyboy goes through his troubles.In which they all begin when a small fight begins, and Johnny saves Ponyboy's life by taking another.

However, all that effort to not like it was to was to no avail- when all is said and done, I really enjoyed this book and it's safe to say that it completely exceeded my expectations.After finishing this book the two elements which stick out to me most are the emotions and the relationships. In reading YA over the years I have grown so accustomed to the male characters being \\"bad boys\\"- cocky arrogant, and charming to the nth degree, however, despite all of that they have nothing on these boys. I've come to realize that those \\"bad boys\\" are fooling themselves, their \\"badness\\" (and all of the emotions surrounding it) is such a facade and superficial. These boys, from Soda, with a larger-than-life personality and who brings a smile to everyone's face, not unlike the beverage he derives his name from does, to Darry, stuck in a \\"between\\" state, due to putting his brothers before himself, to Dally, who isn't near as jaded as he lets himself come off of as, to Johnny, who, out of his death, inspires new life, to Ponyboy, a young man truly trying to find where he fits in the crazy world that he was born into, experience real and raw emotions- while they certainly have swagger, they aren't afraid to cry whenever need be (it was refreshing and I think that authors of the twenty-first century could certainly learn a thing or two from this author of the mid-twentieth-century). As for the relationship element, I can't remember the last time I read of such a strong family unit, despite many of these boys not being related by blood. These boys could always count on one another, even during those times when they may not deserve it.All in all, while I did enjoy this book I don't believe that it's the \\"best\\" and \\"most popular young adult novel of all time\\" as the cover boasts (though it is one of the best novels that I have been required to read for school, both high school and university)- but I am entirely thankful for it as it truly paved the way for all future YA."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Great book, good plot line and awesome characters overall an a++ @$&@$&@$&&$@&$@&$@ &$@ &$@ @$& &$@ $$&@ &$@ @$& &$@"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The book was bought for my daughter for an assignment in school.

Hinton was all the rage to read in my high school and I was seriously attached to Ponyboy and Sodapop and the rest. Like many another teenage girl smitten by Ralph Macchio, I memorized the Robert Frost poem and cried buckets at the end of the book.It's funny to me to hear recent reviewers discussing the book in terms of its relationship to gangs, because I don't see it as being about rival factions. Instead, I see it more as a meditation on the price of having an inside and an outside to any given social context. At the time the book was written, it was the socs and the greasers. At my high school it was the Jocks and the Beegs. It's about people being judged by their clothes and their family rather than their abilities and their desires.Hinton's book stands up well to time-- I'm a lot more cynical than I was as a child and I couldn't summon tears anymore for the characters, but reading it I could still revisit the concerns that I had at the time and the world that this book represented.A good gift for young teenagers."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This was a book I had to read in High School. Though I wan't an avid reader, I loved it! Probably because it reminded me of the rivalry between the &quot;jocks&quot; and the &quot;freaks&quot; in my own High School.The narrator is Ponyboy, sensitive with a tough exterior. Since his parents are deceased, he and his laid-back older brother Soda are taken care of Darrel the eldest, who's a bossy perfectionist (really only worried that he might lose his baby brothers). There's Johnny Cade, whose family life is insufferable. There's Dallas Winston, mean and gruff (but has a soft spot for Johnny). And then there are the Soc's, the spoiled kids who like to pick on the greasers for fun (the &quot;fun&quot; runs out when their buddy is killed). And let's not forget Cherry Valence, who though dating a Soc has a heart and a mind all her own.While Pony and Johnny hide out after the murder, with Dallas coming to their aid and rescue, the 3 &quot;greasers&quot; temporarily clean the slate of all stereotypes and somehow wind up as heroes! If you're wondering how these events occur, go read the story! You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book, which was written in the 1960's, may have well been written today. It describes the many conflicts between gangs, social groups, family violence, and friends. I was made to read this book twice when I was in middle-school, but even so I enjoyed it. Many emotions and thoughts surround the patrogonist, Ponyboy, who describes ganglife in the city. The book goes into many depths to develop the personality and emotions of every single character, and even from the view of the main character, you know the intellects of every little character. Every emotion is very sicere and well portrayed and not a detail is left out. You get a good view of human nature, feelings, and life. The story has a very moving plot that deals with family conflicts, murder, robbery, gang fights, friendship, social status, and loss. It does well at alerting the reader of the seriousness of gang warfare. Even though it expresses the many sad parts of life in the city, it gives a message that there can be hope and there is hope for those who have not lost the fight yet. This is an incredible book and definately worth getting. A must read!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I read THE OUTSIDERS for the first time when I was a teen myself, just a little bit younger than Ponyboy and Johnny. This book had a huge impact on me at that age. I fell so deeply in love with Hinton's simple, vivid writing style. Never had teenagers like me felt so real and present on the page. I couldn't stop telling my mom about it and how good it was and why. I'm sure she still remembers those nights. It is an oft-challenged book, unfortunately, and thinking about it now, I would have been devastated if someone had told me I couldn't read it or had come and taken it out of my library. I can't imagine not having read it then and I have read it so many times since. It's truly a classic and deserves the praise it's gotten over the years.Ponyboy Curtis is a Greaser. He lives on the wrong side of town. He acts tough, dresses tough, and lets his hair grow long to look tough. He lives with his two older brothers, Darry and Sodapop, and they barely make ends meet. Darry and Soda work hard to support themselves and let Ponyboy stay in school so that at least one person in the family can graduate high school. Pony's best friend is a sad boy named Johnny Cade who's been beaten around one too many times and spends a lot of time looking over his shoulder, anticipating the next blow. The only family these boys have are each other. Pony, his brothers, and their motley group of Greaser friends watch each other's backs and defend each other when necessary. Particularly when the Socs (rich kids from the other side of town) come looking for trouble. Dangerous Dally, funny Two-bit, somber Steve. Through Ponyboy's eyes we catch a brief, eloquent glimpse into the life of a group of teenagers the world seems to have forgotten, who take life's knocks on the chin and somehow keep going.I picked a small, worn copy of THE OUTSIDERS up off the shelf of a tiny used bookstore in Texas and took it home with me because I felt like the kids on the cover might be worth knowing. How right I was. This story of small-town prejudice and class warfare set in the 1960s has never really aged. The first time I cracked it open I was immediately enchanted by the magical language these kids seemed to speak, a language full of \\"greasers\\" and \\"Socs,\\" \\"savvys\\" and \\"tuffs.\\" I couldn't tear my eyes away. It is a coming of age story and a commentary on the dangers of going through life with blinders on, of judging people who are different from you before you know them. Of not wanting or caring to know them. Every character in this story is backed up against the wall, struggling to survive, and I cried more than once at the injustice of it all. And yet, when you come to the end, you feel the indomitableness of hope, the possibility of change, and the beauty of the human spirit. THE OUTSIDERS has been challenged several times on the grounds that it includes rough language, violence, references to cigarettes, alcohol, and for depicting broken families. And we would never want young adults to know that such things exist or, heaven forbid, that they may encounter them in their own lives. *eye roll* I get so angry when I hear hogwash like that. Never mind that it's beautiful, and real, and good. That it will teach its readers about how to treat their fellow human beings, how hatred and fear do nothing but destroy, and how the sunset looks the same no matter which side of the tracks you're from. That's the kind of book I want to read. That's the kind of book I want my children to read. And no one is allowed to tell me no."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"When I had to read THE OUTSIDERS in seventh grade, at first I was just like whatever because I thought it was going to be another boring book we had to read and why can't we ever get good books to read? But from the first chapter, that was it. I fell so hard I still haven't gotten up.This book was my inspiration for writing my own teen novels. It's one of those books that has characters you're so into you wish they were your friends. Well, first you wish they were real. And then you wish they were your friends and you could call them any time you wanted and be like, \\"Hey, Ponyboy, what's good? Can you meet up at Chat 'n Chew for some grilled cheese and backgammon?\\" That's what hooks you in from the beginning...the way this story feels so real. The intense energy of the dialogue and the fast pacing of the plot make it impossible to put this book down. And when you do put it down because you have to go to school or sleep or whatnot, you can't stop thinking about it, you can't stop wondering what's going to happen next. It's like you don't even know how you can get through the day without finding out.So I want you to be as hooked as I was and read this so many times that page 73 is falling out. Because this book makes you feel alive. And that's an amazing feeling."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This is MAX REVIEW with GriffenI am writing a book review on The Outsiders. This book is exciting, fast-paced, and a very enjoyable read. If you like action and suspense, then this is the book for you.The book begins in an Oklahoma neighborhood. Ponyboy, a parentless child, is going fine. Him and his gang are staying out of trouble, but still getting the usual gang fight between two groups; the Socs and the Greasers. The Socs are the rich, snobby people who drive around in their expensive cars. Then the Greasers, well, are pretty much the opposite. So anyway, Ponyboy is getting good grades in school, and everything is going great. Well, so he thought.The trouble begins when Ponyboy and the gang sneak into a drive-in theater. They meet Cherry, and her drunken boyfriends who don&#65533;t take kindly to strangers picking up their girls, and to make things sound worse, they are part of the Soc gang. Ponyboy and his gang get the drunken boyfriends to buzz off, and they walk the girls&#65533; home. The socs were gone for now, but their minds were set on revenge.After all that, Ponyboy and his friend Johnny are getting sick of things, so they decide to run away. But running away doesn&#65533;t turn out to be as pleasant as they expected. Leaving the house means vulnerable in fights, and they are the Socs main course. With saying this, you can expect that Ponyboy and Johnny are in a tight situation. So for that, they go to the one man who can help them escape, Dally. Of course, Dally isn&#65533;t pleased with lending them 50 dollars and a loaded gun, but he agrees. He sends them on their way on a train to a town called windrixville, which is almost the exact opposite of what their town is like. They stay at an old church at the top of a hill where nobody usually goes.After a few days of hideout and a few days of eating bologna they decide that hideout is not only hurting them, but other people too. An incident with them accidentally setting the church on fire puts not only them, but a group of kids on a picnic&#65533;s life in danger.So, what exactly is the fate of the kids in the burning church? Who will dominate the city, Socs or Greasers? Will Ponyboys life go back to normal? All this and more is in the book, The Outsiders, a book about understanding, decisions, and looking out for each other."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders was a fascinating novel depicting the life of a boy struggling to survive in poverty without parents. Having only two brothers to look up to, Ponyboy had to often fend for himself. While trying to stay out of trouble with the Socs, boys from the wealthier side of town, Ponyboy learned to depend on himself and keep his eyes close on his goals even with the many distractions he faced. Many times during this story, Ponyboy got into situations that ended up in fights. While being either strangled, threatened with a knife, or plainly just beaten up, Ponyboy learned to live a hard life. He was rescued in the nick of time, by his brothers, many times. Being the smartest and most focused Greaser of the gang, he set his sights beyond what the average Greaser could imagine. His goal was not to be the best street fighter in the gang but to get an education. He imagined a life free of the hatred between the Greasers and Socs, a life without fear and violence. Many Greasers could not live like that, but Ponyboy could. Ponyboy was different. This story takes us though the winding journey of conflict and heartache in not only Ponyboy's life, but in the lives of those closest to him.I recommend this book to people who would like to know what life in an inner city environment is like. This book will be exciting for all young adults for it addresses topics interesting for this age group. The action and fast paced tempo in the fights, hideaways, and rescues will bring excitement to any reader. This novel will teach any of its readers to be grateful for what they have and due to the many suspenseful moments throughout this novel, it will captivate the reader. I give this book an A+."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"In the city where Ponyboy has grown up, there are two major groups of teens--the greasers and the socs. Ponyboy is a greaser. He comes from a lower-class family and he wears his hair long and greased. His parents both died in a car accident, but he lives with his two older brothers, Darry and Soda, and the rest of the greasers in the neighborhood are like family.The socs live on the other side of town, and they seem to have everything going for them. They are rich and have their own cars. They have nice clothes and nice girlfriends, and their parents give them everything they could ever want. Those kids seem to take special pleasure in harassing or beating up the greasers. The two groups are constantly feuding, and the socs usually win.One night Ponyboy is out with another member of his gang, Johnny, and they are attacked by a group of drunk socs. One of them holds Ponyboy's head in a fountain and would have drowned him, but Johnny stabs him to make him stop. The boy dies, and Johnny and Ponyboy go on the run to avoid being tried for murder.I like the ways Ponyboy analyzes his world, trying to figure out why things are the way they are. I like that he doesn't just accept his environment. I also like the complex relationships in Ponyboy's family, especially his relationship with Darry. However, the rest of this book was a bit simplistic. Most of the characters don't seem three-dimensional, and their motivations for the way they act often aren't explained."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is about three brothers who must try to stick together in a rough neighborhood. The youngest brother is trying to find his identity and role in society while going through many ordeals such as trouble with the police and fights between the \\"Socials\\" and the \\"Greasers.\\" I believe that this book conveys many important values along with scenes common in our society today. There are disputes between different social classes as well as acts of heroism shown by Ponyboy at the burning church. The book starts out introducing the main characters and a little background on their place in society. The narrator, Ponyboy, is one of three brothers who lost their parents in a car accident. The oldest brother takes care of them and teaches them many values, which brought the brothers into a respectable life. Many events bring Ponyboy closer to realizing how other people think and where exactly he belongs.The American Library Association lists The Outsiders as one of the top 100 challenged books of 2000-2001 around the country. They reported it being banned for its violence, profanity, and drinking. I found absolutely no profanity in the book, although it does contain some violence and drinking. But the narrator in the book even criticizes drinking and prefers to avoid fights. One surprising point was that although the \\"greasers\\" carried around knives, they never use them to fight with. If they were going to fight, they used their fists instead of deadly weapons. This book should not have been banned because it critiques objectionable behaviors and certainly does not promote any of them."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The outsiders is a book about two gangs and their rivalry. It presents the friendship and love of the people in the gang. It's unique because it changed the teen books about crushes, prom queens, and cat fights into a truer, darker side of the world."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"i fell a sleep in class doin the outsiders book and now there makin me do this review about the book and i dont like it and i didnt like it or abomidible it was abomdible i cant spell ne ways bye bye i dont really read i ride dirt bikes ant im getting sponserd in the fall bye donald trump"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Was S.E. Hinton kidding herself. This book is a joke. It is so stupid. I would not recommend it to anyone. The characters are mandated to seem so cool. They think their cool because they murder and steal and smoke. It is a real American Joke!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"S E Hinton wrote this 128 pages book when she was 17. I thought she would have written something interesting or truthful of the life of teens in the US. How wrong it turned out to be! There is no plot, no interesting thing happening, just meaningless street fights and crazy violence. And throughout book, it shows how badly the writer is equipped with writing skills, if any skills at all. It told so many things which are unbelievable and unreal. How often do you see two skinny teenage girls, when one 6.2 foot bad boy offered them Coke, one of the girls would throw the Coke on the bully's face in return for his hospitality? Probably the this poor writer did and resulted in her forever brain damage which resulted in this crazy improbable tale. The main character's first name is Ponyboy and his brother Sodapop. I don't think there are many people in this world can find more stupid names. The names also made the whole crazy story unbelievable. What a waste of time in writing this thing called novel! An insult to anyone with any degree of intelligence.
