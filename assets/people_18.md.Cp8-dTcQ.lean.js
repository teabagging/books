Safeguarding Your Wi-Fi LAN","review":"I have 24 network jacks in my house. I don't want to install another network jack ever. Wireless is the answer from this point. The biggest problem with wireless is evident: security.This is one of numerous books on wireless security. Fortunately, it's a well done book that is not meant to be read by rocket scientists. You know those kinds of books: written by ego-centric techie-geeks who pad their books with technical jargon and useless scientific theory that only people at MIT could understand. Instead, this book is relatively easy to understand as long as you have some knowledge on wireless technology (beyond the fact that there are no wires involved).One chapter that I found to be very interesting covers the concept of war driving, which is the equivalent of driving around to pick up wireless networks in a neighborhood. It also covers how war drivers leave chalk identification markers for other war drivers to know that a wireless network has been detected.The book also adequately covers the various types of authentication and encryption that can be used help to secure a wireless network. Once again, the very technical details about how the packets are designed and how the handshaking takes place tends to be a bit dry to those without much technical experience.Using Windows 2000 Server as the example, the book goes through all of the steps necessary (with a large number of screen shots) to implement a VPN as well as set up an authentication and certificate server for enterprises. Fortunately, the home user is not forgotten. An entire chapter is dedicated to securing and managing a home wireless network; however, all of the home security methods that are covered in this book are Linux-based. Of course, if you're concerned about security, why are you thinking of using Windows in the first place?The appendices have a lot of background information on radio frequency and antennae types. But the really geeky appendix is how to make a functional wireless antenna out of a Pringles potato chip can.Overall, this is a good book to have. Obviously, computer technology being what it is means that the book will be obsolete in relatively short order. However, the fact that this book doesn't adhere to the mindless Windows centricity of most books of this kind also helps to give it that little boost of extra value.I also like this book because it does not have the &quot;I have a master degree so I'm going to speak like I'm addressing only brilliant people so as to impress you and add pages to the book to make it seem more important than it is&quot; attitude. Yes, you should to have a grasp of some of the concepts behind networking protocols to understand this; but the majority of the book is not a difficult read.If you're thinking of implementing a wireless network, this is a good book to have at your side."},{"Title":"How Secure is Your Wireless Network? Safeguarding Your Wi-Fi LAN","review":"Not being a wireless security expert, I liked this book for a concise intro to wireless technology as well as wireless security.This relatively thin book provides balanced (in my opinion) coverage of attacks and defenses, enterprise and home. It deals well with high-level and low-level topics (such as various configuration settings). It also described both UNIX/Linux and Windows configuration options and solutions. For example, detailed guidelines for setting up a public hotspot with Linux are provided. The book mixes the wireless technology details with relevant security issues in a single coherent story. It is easy to read and well-written.Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH is a Senior Security Analyst with a major information security company.

Safeguarding Your Wi-Fi LAN","review":"Congratulations to Lee and the Prentice Hall team, this is the clearest, most approachable material on wireless I have seen. The only reason I didn't give the book five stars is it will be functionally obsolete very soon. However at least for calendar year 2003, this is the best book on the subject, hands down.The book explains wireless technology and the security problems that come with the ease of use. The wardriving chapter (how to audit your organization's wireless) is well done and then they discuss the range of security solutions. What more can you ask for?Wireless is probably the most important IT security issue and managers and techies alike need to make every effort to keep abreast of the technology. This book is fluff free and will get you up to speed fast."},{"Title":"How Secure is Your Wireless Network?

But, anyone can intercept those airwaves so you need to be sure that you know how to secure your wireless network and protect your network and your computers from prying eyes. How Secure Is Your Wireless Network? provides detailed coverage of the available wireless protocols and the pitfalls of each (like interference with common household devices such as cordless phones and baby monitors). This book is a very good resource, but may be a little too technical for the non-computer gurus. Barken does a good job of explaining most of the concepts and steps in relatively plain English though.(...)"},{"Title":"How Secure is Your Wireless Network? Safeguarding Your Wi-Fi LAN","review":"Wonderfully informative book, well structured in taking the reader through the development of security for WLAN's. This book could form the framework for a college WLAN Security 101 course syllabus. The book is comprised of 11 Chapters and for all intents and purposes two sections. The first section contains wireless communication security concepts and the state of security in the wireless industry; and the second section contains practical application solutions to secure (or prohibit the use of) the home or office WLAN. The only addition I would like to see in the book, is a glossary of terms."},{"Title":"LETTER FORMS","review":"Stanley Morison is always a pleasure to read. He had enormous influence on twentieth centry type founding, and an encyclopedic knowledge of the history of type. It's a fascinating subject, partly because type design, more than just about any other art, is vividly aware of its own past, and is inextricably bound up with commerce.Up to about p.38, this book keeps the promise of its title, the search for a \\"scientific\\" classification system (a teeth-gritting misuse of the word). It discusses the history of letter forms as they appeared in cast type. The second essay also discusses one strand in the tapestry of calligraphy's history.After that point, however, Morison seems to switch gears. Gradually at first, he mentions earlier commentators on typography. By the end of the first essay, the topic is wholly the history of such commentaries, making this a history of typographic histories. It's a great starting point for someone about to embark on an academic study, but of limited use to the practicing typographer.It's brief, though, and still interesting to any reader wanting to know more about the typography's history. It just doesn't say a lot about the letter forms themselves.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"LETTER FORMS","review":"At first there were Phonecian and Greek alphabets, then Roman inscriptions.

Susan E. Wallace was the wife of Lew Wallace, Governor of New Mexico Territory from 1878-1881. When they moved to the southwest she began sending articles to magazines and literary publications. With an eye for detail and a knack for being the right places, when it came to recognizing important moments, whether in history of a place or daily life, she was there.In this book she shares her observations about the land, the customs and the mix of inhabitants that she finds. Her journey West starts first by rail and then by buckboard. She details her first encounter with Native Americans and her first visit to an Indian ceremony. Wallace writes about forcing open a heavy wooden door into a locked and forgotten room in the Palace of the Governors in Santa Fe. What she uncovered was a pile of jumbled papers, some of them dating back to the 1600s. The Land of Pueblos documents the past by a person who was truly in the land where she lived."},{"Title":"Beckett Baseball Card Price Guide","review":"I've used this guide in the past years and find it very detailed and informative.

As an avid figure skating fan, I expected 'Inside Edge' to be full of skating secrets and inside info, and it delivered. Wonderful tidbits from skating now and then. And the unusual scoring process of this sport was explained in full detail. I've read it twice, and I still want to read it more. Skating fans--this book is a MUST HAVE!!!!"},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"Christine Brennan put her Nothwestearn Journalism School education to good use. I was especially moved by the following passage:\\"Tonya Harding possessed more raw jumping talent than almost any of them. More than Kerrigan, Oksana Baiul, Michelle Kwan, Nicole Bobek, Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill, Kristi Yamaguchi, {or} Sonja Henie. Harding had it all.\\"I never heard such words applied to Tonya Harding before this book. I also didn't know before this book that Nancy Kerrigan wasn't well liked.This book clearly shows that talent even unusual talent or skill doesn't compensate for hard work. If Tanya Harding had practiced and stayed in shape, she could have been famous instead of infamous!"},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"My daughter, a figure skating coach, and I are on our 3rd copy: people keep borrowing this book and keeping it!Brennan does a fine job debunking the \\"pretty girls in pink\\" myth about skaters, while still showing respect for the amount of effort and athleticism necessary to succeed in this sport. It's been said that Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did - only backwards and in high heels. Well, figure skaters do everything other elite athletes do, backwards/forwards and in the air while maintaining an illusion of fragility. Brennan recognizes that dichotomy, which is why this is such a good book.If you know skating from the inside, elite or simply local, you will recognize much of what she talks of. If you enjoy politics, read this for incredibly sharp double dealing and backstabbing. But always, read it for the beauty she evokes."},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"When I first saw this book, I expected it to be a &quot;Little Girls In Pretty Boxes&quot; -type bashing of the sport. As I began to read I realized it was nothing of the sort. You can tell the author really knows and loves the sport. Reading &quot;Inside Edge &quot; is like being a fly on the shoulder of several top skaters. Christine Brennan writes like she was talking to you!"},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"This book contains a lot of unsubstantiated gossip about skaters, and the author has apparent biases towards, and against, specific skaters, but it gives a very insiteful view of the insides of the skating world. It is well written and very interesting, and I recommend it highly to anyone interested or participating in competitive skating.This book is a seminal skating book, EVERYONE I know in skating has read it and has their own opinions about what it contains. It's a must read."},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"I truly enjoyed Ms. Brennan's portrayal of figure skating. Having grown up in the sport I am often disappointed with the very narrow and superficial view depicted on television. In her well researched account, Ms. Brennan managed to capture the essence of the sport without exploiting or oversimplifying it. It brought back vivid and fond memories."},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"I though the book was very informative. It gave alot of &quot;backstage&quot; stories, fans never hear or see. However, I felt that the book was VERY one sided. Sometimes it completely ignored the other side of the story, for example when describing the entire Kerrigen/Oksana battle, i felt that she clearly showed that she was on the side of kerrigen, I felt she should have remained in between, a foolish reader would easily be turned to what she wrote, and take it as complete facts, because thats the way I felt she was writing, like it was a fact that kerrigen was better, and that simply is not true. Aside from that I felt the book was strong, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"Journalist Christine Brennan takes fans of this sport behind the scenes for a brutal but truthful look at a sport known as much for its glitter as its athleticism. Brennan exposes it all, from the pressure of competition to the facades perpetuated by an antiquated skating federation. Using real interviews with the figure skating's top athletes, Brennan covers tragedy and triumph with unbiased professionalism. Highly recommend for skaters and fans of figure skating"},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"If you want to know it all about figure skating, well, here's the book for you! It struck me as sort of gossipy, though.

I can't wait for the release of Ms. Brennan's new book."},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"Though I'm not a figure skater, this book was very interesting and held my attention. Chritine Brennan takes you on a journey into the secret parts of figure skating. Find out about what makes them want to keep going, why the parents can be so pushy, eating disorders in the sport, figure skating's scoring process, and tons of secret and insider information on the magical world of figure skating. Tons of revealing information and secrets that anyone will find interesting. This book is more like a figure-skating version of &quot;Little Girls in Pretty Boxes&quot;. Must-read for all figure skaters, fans, and coaches."},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"This gives a one way look into the sport.

It is a must for every figure skating fan, chock-full of inside stories and unknown tidbits of information. It profiles skating's top personalities and competitions in both the amateur and professional sides of the sport. Even if her opinions are different than yours, it is still a fascinating read. This is not just another figure skating book. If you like this, read Ms. Brennan's other book Edge of Glory, which is just as thrilling. You will love this book!"},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"This is a really good look at the world of figure skating.

It is a really fast read."},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"I think the author focused too much on the negative aspects of the sport and was too critical of many of the skaters except with exceptioon of a few whom she is an obvious fan of and throughout the book she talked about what skaters were thinking and what they were feeling...which made me wonder.... is she a sports reporter or mind reader!!??!!???"},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"Unfortunately, this review won't allow for a rating of zero. I have just one word to describe this book: TRASH!"},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"Christine Brennan obviously has a number of axes to grind with several members of the sport of figure skating. While her book is entertaining, I'm afraid that it is horrendously biased and smacks of pay-offs and vindictive gossip. Unfortunately, the readers that this book will most appeal to (namely those new to or outside of the sport, casual observers) are likely to accept Ms. Brennan's anecdotes as fact. For those of us that were there in many cases, or know those involved, this is a deplorable tabloid-istic smear essay. Don't bother."},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"As a figure skater this book was really interesting for me. It brought out all the negative things about skating (the early morning practices, pressure to do well, AIDS, homosexuality, and the extremem competitivness of the sport) and put them out for the world to see. But the book also showed the positive things about skating, showing why people are captivated and why skaters put themselves through the pain and pressure just to skate and be number one. The book gave me a new perspective on the sport that I love and will give up anything to be a part of. I know now about the good and the bad, and that gives me a good perspective, not just focusing on the good or just not on the bad, this book gives what feels like a one-on-one chat with the reader examining this ever perplexing sport."},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"I have to say I was surprised by Christine Brennan's take on Tonya Harding. Tonya Harding is now a pariah in the world of American figure skating even though she helped many of today's figure skating athletes to become household names and wealthy as well. Tonya doesn't see any of it. It's ironic that Tonya Harding can't skate professionally while convicted rapist Mike Tyson is allowed to box but that's figure skating. Between the 1992 and 1994 Olympic Winter Games, the infamous incident by Nancy's clubbing by one of Tonya's hired goons caught everybody off guard. Poor Tonya, she was the girl from blue collar upbringing, divorced parents, and quite a dysfunctional childhood. I think if this was played out in Hollywood. Nancy and Tonya would have made up before the 1994 Winter Olympics and let it go down in history. No, the FBI was brought in. In the 1992 games, too much attention was paid on Nancy Kerrigan and the plight of her legally blind mother who later claimed that her daughter deserved the gold medal. In 1992, everybody including myself who watched the Olympic games knew about Nancy's poor mother. Nancy got more attention than Tonya and Kristi Yamaguchi who went to win the First Olympic Gold Medal for Ladies' Figure Skating since Dorothy Hamill. Still, she was shadowed by Nancy's blind mother. Since 1994, I became disillusioned when I saw figure skaters past judgment on Tonya Harding. I haven't lost respect for Jayne Torvill because she was actually quite ladylike in all retrospect. Sadly, Tonya was never the graceful skater but an excellent jumper who was the first American woman to land a triple axel. Tonya's happiness was short-lived by an abusive marriage and a US Figure Skating Association that cared more about maintaining a facade of a happy family. I didn't know that Nancy was not well-liked. YOu could have sure fooled me. Even now, Nancy is still the victim of a dumb plot. Had she had any sense, she would have forgiven Tonya and let it go but no it became a nightmare and a dream for the tabloids of the time. My respect for figure skating is gone. I am not surprised by the homosexuality in figure skating because it's so obvious but I wish they would just admit it rather than cover it up now. Even now, you just wonder why some aren't married or dating anybody. Anyway, the sport has changed for the worse in my opinion. It's become corrupted by greed, jealousy, and envy."},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"Brennan does a great job in bringing the reader into the inside world of figure skating. This book is so well written and enjoyable that I read it several times. It was fascinating reading about the double dealings, backstabbing and intrigue involved in this sport. Brennan also touches on the Nancy Kerrigan/Tonya Harding story and debunks the perception most people have about Nancy Kerrigan being \\"America's Sweetheart.\\" Another fascinating part of this book was the story on the sacrifices parents make for their children for figure skating, and how champion skaters are raised.If you are a figure skater, enjoy sports, or interested in history/politics, you will definitely love this book."},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"Having just finished this terrifically addictive book, I was thrilled to learn she's written an update and hope she considers writing more skating-related nonfiction in the future. I'll admit I was a bit chagrined to learn she focused pretty much entirely on American figure skaters (seems like Paul Wylie was a primary source for much of her material which is interesting) in this work, but those who she does focus on are fascinating subjects after being touched upon by Brennan's prose. She jumps (pardon the pun) about a bit from skater to skater, but I greatly appreciated the insight into Nancy Kerrigan's history as well as Janet Lynn and Michelle Kwan, to name a few. Her chapter on Christopher Bowman reminded me of how supremely talented he was, and how he didn't know what to do with it all besides fritter it away; it's especially poignant considering his recent demise, which could have been predicted by pretty much anyone who came into contact with him during his skating years. I plan to send my copy of Brennan's \\"Inside Edge\\" to my mother as she too has been a longtime figure skating fan, and look forward to seeing what else she touches upon in \\"Edge of Glory\\"."},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"Lots of inside information about figure skating that most of us might never have guessed! A good and fast read!"},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"This book is now dated, figure skating is scored quite differently now, then it was when this book was written. The skaters in the book have long since been replaced by a current crop. Not being an \\"insider\\", I don't know how the \\"politics\\" of figure skating have changed, but I'd suspect that the \\"politics\\" is also at least a bit different from when the book was written.Still, the book is an entertaining read into the world of figured skating in the '90's. The book introduces us to personalities and gives us some background on the famous personalities of that time period. It's interesting to contemplate that today's prominent figure skaters were just starting out when this book was written. In that regard, this book provides an interesting look at how today's prominent skaters were raised in the world of figure skating."},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"I thought Christine Brennan brought the lives of the skaters she followed in this book to life in such an interesting way that the book was hard to put down. I found myself totally involved, even knowing the outcome of some of the events she covered, I still was fascinated! Great job. Great book for anyone who loves this sport!"},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"I had heard opinions on this book that went all the way across the board, and decided I should just read it for myself. I loved it! As a person on the outside, a figure skating fan, it was very enjoyable to read about some of the behind-the-scenes activities and interactions between skaters and their families, coaches, choreographers, costume designers, and even agents. I would recommend this book to other fans of figure skating."},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"Christine Brennan had the ultimate opportunity to write an inside report of the world of figure skating, but instead she wrote a book full of sensationalistic journalism.Opinions are passed as fact in Brennan's morphed view of figure skating. Unlike Beverley Smith, Brennan did not have much experience in figure skating when she began writing this book, and it shows. Her &quot;revealing journey&quot; is one of gossip and stretching the truth.Beverley Smith's &quot;Talking Figure Skating&quot; is the best alternative to &quot;Inside Edge.&quot; Smith respects the sport much more than Brennan, and she is considerably less biased and opinionated.Take everything you read in &quot;Inside Edge&quot; with a large dose of salt."},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"I think Brennan did a very good job of exposing everyone to a side of figure skating that is not glamorous, victourious, or triumphant. Inside Edge gives people a whole new perspective of skating, a realistic side, not just the &quot;dazzling under bright lights&quot; part. From this book I learned many important, interesting things about all the famous skaters, facts that are true because they are told from the skaters' points of view. For example, the fact that many figure skaters are homosexual had never occurred to me until I read the book. However, I think Brennan was just a bit biased, especially when she expressed her opinions about major, international competitions. At times like these she could have refrained from being so overly negative. But overall, I think Inside Edge is worth reading, and will not be easily forgotten."},{"Title":"Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey into the Secret World of Figure Skating","review":"See the starts of Michelle Kwan. Become aware of AIDS and the skating community. Go behind the scenes with Nancy Kerrigan. Learn how the skater's season begins and ends in this fabulous book.Any skating fan will love this book.

She is to be to commended for asking the hard questions that produced chapters which looked at the darkside of skating. Though the glittering illusion was slightly tarnished by her writing, I am not disullisioned. I can know watch the sport with greater appreciation for the struggles and sacrifices that skaters make in order to become elite athletes."},{"Title":"Instant Italian Vocabulary Builder (Instant Vocabulary)","review":"Recently my wife and I were planning a two week, once in a lifetime trip though Italy. We were very excited to see the entire country but realized that communicating might be difficult as we got into the Tuscan countryside. With this in mind we picked up a copy of Instant Italian Vocabulary Builder.Although my wife and I had a bit of Spanish and Italian while in college, we didn't retain nearly enough of the language and its structure to feel comfortable on our trip. We each spent some of our free time reading though this book and were simply amazed at how much we retained. This method of learning worked wonders for the both of us and we commented to each other on our trip that we feel we learned more in the short time spent with this book than in our entire college experience.This level of comfort with the language helped make our honeymoon a truly unforgettable experience. It allowed us to put our concerns aside and to enjoy our time in the Tuscan wine country. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a fast and easy way to pick up the Italian language. Simply the best learning tool I've used while studying a foreign language."},{"Title":"Instant Italian Vocabulary Builder (Instant Vocabulary)","review":"I never thought it could be that easy. I have tried classes and and other textbooks in the past. Tom has really discovered a way for people who find learning languages challenging, such as myself, to really connect and understand how words and sentances are formed in the Italian language. It not only helps people to understand what is being said, but more importantly enables people to interact in a full on conversation. It has really given me hope from the several years of discouragement I have had trying other teacher's methods.I highly recommend anyone who needs and/or wants to learn or expand thier knowledge of foriegn language to order this version.It is easy and understandable for all levels. The most effective method I have ever read.Great job."},{"Title":"Instant Italian Vocabulary Builder (Instant Vocabulary)","review":"I don't often write reviews, but I had to this time. The book in question is pretty worthless. I was very disappointed. In fact I will never buy a book from this series again. Basically, it is a list of words in Italian that are almost the exact same as what the word would be in English but with different suffixes. For example, the english version is important but the Italian version is importante. The English version is incredible the Italian version incredibile. In other words you can guess what the word means anyway. Don't buy the book.

Serena hastened to her sister's side, but no sooner had she arrived at the vast prarie mansion than her heart was filled with foreboding. Sybelle was strangely distant, and Morning Star Ranch was a house of dark intrigue: hidden gold...drugged wine...a pond whose black, glassy surface concealed a hideous crime...and a drink-crazed wrangler who didn't care which of the twins he sacrificed to his own desperate scheme.The more Serena learned, the more danger she was in.

Sybelle's adopted brother, Bazz, is nice, charming and attentive to Serena, but she knows that he and Sybelle keeping secrets from her. They also tell her horrible stories about Bazz's half-brother Quinn. So when Quinn arrives Serena can't help but hate him. And Quinn thinks that Serena has the same character as her sister, so he doesn't like her either. It is not until tragedy strikes that they realize the truth about each other.I love it when the people in a love story don't like each other at first, it makes for a fun read.

Serena hastened to her sister's side, but no sooner had she arrived at the vast prairie mansion than her heart filled with foreboding. Sybelle was strangely distant, and Morning Star Ranch was a house of dark intrigue...The more Serena learned, the more danger she was in. And unless she dared to place her trust in handsome, dark-eyed Quinn, she had no chance of escaping the fate that awaited her on the night of the summer solstice...a fate too terrible even to imagine.\\""},{"Title":"Sister to the Sioux (Second Edition): The Memoirs of Elaine Goodale Eastman, 1885-1891","review":"While I found the subject of this book very intriguing, much of the actual writing was dry and factual, without enough human emotion or interesting detail.Elaine Goodale-Eastman was a teacher to the Sioux and lived among the native people. She was sympathetic to the traditions and needs of the Native American people. She wrote this memoir many years later, and she seems to have based it on her notes from the time period and her memories. I think this book would have been better written closer to the time she spent teaching the Sioux, perhaps there would have been a little more detail to her stories.I still feel that Elaine's life was fascinating, and I find encouragement in what she was able to accomplish in her lifetime. The story of her life is inspiring, but this book was far from my favorite."},{"Title":"Scottish Exodus: Travels Among a Worldwide Clan","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for my husband who is a member of the McLeod Clan, and he hasn't completely finished reading it yet. The book arrived quickly and was well-packaged. It has a lot of information about the McLeod clan that we didn't know before. The purpose of the book is to trace the McLeods who have left Scotland, why they left, and where they ended up all over the world. The author has actually traveled to interview many of these people in person which makes the book more than just a dry listing of statistics. Would recommend the book to any member of the McLeod clan."},{"Title":"A Dancing Star: Inspirations to Guide and Heal","review":"A book which delivers the title.

Sufi aphorism."},{"Title":"Supership","review":"Originally serialized in the New Yorker in the wake of the early 1970's energy crisis, this book is an in-depth history and analysis of the biggest moving objects ever built: oil supertankers.A quarter mile long, half a football field wide, and with several cavernous tanks each the size of a cathedral, these behemoths carry enough crude oil to meet the energy needs of a small city for a year. Their small crews and giant payloads maximize shipping company profits, but their sheer size is no guarantee against the elements and mismanagement, two factors which, when coupled with fundamental structural instability, have caused scores of sinkings and spills since the first supertankers were built in response to the temporary closing of the Suez Canal in 1956.Written over a decade before the Exxon Valdez catastrophe, the author already had plenty of disasters to cite as examples of these ships' inherent unreliabilty and inevitable environmental impacts. But worse than the headline-grabbing collisions, explosions, and slicks is the day-to-day trickle of deadly pollution these monster ships leave in their wakes-over a million tons annually casually released into oceans during routine cleaning, bilge pumping, and emergency dumping in stormy seas. Leaking, cracking, colliding, exploding, sinking, these VLCCs (Very Large Crude Carriers) are apt symbols for the wasteful societies whose heedless practices first made supertankers a \\"necessity.\\"Mostert takes as his frame of reference a voyage he took aboard the 220,000 ton Ardshiel in 1973 and his appraisal of his ship and the supertanker fleet is objective and even-handed, delivered in a gripping style that avoids sensationalism. The maritime history is fascinating, the statistics startling, and the litany of mishap appalling. But more than an eyewitness account of these outsized ships and the overworked and underqualified crews that run them, Supership is a stunning expose of the oil business and the naked greed which drives it without moral compass.This book is due an updated edition."},{"Title":"Supership","review":"I loved this book. It deals with many things, such as how these ships were built, and why. It also gives these massive vessels a human face, because the author actually trvelled aboard a supertanker, and he gives an exellent account of the voyage, as seen through his eyes, and those of the crew. A person reading this book will find themselves wondering how some shipowners are even allowed to operate at all, or how things have gotten the way they have. He raises many hard questions concerning flags of convenience, the environment, and ship safety. If you are into ships, the sea, or just want a good read, this is well worth getting hold of."},{"Title":"Supership","review":"I eagerly looked forward to reading this book, but found it to be not so much about the functioning of a supertanker (VLCC or ULCC) but about the environmental impact of oil in the oceans. Don't misunderstand me, I am all in favor of strict safety and anti-pollution measures, which are generally better today than when this book was written thirty years ago; I just was expecting that this book would discuss technical matters and life onboard to a greater extent than it did, and be more balanced in its appraisal of the shipping industry.The book is shrill and alarmist. It dwells on the negative impact of oil in the ocean, decries the evils of Japan, Western Europe, and especially the United States, and their appetite for oil, and notes anecdotal information like that Africa and Asia use less oil per capita than the industrialized west. Of course what he never mentions is that those same Western societies at the time of publication produced an overwhelming majority of the world's goods. This is a book that wants to be &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, while trying to appeal to those with a technical interest in shipping.I am interested in literature on the environmental impact of tankers, and particularly recommend &quot;Black Tide&quot; about the 'Torrey Canyon' as an excellent example of tanker related, balanced environmental reporting. What I don't like is a book that is ostensibly fair and balanced trying to sell me a shrill alarmist position that is anything other than balanced. In the book, for instance, Mostert goes on at length about studies that show that the oceans will be completely lifeless due to oil pollution in 25-30 years. That time has now past, and where marine species have decreased, the cause has overwhelmingly been over-fishing, not oil, with exceptions around refineries and spill areas. My point here isn't that oil is good for the oceans, but that his personal disdain for supertankers won't decrease the need for them: the solutions are in the disciplines of systems safety and crew training, with legislative assistance from governments and insurers, not in ridding the world of the tankers. Long term, of course, alternatives to oil will be found that will relegate these ships to the scrapper's torch, which is the good news; on that I am sure that Mostert would agree with me. I am for increased regulation and monitoring of tankers and agree totally with Mostert that the bulk of the problem is with ships flying flags of convenience (especially Liberia.) There is no question that these mammoth ships are capable of untold destruction, and for that reason I believe that the oil companies and the insurers (especially Lloyd's) need to carefully monitor not only the ships themselves, but the adequacy and training of the crews and the regulations and enforcement actions of the flags they sail under. If insurers make it less economically viable to use flags of convenience due to higher accident rates, safety can only then be improved.There is good information in this book, particularly details of tanker losses and casualties, and also in the history of tankers and oil importation/exportation, but there is a grim hysteria about the horrible fate supertankers hold for the world, virtually none of which has actually come to pass.I would very much like a new and revised edition to examine the current situation today, and to accurately summarize the strengths and fallacies of the original. If you are looking for a book on the functioning of tankers, look elsewhere. If you want a balanced book on the environmental impact of tankers, try &quot;Black Tide&quot;. If you want a look at modern (cargo) shipping as it exists today, try &quot;Colombo Bay.&quot; If you want a shrill, alarmist tome that accepts sources uncritically that further its cause, but is quick to dismiss evidence contrary to the opinion of the author, this is your book."},{"Title":"Supership","review":"Mr. Newland pointed out that the book was published in 1975 and that Ultra Large Crude Carriers or ULCCs which is the official industry term for a supertanker, have probably gotten bigger. Indeed he is correct in his assumption. The world's largest ship right now (which also makes it the largest man-made moving object on the planet) is the Jahre Viking weighs a monumental 564,763 deadweight tons; has a length of 458.45 meters (approximately one third of a mile); and is driven by a 37,300 Kilowatt turbine.Information can be found at ....As Mr. Newland anticipated, the Jahre Viking was launched in 1976, one year after the book Supership was published. The Jahre Viking was built by Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd of Japan and is currently operated by Jahre-Wallem of Norway, one of the largest ship management companies in the world.It goes without saying that if an accident were to happen to a ship of this size, the environmental consequences would be catastrophic. Of course, since 9-11-2001, the terrorist threat has added another dimension to the dilemma. One would hope that security measures have been re-evaluated, however I am not hopeful. As of this writing today, we here in the USA just saw a 15-year old boy take a small private Cessna aircraft, fly it past one of our most secure military bases -- McDill Air Force Base in Florida -- and crash it into a high-rise building owned by Bank of America. If that is how lax our security is on our own home turf and only three months after 9-11, I shudder to think what the security is like in international waters on the open seas.I must agree with Mr. Newland that a 2nd edition of this book is needed and perhaps, now more than ever."},{"Title":"Supership","review":"I first read Supership in the late 1970's and did not reread it until this year (2001). The second time around made a much deeper impression on me, and I found it to be - for the most part - as riveting and terrifying as a horror novel. I only wish Mostert's tale was fiction.The book describes the pros and cons of supertankers, which I'm sure have only grown since the behemoths described from 30 years ago. Mostert is no muckraker, and he does humanize the crew in good and appropriate detail (they are individuals; not monsters, not corporate automatons), but the overriding feeling I got in reading the book was dismay and helpless frustration. The impact that these ships, and the oil-consuming culture that we take for granted, has resulted in more ecological devastation than we can know. The mysteries of ocean currents are one thing that make the range of oil spills and leaks impossible to know, but the way the earth depends on the numerous lifeforms in the sea are another. Like Rachel Carson a decade earlier, Mostert is a thinking and balanced environmental reporter, and he knows the sea. I found him to be an excellent writer, using the structure of the Ardshiel's basic Europe-Gulf-Europe round trip to order the book but spinning numerous side stories related to each stage of the trip to cast light on various historical and environmental issues. It held my interest and terrified me at the same time.The fact that 27 years have passed since its writing seemed like a mixed blessing. On one hand, the earth has survived continued oil spills of huge proportions (the book makes you feel that mankind would not survive the 20th century). On the other hand, the spills and tanker volume have only increased since the early 1970's and who knows how much worse things have gotten.Supership is a great read and I would hope that a 2nd edition is in the works!"},{"Title":"Lightning (McGraw-Hill advanced physics monograph series)","review":"First published in 1969 and thus out of date due to the extensive research in lightning since then, this book can nevertheless serve as an introduction to the knowledge that was known at the time of publication. My interest in the book stemmed from a sideline interest in ball lightning, a phenomenon which I have never observed, but the accounts of it have some peculiarities from a physics standpoint that are very interesting. Unfortunately, the author only discusses ball lightning in one of the Appendices, and the discussion is very short. The author does discuss in this context the St. Elmo's fire phenomenon.Even though the book is out of date, it could still serve as a source for homework problems for an instructor teaching a course in electromagnetic theory, whether in physics or engineering. In addition, the author has more recent books on lightning that could be consulted in addition to this one. Lightning is a great example of an electromagnetic phenomenon that everyone is familiar with, and that has lots of interesting physics, some of the understanding of which is still a hot topic of research.

It is a classic in my eyes.This book includes and introduction to lightning on subjects such as thunderclouds, the steeped leader, the return stroke, the dart leader, discharges and other lightning forms.There are some photographs as well. These range from early studies, the Boy Camera, and photographs from countries such as South Africa, the U.S., and some more recent photo's from Switzerland.You will also learn about electric and magnetic field measurements, which includes field changes due to cloud to ground lightning, discharge lowering charge to earth.There is some history in this book on theories; experimental techniques and the lightning spectroscopy; thunder and the discharge processes."},{"Title":"Lightning (McGraw-Hill advanced physics monograph series)","review":"The second book I ordered in the series from Martin Uman.

The book begins with all the major players doing their thing the night before. SWAT paramedic Anna Carson comes to Courage Bay to begin her new job, assailed by her memories of a love affair gone wrong. Five years ago, she had left Courage Bay and her engagement to Flint Mauro behind to attend SWAT training in Washington, DC. Anna loved Flint, but he wanted her to pursue a safer career if they married, and refused to see that he was squashing Anna's ambitions. Now, Flint is SWAT commander in Courage Bay, still missing Anna, and unaware she's back. We also meet city council clerk Lorna Sinke, sure she's about to be fired by an antagonistic council member, for whom she has plans. Kenny Reese is a thug who lures a sad old man, Lee Harper, into a plan he figures will have him set for life.Flint and Anna realize they'll be working together the following morning in a meeting with the police chief. No sooner has the dust settled when they get a call. Kenny and Lee have taken Lorna Sinke, her poison cookies, and the city council hostage, along with a prestigious judge. Shots are fired, and Lorna Sinke takes one in the chest. Kenny gets shot in the arm and demands a doctor be sent in. Flint and Anna pose as a doctor and nurse and get inside. What follows are several tense hours of Flint and Anna trying to stabilize the injured, stop Kenny from shooting anyone, and keep Lee from detonating the bomb taped to his chest. During this time, Flint and Anna examine their feelings for one another, and when things get hairy, they really begin to realize what's important in life. They work out their problems and achieve a compromise, and then ride off into the sunset.While satisfying enough, the book lacked spark, and though the scenario was fraught with tension, I always felt safely insulated from it. Also, our highly trained hero and heroine are kind of wimpy when the heat is on. I know they're supposed to be realistic, but I would hope a SWAT-trained woman could fight better than I can. Not the most explosive Courage Bay adventure, but better than some."},{"Title":"Crossfire (Code Red (Harlequin))","review":"I enjoyed reading this book the author kept my interest durig the whole book. it is well written and the charcters were very good. the reader kept me wantint to keep reading. she kept my attention during the entire book.

It features Gordianus the Finder as the gumshoe. Gordianus a down-on-the-heels Roman detective is hired by Cicero an up-and-coming republican, lawyer/politician to gather evidence proving the innocence of a murder suspect he's defending. Gordianus's footwork unveils a not just the murder, but a political intrigue involving the highest levels of the dictator Sulla's regime.Whodunnits are pretty formulaic. This one reminds me a lot of the best of Ellroy mixing murder, money, and politics. The spin of setting it in ancient Rome makes it more interesting. Saylor writes well. His prose is tight, and graphic. The obligatory gratuitous sex is especially well done. His violence and action passages are just a little weak.

Normally mysteries are not my favorite kind of books, but this book definitely attracted my attention."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Roman Blood, the first of Steven Saylor's Sub Rosa series of novels, introduces Gordianus the Finder and his family, fictional characters who become increasingly memorable and claim a hold on our affections and sympathetic concern as they interact throughout the series with many famous historical characters, Julius Caesar, Pompey The Great, Marc Antony, Cicero, and Spartacus being the best known. The lawlessness of a great city - Rome - without a police force; the brutal treatment of slaves as chattel; the political intrigues and assassinations - all are faithfully portrayed in historically accurate and authentic detail. But perhaps the most remarkable aspect of these novels is their overlay of modern liberal values represented by the fictional narrator, who manumits (frees) and marries his Egyptian concubine, Bethesda, adopts a street urchin and a slave as his sons, understands and accepts the independence and sovereignty of women, reveres and serves the truth as much as Diogenes, and evinces a genuine religious piety. The characters are memorably drawn and individuated, and the finder's daughter, whose patronymic name Gordiana is shortened to Diana, is arguably the most appealing daughter in literature since Cordelia. Like all works of a master spirit, these books provide an edifying education, with recognizable allusions to ancient as well as Elizabethan literature, and they contain flashes of sardonic humor appropriate to the anatomy of the human condition that they reveal. They are among the very best of modern recreations of that peculiar combination of greatness and squalor that was ancient Rome."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"This was a very interesting read, in which the setting of the Roam Republic in the first century BC really comes alive.

Gordianus ... just as entertaing as always"},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I came to this book through a recent reading of Mr. Saylor's The Seven Wonders. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, having had some reservations about the believability of Gordianus the soon-to-be Finder's abilities in some of the mysteries from this most recent novel. Fortunately, this turned out not to be an issue in Roman Blood. This is an excellent novel.In fact, believability is probably Saylor's strongest suit here. Based in part on Cicero's own writings, Saylor clearly knows his stuff when it comes to ancient Rome. His descriptions of the city: its homes, its people and their attitudes seem to be an accurate, if at times colorful, recreation of the times. In addition, other than escaping almost certain death in a few situations, nothing Gordianus achieves here seems beyond the ability of a normal, observant man (unlike some of his work as a younger man in The Seven Wonders). If Gordianus' attitudes seem a bit more enlightened than a typical Roman of his day; well, that is the price we often have to pay in historical novels for the protagonist who is meant to be our eyes and ears.Moreover, the mystery here is very well done. The basic plot is straightforward. The young Cicero hires Gordianus to help him win the acquittal of a man accused of killing his father. As a \\"finder\\" it is Gordianus' job to do the legwork, to find out what really happened in this murder and provide Cicero with the information that will be the basis of the defense. What makes Gordianus so effective at his job, beyond the fact that he is generally observant and knowledgeable, is that he actually cares about finding the truth in the face of so many who are out to hide it or simply don't care what the truth is.The bulk of the novel is a direct, albeit well-done, historical mystery. It is the last section, when Cicero's defense begins and the case draws to its conclusion that lifts this novel up out of the ordinary. Layers of intrigue that Gordianus only suspects are revealed and there are multiple surprises in store for the reader. In these reveals there is also a respect for the way things often actually work that is rare in a mystery like this. It is refreshing.If I have a complaint about this book, it is that my edition of it is printed entirely in a small, bold type. It was quite distracting at first and took some getting used to.That, however, is relatively unimportant. It is easy to see from Roman Blood why Gordianus became such a popular character. I don't know if the other novels in the series stand up as well as this one. (I know at least one doesn't, though knowing the origins of Bethesda and some of the back story coming into this novel is nice.) On the other hand, I am quite interested in seeing what else Mr. Saylor has done with this character."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Roman Blood is an excellent read.

But this book is so much more than Philip Marlowe in a toga. More than anything else, it is seductive, both in its rich characterizations and in its storytelling. Steven Saylor draws the reader into the world of the Ancient Romans in a sensual way, painting vivid pictures, and strongly bringing that world alive.Sextus Roscius is murdered, his son stands accused, and Cicero, the man who will become known as the great orator, is a young advocate who takes on the case--the first big trial of his career. He hires Gordianus the Finder, the Ancient Roman equivalent of a detective, to ferret out the truth. This search takes Gordianus on a journey through the political and social intrigues of the day, and through the twisting heart of human nature.The intrigue is fascinating, the implications profound, there are flashes of wit, and an erotic thread weaving throughout. The relationship between Gordianus and his Hebrew-Egyptian concubine, Bethesda, is funny, erotic, and tender, and provides a wonderful backbone to the book.

The story kept me entertained by the well thought out investigations and storytelling. I felt like I was transform back to the time of ancient rome with the descriptive locations of the city such as buildings and monuments. Even the conclusion had me surprise by its ending. Overall if you are looking for a good mystery check out roman blood you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"The writer creates good characters with interesting feelings and truth to them. The plot is interesting. However, in this book at least, he is entirely too talky. I found myself skimming the endless details of every stone in every street and stopping where I found quotation marks beginning. Too verbose and very fussy. The book could have been done in half the pages and been less irritating. Also, although the other characters can be interesting, the protagonist is himself rather watery and undefined. But my biggest criticism is that the book is totally humorless. Now that won't bother everyone. But it won't do for me."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Saylor starts off his rollercoaster-ride Roma Sub Rosa mystery series with a bang! Gordianus is called upon by young and ambitious Cicero to help solve a patricide murder case. He is reluctant. But as soon as he starts to peel away layers he finds startling facts about the murder but also puts his life in grave danger! In this fun first entry, Saylor entertains and also seductively educates. Ever present behind the fast-paced story is Ancient Italy - a character unto itself. Civil war looms. Politicians scheme. Roman blood is spilled. Murderers are revealed.Read the Roma Sub Rosa books in proper order (but get \\"The House of the Vestal Virgin\\" next. Its a collection of short stories that take place next chronologically)."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I'm immediately biased in favor of any book that is set in Ancient Rome. That having been established, this was a highly entertaining read.Our protagonist, Gordianus the Finder, is a middle class Roman citizen perched precariously on the edge of financial ruination. I particularly enjoyed his observations of the great men of his day. Cicero (AKA Chick Pea) is one of the major characters in this book, and the author does a fine job of painting a picture of what life in his household may have been like. Sulla the dictator is featured less prominently in the story, but the danger he represents is palpable throughout the book.The book features shockingly brutal descriptions of murders, rapes, and the punishments doled out for such crimes. The action moves along nicely, and makes for a quick, satisfying read.Read it! You'll like it!"},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I thoroughly enjoined this book. Most historical fiction of Rome and Greece revolves around only the greatest kings and generals of the age. This novel with its man in the street protagonist however paints a more intimate and realistic picture of Rome.I found it a little odd that Gordianus has absolutely no familial relations mentioned in this book and no real social relations to speak of either. I felt that Gordianus' familial/social disconnet brought a bit of unbelievability to this book.As far as I could tell, this novel otherwise appears to free of anachronisms yet completely palpable to the modern reader.Despite the fact that with the last 100 pages this book suddenly shifted into slow motion (the second visit to Electra, or the tearing down of the charred house, etc. \\"yawn\\") all in all, I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"What a pleasure it was to read this book when it was first published. I have long enjoyed reading Roman history, and to read more of that history, in the form of detective fiction, was exciting and fulfilling. Gordianus the Finder is a sympathetic character: intelligent, but not a Lord Peter Wimsey or Nero Wolfe. Gordianus makes errors in judgement, but not too many. He questions people, observes and listens, and wheels are set in motion in his brain. He puts II and II together and gets IV.In this novel, I liked learning about Roman families and inheritance laws, about how slaves were treated, about Cicero, and about the period in Roman history (a volatile period) that would lead up to Caesar becoming emperor. The mystery, the motive, the clues, all are very well done. My only complaint is a minor one: that at times the information put into the book reads like nonfiction. I'm happy to say that I feel Saylor corrected this by his third or fourth Gordianus novel. Read Roman Blood, the first, and you may very well be hooked and read all the others."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I enjoyed Roman Blood when it was first published in the early '90s and just this week pulled it off the shelf for a re-read. In these two decades I've read many other novels set in ancient Rome and so was curious to see how well the first book in Saylor's Sub Rosa series had held up. The answer is: very well!Through both readings, the things I most appreciated about Roman Blood (other than the mystery, which was compelling) were Saylor's fine writing and characterizations. Gordianus is a delight: funny, earthy, and shrewd. A take-no-crap kind of guy and a great figure to lead a series. Both Cicero and Tiro are nicely drawn, but I especially enjoyed Tiro. Saylor brings to life this man who was at once a slave and his master's best friend. It's a fascinating relationship.And, as others have pointed out, the historical details of this book and others in the series are rich and accurate. You really feel you're back in Rome, ca the first century BC. Anyone who loves this period,as I do, is certain to enjoy this book. I've now read two of the series (one twice) and plan to go back for more."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"This book was actually really interesting. Of course it seems a bit strange for the book to be about a mystery in ancient Roman times, but that's what so great about it. It's amazing how Steven Saylor was able to keep the reader's attention and still keep the book based on the ancient times. Most books these days have a lot of either present action or future action in it, but this book didn't. Instead it had past action which was very interesting. It was great how Saylor could give a book in this time period so many different twists and turns. Yes some of the terms in the book were slightly out of the ancient times, but for the most part all of it was based in that time period. If you love mystery books you will absolutely love this book. It's like a mystery inside of a mystery. I would definitely recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Roman Blood is a fun little mystery set in the last days of the Roman Republic. The book is modeled on the actual killing of Sextus Roscius and Cicero's defense of his son for the crime. Saylor has taken many a liberty with the actual story, and embellished off what is unknown about the incident and by doing so he has created a fun and diverting mystery that does an excellent job of brining ancient Rome to life and of introducing Gordianus the Finder, the sleuth who will star in the rest of this series.The book is better written then the average mystery and the historical figures who make appearances (including Cicero and his slave Tiro, both in staring roles) are well drawn and believable. I could have done without some of the forced humor, but the accurate portrayal of Rome, warts and all, make this a worthwhile read for anyone interested in a decent mystery or ancient Rome."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"It would be easy, as some reviewers have, to find fault with Roman Blood; it is by no means a perfect novel. Nevertheless, I found it to be a wonderful read, bringing Ancient Rome to life in a way no other book - fiction or non-fiction - has. It is one of those most delightful of books - the ones one puts down only with great reluctance. Absolutely worth reading."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I thought that Roman Blood was a pretty good book. I liked it because it was a mystery and mystery novels are usually the only books that I find interesting. My favorite character was the main character Gordianus the Finder. To me, he was like an Ancient Roman version of Sherlock Holmes. He seems to be more of the wise and curios type, although at some times he was a little boring. I also liked the novel because it gave me a much better depiction of the Ancient Roman lifestyle. It went into great detail about the streets and buildings which gave me a better image of Rome and its people."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I thought Roman Blood was a good book to read if you wanted to learn more about Rome's history and how they lived their lives. Reading this book has taught me a lot about the Roman lifestyle that I would not have learned in a Social Studies book. Although some parts in this book were a little boring there were still some good events. My favorite part in this book is when Tiro and Gordanius were walking and they came across a fight between the gladiators. I thought it was interesting how Tiro wanted to stop and be a wittness because someone was lying dead in the street. I give this book 4 stars because it really relates to Roman history more than a Social Studies Book or a aritcle you would read in the paper."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Gordianus the Finder --- a Roman detective with a lust for the truth, hard drinking, and his slave-girl Bathsheba --- is hired by Cicero to unearth the facts behind a mysterious killing. Gentleman farmer Sextus Roscius is accused of killing his estranged father, but the truth of the matter may reveal corruption not only in the man's own family, but in the noblest and richest families of Rome; the murder may involve even the dictator Sulla himself. This is a superb historical detective novel. Gordianus is a Roman Matt Scudder, a hard-living survivor with no special interests or abilities except a deep need for the truth and, possibly, a liking for rough justice. He's an empathetic everyman with foibles and flaws, always a must in a detective. Saylor's scholarship seems excellent; his Rome is vivid and picturesque. You get a sharp portrait of Roman life in 80 BC, from the street gutters to the gangs to the games of trigon to the slave economy. Cicero in particular is brought to life in fine detail. The book's plot is convoluted and opaque, but in a satisfying way. All together, a promising start to a mystery series with a very solid historical background."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I enjoyed ROMAN BLOOD, mainly the characters, aristocrats, patricians and slaves. But the plot moving along left some things to be desired, such as what happened to Eco's mother. And it also kind of plodded along, the ending was good. I will continue reading Mr. Saylors books. I very much liked the main character."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome!I love the genre of mysteries in a historical context and have been looking forward to starting this series. I don't have a tremendous understanding of ancient Rome, outside of Shakespeare plays -- primarily Julius Caesar -- which actually were based on Plutarch's histories.I'd had an idealized view of senators dressed in bedsheets heroically conspiring -- sometimes in sotto voice -- to murder dictators.I'd suspected that Saylor's version -- which is set in B.C. 80 and thereby pre-dates Julius Caesar's rise by a few years -- would be a little more true-to-life, and so it appears.It's a little hard to get comfortable in a setting that might be said to resemble your own in some respects -- but where slavery and the presence of slaves is an aspect of everyday life.It's a disturbing presence that I never get completely used to, and yet Saylor is able to nicely balance that perspective with descriptions of some of Rome's glories and ingenuities, as well. Presumably, that's a running theme throughout this series.This novel -- apparently based on a real-life case narrated by Cicero -- involves the defense -- in a Roman equivalent of a criminal trial -- of a man accused of parricide.The unique means of execution that the defendant is facing -- applicable specifically to parricide offenders -- might be said to be slightly more barbarous than lethal injections and would probably not pass 8th Amendment scrutiny today. I decline to describe it here.Certainly, the action here is an ever-present reminder of just how commonplace man's inhumanity to man has been throughout recorded human history. Children, having even fewer moral scruples than adults, have a remarkable capacity for cruelty, even if they don't have the means to carry out evil intentions as effectively. One scene in particular involving cruelty perpetrated by a group of boys suggests what we already know -- that this inhumanity will persist over time.Gordianus The Finder seems to be civilization's first private detective, though he is not described in so many words by his contemporaries in this setting. He's Phillip Marlowe reset in Rome, circa 80 B.C., except with a slave/common law wife. Notwithstanding his means of having acquired her, their relationship seems to be pretty much the same as that of any married couple.The name \\"Bethesda\\" is slightly disconcerting, improperly suggestive as it is of a naval setting in Maryland.But Gordianus himself has sort of the same doggedness and desire for justice -- by means public or private -- that distinguish the 20th century hard-boiled detective in fictitious works. It's fun to watch him work his way from Rome -- taking him to places that include both the seamier side of the Subura and the fabulous Forum Romanum -- to the rural towns of Narnia and Ameria -- and back to Rome as he tracks his case down.As a criminal defense attorney, I'm intrigued by just how familiar the practice of the profession -- and that of the prosecutor -- in ancient Rome seems to me personally. At the time this novel is set, Cicero is only starting to become renowned for his eloquence, and he pretty much retains Gordianus as his private investigator for the purpose of enabling him to mount his defense of the accused.At one point, Gordianus learns of a pretty shocking series of moral offenses committed by the accused and when he tells Cicero of them, he receives in return a blank stare and a reprimand to the effect that this is irrelevant to the defense that he is mounting. Very familiar-sounding indeed.From an institutional standpoint, the action is set against the backdrop of the rule of the dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla, which does become relevant to the unfolding of the plot.But my primary reason for a relatively indifferent rating of a novel that promised so much more -- and that certainly interests me in the succeeding books within the series -- is that the author, Stephen Saylor, allows himself to become too bogged down in his grand store of knowledge of his subject, which he can't resist showing off at the expense of the plot.He allows the climax of the novel to be turned into a mini-biography of The Life and Times of Sulla, and the political satire delivered in a party setting by Sulla's transvestite lover is hopeless. This much detail simply wasn't necessary to finish the story.Equally hopeless is Saylor's afterword where he states that he has taken clues from a historian who writes from the perspective of a survivor of the Republic of McCarthy, Nixon and Reagan, et. alia. Oh?Hopefully, this is an aberration and Saylor doesn't actually intend for his Roman novels to become veils or platforms for some sort of left-wing edictum.It is, after all, the tale and not he who tells it. And one of the heroes of Roman Blood, Cicero, was a dedicated and principled conservative."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Steven Saylor's historical mystery is a good read for fans of the genre, especially those attracted to Roman history.This is the story of Gordianus, a finder (private detective), hired by a youngish Cicero who is defending a man charged with the horrific crime of patricide. The more Gordianus delves into the mystery, of course, the more it unravels until it becomes a tale that touches even the emperor himself.A skilled writer, Saylor takes the reader on a tour through Roman daily life that most will enjoy. His eye for detail is superb, albeit wordy... There are a few occasions where, just as he's picking up the pace, you're thrust into page after page of too-much narrative, as if our narrator Gordianus has all the time in the world to tell his story (which he does not).By the end, however, Saylor finishes the story with enough flair to make you want to see what Gordianus does on his next case. Luckily, this is just the first of a series of Gordianus the Finder books so the history-mystery fan will be able to sate his desire quickly -- and frequently."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I've been reading a lot of mystery novels lately so I'm rating this one in comparison to others. What it has going for it: historical data, humour, sex (straight and gay), and strong sense of location What it lacks: craft, clever dialogue Still, it's an enjoyable weekend read but don't read it if you have better things to do."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I have probably read only a handful of detective fiction in my entire middle-aged life. The genre never really appealed to me. But I've always been crazy about the Roman Empire, being a life-long fan of movie epics like SPARTACUS, QUO VADIS, BEN HUR and CLEOPATRA. I got a big kick out of ROMAN BLOOD. It's a detective story set in ancient Rome. Gordianus the Finder is a wonderful character. Who knows whether there ever was such a thing as a \\"finder\\" back in those days? It doesn't really matter. In Gordianus, Steven Saylor has created a brilliant device that allows the reader, through a myriad of interesting details, to feel that he actually IS in ancient Rome. When we first encounter Gordianus, he lives in a crumbling villa with his slave woman Bethesda (whom he eventually manumits and marries) and has a hangover from too much wine the previous evening. ROMAN BLOOD is the case that starts Gordianus on an illustrious career as a Roman private eye, because this is the case on which he meets Cicero. Their association coincides with Cicero's rise from obscurity to celebrity. Gordianus' exploits are set against actual historical events and over the multi-volume series Gordianus matures physically and emotionally, prospers in his career, marries and has children (who grow up to become Roman citizens). This all occurs during what may have been Rome's most turbulent period, when the Republic was supplanted by the Empire. ROMAN BLOOD is highly entertaining historical fiction. I learned a lot from it, too.I'm no judge of mysteries. I have read few other mysteries to compare it to. Whodunit did surprise me, however. I really enjoyed ROMAN BLOOD and have read the next three volumes in this series. I usually save these books for when I have to travel. They're good paperbacks to read while waiting in an airport or flying long distances. Time passes very quickly in Gordianus' company. It's not wasted time, either. There's a lot to ponder in these books."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I was a little disappointed by this book as it had been highly recommended to me by someone who knew I enjoyed Lindsey Davis's Falco books. Given that Mr. Saylor chose to follow Ms Davis's lead by also setting his detective books in Ancient Rome with a private eye as the central character, it's impossible to read this without making comparisons (conscious or unconscious) to the Falco books which are an extremely tough act to follow. Mr. Saylor has certainly done his homework on Ancient Rome and the historical detail is excellent, but I found his characters rather two-dimensional and lifeless. I can cope with most of the characters being essentially unlikable (the Romans really weren't very nice people) but I think one needs to be able to feel more of a connection to the private eye protagonist and despite the story being told in Gordianus's voice I don't think the reader gets to know him or sympathise with him very much. In honesty, I did enjoy the book and found the mystery and its conclusion satisfying, but it suffers greatly in comparison to the Falco series which combines impeccable scholarship with a wonderful dry wit and excellently depicted characters about whom I really wanted to read more."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I gave A Novel of Ancient Rome four stars instead of five because while it was good it wasn't quite as good as other books of this genre. For a historical novel, it paled in comparison to the Chronicles of the Kings series. As a mystery it fared better. I bought this book because a friend highly recommended it. I wasn't disappointed."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I have now read all of Steven Saylor's (SS) books, with Gordianus \\"the Finder\\" as the Hero. As I have said elsewhere, I don't really like mysteries, but in SS's case I will make an exception.SS very cleverly combines the factual history of Caesar's time with fine detective \\"novels\\" - tho' at times one wonders where truth ends and fiction begins. The books are very well researched and well written. SS has a fine pen. Most descriptive too, no doubt SS has \\"done his homework\\" - not only on the history, but the environs and places where the action(s) take place.At times SS does \\"stray\\" a bit, perhaps intending to lead the reader up a garden path, but the plots all gel very well indeed.Tho' the books stand alone individually, it is maybe best to read them in order.Aficionados of Roman history and detective series will be far from disappointed.All highly recommended, overall the series gets 4 stars from me."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I'm a huge fan of historical novels, especially ones set in ancient and medievel times.

Roman Blood did not disappoint. Saylor delivered a great compromise between mystery and history.The plot was satisfyingly complex, containing twists and turns in the search for the killer of Sextus Roscius. It was also well paced and skilfully managed action, intrigue and general Roman life. Saylor definitely captures the brutality of the time with graphic descriptions of parricide, rape, incest, mass murder and slavery.The story had Gordianus travelling all over the city. The narrow alleys of the Subura, tackiness of the brothels, opulence of the Patrician villas and ruthlessness of the inhabitants were vividly brought to life and gave the story a feeling of authenticity.The characters were developed and interesting. Cicero and Tiro as well as the relationship between Gordianus and his concubine, Bethesda were the highlights for me.My only nitpick was some dialogue felt contrived in an attempt to elaborate on an historical event or context. Although, this was not a huge problem as the extra information was usually accurate and relevant.I have already purchased \\"Arms of Nemesis\\" and look forward to continuing the adventures of Gordianus the Finder."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Roman Blood is set against the back drop of actual, well documented events that occured during the rule of Sulla, the Dictator of Rome. Essentially Cicero, then a new and inexperienced lawyer takes employment as the defense lawyer for a man accused of one of the most heinous crimes in Roman law, the crime of patricide. This actually happened and Cicero was able to get the man acquited even though it was generally believed by everyone (including Cicero) that the man was guilty. Thus not much has changed. What goes on in the book however it interesting and the author provides a well executed unfolding of the tale for the pleasure of his audience. I read Roman Blood because I'm interested in the period and in this type of writing. I currently read the Lindsay Davis 'Falco' series and am a fan of the Cadfael series. Because of this I decided to try out Roman Blood. Roman Blood is a much darker tale than most of the 'Falco' stories and Gordianus the Finder is no Falco but that's okay for Gordianus has his own qualities that makes him interesting in his own way. Unfortunately I found myself comparing the two as I read the story and I will admit that my opinion of Roman Blood was coloured by my reading of Falco. While the story was certainly darker in content than I had expected, I had no problem with it. Life is life whether in ancient Rome or two day and all you have to do is to read a newspaper to encounter everything that unfolded in Roman Blood. As I stated, not much has changed...from corrupt politicians and shady lawyers to murder, rape and incest. My big issue with the story was the development of the character of Gordianus the Finder. In the 'Falco' series you learn everything about Falco in the first book, i.e. everything about his family, his military career, his ex-girl friends, his drinking buddy and why he is doing what he is doing. Gordianus is not as well developed and his motives which appear to be solely economic is not that well defined. Still the story is well executed and interesting and I do recommend it to anyone who loves mysteries set in ancient Rome. Give Roman Blood a chance and I think you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Excellent education on Sulla's dictatorship. Saylor really does a good job in making the reader feel like what it might have been like to live in Ancient Rome"},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I have read several of Saylor's books. This book is the first of the &#34;Sub Roma&#34; series and I look forward to reading the rest of the series. I have read a couple of his other books too."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"\\"Roman Blood\\" is not quite a mystery, for any student of Roman history will know the outcome of the matter presented. But it is a wonderful retelling of what happened, and it is full of rich detail and description that bring ancient Rome to life--which makes it an excellent find for historical fiction enthusiasts.Saylor's hero is Gordianus the Finder, a young Roman with a dilapidated house, an insolent Egyptian concubine named Bethesda, and an income gained from 'finding' information. He is hired by an up-and-coming (some say upstart) advocate named Marcus Tullius Cicero, who has just been given a murder case to defend. His client is Sextus Roscius, accused of patricide; if found guilty, his punishment would be one of the most horrific Roman justice could mete out. Gordianus must find out who really killed Roscius's father before the man goes to trial.The investigation leads Gordianus into the Subura, Rome's slum district, and into the rural town of Ameria; it covers sibling rivalry, the hatred between a father and son, and the political corruption of Rome under the dictator Sulla. For Gordianus's findings lead him to one of Sulla's creatures, an ex-slave named Chrysogonus--and Chrysogonus's involvement in the Roscius murder raises the stakes dangerously high for Gordianus, Cicero, and his client.Saylor does a wonderful job of characterization, and his dialogue is pithy without being anachronistic. He portrays Rome as a place half-decayed, half-reborn, with the glittering houses of the upper class juxtaposed against the sewage-splattered streets of the lower-class neighborhoods. And Gordianus's observations are well worth the price of the book--he is a wry, sarcastic narrator, never dull or pedantic.The book does end with a twist that's rather timeworn, but the conclusion makes up for the unsatisfying resolution. There is a definite sense of current threads wrapped up, with new ones just beginning. I not only recommend \\"Roman Blood,\\" but the rest of the Roma Sub Rosa series."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"This book by Saylor has its charm and worth, but it shouldn't be at the top of anyone's reading list. Roman historical fiction are few and far between, so if you like the period, I'd still pick it up. However, if you've read the intense detail and drama of Coleen McCullough's series or the enjoyable twists and turns of Didius Falco's life in Lindsey Davis's series, you may be a tad disappointed. The book is worth reading if you're in between good books, but it's nothing incredible. The mystery is almost a little too obvious at times and the historical &quot;fact&quot; is a little hard to take at times. I didn't find myself latched onto Gordianus the way I did to Didius Falco. Read Lindsey Davis's series before this one."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Gordianus the Finder is a Roman private eye circa 80 BC, who makes a living gathering evidence for the lengthy court cases so beloved of his era. One hot day, he is called to aid a neophyte advocate named Cicero, who is defending a man charged with that most serious of ancient crimes, parricide. The accused will say little in his own defence and hired killers dog the footsteps of all potential witnesses to the crime. The further Gordianus digs into this complex case, the more layers of \\"truth\\" are uncovered -- and the more danger threatens his own household.The plot is well-planned and reasonably fair to those who are familiar with the milieu. The author is plainly fascinated with the era and has done a lot of homework; but this book is uneasily balanced between the genres of historical fiction and crime fiction. I hesitate to mention genre boundaries because in general I don't believe in them; but in this case the reader should be aware that the book is extremely slow-paced for a mystery, and rather clumsy for a historical novel.Some historical novelists are sketchers, some are watercolor artists, some are oil painters -- Saylor is a creator of mosaics, patiently toiling away forever to create the desired image from thousands of little tiles. He's perfectly capable of devoting several paragraphs to a character getting ready for bed, or a landscape, or the exterior of a house; and not just once per book, but multiple times per chapter. In any other writer, I'd conclude that this was a first-time novelist problem, but in Mr. Saylor's case I think it may be his natural style -- I mean, anyone who reads Sallust and Plutarch for fun can't exactly be a fan of stripped-down prose. This quirk is particularly pronounced in the parts of the book which deal with the political background of the time: not only is there a longish biography of Sulla (which reads exactly like the introduction to a Penguin Classic and really spoils the first-person narration -- why would Gordianus have to explain Sulla to anyone of his own era?), but the author devotes twenty pages to the rhetorical flourishes of both prosecution and defense in the murder trial. Personally, I deplore speeches in a novel; and since I was forced to read Cicero as a child, I felt no compunction about skipping these orations after a cursory skim. In passing, I should mention that there is an unusual amount of sex for a historical mystery, but almost no humor.In sum, Mr. Saylor's work is intelligent, well researched, deliberate, and written in thoughtful prose. However, it made my spine itch with impatience throughout -- I kept skipping ahead to find some action, and then forcing myself to go back (but only because I was obligated to review the book; otherwise, I would just have skimmed the whole thing). This book is like creamed spinach: it's unclear whether it's really good, or whether you convince yourself it's good because it's so patently good for you."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I am fascinated by ancient history and enjoy novels that accurately convey the essence of ancient places and people. If a book doesn't get the details right, or if the characters are \\"wrong\\" for the times they are supposedly living in, it just doesn't work for me. So when I say that I found Roman Blood entirely believable, it's the best testimonial I can give.The story is also engrossing and enjoyable. This was my first Gordianus the Finder mystery, but it definitely won't be my last!"},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"\\"Roman Blood\\" was recommended to me by a staffer at the Oak Brook, Illinois, Borders. Not something that I would have chosen of my own accord, I was pleasantly surprised at how decent it turned out to be. There are, to be sure, plenty of clich&eacute;d bits of stagecraft (i.e., wispy linens draped provocatively over sexy women, gladiators described in purely animalistic terms, street scenes that play on our preconceived ideas of ancient licentiousness and filth, etc.), but there is an underlying smartness that propels the narrative and upholds fidelity to the historical record.The first of a series of such novels, \\"Roman Blood\\" is essentially detective fiction - complete with the modern traditions of the genre - shoehorned into the waning days of the ancient Roman Republic. There is plenty of sex and violence to keep things interesting, and a fair dose of political intrigue and history as well. The balance between the demands of the genre and the allure of the mise-en-sc&egrave;ne is expertly rendered. This isn't a difficult or terribly complex book, but it is redeemed in the simple integrity of its execution."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Roman Blood (book one of the Roma Sub Rosa series) by Steven Saylor centers around the real life patricide trial of a country farmer by the name of Sextus Roscius. The advocate of Sextus Roscius, the well known Marcus Tullius Cicero, employs the help of a man named Gordianus to dig up information about the murder in order to prove his client innocent. Gordianus is known as \`the finder,' a man well experienced in finding facts no matter how well hidden or obscure. Of course, such facts don't come easy. There is much lying, much danger, and tons of characters only out for their own benefit that all together paint a picture of a corrupt Roman aristocracy. It is a very perilous time in Rome, after all, which has only just caught its breath from the proscription of Sulla and his restoration of the aristocracy over the common people. In order to prove Sextus Roscius innocent, Cicero and Gordianus must attack those very aristocrats that now hold Rome in a powerful grip.I avoided reading this book for a while because I didn't want it to disappoint me. And it didn't.Saylor is clearly a historian. If it's not obvious in his reader's notes, it's apparent in his clear delivery of accurate and compelling historical detail. You can almost see the dark dilapidation of the Roman Subura that is as hazardous as it is teeming with life, or see the immaculate scene of Carthage on the Rostra, or imagine the men in togas sitting around the Senate. What Saylor does is bring Rome to life, but not without insult and credit where credit is due. He doesn't present a Rome that is glorious and magnificent as some are prone to do, but neither does it portray it as a place irredeemably corrupt as others would have it. Saylor gives his readers Rome in all her shameless glory without falling into some one of the most common traps of those who attempt to write historical fiction. A tendency of most historical writers is to accentuate what is \`abnormal' by today's standards because they imagine it will help people understand the time period more, or respect it for how different it is, but this often backfires. I like how Saylor did not give excuses for Rome, but didn't gloss over the many faults. Details are presented in an easy and matter of fact way, which I found helped me get into the time period more simply because it was all given so casually.Roman Blood is not a \`great men of Rome' sort of book, though it does feature many of the people we know: Cicero and Sulla to name a few. They all play their roles, as great men do, but without stealing the spotlight. Gordianus is a great character because he is likable, realistic and humble. And very Roman. I also quite like the portrayal of Cicero in Roman Blood because I think it captured his peculiarities perfectly while still redeeming him at the end when it was shown to Gordianus the doubter that Cicero is more than just a picky nag and really is one of the greatest statesmen.Roman Blood is as much mystery as it is historical fiction. It's full of murder, perversion, ruthlessness, and doubt. There are enough twists and turns to make the plot interesting while not so many that you lose sense of the thing. In the end, you come to understand that everyone is guilty of something in some way and even an \`innocent' man has committed plenty of crimes of his own."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Steven Saylor's \\"Gordianus the Finder\\" series is one of the best historical fictions I've ever read! He's able to flawlessly integrate his character into Roman society at the end of the Republic, sharing the Forum with some of history's most famous personalities - and he does it in a completely believable way.The characters are multi-dimensional and evolve throughout the series, his descriptions are beautiful without becoming pendantic and the mysteries unroll in a way to keep you enthralled until the last page.FABULOUS!"},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Steven Saylor's fascination with Ancient Rome began in his childhood. A history graduate and former newspaper and magazine editor, he lives in Berkeley, California. His series of books about Ancient Rome and featuring Gordianus the Finder are extremely popular both here in England and also in America. Anyone who is a fan of Lindsey Davis will love these books too.Gordianus the Finder, the investigator of crimes, a man whose skill and integrity have made him much sought after by some of the most important men in Rome. Men who may need a secret to be kept, men who need to know that when Gordianus is working for them he will be discreet and not susceptible to bribery.Such a man is Cicero, who hires Gordianus to look into the affairs of a man who is accused of murdering his own father. He wishes Gordianus to acquire evidence that will either acquit or convict the man. It is a delicate case and one that soon puts Gordianus into more danger than even he is used to."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"This was a great book. Steven Saylor really showed what he can do. When reading it I felt like I was actually in Rome. The descriptions were outstanding. I could tell that a great deal of research was put into this novel. The mystery was great. I always like a good mystery that can keep me hooked. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"The is a great book that makes you feel as if you are living on the same street and experiencing it for yourself. I'm not a huge fan of mysteries, but this one is great. It has incredible detail in the street names, historical figures, building design, and a ton more. I thought that the main character Gordianus the Finder was very deductive in finding information. I enjoyed the many twists and turns that occurred when the murder was being solved. I also enjoyed Gordianus the Finder's openness in politics."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I have read all of Steven Saylor's ancient Rome book series, this one being the first one of the series. These books are probably more accurately described as historical reference books masquerading as novels. The books are chock full of very interesting bits of information on culture, politics and daily lives of ancient Rome. Any novel that incorporates extensive excerpts from Cicero is fine with me. While the books are marketed as mystery books, the mystery aspects of the books are not much more than an afterthought."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"This book starts the mystery series starring Gordianus the Finder. You don't have to read the series in order to enjoy them, but it does enhance your enjoyment thereof. Also, anyone who likes Ancient Roman history should be pleased with these well-researched books. This book is especially good, with an interesting plot. I recommend this book and his others to anyone who either likes good character-based detective fiction or ancient Roman history."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"\\"Roman Blood\\" by Steven Saylor is a wonderful murder mystery in the waning days of the Roman Republic. Saylor's protagonist Gordianus the Finder is a talented investigator in the classic private detective mold. When a notable citizen of the Republic, Sextus Roscius is murdered, Gordianus is engaged by a young Cicero to discover the true identity of the killer. What follows is a tense game of cat and mouse as Gordianus sifts through the clues to find the truth. While the story is fun and very engaging, the real star of this novel is Saylor's command of historical detail. One feels the thin veneer of civilization delicately hovering just above absolute violent chaos. This is a fantastic first entry in Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa series. Check it out."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"A solid murder mystery set in Republican Rome. The first in a series of books featuring Gordanius \\"The Finder\\" - a Roman gum-sandal who takes on cases that frequently put him physical peril as he makes his way through the dirty togas of the rich and powerful of ancient Rome. Saylor stakes out Gordanius' hard-boiled heritage in classic detective fiction in the opening pages as The Finder entertains taking on a new case while suffering from a terrible hangover.Saylor does a good job at depicting life in Republican Rome and embracing the reader in the history of the era without it feeling like a history lesson. Figures from the era like Cicero and Sulla make appearances and become more alive in your mind for it. The mystery is not particularly deep or complex, but serves its purpose and is not too transparent.Overall a fun read. I'm looking forward to the other books."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I've gotten on an historical kick this year and I found this one to be a favorite. I'm not sure what I liked better; the interesting plot, the characters, or the period detail. All top notch."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Steven Saylor's Roman Blood is an excellent detective story, set in ancient Rome, and based upon actual historical events. Roman Blood is the story of the investigations of Gordianus who works as a sort of private investigator, a vocation known in ancient Rome as \\"finder\\". Gordianus is hired, by a beginning advocate and aspiring orator named Cicero, to gather information for a scheduled trial. The defendant in the case is Sextus Roscius who is accused of, what is to Romans one of the most unspeakable and unholy crimes, parricide. Sextus, who is facing a horribly painful sentence appears very depressed and believes that no one can help him.Gordianus accepts the mission and lives through multiple challenges and threats in his effort to discover the truth. The investigation takes Gordianus to Ameria, a small town in rural Italy, where Sextus lived and where he had to confront the fearsome Magnus. He pursued his search in the House of Swans, a brothel, and the Baths of Pallacina, where he is accosted. Finally he has to fight the hulking Mallius Galaucia in the latrines of Rome.This is a fine detective story and presents a realistic, vivid, and very detailed picture of everyday life in ancient Rome. One of my majors in college was history. In my studies I completed several courses in ancient history and focused on the Roman Republic in particular but none of my studies provided the detailed picture on Roman life contained in these pages. If you like history you will like this book."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Anyone who is interested in Ancient Rome and loves a good mystery should not miss out on this Author. He is a favorite of mine. I have read all of his Roma Sub Rosa series and I am awaiting the next one due out next year. His stories are enjoyable for all ages and while the story itself is fiction, many of the events, people and places are real. One thing this author does that I really like is at the end of each book he tells about his research and what is or is not known about certain events and people."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Good read.I have read quite a bit of history including Roman and Saylor's use of historical detail is perhaps unexcelled. For a sense of what ancient Rome was quite probably like, you can't go wrong with this book.As far as plot goes, this book is no Hitchcock. The plot suffers from a few too many coincidences stemming from the highly improbable initial set up where the hero says that he will completely solve the murder in 8 days. For that to happen, in any age, everything has to fall into place in quick order and with no false leads. So, quite a few happy coincidences make things move along at a quick pace. People pop up at exactly the right time to furnish pieces to the puzzle. The twist at the end is pretty good but not entirely unexpected. All in all, this is a happy book to read. You don't care too much about those things, you just want to see how the plot progresses even if you are not chewing your nails while you're reading.The strongest feature is Saylor's superb handling of what historical details are actually available about a real trial involving real people where the end does indeed seem to correspond to very reasonable handling of the facts available.Read it and learn about some people that you may not have ever thought about."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I was not sure if I would like this one - turns out I loved it. I am not a reader of mysteries, but I do enjoy reading historical fiction about 1st century BC Rome. The plot is a typical murder whodunnit with perpetrators that are willing to stop at nothing to avoid being caught, which places the investigator (in this case Gordianus the finder) in intensely dangerous circumstances. What makes this book stand out from the pack is that Saylor immerses the reader into the Roman world in a most convincing manner. You will see, hear, and unfortunately SMELL Rome in a way that makes you feel as though you've been there. Saylor paints a picture that is so vivid it is very apparent that he has done his homework thoroughly. 5 stars all the way. I'm hooked and have already picked up the next in the series."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"This book is a fascinating look at the daily life of the ancient Romans. Steven Saylor places a very interesting plot into Roman history. This is a great way to learn about an incredible ancient civilization, what their politics were like, what their daily life was like and what it was like to actually be there, but not feel like you are reading a history book. I cannot wait to read the next one in the series!!!"},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"This is the one that starts it all, the first of a series of ten can't-put-down historical novels. What is so good about the book and the ensuing others is the author's ability to put the reader right into the daily life of Rome towards the last days of the Republic.. The story revolves around the central character, Gordianus the Finder, a Roman detective for hire.Using his keen instincts for survival and both intuitive and logical skills, he alone is able to solve the puzzle toa murder, allegedly of a patricide, providing important information to the famous lawyer and orator, Cicero, indefending the accused son. All throughout the novel, we seem to walk with Gordianus in the streets of Rome,seeing both the exquisite homes of the Patricians down to the plebian low-life in the Suburra district. Author,Steven Saylor, makes it all too real and the reader truly senses he is there, drinking fine wine with the aristocrator chatting with a slave prostitute.I can recommend this story and all of Saylor's follow-up novels about life in ancient Rome to anyone who enjoysa good puzzling mystery and a vivid imprint of life in Italy two thousand years ago."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"\\"Roman Blood\\" is the first of the \\"Gordianus the Finder\\" series of novels, all set in the latter days of the Roman Republic. It is the time of the dictatorship of Lucius Cornelius Sulla, and thus Rome is under the rule of a Dictator. Gordianus the Finder is commissioned by none other than lawyer Marcus Tullius Cicero, who is defending his client against the charge of patricide: the murder of his own father (I use the modern English word; the novel uses the more archaic term \\"parricide\\"). This crime entails a particularly gruesome penalty which is a form of death by torture. Gordianus is commissioned by Cicero to investigate the facts of the murder in the hope of finding exculpatory evidence.Gordianus investigates the crime, and this makes for, in itself, a fine detective novel. But it is much more, which is why I easily award this one five stars. This novel provides true insights as to the problems of Republican Rome under Dictator Sulla. This was a time when Sulla's enemies, or anyone else who happened to get in the way of the State or of Sulla's friends, could be summarily proscribed, which means that they will be murdered for the bounty on their head, their lands taken, their families turned out of their properties as penniless beggars. This fate, in fact, has already been suffered by the family of Cicero's client. For Cicero and Gordianus to endeavor in their client's defense they risk incurring the ire of the State themselves, the usual penalty for which is proscription.This novel is full of twists, turns, and surprises. And all along the way it acquaints the reader with insights as to the nature and problems of the Roman Republic. For while ancient Rome shared certain conspicuous features with a modern Western democracy, it was based on slavery, a rigid class structure, and a hereditary nobility. The rule of law was weak and often unenforced; the society was violent and unsafe. All of this provides the backdrop for an exciting novel. And if this were not enough, Gordianus, Cicero, Tiro (Cicero's slave and right-hand-man) and Sulla are all brilliantly portrayed; the characterizations in this story are excellent. Highly recommended. RJB."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Patricide. To murder one's father. There is no greater crime in Ancient Rome. Maybe setting a building on fire, but either way killing your own father is death. And not a clean, quick death. Oh no, we're talking seriously painful and long.Cicero comes to Gordianus the Finder looking for help. You see, Cicero must prove that the accused did not kill his father, even when all the evidence suggests otherwise. The case is not simple and, as much of what happens in Rome, has power and politics bubbling under the surface.Welcome to Rome during the time of Sulla, Cicero, Tiro, and Chrysogonus. Welcome to the dirty streets and slums of the poor, the extreme wealth of the rich, and the naked greed of the most powerful men in the world.

If you study the historical background, it is even better."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I found this novel to be a blend of good historical fiction with the psychological puzzle of \\"Film Noir\\". This book puts you into ancient Rome and keeps you there. Saylor paints believable, complex characters from every strata of life. Go to Rome this summer read this novel. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Having just returned from Rome, I found the novel fascinating for its detail and insights into early Roman life. Parts did seem to drag a bit, especially toward the end, but the characters and plot were well done. As for the person who complained about the more risque portions, the \\"necrophilia\\" consists of a single sentence when a man blushes with interest at the sight of a dead woman's breast. Does not even qualify as racy!Bottom line: I'll be reading more in the series!"},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"The first book in the Roma sub Roma series starts the series off with a blast.

In this novel he is hired by a young aspiring attorney named Cicero to help find information on a man accused of killing his father. The finder goes through the depraved world of Rome to somehow sift through the truth. Great read but be aware if you read number 1 you will buy the next 11 books just like I did!"},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"This is a masterful achievement. Historical study teaches us that Roman sources are few; that what we have are at best transliterations centuries later; and that the majority of classical texts are lost and not likely to be found. And in spite of this, Steven Saylor is able to create a picture of Rome and Roman society that teems with life, that draws a complete picture that the sources individually do not, and in my limited expereince, seems to be historically accurate and true. Not to mention its one heck of a great story. This is historical fiction at its best."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Beginning with a dull and esoteric exchange between slave Tiro and No-Praenomen-or-Nomen Gordianus, I had little desire to continue. But I did anyway.The mystery, which I had gotten to read from Cicero's point of view in Colleen McCullough's book \\"Fortune's Favorites\\", unfolds with Gordianus in the underbelly of Rome, torn by civil war and proscriptions past, and a murder mystery which seems to have nothing going for it but witnesses unwilling to speak.Gordianus is fluent, clear-thinking, and easy to follow as the story unfolds casually, without any over-indulgences and plenty of detail. Some of the characterizations are repeated ceaselessly, using \\"dyspeptic\\" to describe Cicero in six different chapters, or marveling at how chiseled and handsome and golden Chrysogonus is.The story is interesting, and the mystery unfolds without much surprise as it's easy enough to figure out what happened and by who a few paragraphs or pages before its revealed, but it's an entertaining read which culminates in the neatly written opening arguments of the Sextus Roscius case of Erucius and Cicero.After that, it falls apart as Sulla comes to Cicero's house and provides a very long, boring, and really disappointing twist which almost completely negates everything that had taken place previously. After that, another useless plot twist occurs with seemingly no purpose other than to spill more \\"Roman Blood\\" or add some quick \\"investigating\\" work just in case you think Gordianus didn't do a good enough job.Up until the ending (which the author seems to admit in the Author's Note that he added on as a last minute thing) the story was a good one, and seeming the beginning of a nice series."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"This book was impressivly good, and one of the best mysteries I've ever read. Gordianus the Finder, the main character, was well-written and very intresting. Saylor paints such a detailed mental picture of ancient Rome that it seems he was actually writing from the time period. This book is sure to keep you intrigued and guessing until the very last page. Roman Blood is one of the best mysteries I've read in a long time. I highly recomend it to anyone looking for some suspense."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Saylor's recreation of a Rome nearly 300 years before the birth of Christ is a treat to the historical lover's eyes. Soaring marble columns, white togas, and references to famous ancients such as Cicero adorn every page. What may not be so appealing in this mystery is the muck of Roman streets, various unclothed Romans engaging in numerous sexual acts, and a several page historical dissertation about the dictator Sulla which has nothing whatsoever to do with the plot. Certain revelations meant to be dismaying are predictable and the detective spends as much time moping around as he does trying to solve the mystery. History purists will also be disappointed that much of the dialogue (excluding exclamations of \\"by Hercules!) could have been lifted from any of the many crime shows that dot the TV arena."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Steven Saylor does a well-informed and colorful job of writing a mystery set in the historical context of ancient Rome, but that's about the only place this book has high merit. Those with good knowledge of Roman history and culture will certainly admire tha, at least. If you're not interested in the great job it does with these details, the plot will probably confuse, bore, or disgust you. The title is appropriate, there's lots of blood; and sex, and danger, and all the grimy aspects of a murder mystery novel. The ending is really good, though, and after making it all the way through the book I ended up glad that I had. Nonetheless, it was not an exceptional book, and in a number of instances, offensive. Unsuitable for young or unsuspecting readers. For those classicals with respect for Cicero, he is done amazing justice considering the standard the rest of the book has."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I'm not completely finished with this book but it's been somewhat of a struggle to get this far. I find myself saying to myself \\"it has to get better, just keep reading!\\" lol I really hope it does get more interesting. I feel like Steven has laid so much ground work that I can now predict Gordinius' (the main character) moves before he acts them out. But it's definitely not horrible and perhaps someone who has more knowledge of the Roman Empire would better appreciate what I have forced myself to read."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"The book was awful. Everytime I started a new page I had to reread the half the other page to know what was going on. Also the things that happened in the book weren't very descriptive in the parts that had a lot of action especially in the begining with the murder. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Steven Saylor's series of books about Gordianus the Finder begins with a twisted tale of patricide, and ends with a surprising conclusion in a case that actually took place. Saylor's impeccable research, and mellifluous writing style make these books a pleasure to read. Knowing that the events are based on actual historical cases adds to the fun. (Too bad Saylor didn't get to write the screenplay for &quot;Gladiator&quot; - it would have been a lot more fun.) Gordianus is a wonderful gum-shoe, far more real and relatable than Lindsay Davis' Marcus Didius Falco. Saylor's books are also fresher for being based on actual events. Warning, these books are habit-forming. Read one and you'll be hooked!"},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"'Roman Blood' started Steven Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa series with Gordianus the Finder helping Cicero on his first big case - the parricide Sextus Roscius. Saylor authentically renders the details of life in late Republican Rome (albeit during the interval of Sulla's dictatorship). The reader will meet many real historical figures such as the orator/politician Cicero, his slave Tiro, the dictator Sulla, his enemy Caecilia Metella, the wealthy freedman and Sulla's adherent Chrysogonus and many others.The story of Sextus centers around the proscription lists (literally lists of death warrants) posted by Sulla in Rome. Anyone on the proscription list is subject to being killed with a reward to the killer. Abuses occurred and the victims' estates were plundered by Sulla and his followers. Sextus the father was a wealthy owner of agricultural estates in Ameria who made his son run the farm while he played in Rome. Sextus senior ends up dead, but who did it and who is going to be held to account for it (not necessarily the same thing)?Unlike much historical fiction, Saylor has entwined a nice little mystery of his own into 'Roman Blood'. Who really did kill Sextus?Gordianus also meets the mute boy Eco in this book.A very enjoyable read and by all accounts quite historically authentic."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Now lets be honest with everyone I myself can not stand to read, I would rather get my teeth pulled out. I would also much rather watch T.V., but when I was reading Roman Blood for school, somthing changed me about this book. It reminded me of the hit T.V. show \\"CSI\\". The book Roman blood involves Gordianus a vary cunning and smart detective.I only have one beef with the writer Steven Saylor...Steven my good man you made me loose a ton of sleep reading this book because I couldn't put it down. I love the way how you described everything, it felt like I was in the midst of all the action.

This is a promising series, where life in Ancient Rome is reborn. While we accompany Gordianus around the city and its surroundings, the feeling of &quot;being there&quot; is ever present.The descriptions of the city of Rome, its corruption, its brutality, make us think about an indelible period of history that shaped the world we live in today. I read somewhere that the romans represent a period of history when men made an attempt to rule themselves but ultimately failed. Well, they might have; but Saylor and his novel are all time winners.It is true that the title of the novel is a very accurate representation of what goes on into it. There's lots of blood everywhere, and descriptions of death are sometimes gorry. Saylor writes with all his senses. He does what every great writer does: he shows us.I am more than ever looking forward to further adventures of Gordianus the Finder in Ancient Rome. If it was only even a bit close to this, life in Antiquity must have been fascinating."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I enjoyed this book, although it is not 5 stars, but I warn potential buyers to chose a different book if they are easily offended. The author puts a gratuitous note in the book referring to the challenge of surviving our modern era because, among other things, Ronald Reagan lives today. The slam against Reagan had nothing to do with the rest of the book and it left me with a sour taste. The author doesn't have to practice tolerance, of course, this being a free country, but those who don't want be insulted for their beliefs when they are just trying to read escapist fiction might want to steer clear of this book."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Let me start off with this -- Steven Saylor is a very talented author. His building a story based, in part on historical fact, ranks with some of the best writing in the mystery field. There are little nuances of storytelling that put you completely into that world. Roman Blood is the author's first in a series of books and sets the stage for further development.The kindle version however had been blighted with a collection of typos and weird ligatures that distracted from the enjoyment of the story. I can attest to the fact, as of August 3, 2010, the kindle version has been corrected and is near flawless. The \\"redo\\" of the kindle version was in part due to kindle readers bringing the distracting element to the attention of Steven Saylor who contacted his editor at St. Martins to make a new edition for kindle available. Bravo to you, Steven and your editor at St. Martins. Enjoy the new version!"},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"The first 300+ pages of Roman Blood is a masterpiece of historical mystery writing. It has richly drawn characters, lots of suspense and a strict adherence to historical fact. In short, it is a great read. If Saylor had the judgment to end his novel with the first 300+ pages, I would have given it a 5-star rating without any reservations.However, such is not the case. The reason is that Saylor either decided to throw in one final plot twist or his editors compelled him to do so. This twist contradicts both established historical facts and also the facts of the case that was laid out in the previous 300+ pages. It is also written in such a way that it literally violates the suspension of disbelief that is vital to any enjoyable escape reading. The reader feels cheated at the end of the novel.Due to the merits of the first 300+ pages, I still give this a 3 out of 5 star rating, but it could have been a 5 all the way."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Roman Blood is an extremely intriguing book and has great twists up until the very last page.

Finally near the very end I was almost positive I knew how it would turn out but then just like that every thing changed and it is exactly the opposite I thought it would be. Roman Blood was very descriptive and informitive. It gave me a great sense of what Roman life was like and I could almost feel, taste and smell everything through the Roman streets.

Gordianus is soon plunged into the not so glamorous side of ancient Rome, a Rome of hired killers, corrupt government, brothels and home invasions. A world where a dying man's screams only cause good citizens to cover their ears and hide behind their barred doors.The clues to the mystery of this novel are all there for the reader to follow but twist and turn so that it would be a challenge to solve the crime before Gordianus. The real treat to this story is not the mystery, although it is engaging, but rather the glimpse into the ancient world. Even though Gordianus has many of the same concerns of a modern day citizen, (crime in the streets, corruption in government, stretching the income to cover expenses) but he is very much a man of his times. Gordianus must contend with the social niceties of how a free citizen should treat a slave, his own and those belonging to others, finding his way through a city that has no maps, nor even any names on most of the streets, streets where a citizen could be killed at any time by a common thief, in a vendetta with a rival family or even at the request of the government. Saylor's descriptions of the settings and characters are fascinating, they bring this long gone time a place alive in an interesting and entertaining manner.This is the first of the ROMA SUB ROSA series, and I cannot wait to get my hands on the next in the series."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Steven Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa series is wonderful for the exploration of character, for the mysteries (of course), and for bringing Ancient Rome to life. The descriptions of Rome made me feel like I was walking through a city teeming with life, people, sights, sounds, smells.The novels seem to become more complex as the series goes on. Roman Blood, the first novel in the series, is the most straight-forward murder mystery. Arms of Nemesis puts Gordianus under pressure with a time limit, and looks at the way slaves fit into Roman society. Catalina's Riddle takes place on a farm, in the midst of a possible revolution. The Venus Throw involves, scandal, politics and an examination of morals. I haven't read the other books yet, but I have ordered them. I heartily recommend this series."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Steven Saylor's novel is aptly named -- a good deal of Roman blood is indeed spilled when Gordianus the Finder agrees to help a young lawyer named Marcus Tullius Cicero with his first case. Cicero has been hired to defend one Sextus Roscius, accused of killing his father, also named Sextus Roscius. The crime of patricide was punishable by death in ancient Rome, and neither Cicero nor Gordianus wants to see an innocent man executed.Saylor does a good job of bringing Rome to life; he includes many details, including descriptions of the narrow, winding streets, the oppressive heat of summer, and the intricacies of the Roman legal system, that create a sense of place and painlessly educate the reader. There are only a few places where the description intrudes into the story. Since the story is bound up with the political intrigue surrounding the rule of the dictator Sulla (80 BC), a knowledge of Roman history will help the reader keepthe characters and their motivations straight. Saylor does give an explanation of Sulla's rise to power and the atrocities he and his followers committed, but it comes late in the book and drags on for several pages, so this is not as useful as it could be. Readers not familiar with (or uninterested in) Roman history may have trouble getting into the book, but overall the setting is well-done and convincing.The mystery aspect of the novel was not as interesting as the historical aspect; the story is slow in places, and it was hard to care about the characters, especially since many of them lack redeeming qualities. Also, Saylor has an unfortunate tendencyto overemphasize key plot points, as if he doesn't want the reader to miss the fact that a certain discovery is a clue. Part of the mystery reader's responsibility is to find the clues on her own; it is the mystery author's job to confuse the reader about what is a clue and what is a red herring. Saylor doesn't seem to have mastered that skill. The end of the novel, which includes the requisite court scene with Cicero making his argument on behalf of the accused, seems to take forever to lumber to a conclusion. Read the book for its setting, but don't expect too much in the mystery department."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"(there's a spoiler in here, so be warned)I wouldn't have read this book on my own - it was recommended by my son's history teacher. And it's actually not bad - but it isn't for kids.The book has some pretty steamy, detailed sex scenes - nails clawing in the back, hips thrusting, etc, etc. In fact, it has two such scenes in the first 50 pages, not to mention a brutal stabbing in the middle of a mob (which the protagonists choose to ignore), and a scene where one of our main characters lusts after the pretty, dead flesh of a corpse. Eesh.We go on to deal with rape, father-daughter incest, your run-of-the-mill child abuse and neglect, another brutal stabbing (first reenacted, rather heartbreakingly, by a traumatized child, then described in vivid detail), the nasty ways a parricide is punished (to which an eager potential child witness responds \\"wow, I've never seen a monkey before!\\"), the beheading of thousands whose heads are impaled and on public display. The killing of a kitty cat whose blood is used as ink. A grown man having sex with a woman he owns as property while fantasizing about having sex with a young girl he knows has been molested by her father.And a couple more brutal stabbings.As a historical detective novel, I think it did a fine job - it's not my genre, and I was certainly captivated by the story. Jacqueline Susann/Raymond Chandler in a toga, sort of thing. But it's not for those under 17."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"How very ironic that the week after my students I am discussed and read Cicero's letters to his slave, Tiro, that I should get this book. I read it quickly and enjoyed every minute of it. While I might argue on some historical points, the speculations about society in Rome in 80 BCE are well done and played out with depth and personality. I suggested it to my students today on our last class as a good example of popular history also being well-done history. Saylor does an outstanding job in this entire series, it seems now having read a second book in it, of protraying slavery as a realistic institution."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"I had been putting off reading this series, but finally decided to start, and I'm glad I did. The book is a long one, but it is so interesting, and so suspenseful that it kept me turning pages. While I was reading I almost forgot I was reading about Ancient Rome circa 80 B.C. Gordianus the Finder is a strong character, and he definitely moves this book along. There is a whole gamut of stuff going on from parricide to murder, to hired assassins, as well as a whole lot of family secrets. The settiog that Saylor sets is very vivid and realistic. This book is both a good history lesson as well as an excellent mystery. Can't wait to read more. Even though these books are about ancient Rome they are as different from Lindsey Davis' Rome as can be, but still wonderful. Lindsey Davis is one of my very favourite authors, and that is why I was hesitant to begin this series, but the series will have merit in its own right."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"'Roman Blood' is an excellent example of historical fiction where the words 'historical' and 'fiction' are given equal attention. Steven Saylor spins a &quot;whodunnit&quot; mystery based on real events, much like Margaret Atwood does in her excellent 'Alias Grace'. This is unlike the work of Lindsey Davis, an author whose popular Falco mystery series, while in a similar ancient Rome setting, is pure fiction (although the author clearly knows her Roman history).As for the story, hmmm... it's a bit complicated. Broadly speaking it is about a private eye (Gordianus) who is hired by a defense attorney (Cicero) to investigate the bloody death of a Roman citizen. The victim's son is accused of planning the murder and, if convicted, would suffer a most extraordinarily gruesome execution. In the end we witness the murder trial and its aftermath, both of which are rather ... surprising. Yet before then the reader is taken through the very colorful day-to-day events of Roman high-lifes and low-lifes; I found it all to be very educational, and the murder mystery element is very well presented.Compared to the works of Lindsey Davis, 'Roman Blood' is somewhat dry - it doesn't contain much humor, and the characterizations, while completely satisfactory, do not sparkle. Yet I actually prefer the work of Steven Saylor because of its historical accuracy and I find his prose to be richer (ie, it feels more like 'literature' versus 'popular fiction').Bottom line: not quite James Michener material, but nonetheless a very accomplished piece of historical fiction. Recommended."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"As always in the case of a (good) historical novel, this is a story about a modern character in pseudo-Ancient grab peeeping at an alien reality and judging it on his own terms. The interest of the story therefore depends on the modern character being intersting enough. Fact is, Gordianus the Finder is a very interesting character, the knowledge of Roman History displayed by the author accurate, and there are vignettes in this book I wouldn't wish to miss (for instance, the account of Gordianus' travel to Ameria). An enormously interesting book, deserves to be read both as a mystery and as a historical novel."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"This is a decent, well-written mystery. It's not a top-tier mystery, but good enough that I intend to buy more of Saylor's work. The Roman setting was interesting because it seemed realistic, and the plot pacing was good. I wish the main character's motivations were a little better drawn, though. It seems he's motivated largely by needing to earn a living and enhance his social class, which is a perfectly normal motivation in any era, but a little bit pedestrian. I'd like to see him face and resolve some morally complex situations, which would not only be interesting in its own right, but give us a chance to know him and empathize with him more deeply. After all, one can only learn so much about a character by seeing him resolve the standard &quot;two goons waiting for him in an alley&quot; crisis. I also think the attack on Ronald Reagan was unwarranted and undisciplined. It was self-indulgent on the author's part to force the reader to react to a contemporary political statement when the natural thing for a reader to be doing at that phase of the book is to be thinking about the resolution of the plot."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"Roman Blood is a wonderful display of Ancient Rome at its finest, and its dirty underside. Steven Saylor sure doesn't shy away from the unappealing aspects of ancient Rome. Instead, he has geniously incorporated all aspects of Roman life, giving the reader an accurate description of the hustle and bustle to be found in the streets of Rome and the exquisite and diverse decorating styles in the homes of the wealthy. Rome is a city shrouded in mystery, as the reader finds when following the paths of Gordianus the Finder as he braves the Roman World to help bring justice to the lawbreakers. Roman Blood is a quick, suspense-filled novel, one that I truly enjoyed. Steven Saylor depicts Rome so well, it seems as if you're really there and the characters are portrayed in such a manner that the reader feels he really knows them. Roman Blood is a wonderful piece of work and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Roman Blood: A Mystery of Ancient Rome","review":"This is the beginning of a great series.

The year is 1869, and Kate Whittington is a twenty-nine year old spinster teaching at the Catholic orphanage where she was left by her mother at the tender age of nine. One of the sisters tells Kate that their orphanage is to close and relocate to Minnesota. Because her mother was a prostitute, Kate has difficulty finding another place to live, not to mention a place to work.She discovers an advertisement in a newspaper where a Texas rancher is looking for a wife. She begins corresponding with the rancher and becomes enthralled with him after reading his letters. Kate and Reed Barton are married by proxy, and she travels to Texas to be with him.Upon her arrival in Texas, Kate discovers that Reed has been wounded when on a mission as a Texas Ranger. She nurses him back to health, only to discover that he neither wrote those letters to her nor wanted her as a wife.Though she is devestated, Kate agrees to stay on as Reed's housekeeper and care for his eight-year old son Daniel. This proves difficult as Daniel has recently been found after having been captured by the Comanches five years ago.Reed is shaken by his attraction to Kate as he has sworn off love thinking it an unnecessary emotion. His marriage to his first wife was difficult at best, and he is consumed with guilt concerning the manner in which she died.SUMMER MOON is an incredibly touching story that gives you an eyewitness view into the heart of the hero and heroine. Kate is such a remarkable woman, gifted with the ability to love though constantly faced with rejection, first from her mother and later from Reed. She is such a likeable heroine that one finds oneself crying with her as she faces heartache. Though damaged by his father's betrayal and the strained relationship with his first wife, Reed is strengthened by Kate's unconditional love enabling him to overcome the demons of his past. This is a truly superb novel, one that leads you on an emotional rollercoaster ride that will not soon be forgotten."},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"Summer Moon is the story of Kate Wittington, a woman who at the age of nine was dropped off at an orphanage by her prostitute mother. When Kate is twenty-nine the orphanage closes and she must decide what she's to do with her life. She answers an ad in the newspaper for a woman to be a mail-order bride. She takes a chance and answers the ad and is the lucky woman who is chosen to be the wife of Reed Benton. When she arrives in Texas she finds out the shocking truth. She married Reed Benton by proxy but he knows nothing of their marriage. It seems they were both tricked by Reed's father, Reed Benton Sr., a devious and scheming man who devised a plan to get his son back home to the Lone Star Ranch. When Reed Jr. returns to the ranch, wounded, and with his son who has been raised by the Commanche for the past six years he finds out he's married to Kate. Since he's wounded and can't care for his son he hires Kate on as his housekeeper and caregiver to his son Daniel.This book was very entertaining and very easy to read. The characters were very life-like and well developed. Every character in the book has a purpose and they serve their purpose well. Ms. Landis seems to have thought out her character before she began writing. Even the secondary characters are well rounded. They all add to the story in their own way.Summer Moon moves along at a steady pace. Again, the storyline seems to have been well thought out before the book was started. The author clearly had every scene planned out and this makes the book very enjoyable to read. The book doesn't seem choppy or hurriedly put together. It just seems like a well planned book about everyday characters on the Texas frontier.Summer Moon is an excellent read. I was able to finish this book in just two days. I couldn't put this book down. I wanted to find out what was going to happen but at the end didn't want the book to end. I felt like I personally knew the characters and could feel their emotions. Summer Moon is a great book and will make a great addition to any romance lover's or Western romance lover's library."},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"I enjoyed Summer Moon very much. Jill Marie Landis is a wonderful story teller - she keeps you captive with her great plot, and with her fabulous dialogue makes you feel her stories. I especially enjoy her historical facts that must require a lot of research, but are so woven in the story that you just get swept away. This novel made me feel a part of the Texas history, and I loved the main characters! I have read ALL of her books, and recommend them highly. Curl up, and enjoy her amazing ability to weave a romantic tale."},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"Summer moon is the story of Kate, an orphan turned schoolteacher and the love she has for Reed an ex-Texas ranger.Corresponding with Reed via letter she falls in love with him and agrees to a marriage by proxy. Little does she know that Reed knows nothing about the letters, and the letters were truly written by Reed's aging father in an elaborate scheme to get him to finally marry.While this plot is certainly nothing new, Jill manages to breath new life into an otherwise tired plotline, with her clear writing style and attention to historic detail.What I like most about Jill's writing is she manages to portray the predjudices and attitudes of the time without the 'politically correct' glasses worn by many romance authors. She simply states things as they are without making the heroine a radical reformer or an instrument of social change.My only real quibble with this book was I thought the hero Reed was a little to self-pitying as a character. If he isn't running away from his problems... IE, his dominating father, his wife who used him for his money, his son's problems acclimating to Anglo culture. He stands around making frustrating 'noises' and using the heroine. I would've much preferred the hero to be more mature and responsible.Surprisingly, the story is interesting enough to read, despite the under whelming hero.

I liked the historican aspect of the book and the fact that the author told the story through a variety of perspectives, unlike most books I read. When i finished reading I was disappointed that I would no longer be reading about these interesting charachters. I would be willing to read other books by the same author after experiencing this story."},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"*Spoilers Throughout*Kate, daughter of a whore, but raised by nuns is finally taking her life into her own hands. For months she's been corresponding with Reed in Texas. They get married via proxy and she comes to claim her husband. But when she gets there her new \\"husband\\" has never heard of her and she discovers that it was Reed's father who wrote to her all those months, trying to get his son a bride. Reed is less than pleased. Reed has brought home his son Daniel, believed dead in the same raid that killed his mother, but instead he was taken and raised by the Comanche. Reed gets Kate to take care of Daniel until he can arrange an annulment.I have to start out by saying to me this book isn't a romance, it seems like it wants to be, but I never bought into any of the romantic elements. The first sex scene (1 of 2) was utterly bizarre. She is yet to actually say hello to the man because he was brought in wounded when she shows up. She thinks he is her husband and she goes to check on him as he is having a fever dream. Reed thinks she is his first wife, Becky, and afterwards they just forget about it. It's very weird that a woman RAISED BY NUNS is going to be so laid back about casual sex, that she isn't going to demand he does the right thing for her, that she isn't worried about a possible baby or something. I never believed that Reed cared for her and at the end I didn't believe that he actually loved her.For me I was much more invested in the storyline involving Reed's son, Daniel, or Fast Pony, as he calls himself. It seemed honest and realistic as we learn about his loyalty to his adopted family and also as he comes to terms with who his real father is and bonds with Kate. Also the character of Charm was, well, charming. She is a young former whore whom Kate befriends. All the characters are likable, there are no villains there. Even the Comanche are portrayed as sympathetic. The problem I have with this book is Reed. Everyone is so likable and real, while Reed might be real but he's not very likable. He is a typical wounded hero, who's wife ran around on him, holds himself responsible for losing his son and his wife's death and had a toxic relationship with his father. These are the kinds of heroes I just eat up, but Reed was too cold, he didn't care about any one or any thing and I couldn't feel any sympathy for him in the slightest.I know I am being rather negative, but I really did enjoy this book. It's a traditional western with cowboys and indians, saloons, and hot Texas sun, and if you don't mind that the romance here is a bit on the shallow side you will definitely enjoy this book.4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"I found the book to be absolutely wonderful.

She and Reed Benton hit it off by mail, marry by proxy, and she heads to his ranch.When Kate arrives at his ranch, she finds her father-in-law has just died. Her husband is recovering from a bullet he received during a Texas Ranger raid on a Comanche camp. His son Daniel behaves more like an Indian because that is where he has been raised for five years.

Kate says they wed by proxy, but they conclude that his deceased father forged his signature. Reed keeps Kate as a temporary housekeeper to help him with Daniel, who wants to return to his tribe. She falls in love with the father and his son, but Reed refuses to acknowledge his love for Kate.SUMMER MOON is an exciting Americana romance that stars strong realistic characters struggling to do the right thing especially for Daniel. The story line is interesting as the reader becomes very familiar with Kate, Reed, and Daniel, which in turn allows understanding of each one's motives.

Reed Benton, Junior the hero comes back to the Lone Star homestead, his father is dead and he is gravely injured after fighting as a Ranger in a Comanche Indian raid. He is seriously wounded. In his bed he mistakes the heroine as his dead wife and has sex with the her. I just find this plot very far-fetched. How many people have a romantic romp soon after being shot and wounded barely holding on to life? Not believable for me at all.Like other reviewers I was routing for the minister and Kate to get together, he was a much more attractive mate for the heroine, even though I knew by the obvious and predictable setups that Kate would wind up with Reed, who was not that endearing. Not a great romance if you're hoping that the two main characters do not wind up together. Grade C-very average"},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"What a yawn.

I picked this up at a UBS and read it on a long haul flight last week. I was quite disappointed. The author writes well enough but here is what I found problematical:1 - rather un-PC in dealing with the Comanches2 - redemption of the un-PC attitude not rectified until the epilogue3 - our hero wasn't much of a father (or son for that matter)4 - the heroine chose the wrong man, IMOThe secondary character, the Rev Preston Marshall, made a much more interesting and attractive hero than Reed Benton, and his emotions and feelings were deeper and far more sympathetic than Reed's. Reed, IMO, was very immature unlike the heroine, Kate. Kate's early years and 20s were tough and difficult but she rose to overcome them. Reed, however, acted like a spoilt rich boy, made a stupid choice of first wife (complete with the in-laws from hell) and treated his son very badly. Young Daniel, Reed's son, was perhaps the most interesting character of all as we are shown a white world through the eyes of a small boy captured in a Comanche raid and raised by apparently loving Indian parents.Not sure about this author. Magnolia Creek was also a good enough read though not outstanding. I am giving her one more try but if there is no improvement, may not continue with her. However, if Preston Marshall should ever get his own well-deserved story, I'll be in the queue to read it!"},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"This is the first historical romance novel that I've read in years as I've been concentrating more on contemporary women's fiction, but this story is quite different but it captured me and I enjoyed the author's formal use of language to set the tone in this charming tale set during the Indian American war. I found myself thinking of the characters after I turned the last page and that's always a sign of excellent writing and a great story.Kate Whittington spent her early years as the daughter of the town whore - not very well taken care of and ostracized by \\"polite society\\". When her mother realizes she can no longer take care of her, she abandons her on the steps of the local orphanage, where she grows to become an educated teacher, but trigger-shy about men, she remains unmarried but years for a family of her own but thinks that at almost 30, it may be too late. Then she spots an ad in a local newspaper placed by a man who lives far away in Texas, advertising for a mail-order bride.This tale may have been told before but Jill Marie Landis creates a fine drama and enlivens this story with vivid characters and the wild frontier of Texas as a fine backdrop. There's a twist to this story, the Texan that she thinks she's been corresponding with doesn't seem to know who she is and their first meeting is confusing but sets the stage for a battle of wills that neither is prepared for.As in most romance novels, the attraction is almost immediate, but Landis takes the time to slowly build her characters so that you discover their personalities and their histories in such a way that you begin to understand how their lives have led them to each other.We eventually learn that it was Reed, Sr. that wrote the letters to Kate, without his son knowing and her arrival comes at a bad time, or is it perfect timing? Reed, Jr. has recently discovered his son, Daniel, once abducted during an Indian raid on his property, where he wife was left injured and died shortly after. While embarking on another raid, he discovers that Daniel has been raised with the Indians and the boy does not wish to return to Lone Star with him, but Reed is not about to lose his son once again and forces him to return with him. Although sparks do fly between the two, the discovery of their marriage by proxy creates a difficult situation, but Kate decides to stay on as a housekeeper.Her primary responsibility is to care for Daniel. Once Kate lays eyes on the adorable, but heart-broken little boy, she finds the stirrings of love that she has felt for students in the past. She starts trying to teach him English and cares for him, initially as a house keeper and later finds that she loves him with a mother's heart.Eventually Kate finds companionship with the local preacher and maybe her hopes of love and family aren't lost when he professes his feelings for her. Can Kate put aside the feelings she has grown for Reed and instead plan a life with the minister? Will Reed let his second chance at love slip through his fingers? Jill Marie Landis keeps it very interesting as we find out the answer and we discover what love really means for all involved.I was impressed with the breadth of this novel and Landis' story telling talent. Once I got my head around the fact that this story is in a very specific genre, I was able to sustain my disbelief enough to get carried away in this story. I don't know if I'm going to continue to read more historical romance, but I was intrigued to find that Jill Marie Landis has written some contemporary novels and I'm looking forward to reading Heat Wave to see how she handles a modern-day story."},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"I enjoy a quality romance novel as well as I do any other well-written, creative book with memorable characters. Unfortunately, Summer Moon does not totally fit my bill. It will, however, likely satisfy avid readers of formula mass-market romance paperbacks.Kate Whittington, a prostitute's daughter raised in a Catholic orphanage in the late 1800s, answers a \\"wife wanted\\" ad and finds herself living in Texas with a landowner who may or may not actually be her husband. She is also charged with raising and taming the landowner's Comanche-raised son. Throw in sideplots involving a reforming prostitute, the landowner's best friend, and the town minister who falls in love with Kate and the book falls into a comfortable, predictable, formula romance.While Landis obviously knows how to write (the plot moves smoothly from event to event and her structure is clear), creativity does not seem to be her strong suit here. All her characters are predictably gorgeous, ruggedly handsome, sexy, and/or heroically beautiful. The plot is as predictable as a hot Texas summer, replete with cowboys and indians.Despite these negatives, Landis admirably limits the novel's most intimate moments to suggestively sexy scenes that stroke the libido without resorting to the graphic anatomical grossness so prevalent in today's romance books. And in the end, she deftly weaves her swooning prose into a predictable but romantic payoff that will please avid romance fans."},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"This was my first book by this author and I am not sure what to think.

I've been using the Uston Advanced Plus/Minus count for over 5 years now and have an awesome winning record. The Uston Advanced Point Count is also outlined in this book (It's extremely complicated though.)I would recommend this book to anyone who is serious about counting cards or anyone who wants a really entertaining read."},{"Title":"MILLION DOLLAR BLACKJACK","review":"Ken Uston (God rest his soul) was the KING of 21 during the 1970s and early 1980s. Million Dollar Blackjack is a masterpiece of the game, and the scene around it in Las Vegas and A-City during that time. Many casinos have knocked out single- and double-deck games, moving to 6 and 8 deck shoes. Uston did not have to deal with that back in the day; yet his stories about fighting off Griffin agents, pit bosses, and squirrly female dealers are the stuff of legends. The stories in this book pay for the price itself. As for the blackjack knowledge, the card counting pages are excellent, and while the comps information is 20 years too late, it still makes for interesting reading."},{"Title":"MILLION DOLLAR BLACKJACK","review":"Million Dollar Blackjack is THE book on the subject. Ken Uston has won more money than anyone else has and has been known as &quot;Mr. Blackjack&quot; for this reason. Aside from this, the book is enjoyable, understandable, and makes learning ANY count method easy to learn. A good player can easily use his information to make the Hi Opt II or Zen Unbalanced counts their vehicle to riches. Flash cards make the memory work a breeze, and give every player a better than even chance to make money against even the difficult multideck games of today. You are taught to avoid certain games and evaluate each game before you buy in and go for the kill. Learn how you can travel for next to nothing and play 1 and 2 deck games that still exist today with good rules. Ken tells you how. Covers everything from playing the game for fun to making a living at it."},{"Title":"MILLION DOLLAR BLACKJACK","review":"Terrific book containing a number of different counts, practice tips, and stories about the early days of professional blackjack. The book is in large measure a training manual, but the technical parts are punctuated with three autobiographical vignettes. The practical advice is good, but don't bother learning the Advanced Point Count. It is quite difficult, and not even close to worth the effort today.Million Dollar Blackjack contains a wealth of background info about the game, and the autobiographical vignettes are great. The first vignette details how Uston initially got involved in professional blackjack, and some of his early experiences playing in Las Vegas. The second describes his experiences with a blackjack-playing computer called \\"George\\" (Keith Taft's invention, actually called \\"David.\\") One quintisential Ustonism: he writes, \\"[The computer] needed some alterations to make it practical, but there was no question in my my mind that Jerry [Uston's pseudonym for Keith] had a viable money-making tool.\\" The \\"alterations to make it practical\\" to which Uston referred was the fact that the cards were imput using four buttons located in the toes of shoes. Everyone else mastered the shoes; Uston required a special keypad created just for him for card entry. \\"...needed some alterations\\" indeed!The last vignette describes the game in the very earliest days of legalized gambling in Atlantic City, which is easily worth a book unto itself. It is a great story.Although an argument remains about how good a blackjack player Ken Uston really was, there is no doubt that he was the world-renouned expert in one thing: relentless self-promotion. Virtually all professional blackjack players have heard of Uston, and a large number of non-pros have as well. Kenny sure could sound his own horn, and this book was no exception.\\"Oh Lord, oooh you are so big. So absolutely huge. Gosh, we're all really impressed down here, I can tell You.\\"-- Michael Palin as the Chaplain in Monty Python's The Meaning of LifeI attempt to wrap up each blackjack book I review on two levels:(1) The *current* practical value of the specific information provided in the book (e.g., basic strategy, counts, betting strategy, etc.)(2) The *meta-value* of the information contained (meta-value: includes entertainment value, what the book teaches you in general aboutthe game of blackjack, and the practical value of the book given the circumstances of the game at the time the book was written).1 - In practical terms, the Uston book provides accurate basic strategies for multiple-deck games (for all intents and purposes, the only strategy worth learning given the games available today). Forget high-level counts and a side count of aces -- learn the high-low count provided. Spooking info is obsolete, as is all of the early surrender info re: the Atlantic City game. Betting strategy (Kelly betting) is excellent.2 - The meta-value of this book is through the roof. It is extremely entertaining, and simply reading this book will teach you more about the game of blackjack than 99.99% of the players out there. Moreover, you will have a solid insight into how professional blackjack players think.

It actually made me not want to play the game, and as of this post it's been about 8 months since I've played the game. I'll just say, it made me realize that to win at this game it really takes 3 things in abundance: knowledge, time, and money. I had the knowledge before I read this book, but this book really made me realize how important it was to have a ton of cash (to achieve an acceptable risk of ruin) and how important it is to have lots of time to dedicate, in order to get your strategy down and in order to get into the \\"long run\\" of the game.

It is still every bit as applicable today as it was in the 70's when it was developed. Several other simpler count systems that Uston devised are also covered in great detail. Stories of how they won millions of dollars from the casinos are inspiring and enjoyable to read. If you're in it for the stories, pick up one of his other books: Ken Uston on Blackjack.

Many people unfamiliar with card counting imagine it to be a solitary practice where a single player attemts to \\"take on\\" the casino. Ken (and others) viewed card counting as a business and developed a number of innovative (at the time) systems for team play to maximize profit, while minimizing financial risk! Some of the techniques they came up with (and revealed in MDB) are nothing short of genius!The Verdict:If you're trying to learn how to count cards or just become a better blackjack player there are newer books out there better suited for this purpose...But once you've read a couple of those books come back to MDB for a great read on how card counting evolved!"},{"Title":"MILLION DOLLAR BLACKJACK","review":"Book came highly recommended by a friend and has exceeded my expectations.

The majority of the book is a \\"how-to\\" book. There are different counts, flash cards, and lots of advice around how to learn and practice the various techniques. In retrospect, one criticism I have is that Uston doesn't help much when it comes to deciding which of the many counts in the book to learn. The hardest count (Uston APC) is very hard, and has a side-count of aces. I wish I had known when I first read the book that this count is just not worth it when playing multiple decks. (I first read this book when I was in college.)The other part of the book is the stories he tells, and these are great. Just great. You get a real feel for what it must have been like to live that kind of life. I now know that the author was a bit of a blowhard, and took credit for some things that others had done (and assigned blame to boneheaded things he did), but he's the one who took the time and effort to write the book, so he gets to shade history, I guess.Four stars instead of five because there is no way to decide which count to count.

I also found characters torn apart by the past, reliving it at every turn in deep caverns filled with real danger.There are trolls, elves, wyverns and some humans thrown in for a real Dungeons&amp;Dragons time. Anyone familiar with Guy Gavriel Kay's work will notice many of the same references: dockalfar, liosalfar and several others.

However, to the victors may go the spoils, but for Michael ab Arawn, the triumph is tainted by the fact that the two dragons, who repel the forces of darkness, appear to be missing.Regardless of the peril to himself, Michael knows that he must find the missing guardians or else. He begins his quest into the dangerous caverns where the spawn of dragons, the pryf, dwell. All his so-called allies except one have personal agendas, making each of them more dangerous to Michael and his quest than his known enemies, including an evil so malevolent that his eternal soul is at stake. Only Llynya of the Quicken-tree seems to really want to help him succeed, but he wonders what her agenda actually is.DREAM STONE is an incredible experience that takes the reader into a Medieval world of fantasy where the unbelievable feels real. The characters, including the ultimate evil, the pryf, the dragons, and the mortals come across as genuine with realistic motives. The story line is romantic fantasy at its best. Glenna McReynolds has written an epic adventure that will elate fans of fantasy and Medieval romance as a stunning novel worth reading.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dream Stone","review":"ISBN 0553103938 - I am not a fan, at all, of fantasy. Throw in romance and you've pretty much written my worst nightmare of a book. So I was quite surprised to find out that this book was better than that. Still, there are a few things that bother me, even beyond the similarities to Dune.Mychael ab Arawn is the son of the last rulers of Merioneth, now ruled by Rhuddlan, leader of the Quicken-tree clan. Mychael doesn't have all the facts about who he is and his destiny, but he knows that he has a wildness inside of him and the fire of dragon's blood in his veins. He meets and falls for the elf Llynya, who is part of his destiny in more ways than one. Slott, the Troll King, has been freed from an enchantment after 500 years and things are happening in the deep dark that brings Mychael's destiny ever closer. As war looms, he will be called on to call the dragons, and lead the Quicken-tree to victory over the forces arrayed against them - and he can't succeed without Llynya at his side.For the Dune similarities, they're only in the beginning of the book: boy child born to a priestess from a long line of priestesses, who has him even though she was forbidden to do so. There's giant worms, twins, and reference to Transformation. On the weird front, Mychael has dragon's blood from his mother and \\"'Twas what came from allowing love to make a match\\"... which just leaves you wondering about who loved who. For language, there's at least a half dozen uses of \\"friggin\\", which clashes with common language in 1193; McReynolds has made up all kinds of names and language and then comes up with \\"quickety-split\\" for the name of a fast move which seems really lazy and cracked me up every time I read it. The sex scenes were totally unnecessary and pretty badly written but at least they were few and far between, with the first one not showing up until page 302.A small positive note - the author's description of Christianity, in elf maid Llynya's voice: \\"I've heard they tie women to stakes and burn them, and that they keep their God alive in vats of wine and bits of bread and eat and drink his flesh and blood.\\" Makes Christianity look a bit bizarre, which always endears an author to me.

He begins his quest into the dangerous caverns where the spawn of dragons, the pryf, dwell. All his so-called allies except one have personal agendas, making each of them more dangerous to Michael and his quest than his known enemies, including an evil so malevolent that his eternal soul is at stake.

Worse are the changes in the Druid boy, again unanticipated & unprepared for. *I've* written better - & i don't write fantasy to sell.

She possesses a gift for taut imagery: \\"The house of illness is papered with euphemisms.\\" Or, \\"...his promises exited his mind backward, like tottering geishas.\\"With \\"Moral Hazard\\" Ms. Jennings offers, if you will, a morality/mortality tale in which the madness of the world of high finance (appropriate considering Enron) and the delusional states of Alzheimer's disease stand cheek by jowl, emphasizing the similarities.Cath, a freelance writer in her forties, is happily married to Bailey, a creative soul in his mid sixties. \\"He was always doing, always curious,\\" she says. \\"He surrounded me with warmth.\\" When he is diagnosed as being in the early stages of Alzheimer's it becomes quickly apparent that she cannot provide the care he will need on their current income.Therefore she finds work at Niedecker on Wall Street although she is \\"an unlikely candidate for the job of executive speechwriter, to be putting words in the mouths of plutocrats deeply suspicious of metaphors and words of more than two syllables.\\"Cath's guide through the miasma of high finance and cutthroat office maneuvering is Mike, a caustic, voluble risk manager. The two became friends on the day of Nixon's funeral, which was declared a holiday on Wall Street. Mike's tutelage proves invaluable, as he advises her to stop bucking the firm lest she be broken. \\"Round off your sharp edges,\\" he counsels, \\"Turn yourself into an anthropologist.\\"At home she faces the inevitability of Bailey's decline. Initially anti-psychotic medicine is prescribed. Then, after consulting a line up of professionals Cath determines that Bailey must be relegated to a nursing home. He, of course, cries, weeps, \\"recoiling in horror,,,,,beyond comfort\\" when he is left in \\"...a place where behavior was infantile, instincts animal. A place of last things.\\"In due time, while he never makes peace with his surroundings, Bailey does make a friend in the home. She is Dolly, another Alzheimer's patient with a penchant for brilliant colors and black patent leather shoes. When confined to a wheelchair, Bailey finds a second friend in Gwen, a Jamaican private aid hired by Cath. An intuitive caregiver, Gwen lavishes him with affection and treats him with respect.\\"Moral Hazard\\" is a unique story, both moving and incisive as it explores the worlds of trade and sickness with insight, compassion, and humor. A former senior speechwriter at an investment bank, Ms. Jennings well knows of what she writes, and she does it with incomparable precision..."},{"Title":"Moral Hazard: A Novel","review":"This fine novella, a mere 50,000 words or so of taut invective against the greed of aspiring Wall Street shakers, is written in the style of an autobiographical essay, a winning strategy as Jennings juxtaposes the anguish of caring for her husband, suffering from Alzheimer's-driven dementia, with the novel's even more virulent dementia, the craziness and moral grotesqueness of all the avaricious, ego-piggish colleagues the narrator, Cath, must contend with day in and day out as she works as a corporate speech writer. The narrator's voice is sharp, pungent, and never sentimental as she describes her alienation at work and her despair at witnessing her older husband, twenty-five years her senior, disintegrate at the hands of Alzheimer's Disease."},{"Title":"Moral Hazard: A Novel","review":"Cath is a 40ish woman who was once a freelance writer who has been forced into becoming a speechwriter for big business in early 1990s New York. Her husband, who is 20 years older than her, has been stricken with Alzheimer's, and she is in dire need of money to cover the expenses of his care. Some of her connections get her a job with Niedecker Bereche, an investment bank. When she gets to her new job she thinks &quot;I was in the belly of the beast:observe, listen, learn.&quot; You see, her problem is that she is a feminist liberal idealist, so she is out of her element in the cutthroat world of high finance. She soon finds that a lot of what goes on at her work are scams and schemes much like those that brought down Enron. She does manage to find an ally to stem the tide of corruption from infecting her. Mike, a coworker, is also aware of the dangers of capitalism run amok and plans to take down the company from the inside out. The problem is that after working there for a while, Cath has perhaps changed her mind about the evils she once perceived.Moral Hazard by Kate Jennings is an excellent work. It was critical of big business behavior without sacrificing story or preaching. It also retains a human element in the scenes with Cath and her stricken husband as he gradually deteriorates into a man she no longer knows. The satire in it is also humorous. It explodes the myth that Wall Street bankers know what they are doing and reveals them as paranoid, helpless, and corrupt investors who blow with the wind of rumors. I think we have already seen in real life what happens when markets are left to regulate themselves. This book is a great short read."},{"Title":"Moral Hazard: A Novel","review":"MORAL HAZARDRead this book. Even by the second chapter, you'll understand you are entering a world that is mad as a hatter, only that the diagnosed alzheimer patient (the author's husband) is way more lucid than the bulls (the author's bosses) who ram Wall Street down our economic throats. Moral Hazard blinks yellow warning lights even when the words slice into neat little pats of cold butter on warm toast at breakfast. This makes the story edible in deceptively gentle prose. What seems like a peculiar combination of subjects is - dementia on Wall Street countered by a beloved husband's alzheimers' trials and indignities. Somehow the two stories fit hand in glove and come out swinging the reader into black-eyed shame for our dual neglect of an aging population, and withering pension funds ground into dust by tassle-shoed Big Toes. There's more, but then, that would be telling. Read Moral Hazard for yourself. I did. Twice."},{"Title":"Moral Hazard: A Novel","review":"Kate Jennings lived in New York when she wrote this beautiful book.

Not very often do you get new insights into the theories of education and the art of mentoring. Usually teaching seminars are just tune-ups on the basics. There was a lot of truth that seemed intuitive in Mr. Stuart's findings, but his approach is definitely unique, and I greatly appreciated hearing his thoughts. I think his ideas are useful for teachers who struggle with at-risk students (both the privileged and non-privileged types), and as far as I can tell that's pretty much all of us.

But don't expect a lot of feel-good psycho-babble. This view of child-relating is clear and challenging. The \\"at promise perspective\\" has given me a renewed hope, not only for my own kids, but for myself, and for those I previously would have viewed as \\"hopeless\\".

A great companion to \`Stalin's Generals' by Shukman(editor), this book tells the stories of every rank of Germanys command in WW II. Separate sections detail the \`Anti-Nazi Generals', the \`Desk Generals' the Fieldmarshalls the \`Battlefront' commanders and the \`innovators'. Every German general and military leader is mentioned. From Guderian, the man who created \`Blitzkrieg' to Rommell the \`Desert Fox to Paulus who surrendered Stalingrad as well as luminaries like Rundstedt and Kesselring.These wonderful biographical sketches help one understand the diversity in command of Hitler's war machine. The generals ranged from the totally incompetent to dire hard Nazi's to professional soldiers like Rommell. A number of the Generals were captured or killed before the war ended and many were tried for war crimes. A wonderful book, very well written and one that allows you to jump from place to place since each sketch is authored by a separate expert.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Hitler's Generals","review":"Hitler's Generals is a collection of biographical essays on 26 of German top military commanders during the Third Reich. They ranged from political generals like Keital to one of the Great Captains of history, von Manstein. Each biographical essay was written by different author who appears to have a in-depth knowledge of their subject. They were able in very few words, gives us a pretty good insights of these German commanders who fought for the Third Reich, some willingly, some unwillingly. The indivdual essays were written on the individual. Anyone looking for in-depth military history lessons should look else where.I was bit surprised by the latitude of some of these mini-biographies. Josef Sepp Dietrich, for example, appears to have a very much of a professional career, an interesting contrast to many accounts of him I have read in the past which painted him as Hitler's favorite \\"street thug\\" who knows nothing of military matter. It was interesting to note that Walter Gorlitz who wrote on General Alfred Jodl who was hung at Nuremberg forgot to mention that the German courts in 1953 exonerated Jodl, only Nuremberg defendant to be clear like that. Important omission considering that Gorlitz wrote rather sympathetically on Jodl. I found these mini-biographies to be insightful, interesting and entertaining reading material. A lot of information here without weighting you down with details.An excellent book which gives you a quick study of top men Hitler relied upon to wage war in Europe."},{"Title":"Hitler's Generals","review":"A couple of reviewers have expressed disappointment in this book because it didn't go more deeply into military strategy, but that is exactly the reason why a more general audience will find this book as interesting as I did. I found myself skimming over the esoteric (read boring) battle details and absorbing the personal ones because they were much more revealing of the men beneath the uniforms. Who would have suspected that the imposing von Rundsteadt once considered being an actor and loved to read mystery novels. This may not be the book for strict tactical historians, but it is a very interesting read for everybody else."},{"Title":"Hitler's Generals","review":"\\"Hitler's Generals\\", edited by Correlli Barnett, contains many well-written and thoughtful essays of Hitler's military commanders in World War II. From these pages a greater portrait of the German military, and indeed the entire Third Reich emerges.The essays are divided into five parts that categorize the subjects effectively: I. The Anti-Nazi Generals; II. The Desk Generals; III. The Feldherren; IV. The Battlefront Generals; & V. The Innovators. The essays within each section offer brilliant sketches of German generalship.The work overall tells the story of brave men willing to fight and die for their country, but only too willing to fall under the spell of Hitler's personality. The reader grows angrier and angrier that more generals didn't follow the example of Ludwig Beck, who quit as Army Chief of Staff because of opposition to Hitler's reckless policies. The incident is recorded in Robert O'Neil's \\"Fritsch, Beck and the Fuhrer.\\" Brian Bond's \\"Brauchitsch\\" and Barry A. Leach's \\"Halder\\" show two talented military administrators sidelined as Hitler grabbed for more power by inserting himself further and further down the chain of command. Perhaps the most compelling essay, and the most sympathetic general, is Samuel W. Mitcham Jr.'s \\"Kleist\\", as it details the Field Marshal's attempts to extirpate his army from the Caucuses in the wake of the Stalingrad disaster.Overall this work is filled with fascinating sketches of German military leadership. Important lessons are learned from studying the lives of these brilliant, flawed men."},{"Title":"Hitler's Generals","review":"This is a useful overview of some of Germany's leading generals in the years leading up to World War II and their performance in that conflict. This is a volume that looks at the \\"good\\" (e.g., Rommel, Guderian, Manstein, Kesselring), the \\"bad\\" (e.g., Paulus), and the \\"ugly.\\" (e.g., Keitel and Jodl). As such, it provides context for understanding the actions, decisions, and effects of a series of major general officers.Is this book a whitewash? Hardly. Generals such as Senger are portrayed as trying to ignore the atrocities that they knew were happening and rationalizing their unwillingness to do anything. The desk generals, such as Keitel and Jodl are portrayed in less than a flattering light. The fates of generals who were not wholeheartedly Nazi is part of the context of the behavior, perhaps, of some of these generals (witness the fates of generals such as Beck and Fritsch).Interesting, too, is the discussion of the commanding field generals, such as Rundstedt, Manstein, and Kesselring. One wonders what might have been if there were more Manstein's and fewer Nazi loyalists in high command. But, given the micromanagement of Hitler and his desire for pliant commanders, that seems improbable. Another interesting element of the volume is its consideration of battlefront generals--some of whom, like Rommel, were excellent and some of whom, like Paulus, fell short.The last two chapters examine \\"innovators,\\" one of whom is the well known Guderian, whose armored perspective was revolutionary and not always appreciated by more traditional generals. His ongoing conflicts with Hitler are aptly illustrated (and see Guderian's autobiography, \\"Panzer Leader,\\" for more detail). Student was for the airborne forces the equivalent of Guderian with armor.This is a useful volume, with relatively short chapters detailing the talents (or lack of same) and the courage (or lack of same) and the accomplishments (or lack of same) of a wide array of German generals."},{"Title":"Hitler's Generals","review":"I enjoyed the personal details of the generals profiled; it tended to give you a better understanding of the men without having to read a full biography on each one. I would have liked to see more of a comparison made with American generals just to better my understanding of the men. I did come away from the book with a positive view of the generals highlighted, they were professional and competent and not a bunch of jack booted Nazi's out killing any innocent they came across. Then again this book dealt with the top of the class, the type that for the most part did not get relegated to camp duty. The most disturbing observation I made was that here was a very strong, intelligent group of people that were lead to ultimate destruction in only a few years - if it could happen there... This book delivers on what it states it will, an overview of so of the men that made the Germany military successful. It is a good first step if you are looking to increase your knowledge of the area."},{"Title":"Hitler's Generals","review":"By focusing on a number of different generals, this book lets you see all the personal and professional conflicts that hid under the German army's apparent uniformity, and, by doing so, it helps you understand one of the great tragedies of the Second World War: how a civilized country marched all the way down to its own destruction. It is perhaps no light reading, but I can think of no single book that will give you a better understanding of the German army's attitude towards the war and towards Hitler."},{"Title":"Hitler's Generals","review":"A comprehensive and detailed story of the men who were most influential towards Hitler but did not want or did not were in the position of taking the lead of the war.

It may not be detail as a bibliography but it is plenty to read for 20 Hitler's famous generals. This book cited the brilliance of creative strategies from these generals in the opening assault of Western and Eastern Europe to defending their way back to Berlin. Not to mention military blunder and a plot to kill hitler by anti-nazi generals example Rommel, Speidel, Stupnagel and Witzleben. And why did they want to assasinate Hitler? As for my recommendation, this book is a great knowledge for beginner readers who need further information behind Hitlers's generals and World War 2!"},{"Title":"Hitler's Generals","review":"Great read and perspective! It is a commentary on the broad spectrum and human condition.

Yes, it could! There's only one problem. It's boring. While it covers the lives of the generals, such as Witzleben, Stulpnagel, Fritch and Beck in excrutiating detail, it somehow fails to get the repect and interest of the reader. It's too much about the Generals' relationship with each other and Hitler. I think most people would prefer to read of their military achievements.Personally, I could have gotten a better book for $20. That's all."},{"Title":"Hitler's Generals","review":"This is really heavy reading, because the book talks about 26 Generals and Field Marshalls in Hitler's age, but the chapters are each written by a differente historian, which sometimes is confusing and boring.

The first section of the book (about a hundred pages) provides the most comprehensive argument for the independence of the Gospel of Thomas from the canonical Four Gospels in a form accessible to the general reader. With this, Patterson refutes the claim that the Gospel of Thomas is a worthless second century Gnostic epitome that just put together a mish-mash of biblical quotes. Instead, Patterson argues, the Gospel of Thomas represents an autonomous tradition about Jesus, confirmatory and complementary of the synoptic tradition. The second part of the book deals with the setting of the Gospel of Thomas, which Patterson portrays as itinerant radicalism in Syria in the second half of the first century. The final chapter concerns the importance of the Gospel of Thomas for the historical Jesus. Patterson maintains that the Gospel of Thomas provides fresh evidence against the apocalyptic portrait of Jesus, because the Gospel of Thomas does not have any of the end-time speculation found in the synoptic Gospels. I recommend this book highly to any student of early Christianity."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Thomas and Jesus (Foundations & Facets)","review":"This book was written by a professor and proves for me that the Gospel of Thomas was a separate tradition and not a gnostic corruption of the biblical gospels. Patterson goes into the linguistics of the Coptic Gospel of Thomas and the Greek biblical Gospels to show that Thomas stands alone in its own tradition.This book was intended more for the highly educated with Coptic and Greek interwoven with the text at the beginning of the book. I can read Koine Greek and I had a difficult time reading and understanding the first half of the book due to the Coptic. You are are curious about the Gospel of Thomas this book will educate you.

Their first date was wonderful, and their second was...Wow...(blushable)...I must say that the night in the tent was a bit over the top...I'm thinking there was a lot of sensuality in this book...The kisses and other romance scenes were wonderful, but I had to cringe at the tent scene...Some places, I think the couple acted a bit worldly. For instance, his buying the new car...And I thought him being a beach bum for awhile was kinda...uh...not good (for lack of finding the right word for it). I loved it when he told her father off!

Though, I did like the ending scene when they were kissing and talking in the hammock...how romantic is that!And the Prince and Princess were a very nice touch.Though I had a few issues with this story, I had to give it a five for entertainment and making me sigh at the end of the story!"},{"Title":"Angel in Disguise (Love Inspired #98)","review":"&quot;Angel In Disguise&quot; was a pleasure to read. Though there were many serious life situations, it was well written with the main characters of Pete and Sunny the key to handling them with humor and love.The character of Pete Maquire was well representive of someone whose life has been altered by chronic pain, and disability. It is a subject that so many experience, but so few who don't experience, understand. It affects you mentally and physically. It was great to see how and Sunny Keegan could accept and love him, even with his handicap.Sunny's personality was a joy also. Both were a testament to what God can do in one's life, if we allow Him in.Pete and Sunny played off each other well and it was pleasent to read a book where the couple were not constantly fighting to stop the relationship that was unfolding throughout the story. The humor that was weaved throughout the book was wonderful.This book is a definite pick me up, and it makes you wish there was a 2nd to follow through."},{"Title":"Ways of Reading: An Anthology for Writers","review":"The book arrived on time, but it's an old version. The page numbers are different and it doesn't include some readings. The pages are also folded and written all over."},{"Title":"Ways of Reading: An Anthology for Writers","review":"This is the \\"default\\" textbook for the sophomore English Composition course I am currently teaching. If I had been given a choice of textbook, I would definitely not have chosen this one. When I teach freshman English Comp, Business Writing and Technical Writing courses, I inform my students that they should write clearly, eschew difficult vocabulary and context in an ill-advised effort to \\"sound\\" clever, and avoid using ten words when two or three will convey the intended meaning just as well (or better). I'm disappointed to find that all of these concepts are flouted by several of the authors and selections presented in this anthology.Perhaps this is because I enjoy reading the works of Shaw more than Shakespeare, or because I grew up during the Punk/New Wave Era instead of the Baby Boomer formative years, but when I read the glowing reviews of this book, I think, to paraphrase Shaw, that educators give it good reviews not because they like it, but because they think they ought to like it. They praise lengthy sentences and unclear prose because they believe they owe it to their positions as academics and intellectuals.This is not to say that there is no place for these works, or indeed that all of them are poorly written. I would certainly recommend some of the essays, and Eady's poems, as a springboard for discussing racism in American society. In addition, one could use Paulo Freire's thoughts on teaching, in conjunction with Richard Rodriguez's anecdotes on being a motivated student in an unmotivated school, to examine the problems of educating individuals in a group setting. Having stated this, such topics are not always appropriate for an English Composition course; for sociology and educational psychology, yes, but for teaching principles of good writing, no.However, the works of Foucault, McKeon and Appiah are more confusing than enlightening for the average college sophomore, and I have found that, rather than encouraging discussion, a great deal of time is wasted on trying to work out what the point of the writing is. If we want to encourage our students to read closely and respond to texts, there are better choices out there.Ultimately, the purpose of English Composition courses is to teach writing, not to tell students, as the editors of this anthology do, that the book's selections are difficult to understand but they are to make the best of it. This is condescending at best and utterly discouraging at worst. In either case, it is not the best way to bring out students' writing skills."},{"Title":"Ways of Reading: An Anthology for Writers","review":"I really don't understand the bad reviews this book is getting here. It's simply a large collection of creative academic essays by different authors, ranging in quality from good to fantastic. This book revealed to me that creativity, humor and personal narrative could enhance and deepen academic writing. These essays suggest radically different ways of looking at the world and leave you as a thoughtful reader to make your own intellectual choices. Coming out of high school, I had no idea that essays could be so good and accomplish so much.I still think about the things I learned from this book all the time. Clifford Geertz's essay on Balinese Cockfighting fundamentally changed my understanding of the role of art and public ritual in society. Patricia Limerick's essay on the Modoc Wars explains in ten pages everything you really need to know about the destruction of the native american way of life and on top of that it's really entertaining.I recommend this book to absolutely anyone who likes thinking.

I now see why everyone hates colleges because they charge thousands of dollars for each class to shovel this useless crap into our minds.

Ways of Reading loves to clarify every other sentence how brilliant, sophisticated, and original these authors are. In reality the authors present very simple concepts that most highschoolers can grasp by their Junior year. But the difference is that because they think they are brilliant, sophisticated, and original the authors add loads of crap just to make it lengthey and boring. As said in previous reviews, all contents in this book can each take up a page if they get to the point. As for the set up of the book, it is also terrible. Introductions for each of these stories is two pages at the most, not near enough to understand these looney authors, after reading, you are given four \\"questions\\" that are at least two paragraphs long and it seems sometimes they forget to ask a question. In the back of the book are Seven \\"sequences\\" focused on developing the reader in some way. Because this book comes out with a new edition like every year(NINTH EDITION now!) you are never going to be able to complete these \\"sequences\\" entirley so the teacher basically just gives you random parts of each, so basically the whole book is pointless to read and turns out to be a complete wast of money.

I generally enjoy English classes because they are usually a chance to discuss things and talk about differing opinions. Well, that's not the case with this book. Every essay in this book is by some radical leftist. The &quot;varying perspectives&quot; talked about in the other reviews are simply the different perspectives of a lesbian feminist and a Brazilian communist, not actual differences in their beliefs. This book is basically a leftist handbook meant to tell the &quot;proper opinion&quot; on every issue. These essays aren't even particularly good. Many are poorly written, ostensibly to make a point. Now, some of the essays do have value, but taken all together they constitute not an attempt to show the best and most useful works in the English language but rather to convince students of a certain point of view.

I have found that the students would rather talk in generals and universals than with the intricate arguments that some of the writers brilliantly present.This is one of the those books that if you decide to use it in a class, then you better be prepared to not only sink with the ship but also be able to provide an inspiring tour of the ruins."},{"Title":"Ways of Reading: An Anthology for Writers","review":"This tremendously rich and rewarding book is probably the best collection of essays, with the best apparatus (the most interesting questions, the best ideas for writing) of any teachable collection out there.I teach at the University of California, Berkeley, and use this book, as do a number of my colleagues.

Although some pieces are better than others, Barthes' piece is more exciting and informative than Marianne Hirsch's writing on the way that children are used in photography.

This book contains arguments about real life events that occured recently and discusses them in a very intellectual level. One of the best things about this book is that you can compare the essays within with other essays in the book.

The \\"short\\" stories in the book are extremely lengthy and wordy. The authors take multiple pages to state what would have been sufficiently written in a short paragraph.

The passages require thought and reflection from the readers, which is good, but I do not find it helpful as a textbook for an English class. We are required to read texts that are wordy, yet expected to write with concise thoughts and statements. I think that a book that modeled the style of writing we as students are expected to utilize would be a better fit.

This has generally proven helpful. At times, as in the case with this story, it has set my expectations to a certain level. The glowing praise that this book received had my expectations set to which I thought I was going to read something special. Unfortunately, I did not find this to be the case. In general I do not prefer a story when the villains are revealed early so that is always a bit of a letdown. The main character is likeable and flawed. The subplots surrounding his personal and professional issues do add to the mix but ultimately it simply became a chase novel. Overall the story moved into much familiar territory so it is hard to give anything other than a lukewarm recommendation."},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"I listened to an audio version of this, read by James Daniels for Brilliance Audio. This was a very fine read, direct and unadorned, but never dull. In the main story, the police track an unusual pair of thrill-killers, a sadistic psycho aided by his hopeless loser girlfriend, who prey on teenagers. There are a few interesting subplots that greatly enrich the story. In one, Algonquin Bay (Ontario) cop John Cardinal may be getting quietly investigated by his low-key but very effective partner, Lise Delorme. In another, we see the pathetic reality of the killers' sad lives and stupid relationship. The killers' identities are revealed pretty early on, and suspense is generated by whether they will be caught, and how much damage they will succeed in doing. And in yet another of Blunt's interesting subplots, Cardinal deals with his seriously ill wife and struggles to pay for his dauter's Ivy League education. The dialogue rings true, and painful moments (such as the scene in which the 2 cops listen to an audio cassette of a murder) are not drawn out, but not shrunk from either. Blunt's style is low-key but effective, and fits the material well."},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"This is a masterpiece by an extremely talented author. From the first to the last page he takes us on a tension/pathos-filled journey in the wilds of northern Ontario. The Algonquin Bay P.D. that Blunt gives us is as riven with fantastic characters as Wambaugh's LAPD or other fictional P.D.'s of note. John Cardinal and Lise Delorme, to my mind, are wonderful, strong, three-D characters who drive this thriller at warp speed. All the characters, good and bad, are very well-developed and the plot is realistic, credible and unfolds at just the right pace.

He did something bad a while back, and although it was bad it was for the right reasons, he still has a guilty conscience.Algonquin Bay turns out to be a great setting for a murder mystery. It gives us more than just the familiar \\"track down the killer\\" drama because the added obstacles of finding clues yet not being able to act on them until results came back from laboratories hundreds of miles away. Combined with a flawed major character, himself under investigation and he knows it, this makes for a wonderfully rich novel.The evil force that is the killer may be a cardboard and predictable, but the surrounding characters are all well drawn. So that's my one great criticism of the novel - the killer didn't engender any fear in my as the reader. I would have liked him to be more personal, to have a part of me in him, something redeemable that I can relate to. For all his flaws, Dean Koontz does that well, and I think if Giles Blunt were to frame up his villain better, he'd be in the top rung of mystery writers.It was a well-done first effort and a real page turner.

This is the first in his series featuring Algonquin Bay Detective John Cardinal, and the beginning days of his being partnered up with the prickly Lise Delorme, the only female detective in this far reaches Canadian town. A serial killer is at work in Algonquin Bay, and the novel starts with the grisly discovery of the remains of Katie Bell, completely frozen in a mineshaft entrance on Windigo Island. Katie's disappearance is quickly linked to the subsequent disappearance of another local child, Billy LaBelle, and then to the remains found belonging to Todd Curry, a traveling young man who stopped one night in Algonquin Bay but never left. This is a stark novel, and Blunt goes to great lengths to bring out the frozen and monotonous beauty of a deep Canadian winter. The subject matter is bleak as well, one murdered child after the other discovered, but the book is saved from tedium by the great characters in John Cardinal and Lise Delorme. This is really John's book, and he is revealed, layer by imperfect layer, as a good cop, a good man/husband/father, but not a perfect cop. A dark secret from his past is slowly eating away at his sanity, and the new partner, Delorme, is really hooked up with him to ferret out his secret for Internal Affairs. What she finds, and how she handles it, sets a good stage for subsequent installments of their story.

Once the body of 13-year-old Katie Pine is found in a mineshaft, John Cardinal is redeemed. He had been assigned her missing-persons case and suspected foul play, but no one listened. Now he's in charge of the murder investigation and partnered with Lise Delorme. Transferred from Special Investigations, Delorme has been assigned to double duty: solve the crimes with Cardinal and furtively investigate her partner for corruption. Soon other teenage bodies turn up, and they know their dealing with a serial killer. Will Cardinal solve the case while also worrying about his wife in a mental institution, the expense of his daughter's Yale education, and the pending corruption investigation against him? Blunt grabs you from the first page; his writing is masterful-precise, and yet, novel dialogue; two flawed, but well-developed characters; and a multi-layered tale set in the most atmospheric of locales. While the crimes are truly heinous and gory, the suspenseful ending is perfectly gratifying."},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"This thriller is set in the bleak winter of Canada's Algonquin Bay. The weather serves to act as a mirror of the mood of the local police force after they discover a body out on the bay.We are introduced to Detective John Cardinal who, we learn, had been obsessed with a number of cases of missing youths. Cardinal was sure the cases were related and could turn out to be more than just missing persons. His superiors disagreed and ended up taking him off the cases. When a body is found, it looks as though it could be one of the missing people, so Cardinal is rushed back onto the case again. The greatest fear of the Algonquin Police Department could actually be reality - they may have a serial killer in the city.When Cardinal is reassigned to work the homicide, he is also given a new partner. Lise Delorme has come straight from Special Operations to help out on the case and, unknown to Cardinal, is secretly investigating him thinking he may have been tipping off a known criminal in return for payoffs.Around halfway through the book we are introduced to the killer and get an insight into his world. The pace of the book suddenly steps up a notch as the two storylines begin to run in parallel to one another, comparing Cardinal's progress in the investigation with the actual focus of his attention.Tension is heightened by allowing us to be privy to the killer's identity, particularly when he takes a new victim. The case then turns into a race against time.I found this to be an excellent thriller combining a tight storyline and methodical detective work with a strong sub-plot that threatens to unravel the whole investigation. The uncertainty provided by this sub-plot was very effective in creating doubt in the reader's mind as to what the outcome could possibly be."},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"Time is a precious commodity so there's always some degree of risk to start a novel by an author I'm unfamiliar with. In this case, the time devoted to read enough to decide if it was worth continuing was short. The story of an investigation of the murders/disappearances of three young people starts with the discovery of a body while describing the main characters in the setting of bitter cold Algonquin Bay, Canada. The cold winter weather is expertly described and matches the cold, detached feelings of the heartless killers. Once they are introduced, the pace of the story quickens. The technique of alternating between Cardinal and Delorme ( the primary investigators ) and the killers and their captive heightens the tension and accelerates the pace so by the time the storyline is clearly established, the investigation is in overdrive. The subplot allows the reader to witness the internal struggle of conscience in one of the characters and the total emptiness and lack of conscience within the other killer. The comparison offers enough contrast to lift the story above the run of the mill thriller by offering the reader some substance and material for reflection. To put it simply, invest the time, it'll pay off."},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"I read this book when it first came out -- the first in what would become a series about Canadian police detective John Cardinal who, in this book, has been investigating a missing-girl case for almost half a year.

This book, with its details of torture, and its random chapters told from the point of view of the killer, is not easy to stomach.

Detective Sergeant John Cardinal, an investigator with the Algonquin Bay Police Department, is summoned to the site of a body found in the Manitou Islands. The victim's remains have decayed and been mutilated by animals, and are frozen in ice. They are the first tangible evidence in a string of disappearances, all involving young people, that has haunted the isolated community in recent months. He and his partner, Sergeant Lise Delorme, are assigned the case. Complicating matters, Delorme has been ordered to look into Cardinal's personal life, to discover just how it is that a small-town police officer can afford to send his daughter to Yale University to study art. And John Cardinal has other baggage: his wife Catherine has been institutionalized once again in the psychiatric wing of the local hospital, suffering from bipolar disease.In the course of his investigation Cardinal will wrestle with his feelings about his wife, cross paths with his arrogant superior, be drawn into a case that involves a secret from his past that will threaten to end his career, and look down the barrel of a crazed killer.In Forty Words for Sorrow Giles Blunt skillfully explores the full gamut of the human psyche. He lays bare the sordid souls and twisted thinking of sociopathic killers; but he also examines, with great sensitivity and insight, the range of emotions experienced by those who suffer from bipolar disorder, and family members who must somehow cope with their afflictions. His characters are believable and his protagonists, John Cardinal and Lise Delorme, are fresh and engaging. Forty Words for Sorrow is a deftly-constructed, literate tale. It has a puzzle at its heart, with sufficient police-procedural forensics to satisfy even the most intransigent CSI buff, and enough suspense to keep you reading until the final, gripping, conclusion.

I read it eagerly when it first came out so the details are hazy but the characters aren't. This just came up as recommended reading on my Amazon screen so I was reminded how much I liked the story. How can anyone think the characters and situations are cardboard when Cardinal has remained with me all these years and the dilemma he faces daily with his bipolar photographer wife, Catherine? There's a deceptive easiness to the pace, similar to the smooth honey way Walter Mosely stories flow out. But things happen in an accelerating pace and keep you turning pages right to the end. The bleak effect of the landscape, the bitter cold, have stuck with me as well.BluntNo Dice (Volume 1)"},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"Unable to sleep one winter night, I began reading this book at one a.m. while wind whistled and wailed outside the windows. At five a.m., I was nearly finished, having been completely entranced by Giles Blunt's story and its fascinating-yet-flawed characters.

Leads turned up no evidence of foul play, and, after an exhaustive search, Cardinal was told he had spent too much time and money on the case.

The process of finding those responsible for her death, and the death of other children whose disappearance mirror Katie's is the path of Cardinal's vindication and absolution.Cardinal is exactly the kind of protagonist a reader can relate to, yet pity.

A prior reviewer complained that the &quot;killers&quot; were revealed midway through the story &amp; that this detracted from the suspense; I think this misses the point of the story. For me, the suspense was heightened as the Cardinal &amp; Delorme, the investigating police detectives, follow-up on leads that bring them slowly closer to the killers &amp; the latest victim; I was reminded of suspense classics like &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; which used this same style of building psychological tension. Highly recommended !"},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"First off, let me say that this book does not follow the typical formula for a mystery and is far more character-oriented than action oriented, at least at the beginning. And then there's the fact that the reader is introduced to the killers fairly early on, taking any mystery out of who they are. This one has been called a &quot;thinking person's thriller&quot; and the description fits.But none of this takes anything away from this wonder of a book, winner of Britain's Silver Dagger Award for Fiction - and deservably so. Author Giles Blunt brings each character to life with an expert hand.Blunt has the rare ability to make readers care about his characters, flaws and all, so much so that I deliberately read the last chapters slowly, not wanting the book to end.And what people inhabit this book! There's the basically good but lonely cop who may or may not have a dark secret in his past, the fellow detective who is covertly investigating him, the pair of skewed killers who prey on hapless adolescents with a veneer of friendliness which masks their ruthless desires and tortures.I confess that I didn't open this one with high expectations, having read far too many works by first-time authors that just didn't hold my interest, had serious flaws or were lacking in depth, solid characters, a believable story line. So it was an delightful surprise to have my expectations overturned. I look forward to reading more books by Blunt."},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"\\"One of the finest crime novels I've ever read,\\" raves Jonathan Kellerman, according to the front cover of my edition. My first thought is that Jonathan needs to get out more, or at least widen his reading. Giles Blunt's debut police procedural, set in the chilling Canadian town of Algonquin Bay, is hardly groundbreaking. At times it's almost comical in the massive leaps of illogic, near-supernatural forensics and sheer coincidence by which the police finally solve their case. Nevertheless, it's a very engaging read. I found myself devouring it. I think this was mainly because Blunt takes the unusual step of revealing the identity of his killers barely 100 pages in. Far from pole-axing the novel, it actually gives it legs. Exploring the psyches of killers, victims and cops in almost equal measure adds both a narrative and psychological richness you don't often find in this genre. Still, the novel is let down by unnecessarily silly plotting and a hero, John Cardinal, who has the requisite private angst but not really enough going for him as a cop to make him interesting. Blunt's language is perfectly clean and functional, just as the genre requires, and is liberally sprinkled with wry, hardboiled observations, but it doesn't break any new ground - except for perhaps the first published usage of the word \\"mucilaginous\\" (p.362). I suppose I should confess that I rarely read crime fiction, and only picked this up because I liked the title (which turns out to be all but irrelevant) and the synopsis on the back cover. (Publishing house wage-slaves take note: your work matters!) Would I pick up the next John Cardinal mystery? Yes, but only because Blunt was a staff writer on the peerless \\"Law & Order\\" and I'd be hoping a little more of that old magic shines through."},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"This is the first mystery I've read by Giles Blunt, and overall it was pretty good. The beginning was a bit slow going - I wasn't grabbed into the story until about half-way through - but the storyline was quite good, and the characters were well described.\\"Forty Words For Sorrow\\" is about a series of murders occuring in the Algonquin area - a VERY cold, snowy place, especially in winter - the time the murders were being committed.The perpetrators are actually a young couple, but they have a thirst for killing that seems insatiable, and an ability to project the type of personality that other's like & feel comfortable with - hence there ability to get victims.Some parts of the story are quite gorey, and there were actually times where I felt sick to my stomach by the details provided - maybe it's my weak stomach, or maybe over-kill, I just don't know.They mystery to the story is whether or not the \\"bad guys\\" will be caught in time to save a life - whether or not the police can put together the small number of clues that have been left behind. There is also another smaller mystery surrounding a pay-off taken by someone on the squad. Although this part has nothing to do with the murders, it makes sense in the context of the story - I don't want to reveal anything more about this, as I don't want to ruin it for you.If you like a good mystery, and don't mind trudging through part of the book to get to the exciting parts, than I would recommend this book to you. It's a good mystery with a great storyline & characters, you just have to have the patience to get there."},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"Blunt writes well &amp; keeps the reader enthralled through out.

I further suspect that the villains herein are fictional spawn of Canada's gruesome twosome Bernardo/ Homolka.Giles Blount's first novel is a \\"captive\\"ating tale of the evil some men (and women) do.

When reading it you really juat want to shiver...he mirrors the setting really well in his cold and calculating plot.The plot here is certainly very original, which i tend to like in a serial killer novel. However, the writing did seem to lack assurance...it felt nervous and even though it wasn't. a bit underdeveloped. Some of it niggled me, and didn't really sit right. This book won the English CWA Silver Dagger award for crime fiction, and had excellent reviews. So i was expecting and absolutely sensational read. It didn't quite live up to expectation. it is still a really really good thriller, though. Just perhaps not quite as stupendous as i'd expected. The blurb didn't help. The english versions is somewhat misleading...anyway, with that said, this is still a very good book, especially for a first novel (i'm discounting \\"Cold Eye\\" his \\"real\\" first book.) The plot IS orignal, and the landscape is evoked well in the atmosphere and overall coldness of the plot.John Cardinal is a really likeable character, and i am looking very much forward to reading about him once more. he is slightly flawed, but for all the right reasons. You really feel for him. He's compelling and interesting. His fierce loyalty to his wife is also a wonder to behold.There are some other great characters too, but Cardinal is the one who really stands out. one of the best and most well developed leads to a book i've read in a long while.The plot is good, original, but the motives of the villains weren't really explained fully enough...just glossed over. However, there were some really great twists, and a stunning climax.This is an extremely worthy book, and any fan of this genre should really like it. It reminded somewhat of Mo Hayder's (an excellent English thriller writer) debut \\"Birdman\\". You try to be too original and it just doesn't read as well it might. The two have real similarities here. However, this book is a bit less disturbing than Hayders. Blunt really is very similar in style to Hayder, and he has great potential. with her second book Mo Hayder poroved to me that she was the best serial killer thriller writer we have in Britain. I believe that Giles Blunt may well prove that he is the best from Canada.Well worth a read."},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"Do we really need another murder mystery with a problem-ridden, flawed and driven cop chasing yet another serial murderer? Forty Words of Sorrow proves the exception to the rule. This is an excellent book which on the surface mystery readers may find all too familiar, but with extraordinary writing Blunt breaks new ground with an old formula...all in small town Canada. John Cardinal is a cop with problems, lots of 'em, (including a partner investigating him for corruption), who, with the discovery of a frozen corpse, must resume the hunt for a serial killer. The reader learns the killer's identity early in the book, the mystery is how Cardinal solves the crimes with everything else exploding in his life and Blunt handles this admirably."},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"I bought this book thinking it was a little different than the average mystery (Patterson, Cornwell, etc., although great authors), as far as being more toward a &quot;literature&quot; nature, from the reviews I have read.The book at first was scary, especially when you first come upon the culprits of the childs' murders; it gives you the creeps.But unfortunately, the book sells out and is, indeed, just another mystery off the drugstore bookshelf. There is no irony or profundity that I was expecting. The ending just made me say &quot;So what?&quot; What is so fascinating here? There was really no element of surprise. It is predictable when you find out who the killers are; big deal after that. It also is unnessessarily sadistic describing the children's torture, which does not add anything thrilling to the story, it just makes it, well, sadistic for its own sake. Also , I felt the author was too negative of women: Women who are pretty are sluts; women who are ugly are malicious, bitter and desperate; and a woman who is a just an average, good person suffers a breakdown for no apparent reason.Disappointing."},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"This book was a great read.

Giles Blunt has written the kind of novel many mystery writers would \\"kill\\" for...Tony Hillerman even admits it.What makes this such a great book is the development of the characters: John Cardinal, a good man but not necessarily a good cop; Lise Delorme, a special forces internal investigator who is partnered with Cardinal to find out if he is on the take; Edie Somas, a homely, love-starved woman who turns to crime and evil to make up for her loneliness; Eric Fraser, a merciless and cruel killer, who uses Edie to help him attain his goals; there are so many interesting and complex characters in supporting roles, it's impossible to single them all out.Blunt creates an atmospheric of unbelievable depth; one can feel the frigid environment, see the breaths of the characters.Dark and disturbing, it is still a tremendous first novel for this talented Candian writer. I couldn't find a thing wrong with it.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"This book hooked me on the first page, with its description of just what winter is like in Algonquin Bay, Ontario, in what even Canadians call &quot;the North.&quot; John Cardinal is a police detective with a Past and a string of murders of adolescents to solve. His partner is Lise Delorme, six years in Special Investigations (i.e., political cases and what we in the U.S. would call Internal Affairs), whose assignment is to investigate Cardinal, as well as to help solve the murders. So far, so good. Blunt gets you into Cardinal's mind, into the personality of this frozen little town, into the relationship between the local cops and the RCMP . . . and then he blows it completely. One-third of the way into the story, he tells you who the killer is. A serious error on the part of the author. What began as a potentially first-rate murder mystery degenerates into a mediocre thriller. At the two-thirds mark, I gave it up."},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"O Canada, your Ontario setting was the only good thing in this novel. Everything else was... well, blunt. Come on, Canadians; the stereotype is that you're rather witty - act like it! (D)"},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"Algonquin Bay in northern Ontario is not just bitterly arctic---it spends the long winter snowbound and the cold is a living force that invades like a sledge hammer. Could-be, dirty cop John Cardinal has spent a fruitless, expensive five months trying to locate missing 13-year old Katy Pine. His credibility is suspect with his superiors. When Cardinal finds the missing girl brutally murdered in a mineshaft near an isolated lake, he is given the dubious honor of leading the investigation of this clueless, highly publicized crime. He is assigned a partner who may or may not be investigating his background. The killings increase in number along with the frustrations of the police force.The pace picks up a bizarre momentum when the killer is brought into the narrative. His machinations always are two jumps ahead of the authorities, and he seems hopelessly invincible. This tale is for the steely of heart, for the violence is graphic and horrific. Yet there are light moments as when the police are questioning a well-known burglar and asking him about his known associates. Burglar says in tones of disgust \\"If I wanted to MEET people, I'd be a mugger.\\" One of Cardinal's fellow detectives is a constant complainer, and his rants about everything from the Mounties to his ex-wife are brilliant, ferocious and unending.\\"Forty Words For Sorrow\\" has an \\"it's not over till it's over\\" gambit that enchants me every time. The suspense becomes well nigh unbearable, and entirely unpredictable. I'd nominate this book for best title of the year and certainly one of the very good reads."},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"An excellent police procedural that takes place in one of the most overlooked locales in the genre. Here in the states, we're quite familiar with the top British and American mystery writers, but Australian and Canadian authors tend to be ignored unless they have American or British publishers. Consequently, it's not often that icy, small town Canada is used as a fictional backdrop. Blunt's descriptions are so well done that the climate itself plays a role as an obstacle in the investigations. In addition to the nice character work that the author has accomplished, the ending ties up all of the loose edges quite neatly, thus setting the stage for the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"To those of you who thought the villains were too black-and-white evil, consider that this story is obviously based on the Homolka-Bernardo killings. Details like the video tapes and sadism are very much the same. And Homolka and Bernardo were much, much worse. Edie is at least pitiful in her low self-esteem and craving for love in whatever ugly form it takes.And Blunt deals with murderers much more, well, bluntly. Bernardo is still in prison, and Homolka served 12 years before being released. I think Canada is still scarred by the murders and furious over Homolka's release, so the novel serves to tie up loose ends rather neatly.I liked very much that Cardinal wasn't entirely virtuous, and liked even more the resolution with his wife.The detective characters and the corruption sub-plot reminded me of Louise Penny's Cruelest Month."},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"Giles Blunt, Forty Words for Sorrow (Berkeley, 2001)Giles Blunt first came to the attention of critics everywhere as a staff writer for Law and Order, one of the strongest television series in history. And when reading Blunt's first novel, the reader who is a Law and Order fan is likely to know, even without knowing Blunt's allegiance to the show, that there are similarities. Needless to say, for the Law and Order fan, this means you've pretty much got a free pass on this one; you're going to love it.John Cardinal is a cop with his career in the toilet and a clinically depressed wife. His usual partner is tied up in court on another case, so Cardinal is assigned another one, Lise Delorme, who's just come to homicide from Special Bureau (Americans, think \\"internal affairs\\"). Cardinal, who some folks in the branch suspect of being crooked, immediately suspects she's been paired with him in order to investigate him. But he's got too much on his plate to spend much time worrying about that; first, his wife goes into the hospital with a particularly nasty bout of depression. Second, a body is found in a mineshaft, believed to be that of Katie Pine, a missing girl whom Cardinal always suspected of being murdered; his obsession with her case got him demoted from homicide in the first place. Who can worry about whether you're being investigated by your partner or not?Perhaps the most intriguing thing about Forty Words for Sorrow is the tension between Cardinal and Delorme, and trying to decide whether a romance is getting underway. The two of them are very deftly handled, and while they seesaw back and forth between being nice to one another and loathing one another, there's never a sense that anything is being exaggerated for the reader; the perils of having a new partner, and one of the opposite sex.That said, the best-written scenes in the book are those between Cardinal and his wife in the hospital. Cardinal is hopelessly adrift, completely unsure of how to handle himself around her as she struggles in the mire of her depression. Both characters are painted spot-on in these scenes, and they alone are enough to warrant the purchase price of the book.What's missing from the above two paragraphs is the mystery itself. And, ultimately, the mystery takes a back seat to the characters. This is not a bad thing, as long as the characters can sustain the novel (and they certainly do here). But the end result is that the mystery becomes somewhat predictable, especially for regular watchers of (you knew I'd get round to it sooner or later) Law and Order. The twists and turns in the plot will be easily recognizable to the show's rabid cult following. Again, not that this is a bad thing; in fact, regular Law and Order viewers have come to expect this, and will feel right at home. (Non-regular viewers, or those who have never seen the show, may not find anything here predictable at all.)A good, solid work, Forty Words for Sorrow, a promising debut from a promising writer. John Cardinal is coming back soon in Blunt's second novel, and if the first one is anything to go on, it will be just as well worth reading. ***"},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"According to the brief bio in the back of this book, author Blunt has written scripts for such notable shows as Law &amp; Order. It is clear that he brings a lot to the table: a fine sense of narrative timing, strong skill at characterization, and a crisp writing style. These gifts all come into play in Forty Words For Sorrow. From the outset, the wretched cold is as integral to the plot as the characters. Blunt succeeds in evoking the climate both of a mythical northern Ontario town and of the local police force, where personalities clash and collide and, ultimately, pull together to solve the mystery of who has murdered a number of missing kids. There are finely wraught characterizations with not a stock character in sight. The issue of mental illness is addressed with sensitivity and insight. And at the point where the narrative focus shifts from who the villain might be to the interior rationale(s) behind the crimes, the momentum moves into high gear and stays there. The tension is spread across several lines: detective Cardinal's anxiety over his secrets and personal sorrows; the heightened fears and sorrows of those related to the victims; and the ongoing investigation of Cardinal's past by his new partner, Lise Delorme, who is torn by conflicting emotions and relentless ambition. This is a can't-put-down book, lean and taut.

As you are pulled more deeply into the story, I'm sure you'll agree that comparisons like this are both inevitable and well-deserved.And when you get to that first-rate ending, you'll understand (with considerable gratitude) that there's lots of mileage left in the Cardinal-Delorme partnership and more exciting novels to come.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"I skipped whole chapters because they were just too dark for me -- serial killers torturing victims.On the other hand, I read the book straight through (aside from those chapters), because although you knew halfway through the book \\"who-done-it,\\" there was a life at stake and you wondered if the police would figure it out in time. There was a wonderful sense of place -- northern Ontario in the winter -- that helped compensate for other problems with this book.The problems included a secondary plot that was probably unnecessary and just detracted from the story -- soul-searching over right and wrong was a significant part of this book.A more serious problem involved the female characters. I was uneasy about how women were portrayed in this book: clueless daughter who should have been suspicious; mentally ill wife (not clear why her illness was not being controlled by medications); female cop apparently without much in the way of conscience or loyalty; ugly loser willing to do anything for her man; grannie in bed, whiny, demanding, and neglected... I think perhaps that the author believed he was portraying at least some of the women positively, but I would have to question that. Of course, few characters in this book come off very well, so it might be argued that the men in this book are just as bad. I think we're supposed to like the flawed hero-detective, but this character didn't make up for the problems with the women in this book. I think sometimes men have trouble writing about women, and that may have been the problem -- or subliminal misogyny.I expect I'll be reading more in the series, however."},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","review":"I won't rehash the plot as others here have already done so and probably much better.

I also like that I had compassion for Cardinal concerning the situation with his mentally ill wife, but it was woven into the story in such a way that I felt it wasn't overkill. I found myself towards the end jumping ahead of the story because I couldn't stand the suspense and then I went back and read more slowly.

It's puzzling to most viewers and reviewers. So much so, you have to wonder why anyone likes it, since they don't seem to be able to understand it. Yet far from an enigmatic muddle, Godot is crystal clear. It is an Irish vision of Purgatory/Limbo.All the evidence points to it; no evidence contradicts it. It lets the whole story come together consistently and rationally. Two ragged fellows meet every morning and do nothing all day. Not that there is anything to do - the world is essentially flat, boundless, gray and barren, save for one derisory dead tree. There is no water, no food (save for a single old vegetable in the pocket of one of them - every day), no shelter, no objects of any kind. Not even a place to sit. Estragon is doomed to remember nothing except being beaten up the night before. Every night. Vladimir is cursed with an inkling of having been here and done this before, but can't quite nail it. Total frustration.They consider suicide, but don't even have the means to do even that little. They are dead men already, so it is redundant. They cross paths with another pair, similarly cursed, and this happens every day with no one remembering the previous encounter. They are doomed to repeat this meaningless activity every day for eternity. And part of it is waiting for a man who they've never met and who never comes. He cancels on them every afternoon.What fresh hell is this? to borrow from Ms. Parker. They are waiting for God(ot) to decide their eternal fates. And every day, God doesn't show. It's Limbo (since cancelled).It is precisely the same Limbo envisioned by another great Irish author and playwright, Flann O'Brien, in his last novel - The Third Policeman. In it, the nameless \\"hero\\" awakens in a land much like the one he came from, but can't interact with. Instead, his wanderings continually take him to the police station, where the two constables tell him he'll have to wait for the third policeman, who never shows. The police talk endlessly about a bicycle parked there, and whether or not it has moved, is capable of moving, should move, has the will to move, didn't it just move? After 150 pages of this, our hero surmises this can't go on and must be a bad dream, because it's not as if he is dead, he says. And it hits you; yes, of course that's it - he is dead. This is Purgatory. Doomed to endlessly repeat the same boring, pointless rounds all day every day, visiting a deep well of lockers where he can withdraw anything he wants or needs, but he cannot take any of it back up the elevator if it adds even a fraction of an ounce to the personal weight he came down with.Nonsense. Frustration. Boredom. Futility. Pointlessness. Endlessness. Hopelessness. Agony. There is no climax, no love, no betrayal - the minimum requirements of drama. There's just the same again. That is Beckett and O'Brien's vision of what awaits Irishmen. In other words, more of the same. Forever. That is as powerful as anything truly dramatic, and accounts for Godot's undiminished popularity.Waiting for Godot is, in more ways than one, timeless."},{"Title":"Waiting For Godot (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a textbook. I expected the play and was disappointed. I should have made a deeper review before purchasing."},{"Title":"Waiting For Godot (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Like a precursor to the way we communicate today via acronyms and hyper-abbreviated text messages, Waiting For Godot is a pared-down, sometimes lyrical and frequently absurd running commentary on the human condition. A typical exchange between the two main characters goes like this: \\"What do we do now? --While waiting. --While waiting. --We could do our exercises. --Our movements. --Our elevations. --Our relaxations. --Our elongations. --Our relaxations. --To warm us up. --To calm us down. --Off we go.\\" The obvious question, what are these two men waiting for, is less important than what they are doing while they are waiting. The brilliance of the work is its universality, the fact that we are all susceptible to thinking that our lives will be great if only such-and-such would just happen. We wait for our boss to understand us, for our husbands to love us, for our kids to graduate . . . and before we know it, our lives are over and all we have done is wait.I count myself lucky in that my first exposure to this utterly amazing piece of writing was via a production of the play featuring some of the best classically-trained theater actors in America today. It is, after all, a play, and while you can certainly read plays and get a lot out of them, they were meant to be performed, and seeing them performed by acting companies that are at the top of their game is like no other experience. So, kudos to the American Players Theater and actors James DeVita, James Ridge, Brian Mani and John Pribyl, who performed this play brilliantly in 2010 and opened my mind to the possibilities of WFG. OMG it was an incredible performance, which led me to read the play and explore its richness phrase by phrase."},{"Title":"Waiting For Godot (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a review of \\"Waiting for Godot,\\" Naxos Audio Books; Unabridged edition (March 2006).A great play rendered in a pitch-perfect performance.

But I did use it as a study aid in writing a critical review of the play.The play itself is one that is at time very hard to comprehend with out prior knowledge of the playwright Samuel Beckett or the style in which the play is written. While the Max Notes study aid did hit on key albeit superficial points of the play as well as give some ideas and guidelines as to what to write about for an essay on the play, it would be in anyone who attempts to review this play to search for a free pdf of the play, as there are many internal directions that have to be followed by the actors. Also it would be in the reviews best interest if they were to read along with the actual script whilst watching a production of the play on a medium such as Youtube.As I said before I can not really fault the book for not being what I thought it was, however, when used as intended the Max Notes study aid that it is, is best used for high school students and not college students having to review the play."},{"Title":"Waiting For Godot (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"As an absurdist philosophical exploration on the meaning of life (or lack of), it entertains in the dark perspective that life itself is a comedy, with or without a punch line, when one spends it waiting for something else than life itself. \\"Waiting for Godot\\" is very much an acquired taste.

We only know of him from the conversations of Vladimir and Estragon who spend all their time just waiting for him.This character Godot is more like a distant or abstract concept than a real person and the way this story is writtenit seems that the author was trying to show this.Which is why Godot is not portrayed in the story at all but only as a subject of conversation.As with any story this can be interpreted in different ways.I see this tale as an allegory or parable describing those who waste their lives or time waiting for something that will not come about.It could be the hopeful gambler who bets everything on winning a fortune and lives only to achieve this. As time goes by all he manages to do is simply lose more money in the process.Instead of striking it rich he ends up more broke than ever.Or it could be the workaholic who plans for a future of ease andpleasure,while sacrificing everything else including himself,his health and peace of mind.However he succumbs to a heart attack brought on by stress before he even gets a chance to quit the rat race.There could be other examples it could represent.For example the futility of some religous people who think the second coming and their deliverance is at hand.They wait and see every occurence around them as proof that the end is near,but as time passes by and they pass away then it occurs to some observers that what their waiting for is just wishful thinking.What this shows to me is that it is never a good idea to stop living and sacrifice all your needs to wait for a future that may not come.To do so is an act of pathetic absurdity like Vladimir and Estragon wasting their time waiting for an appointment that never occurs."},{"Title":"Waiting For Godot (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I had the joy of seeing Waiting for Godot performed on Broadway last year and wanted a copy of the script.

Waiting for Godot was selected on a whim; my friend spotted a used copy of the play while shopping, perused the description on the back cover and having heard of the play previously decided to buy it (it was only $1). The play was a quick read that would certainly have left me with a brain cramp had there not been other people to discuss it with. The more we talked about the play's religious connotations, symbolism and \\"greater meaning\\", the more I appreciated my encounter with it. Set in what we believed to be anywhere - hell, purgatory, earth (we all had differing opinions) - Waiting for Godot seems to question the meaning of existence and the connectedness of one human to another and perhaps even human's relationship to God.The later point resulted in much discussion after a little research on the play revealed that Samuel Beckett didn't mean to imply that the play's main characters, Vladimir and Estragon, were waiting for God, although this reader and many others arrived at that conclusion. The author noted in previous interviews that Godot has some reference to boots in French; that on a subconscious level perhaps he was thinking of God. Good to know that he was as confused about his work as I was. There are codependency overtones as well as self sufficiency, faith, love and fear; Beckett seems to put it all out there for contemplation. While I won't recommend the reading of this play to others I don't regret having read it. Should the play ever be performed in my area I'll make a point to see it; perhaps more of the comedy aspects of this tragedy will become apparent to me.Absent the discussion with my friends, this read would most likely have resulted in a 1 star review. Thanks to the \\"When We See Each Other Book Club\\" and the fact that I get to count the play for my annual \\"classics\\" read, it's been elevated to 2.5 stars. While I won't avoid any future encounters with the works of Samuel Beckett; after all he is a Nobel Laureate, I won't rush to read his other work either.

This exploration in existentialism, a philosophical view that life is complicated and without a predetermined objective, is a great example of how an author can do more with less--that is, use simplicity to create complex themes and meanings. One of the main reasons I like this play is because of how Beckett uses a simple setting, simple dialogue, and simple stage direction to create a deeper meaning and view of life.Some argue that the play becomes monotonous and repetitive, which it does, but I argue that Beckett does successfully create monotony in a way that does not bore the reader or theatergoer. Another reason I like the play is because Beckett uses comedy to engage the reader and keep audience interested in the little action that is happening onstage.Finally I like the reality of the play. Like Estragon and Vladimir, everyone has something they are waiting for or something they are questioning. Whether that is the meaning of life or the questionability of an existence of a God, this play can be applied to almost anyone's life. Beckett captures a view of life that does not omit the mankind's deep spiritual search or life's unanswerable questions.I would recommend this play to anyone who is interested a piece of theater that effectively captures mankind's need to find answers to the unanswerable questions."},{"Title":"Waiting For Godot (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"First, a word about editions. This edition of WAITING FOR GODOT, though with occasional changes of covers, has long been the standard edition of the play in English. It features Beckett's translation of the play in English, and nothing else. But in more recent copies of the play, Grove has inserted a card noting that in June of 2011 this edition will be replaced by a two one, which will feature the French original alongside Beckett's translation into English. Right now this edition is still available for a fraction of the cost of the new bilingual edition, but at some point soon it will apparently go out of print, and only the new edition ofWaiting for Godot - Bilingual: A Bilingual Editionwill be available. This new edition will also feature an introduction, which the current edition lacks.Too many people forget that this is a PLAY, i.e., something that provides the words for actors on a stage. It is not primarily intended to be read in a book. Unfortunately, this is how most people experience the play, therefore depriving them of most of elements of the performance. Therefore, I am going to make a recommendation for a way of increasing the richness of your performance of the play.Though an Irishman, Beckett originally wrote the play - as he did with almost all of his works - in French first and then later translated them himself into English (in contrast, Vladimir Nabokov after moving to the United States wrote his books in English, and then translated them into French and Russian, his wife doing the translations into German). The play was originally performed in Paris, while the English-language premiere took place in Ireland. The American debut was not on Broadway, but in Miami, Florida, with Bert Lahr and Tom Ewell.Instead of merely reading the play, read it while listening to a recording of the original Broadway production ofWaiting For Godot, which starred Bert Lahr (best known as the Cowardly Lion in THE WIZARD OF OZ) as Estragon and E. G. Marshall as Vladimir. While you still wouldn't get the visual dimension of the play, hearing the actors bring the characters to life adds new layers to the play that you would never get merely by reading it. Lahr was an unexpected choice to star in the play, given that he wasn't an actor so much as a vaudevillian comedian. His acting style was too over-the-top to be convincing in film (though perfect for the Cowardly Lion); I read somewhere - I don't recall where - that he was more like a cartoon character incarnated than a human. He nonetheless gives a marvelous performance here. Marshall was one of the most distinguished stage actors of his generation and more than holds his own with Lahr while acting as more the straight man.If you listen to the recording while reading the book, the performance that will most come to life is that of Lucky. I'd read the play 2 or 3 times over the years and seen it once on the stage in which I now realize was a rather tame production, but had not really paid much attention to Lucky. His main contribution was a single, very long speech (not terribly unlike the long speech given by The Fireman in Ionesco's THE BALD SOPRANO in terms of length and its absurdity - a speech that I gave in a college performance of the play). Read on the page it can seem interesting and silly, but hearing the actor (though it wasn't indicated in the recording, Alvin Epstein played Lucky in the original Broadway production and it is almost certainly him here) perform the speech is revelatory. He doesn't say the words so much as shriek, yelp, gasp, bark, and screech them. Hearing Lucky's speech performed by a talented actor transforms your appreciation of both the speech and the play.This is one of the truly great works of the 20th Century, one of the key plays making up what Martin Esslin dubbed The Theatre of the Absurd, but it is not best experienced by reading it on the page. Try to see it performed instead, or at bare minimum in the Bert Lahr/E. G. Marshall version noted above. You wouldn't think that you had experienced a Bob Dylan song merely by reading the lyrics, and so also you won't experience WAITING FOR GODOT unless you hear or see it performed."},{"Title":"Waiting For Godot (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Fortunately, once again based on the 1-star reviews, reading this play was not a school assignment. In fact the decision was made in a rather circuitous fashion. I was inspired by Harvard sociologist, Laurence Wylie, who wrote an account of his two-year stay in the Provencal village of Roussillon. He moved there, with his wife, and two young children, in 1950. In Wylie's account, entitledVillage in the Vaucluse, Third Edition, he called the town \\"Peyrane.\\" It was an account far removed from the chichi, upscale \\"destination\\" village of today; in 1950 it was still marked by the poverty of the post-World War II period, when farmers would shot sparrows for food. But the most astonishing part of the book is revealed in the preface to the second edition, when he is back in Boston, and was reading Beckett's play (obviously in French, in which it was originally written). He came across a passage that read, as translated: \\"But we were in the Vaucluse together, I'd swear it. We worked in the harvest together on Bonnelly's farm, in Roussillon...\\" Wylie had lived in this small village for over two years, only six years after one of the most famous playwrights of the 20th century had lived there, during WW II. He was later able to confirm, on subsequent visits, with individuals whom he had had numerous conversations that yes, of course, Beckett had lived there. Didn't everyone know that? Supposedly Beckett was inspired to write the play, after waiting for a long time, trying to hitch-hike a ride up to the village, off the N 100, which cuts through the valley just north of the Luberon Mountains.The play was first produced in a Left Bank (naturally) theatre in Paris. Beckett himself translated the work into English, and in doing so omitted references to Bonnelly's farm and Roussillon. Instead, when the two principal characters, Vladimir and Estragon are reminiscing about picking grapes, the countryside is transformed into \\"Macon country,\\" which is actually 300 km to the north. Beckett left one sentence that still points to the ochre cliffs for which Roussillon is famous: Vladimir: \\"But down there everything is red!\\" (p. 40)The play itself is in the Theatre of the Absurd tradition. In parts, the dialogue between the two characters may seem pointless and meaningless. There are far more questions than answers. It is a play, like fine wine, that seems to improve with age (one's own.) The play has achieved \\"iconic status,\\" has entered the English language as a metaphor, and has even entered my backyard. I have a thin, spindly tree, almost dead, that I refuse to cut down: in honor of the only \\"prop\\" in the play, it has become my \\"Waiting for Godot\\" tree, and the subject of an inspirational glance or two during the day. There are so many possible \\"takeaways\\" from the play. For those who are \\"waiting\\" for some external event to happen, like a court decision for instance, perhaps the \\"answer\\" is not to, after bearing witness to the absurd actions of Vladimir and Estragon, who are constantly waiting, hoping... The change is within. I've seen the play produced at least twice, most recently here in Albuquerque. 5-stars."},{"Title":"Waiting For Godot (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This play is a classic, and yet there is a lot to say about it.First of all the play is in two acts with exactly the same characters but in a situation that evolves from first to second day.

They eat a carrot, a turnip or a radish, raw of course. They are waiting for Godot, a character described by his messengers as an old man who is the landowner of a farm where he raises sheep and goats, taken care of by two young brothers. These two main characters are the evanescent hosts of two people who come along the road, Lucky the slave (pack mule if you prefer) of Pozzo, his master. These will become in the second act a dumb (mute) slave and a blind master. The situation in other words is degrading among those who have some semblance of social structure. This makes four characters, a perfect crucifixion turned into a pagan if not satanic pentacle with the boy messenger sent by Godot to tell those who wait for him he won't come tonight but will for sure tomorrow. With Godot we turn this pentacle into Solomon's number six.And the boy messenger gives us a line of interpretation that has never - as far as I know - been followed. The sheep on one side and the goats on the other side, the shepherd never beaten by Godot and the goat keeper regularly beaten by Godot is an allusion to Matthew 25:32-41 where Matthew explains that when Christ will come again, the Second Coming, he will sort out the humans on one side the sheep who will go to heaven and on the other side the goats who will be sent to hell. Godot is thus the master that we are waiting for, Christ in the Second Coming. This leads to reading Godot as it should, built on god with the diminutive suffix -ot. There are several words with that etymology in English, generally drawn from French or Italian, or even Latin. The most famous one is \\"harlot\\" borrowed from French in the 13th century with its original meaning of tramp, homeless person, vagabond, which Estragon and Vladimir are by the way. The suffix was in fact derogatory in this word, a diminutive turned derogatory, which is quite common. Godot is then the small God, the little God, Jesus Christ, the son of God, and we feel Beckett is making fun of this Christ that we are expecting all the time but never comes and sends (choir-)boys to tell us he will come tomorrow, always on the following day.Then what's the fate of the two main characters? Their social status is that of totally marginalized people living on the shoulder and in the ditch of an isolated road, feeding on some roots they probably steal from some fields or gardens. Then they have no sense of time. Over and over again we are reminded that they don't remember yesterday and cannot even conceive of tomorrow. They only have the present instant that they do not live in a dynamic time perspective but in its pure duration. In the same way they have lost the sense of space they only know here and at most there is everywhere else. They only know close and far. They only know distance but their space is flat and has no depth. It is at best punctual in a two dimensional non measurable and unfathomed space. They have developed their dyslexia to a total lack of temporal and spatial perspective. They have also lost all logic and they repeat what they say, over and over again. Vladimir alludes to the two thieves of Christ's crucifixion, and that is the most elaborate allusion to the Gospels when, without giving the names, Vladimir tells us Luke is the only one to state one of the two thieves is saved, whereas for John there are two thieves but none is saved, and for Mark and Matthew the thieves are not even mentioned.If we understand Godot the way I have explained it, this allusion to the two thieves can be set in parallel with either couple of characters, Vladimir trying to lead Estragon to accepting that only one of them will be saved. The two passers-by are essential then, since Estragon and Vladimir have to demonstrate which of them is good and helpful with these passers-by, the condition to be a sheep later on, and good essentially with the rejected one, hence with Lucky, and that is not easy. By the way when Godot was written and then published and performed a Lucky was already getting very famous, Lucky Luke (note the allusion to Luke's Gospel), who appeared for the first time in the famous magazine Spirou as a comic strip character in December 1946. Beckett could not ignore that magazine nor that character.This play is questioning our ability to survive after the man-made apocalypse of the Second World War, amplified later on with the possibility of a nuclear conflict. Apart from waiting for the Second Coming that will never come, though it is not stated so brutally, the rest is purely opportunistic adaptability to a world that has lost all conceptualization of time and space and even social organization, the surviving social class society shown in Lucky and Pozzo is decaying fast from one day to the next. Is it an allusion to the Stalinist system of the Soviet Union? Maybe.It is easy though to see an abstract form or situation that can be the distillated matrix, melting-pot or mould of the post WW2 world devastated by the Cold War. Has this pure form in anyway become obsolete today? The answer is political and depends on our own convictions.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Waiting For Godot (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The story I heard was that when this play was first performed, it was ill received by the audiences and quickly closed. Then, a group of inmates at Jolliet Prison undertook the production for their fellow prisoners. When the last line was spoken and the curtain went down, there was absolute silence, and not a dry eye in the house. They understood every nuance of the play. I'm not sure if this is a true story or not, but I like it, and I like the play. I work with people with brain injuries, and the clients that are never quite content I warmly think of as waiting for their own Godot's."},{"Title":"Waiting For Godot (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The Kindle edition listed here is NOT Harold Bloom's edition. It's a plain vanilla edition of the play. If you are looking for commentary by Bloom, as I was, it isn't there. Cheap but not functional edition of a great play, of which I have several other copies already."},{"Title":"Waiting For Godot (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This TV production comes from 1961, and features Burgess Meredith and the great Zero Mostel. It was directed by Alan Scheider - who also directed the first ever production of Beckett's seminal work in the USA. That was something of a commercial and critical disaster: it opened at the Coconut Grove in Florida - where it had been advertised as the \\"the laugh hit of two continents\\" - and starred Burt Lahr, the \\"Cowardly Lion\\" from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". The first night audience was clearly not expecting the sort of existential drama that Beckett had written - and many of them walked out during the performance. It was also comprehensively panned in press reviews. However, the production subsequently transferred to Broadway. It performed reasonably well there - but, by then, Schneider had been replaced as its director.The cast is different for this TV production, but this tape makes clear that Scheider had a deep appreciation and understanding of the piece - and how it should be played. His direction is seldom obtrusive, but never moves far from the heart of the drama, and there is a fluidity and assurance in his use of cameras which remains very impressive. Of course, Scheider was helped by a very strong cast - who not only display a high level of performance skill, but also show a convincing grasp of the play's underlying themes. This tape was recorded almost half-a-century ago, and there are inevitably a few technical glitches - but what comes across is the startlingly contemporary nature of both Beckett's work, and this production."},{"Title":"Adobe Walls","review":"W. R. Burnett spins a fine tale of the army's search for a renegade Apache leader and his warriors through the deserts and basins of southern Arizona. A chief of scouts and a small party of Apache scouts set out to stop killing, burning and looting by the Apaches and bring them in peacefully or kill them if necessary. The author's detailed account of the Apaches, the scouts, the pueblos and the arid southwest rings true and adds realism to what is essentially a seek-and-destroy army initiative. The novel, however, is surpassed by a wide margin by the 1953 film, \\"Arrowhead\\", a cavalry-Indian western starring Charlton Heston and a fine cast which is based on Burnett's book."},{"Title":"Nancy Drew The Clue in the Old Stagecoach 1960 Hardcover Edition","review":"This book has many surprises in it.

The stagecoach is supposed to a contain a clue to something which would be of great help to the town. This book was alright, it's not one of the best of the series, but it certainly isn't one of the worst. The mystery is okay and there is a reasonable amount of action. I wasn't glued to the book with every page, but it did manage to keep me more-or-less interested throughout. This isn't a book I'd highly recommend; although, it is worth reading."},{"Title":"Nancy Drew The Clue in the Old Stagecoach 1960 Hardcover Edition","review":"OK -- I love the first 25 volumes of the series, of which 22 were written by Mildred Wirt Benson and 3 were written by Walter Karig.According to her meticulously researched book, \\"The Nancy Drew Scrapbook\\", Karen Plunkett-Powell states that \\"The Secret in the Old Stagecoach\\" was written by Margaret Sherf Beebe along with Harriet S. Adams.This book has some fairly serious flaws. First of all, right on page 1, Nancy's girlfriend George Fayne is identified as \\"Georgia\\", when in previous books the authors have taken great pains to note that her name is actually George, NOT Georgia. How did this glaring contradiction slip past Harriet Adams? I have no idea.On page 12 the girls make a bet and Nancy suggests that George will have to knit a sweater for both Nancy and Bess if she is wrong. That is just ridiculous, but this little bit of humor is put in to remind us all what a tomboy George is, that she \\"hated to knit\\". Even though it is 1960, a girl who hates all things feminine nonetheless knows how to knit? And not just knit a potholder, but knit well enough to make an adult sweater? Give me break!Further, Nancy and her friends are pointedly and obviously rude to a married couple in their early 30s who are staying with the girls at Camp Merriweather. It seems their only crime is that they are \\"not popular with the younger set who considered them too aggressive and overeager to be included where they were not welcome\\" (page 13). But there is absolutely no excuse for how rude the girls are to them. I have come to expect tact and forebearance from Nancy and her chums, and in this volume of the series all that seems to go out the window.Another problem with the book is its use of antiquated vocabulary, side-by-side with contemporary slang such as \\"Neat!\\" and \\"Congrats!\\". The word \\"shan't\\" appears in a few places -- hadn't this word fallen out of common usage long before 1960? And on page 33 Nancy purchases some \\"paper handkerchiefs\\". Why not just call them tissues, or even Kleenex (a term in wide usage since the 1930s)?I am also irritated by the fact that two of the fine illustrations (p. 18-19 and p. 159) show clumsy falls by Bess and George which do not have anything to do with the mystery or the plot. Usually when someone has a close call in a Nancy Drew Mystery, it is the result of some sort of trap or sabotage by the villain -- but here, the girls are simply clumsy. The third illustration is of the girls being confronted by a bear, but once again this has nothing to do with the plot -- somebody just happens to have lost his trained bear in the woods where the girls are stranded. I think Margaret Beebe should be ashamed of gratuitously pandering to the need for interesting illustrations!Beebe rarely describes the food that is served to the girls, just that they \\"had lunch\\" or \\"had dinner\\". This is a missed opportunity to make the story come to life. When she finally does describe a meal or two, the food sounds awful -- \\"molded vegetable salad\\"? Ew. Finally at the end Ned brings ham and egg sandwiches and thermoses full of orange juice for breakfast. Yum.Come to think of it, Beebe is not any good at describing home decor or clothing either, although she tries. Nor does she make use of the weather to set a mood. Sorry, Margaret, I've just come to expect more!Carson Drew has arranged to stay \\"at his club\\" while Nancy and Hannah are both away....really? River Heights is not NYC or London...would a fairly small midwestern town be likely to have a fully-staffed \\"club\\" in 1960 where a local businessman could live for weeks at a time?I did enjoy being educated about Mrs. Strook's stamp-collecting hobby, and it was a nice touch that the fortune Abner Longstreet left to the town consisted of blocks of valuable stamps.I also liked the excitement on page 168 where Nancy and her friends are sprayed with some mysterious sleeping gas while they are digging to find the clue in the old stagecoach. Sleeping gas is always a nice touch. BUT, after gassing them, the crooks inexplicably leave the scene with nothing! They could have stuck around for hours and dug up the rest of the stagecoch and found the clue. That is a very odd hole in the plot. These are the type of hands-on villains who are setting off dynamite, gassing people, binding and gagging an elderly woman....and yet they don't bother to stay and find the clue? It would have made much more sense for them to have dug up all the boxes, found the clue, and opened up the cornerstone in the Town Hall themselves.Later when the crooks are rounded up, Nancy and her friends are allowed to \\"hear their confessions\\" at the police station. A bunch of teenagers suddenly get deputized? Is this really likely, even in pre-Miranda days? The crooks readily confess their sins, and they seem to have had precious little motive for all the dastardly things they have been up to. A vague rumor about valuable ore somewhere around town led to all sorts of sneaking around and amateur dynamiting, all on private property, with no mention of their plan to acquire the mineral rights, even if they did find something of value. And the \\"Monteiths\\" had eavesdropped and followed Nancy around when even she had no idea what she was looking for. Hmmmmmmmmm.At the end of the story, the silly \\"sweater\\" bet is dredged up again, and George inexplicably agrees to knit two sweaters. I want to throw tomatoes at this book!All in all, probably the worst in the original series (in which the Stratemeyer Syndicate provided plot outlines)."},{"Title":"Nancy Drew The Clue in the Old Stagecoach 1960 Hardcover Edition","review":"I ordered this book late Monday night.

Nancy has gold hair and blue eyes. She is also tall and slender. Her best friend George also has gold hair but her eyes are brown unlike Nancy's George is tall and slender and has a personality just like Nancy. She loves adventure and likes to get things done and over with. Bess is way different from both girls. She has brown hair and green eyes. She is told to be short and stubby.. She is Goerge's cousin and has the same great trate of loving mysteries.The book The Clue in the Old Stagecoach is an great mystery book. If you like mysteries you will enjoy this book. At the beginning of the book ,all of these girls are best friends and do everything together. One sunny day the three girls were climbing up a hill when they saw an old stagecoach rolling down the road. When they noticed that nothing was pushing or pulling it they started to chase after the old stagecoach. The girls were running after the stagecoach they ran into a truck driver. The truck driver was searching for an old stagecoach in the bushes behind tree's and on the side of everything. The girls told him that they had seen a stagecoach and it was probably the same one. By this time the stagecoach was far out of their sight. When they finally build up the courage to tell the lady that had just bought the coach they find out the coach had rolled its way to her house. When the carpenter she had hired came they replaced the carpet and you won't believe what they found.My opinion on the book The Clue in the old Stagecoach is that the book isn't all that great at the beginning but near the end it all comes together. I would recommend this book to a mystery reader. I would recommend it to them because there are a bunch of mysteries going on at once. If you like reading mysteries and adventure than this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Assassin","review":"The plot had all the potential of a great romantic suspense but unfortunately Butler is not a skilled storyteller. The years between 14 year-old Selena's rescue from rape and her eventual summons to meet with her saviour is completely ignored and the grown up Selena we meet is very well able to protect herself but we have no idea why this woman is what she is - obsessed with Davis. Butler tells us Davis has been grooming Selena to take over his drug business when the time comes yet Davis has ignored Selena once he saved her. He pays for her education, and her expenses but he's never shown any personal interest in her. Yet Davis is described as a villain who is obsessed with possession and power. His treatment of Selena is very contradictory to what we are told - that he wants to own her completely, wants her complete obedience, to even to the point of murdering for him. We also don't know much about Selena apart from her abused childhood which is only glossed over which makes it difficult to truly know her, much less feel for her.Det. Tony Ceola, though, is a nice Italian cop with a nice family. Ok, he's got this kid sister who's sleeping with a creep but overall, Ceola is someone any normal woman would bring home to meet Mom and Dad. His reaction upon being confronted with Selena's duplicity is to be expected and unfortunately, I was not sufficiently moved by Selena's character to feel she deserves him.Suspense-wise, this book was a total letdown. There were several occasions that could have made this book a page-turner but Butler never delivers. Too many pages taken up with Selena ruminating over her unmet needs where Davis is concerned turn this book into a rather mediocre read."},{"Title":"The Assassin","review":"The book was completly predictable. There was only one major twist and even that was not shocking."},{"Title":"The Assassin","review":"Fans of Janet Evanovitch and Dan Brown will probably enjoy this, but if you are looking for an interesting story, well-told, look elsewhere. This book follows the standard romance novel plot, with more violence and explicit sex. It is written in the sort of breathless, unedited prose that keeps the story moving along without allowing the reader to stop and realize that nothing of interest is happening. It would be an improvement if the characters were two-dimensional. As it is they are stock characters, drawn with all the subtlety of the inhabitants of TV commercials. This book has nothing to recommend it."},{"Title":"The Assassin","review":"I have to say, this is one of the best suspense novels I've read in years. Not only is the book hard hitting and fast paced, it's very tender. I especially enjoyed the thoughtful way Ms. Butler dealt with the Alzheimers patient. Excellent job!This is not a mindless read with cardboard characters. Selena and Tony are fully three dimensional, coming to life on the very first page. And they continue to live even after the book is finished.THIS BOOK HAS EVERYTHING TO RECOMMEND IT! Rate it from one to five stars? If I could, I'd give it a ten."},{"Title":"The Assassin","review":"It's prime time Sunday evening and I just finished reading THE ASSASSIN.

An irate Damon detests Selena who is treated more like William's family than a worker.Selena temporarily moves to Tulsa to live next door to Detective Tony \\"Chee\\" Ceola, who is putting together a case against William. Selena is to destroy the dossier and if necessary kill the cop. Damon hopes she will mess up though he admits she is a survivor. While a serial killer murdering the dregs of society leaves behind \\"repent\\" as his message diverts Tony's efforts to put away William, the detective and his assassin fall in love. Will Selena choose the man who gave her a lifeline when she was a drowning teen or the cop that offers her a lifetime of love?The key to THE ASSASSIN is the believability of Selena as a fighter, a survivor, and a woman in love; the cast including Chee pale next to her. The story line grips the audience from the moment Selena shows her skills against a much heavier male opponent and never slows down until she must choose sides. Readers will wonder whether she will go with the father figure who \\"saved\\" her in the past or the hunk who offers her a warm enlightened future.

THE ASSASSIN by Rachel Butler held me spellbound from the get-go. Not only was this emotionally charged book jam packed with twists, turns, and total surprises, it touched me in personal ways, too. And that to me makes the difference between a good book and a book I can't let go of.Having a close relative who is in law enforcement, I love a good cop story. Tony is true to himself, which is a blessing and a curse. He's searching for that one special someone and won't settle for anyone less than the best.Selena is a strong kick ass woman, yet she longs for what most of us do: safety. Having two bi-racial step-children, I've seen first hand the problems that they face, yes, even in this enlightened time.

Her greatest talent is in the way this climbing writer wields the potent power of her prose-flowing pen in her latest novel, Lost Love. Whether she's writing in newspaper ease, typical magazine salesmanship, or mainstream romance, her dashing writer's style is not a routine reader's sofa ride. Her writing technique is more like a rippling roller coaster's casual climbs, screaming drops and glowing glides that leaves you still moving in your dormant seat long after the ride is completely over and dying for one more artfully crafted sentence that bears her signature style. Few proficient writers showcase her natural storyteller's imaginativefinesse interwoven with spring-fresh sentence structure. This wordsmith delivers bright talent embodied in a bold, unconventional and daring feminine author's panache which scribes a vibrant read with a cutting-edge innate flair. Lost Love is down-to-earth, emotionally touching, warmly revitalizingand sensationally sexy, just like the youthful author, which explains exactly why she surrenders such honesty in what she pens. Her ability to share openly private thoughts, angst actions, uncontrolled emotional reactions, and private fears, brings readers to their knees with tears of enduring empathy, powerless pain, and the understanding of lasting love gone wonderfully right and terribly wrong. There's a 'sixth sense' about Chirichigno's non-judgmental perception of the differences between male and female realities within a romantic relationship that is poignantly bonding for both sexes. It produces an instant liking for Kay Chirichigno as a writer and an individual from the reader's perspective. You immediately relate with and form a lasting loyal reader's relationship with her because she takes you with her into the depth of her soul and attaches a permanently sealed kiss to your reader's heart. Warning to readers who read Lost Love: Beware. You may recognize yourself."},{"Title":"The Fool Killer","review":"I decided to buy and read this bock after my first try at it 50 years ago when I was 8 years old.

For our plan, we only listed the competition in general, not specific names of businesses (also suggested in the \\"Competition Section\\").Bottom line, this book provides all the guidance you need to write a professional business plan for any type business.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Crafting the Successful Business Plan","review":"I have two complaints about this book: (1) it's really geared toward a small business like a flower shop and (2) it contributed to my being sued by my former employer because of the way in which it instructs you to write the &quot;Competition&quot; section.In spite of those two issues, the book does a good job of getting you to work through a lot of the issues you need to work through before you jump in to a new venture."},{"Title":"Looking for God's Country","review":"The past often turns up in Krapf's poems, but not in a nostalgic way. The poet does not nostalgically pine for or color the past because it is so lively in his memory anyway. That a \\"shopping mall and a big/black parking lot\\" have replaced the packed-dirt basketball court of the poet's youth is not cause for sorrow or regret because when he sees this, the poet hears in his mind \\"that leather swish/inside a cord net like the sound/of an angel landing in heaven.\\" [from \\"Barnyard Hoops\\"] The poet has memories which nothing can take away from him. But these do not pale the immediate or remove the poet from it. Rather, they give fullness and a wide emotional expanse to the present; as when in \\"Going to Church\\" two elderly widowers smile and move with a grace that \\"says ladies they love/are going to church, too.\\" Throughout his life, Krapf has retained his connection to his German ancestry in various ways. This is seen in this volume with black-and-white photographs by the German photographer Andreas Riedel at the beginning of each of the four sections."},{"Title":"Chris Isaak","review":"The first sentence in the first chapter of this book sets the tone for all that comes afterward. Straight away, the author gets his subject's birth date wrong. (For those unfortunate fans who suffered through this painful work of fiction, Chris Isaak was born on JUNE 26, 1956, not in July...)Wishing not to be so negative as I continued to read, I tried to ignore the spelling and punctuation errors that riddle the book - that could easily be attributed to an inexperienced typesetter... But the errors in fact and history that permeate Mr. Reid's book simply render the entire effort worthless.His research for this book is sloppy, at best, and he clearly is not at all familiar with Chris Isaak, his music, his fans, or the San Francisco music scene. He gets every aspect of his subject's life incorrect, from his blatantly wrong description of Chris' hometown of Stockton, CA, to his ridiculous assessment of the meaning behind each of Chris' songs. It's obvious, to even the most casual of fans, that this author hasn't a clue about his subject.There are so many mistakes in this book; I'd need to write a book just to document them... Ridiculous, careless errors, like identifying the actor who won the role in the film \\"Something Wild\\" that Chris had been intended to play as \\"ROY Liotta...\\" (Again, it's \\"RAY Liotta...\\") Very simple to confirm, easy stuff to get right... But no, Reid, perhaps in his haste to release the book, just didn't do enough due diligence... Other errors? Reid's statement (on page 63) that Kenney Dale Johnson and Roly Salley \\"were judged to be too inexperienced to participate in the final recordings\\" of Chris' first album \\"Silvertone.\\" Neither man had joined Chris' band at the time the first record was recorded - something Reid, himself noted earlier on page 57, from an interview with Kenney as he discussed meeting Chris for the first time: \\"When I first met him, he had most of his first record recorded.\\" Clearly, Reid didn't bother to build a timeline chronicling the events of Chris' life, both major and minor, to see where events intersected or where more information might be needed. His ignorance with regard to the San Francisco Punk scene in the late 1970's, the ashes from which Chris and his new band emerged, is also completely laughable. His statement that The Avengers (the band Jimmy Wilsey formerly played first bass, then guitar for,) did not open the last show for the Sex Pistols at The Mabuhay Gardens... That now legendary show was at Winterland... and that fact took all of 10 minutes to confirm.For what it's worth, an easy 95% of Reid's information came from Internet sources. (How do I know this? I researched every item listed in the book's bibliography - the vast majority of which came from the \\"San Francisco Days\\" site. What's left came from other online sources, and the few books listed in the bibliography are reference books on other topics - like the Leonard Gardner novel, \\"Fat City,\\" from which Reid apparently culled all his erroneous details about Stockton...) Google \\"Chris Isaak\\" and you'll find all the same information the author used to write this book. What's more, you'll probably find that by reading those original articles, you'll gain a much more complete, far less opinionated picture of the guy."},{"Title":"Chris Isaak","review":"Interesting ,particularly the chapters about his beginnings. I also liked the song by song analysis which puts a new perspective on some songs.However,the author never mentions the numerous single-only/bonus tracks,which is a shame as many of them are easily as good as the album tracks (So lovely is the night,partly sung in Japanese is a gem among others)There are also some factual mistakes,Link Wray's Rumble is credited to Duane Eddy and Only the lonely by Sinatra is NOT the Orbison song.A list of the covers played live over the past 20 years would have been welcome as well.So,a very good introduction to Chris Isaak's world and music but a bit light for the long-time fan."},{"Title":"Chris Isaak","review":"BajaBabe knows it all about Chris..Please listen to her review!

The pictures in this book are beautiful and there are many stories included. My only complaint is that the editor condensed some of the longer stories and cut out many of the pictures. The result is that the stories are a little too dense for my two year old, the words on the page don't always match the illustrations.

Better move would be to buy the various stories separately."},{"Title":"The World Restored: Metternich, Castlereagh, and the Problems of Peace, 1812-22","review":"Excellent book that is hard to find and one that should never go out of print. This book first came out in the early 1960's and sadly was not reprinted until the early part of the 21st century and it is now out of print once again. The world of Metternich and Castlereagh was one of finding peace, keeping your country strong while keeping the young aristocrats and military professionals from starting wars. Bismark ran into much the same problems when he was Chancellor of Prussia. The key to Metternich, Castlereagh and Bismark was diplomacy based on strength and cunning. When those that came after them saw diplomacy as weakness and opted for war, then eventually their empires came to an end. We saw the same problems in the Bush 43 administration; hence two wars that contiune to drain the economy and deplete the nation of young men and women who go off to war and die or are injured, not to mention the strained relations around the world. The outcome is a weakening of the nation state and eventual ruin. The empires of Britian, Austria and Prussia all ceased to exist when they threw diplomacy to the wind. Can the US escape the same circumstances by rebuilding diplomacy while maintining our military strength but not using it to go to war? Much like Sun Tzu's 'Art of War,' Kissinger's 'The World Restored' should be read by politicans, military professionals, business folks and the general populace at large. Democracy is based on conversation and no better way to have a conversation about history and diplomacy then by reading and discussing 'The World Restored.' Kissingers later book on Diplomacy pales in comparison to what is discussed in 'The World Restored.'"},{"Title":"The World Restored: Metternich, Castlereagh, and the Problems of Peace, 1812-22","review":"This book was intended to be the first volume in a series that went up to WWI, but for obvious reasons Dr. Kissinger never finished the series.

One of the best cost/benefit relations in my life!"},{"Title":"Chloroform: The Quest for Oblivion","review":"Meticulously researched and skilfully written, this book is a fascinating history of the use of chloroform, both medically and in less laudable pursuits. Fascinating characters crowd the pages--Samuel Guthrie, who managed to survive his own explosive experiments and become the discoverer of the controversial substance; Adelaide Bartlett, whose acquittal on the charge of murdering her husband with chloroform prompted a judge's hope that she would now &quot;tell us how she did it&quot;; W.T. Stead, the crusading journalist who used chloroform in his attempt to expose the Victorian trade in young girls; Dr. John Snow, whose administration of chloroform to Queen Victoria prompted that supposedly staid lady to pronounce the effect &quot;delightful beyond measure&quot;; and, H.H. Holmes, who holds the dubious distinction as &quot;America's first serial killer&quot;. The clarity of Ms. Stratmann's writing, and her touches of dry wit, ensure a painless journey through what could have been a soporific topic in less-deft hands. Students of Victorian crime will be especially interested in her new research and insights into the Bartlett case. I highly recommend this book and hope that we will see more from this writer."},{"Title":"Chloroform: The Quest for Oblivion","review":"According to Linda Stratmann, \\"Descriptions and illustrations of surgery in the seventeenth to mid-nineteenth centuries are mainly a catalogue of unrelieved agonies.\\" It is hard to disagree with this assessment. Patients were restrained on the operating table by strong orderlies and leather straps and given a cloth to bite on to help keep them quiet. Surgeons may have been skillful; they used the sharpest of knives to cut off limbs, for instance, with astonishing speed. They could not control pain except by getting it over with as quickly as possible. When the anesthetic properties of ether were discovered, it was a great boon to humanity. But Stratmann's book, _Chloroform: The Quest for Oblivion_ (Sutton) details the history of the second great anesthetic. It is a dramatic rise and fall story, told with detail and a sense of broader social history.Ether worked wonderfully well, but it had disadvantages, especially its explosiveness. James Young Simpson, an obstetrician in Edinburgh, discovered the effects of chloroform. There were no experimental standards in place, and Simpson's procedure sounds simple and dangerous: he would get samples of any substance with a \\"breatheable vapour, inhale them from a tumbler, and make notes of his reactions.\\" He enlisted friends as guinea pigs as well. Four days after being knocked out by chloroform in 1847, he used it successfully on an obstetric case. Though there is a legend that ministers denounced chloroform because taking pain away from childbirth was irreligious, Stratmann has not found documentation that this is so, although Simpson did get private letters along those lines.Despite the frivolous objections, chloroform did have its bad effects on some patients as all medicines do. There was a long and emotional argument over whether it affected the heart or the respiration after doctors finally realized that some people were dying from it. Chloroform continued to be used until newer, safer agents began to be used in the 1950s. This surprising book shows that it was not just used for anesthesia, but also for general sedation, to combat seasickness, and even as fuel for steamer boats. In addition, it was used for criminal activities like murder and robbery, but it was not very successful for these (or for many of the other proposed uses), even though they did make good lurid stories for the Victorian press. The wide range of _Chloroform_ makes it an amusing history not only of an important aspect of medical science but of the society of the time."},{"Title":"Chloroform: The Quest for Oblivion","review":"This compact book is a spellbinding history of chloroform, from its discovery in 1831-2 to its present role in our industrial plants and our environment. It is, to my knowledge, the first and only historical survey of the famous anesthetic. The author has researched a prodigious number of sources, many of them little known. The book is written for laymen but physicians, especially anesthesiologists, will enjoy reading it and learn much from it.The author clearly presents the controversies which surrounded chloroform from its birth on: who was its first discoverer; the debate between Boston &amp; Edinburgh over its safety, as compared to that of ether; the medical and religious oppositions to its use in obstetrics (or even in surgery); the quarrel between the Scottish and English surgeons on its safe mode of administration; and the disputes over the mechanism of the instantaneous death that it not infrequently caused. All sides of the debates are fairly presented and soundly judged on the basis of facts gleaned in a vast literature.The scientific and medical material is presented clearly and soberly, in a crisp, vivid, and lucid style. The author presents a fair judgment of a drug, which spared patients the horrors of the bite of the knife but could also kill with the speed of a thunderbolt.The book also offers vivid biographic vignettes of the great pioneers of chloroform. Some of them, little known, such as Samuel Guthrie and Edward Lawrie beautifully come alive in the book.Over the years chloroform was recommended for every physical and mental disease and the book includes many amusing stories about those medical fads. From its birth to our present days, chloroform was also used for wrongdoing &amp; Mrs. Stratmann narrates at great length some famous criminal cases involving chloroform, which will delight every crime buff. No mystery writer could have presented with more verve and sense of suspense the stories of Adelaide Bartlett, W. Markand, Sir William Osler, WT Stead, HW Mudgett, and \\"Old Man\\" WM Rice.Chloroform raised much clinical and scientific interest on the Continent, especially in Germany, though less so than in the UK. I hope that the author will delve more extensively with the story of chloroform in Continental Europe in her book's 2nd edition.This work is a serious book on a difficult medical subject but its fluent, crisp and vivid style makes it a delight to read. I immensely enjoyed reading it and am sure that laymen &amp; physicians who read it will share my pleasure. I highly recommend it to both.Ray J. Defalque,MD,MSProf. (Ret.)

The book is organized geographically, its two hundred-odd photographs and reproductions divided among eight chapters that correspond to different sections of town: 1. Whitneyville; 2. Pine Rock, Hamden Plains, and Highwood; 3. Spring Glen; 4. State Street; 5. Dunbar Hills and Upper Dixwell Avenue; 6. West Woods; 7. Mount Carmel; 8. Centerville.Among the photographs included in the book are pictures of local luminaries (Eli Whitney, Thornton Wilder), various civic groups, and prominent buildings--factories and libraries and schools. There are pictures of, or mention is made of, the locals who lent their names to various landmarks--Dunbar and Benham, Bassett and Woodin and Whalen, for example--which breathes life into the streets and parks and playgrounds Hamden locals use every day.The captions of a couple of pictures hint at some very interesting stories:\\"In the early 20th century, the ramshackle printing shop at 915 Whitney Avenue was the home of William Baldwin Beamish (seated). Beamish was a hermit who for 40 years was believed to be a man but, upon needing medical care, was discovered to be a woman. A Mrs. Beamish had supposedly died nearly three decades earlier, leading to the speculation that the husband lay buried in the Whitneyville Cemetery while the wife assumed his identity. Beamish only allowed men into the house; whenever a woman entered, Beamish would fly into a rage.\\"And on a lighter note:The members of the Last Man's Club pause for a group photograph during the club's meeting on May 3, 1941, at the Caf&eacute; Mellone in New Haven. The Last Man's Club, founded in 1936, had as its members veterans, including a number from Hamden, who met once a year. The fellowship was based on a pledge, with 'no point or purpose other than that each member would try to outlive the other in order to win the bottle of wine to be quaffed by the last survivor.' Note the makeshift shrine (lower right) to members who had died during the preceding year.\\"Most interesting, however, are the photographs of locations and buildings that remain recognizable today but survive in very changed form: Hamden Plaza in the 1950's; Whitney Avenue unpaved, and again bisected with trolley tracks; the town center, thronged with locals, during Hamden's sesquicentennial celebration in 1936. These pictures would have been even more interesting, though, and the book much improved if the collection included at least one, but preferably several detailed street maps, with the town's geographical divisions and the buildings mentioned in the book marked. As it is the only map reproduced in the book dates to 1857 and is useless for the purpose of placing unfamiliar landmarks. Perhaps if the book is reprinted this failing could be remedied. In its current form, however, Hamden should be of interest to anyone whose ties to the town go at all deep.Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece (Yale University Press, 2003)"},{"Title":"Hamden (CT) (Images of America)","review":"I really liked this book because the pictures showed how hamden USED to look, along with a lot of local, historical figures.

My mother gave it to me in 1963, so I also have a sentimental attachment to it. Its updated paperback version, The Russian Cookbook, is basically a reprint with a more contemporary cover. \\"Secrets\\" is not the best cookbook on Russian food. For that I would look at books authored by Darra Goldstein whose recipes are authentic, consistent, and clear. Darra's recipes are backed by a heck of a lot of research too. However, I kept Kyra's Secrets of Russian Cooking as a reference book and have used it all these years when comparing Russian recipes. I modified most of the dishes I made from it, as evidenced by the many notes I made right into my book. Therefore, I would recommend Kyra's Secrets of Russian Cooking to those who are experienced cooks and familiar with Russian cuisine. Some say of her updated book that is not authentic. Perhaps they forget that Kyra learned to cook after the Revolution of 1917. During the incredibly hard times that Russians experienced in the former Soviet Union, many families had to modify original recipes, substitute ingredients or take other short cuts. Cooking is like languages, always evolving.

In this experiment participants were asked to choose the most likely mate from a room-full of strangers, and, Skynner claims, people of like family back-ground turned out to pick each other.I was intrigued, but do not buy into the concept without further research. No family is regular; and the idea of 'like family back-ground' is vulnerable to lack of falsifiability - is a deceased parent sufficient to constitute 'like family back-ground'?Also, real life knows many one-sided attractions, where these spring from, we don't find out.Nonetheless, research into what constitutes attraction, and how relationships get started (and continue, of course), are as important a contribution to human happiness as can be conceived, and Cleese's sense of humor makes it all digestible."},{"Title":"Families and How to Survive Them","review":"I had this book for many years before I got around to reading it, so perhaps my expectations had built but, even so, I cannot express how disappointed I was in it. It does include some interesting theories of how problems develop through childhood, but offers little by way of how to overcome them - apart from committing oneself to numerous sessions (and lots of cash) with a shrink (but predictable given that one of the authors is one). I was amazed too that it may be the most subtly sexist book I have ever read!Its main limitation is that its focus is almost exclusively the 'traditional' family of mum, dad and the kids. It is also out of date in a couple of areas in its field and makes some rather questionable claims, such as a \\"good\\" mother will stop breast-feeding her baby at 6 months old (the world health organisation recommends breast-feeding up to 12 months for the benefit of both baby and mother) and that the baby's father needs to \\"claim\\" the mother from their child as if she were an object (not sure why 'sharing' her is such a dangerous idea). Further sexist ideas had me checking the first published date because I wondered if it perhaps had been written in the 1950s (or maybe even the 1850s), but I was surprised to find that, no, it has only been on bookshelves a decade or so.There is a first for everything and this book gave me one - I treat all my books with great respect, keep the ones I will read again and give books I no longer want to charity, so I was very surprised to find myself throwing this one in the rubbish-bin in disgust.My copy was not new so hopefully the book has been updated since (or better yet totally re-written) to be more balanced and less limited. Buy it if you wish, but keep in mind that it has a very Freudian bias and read it with a wary mind.

Both very interesting and informative"},{"Title":"Families and How to Survive Them","review":"This book can be best described as two smug, arrogant idiots proclaiming their unsubstantiated beliefs and opinions as fact.When describing what is wrong with this book, it's difficult to know where to start. There's the fact that the authors seem to deliberately and consciously avoid presenting any supporting evidence for their proclamations, preferring to appeal to the reader's \\"common sense\\", presumably because they don't actually have any evidence.Then there's the actual beliefs they espouse, beliefs so insane and offensive that it truly worries me that people could actually think that way. Some of it can, of course, be attributed to the book's age, but even so, some of it is just strange in any context."},{"Title":"Families and How to Survive Them","review":"This is a useful, humorous, non-pompous book for people seeking insight into the workings of (please note) Western, nuclear-style, fairly conventional families. Skynner is a genial, compassionate man who has obviously enjoyed his career in family therapy and doesn't have much of an ax to grind, while Cleese's wry interjections help give perspective. Particularly praiseworthy are vignettes from Skynner's practice in which he shows how a malfunctioning family system can be nudged toward better health by precipitating very small changes in behavioral styles, without excess angst or struggles with dragons. I also appreciate his focus, common also to Eric Berne and Michele Weiner-Davis (see their books), on finding and embracing what works rather than dwelling on what does not. For people trying to enjoy the best about their families and especially younger children, this book could solve a number of frustrating mysteries. Likewise, it's useful for grasping the ways that certain behaviors and types of people feel attractive and comfortable, and why some situations &quot;push the buttons&quot; of an individual or within a relationship.I do have some caveats. While not Freudian in any strict sense, Skynner occasionally seems to share the reductionist attitudes of &quot;the Master,&quot; leaving you with the feeling that every human interaction and achievement is no more than the search for fulfilment of a parlayed (and frustrated) infant or toddler. True as this can be in everyday situations, I feel that it is not the whole picture and should be balanced by writers examining the human urge to evolve to a more aware, creative and functional state. Thwarting of this urge seems to me a source of a significant number of human conflicts, in or out of the family context, not to be resolved solely through reflecting on one's (non)progress through various developmental stages. Maslow, James Hillman and Robert Anton Wilson come to mind.Especially, my jaw drops when Skynner sets forth his views on the development of homosexuality. I can't remember the last time I heard any otherwise credible and humane writer ascribe homosexual orientation to problems in bonding or detaching with a parent of whichever gender. The more gay people I know, and the longer that gay people are free to live openly in various pockets of American society without fear of crippling social sanctions, the more apparent it seems to me that a few gay people within a straight majority are just part of nature's plan. Studies of animal behavior, brain structures and potential genetic links support this view. So I'm dead amazed to see Skynner, otherwise not terribly doctrinaire, still discussing homosexual orientation, certainly not with any kind of punitive moralizing, but as if it were a kind of arrested development that could/should be &quot;treated&quot; for maximum happiness.But then, no book on human behavior is the perfect answer to all your dreams of insight. Nothing is drearier than the person who has read one book looking beneath the surface of human conflicts and believes he/she has found the guru with all the answers, so take this book for what it's worth--kind, commonsensical and applicable to many families you probably know--and don't stop investigating."},{"Title":"Families and How to Survive Them","review":"This book is one of the rare &quot;ha&quot; books out there! No stupid little behavioral reciepes like &quot;look at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself how much yourself&quot;.

It very clearly addresses the fact that children are not just little people ---unless the grown-ups you know are stuck in some early stage developmental quagmire.

I recommend the book as a primer for becomming more adult and for developing more understanding yourself and your choices."},{"Title":"Families and How to Survive Them","review":"Underlying Cleese's (Of Monty Python, etc) wit has evidently been lots of therapy and divorce court (&quot;...divorce is underrated.&quot; he says tongue in cheek).

Psychoanalysis never had such a coherent explanation!And the voice of John Cleese makes a great delivery for the info. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Families and How to Survive Them","review":"This is a book about family therapy in the form of a dialog between John Cleese (of Basil Fawlty fame) and Robyn Skynner, a psychiatrist whose group therapy sessions he has attended and from which he feels he has greatly profited. It is apparently intended as a self-help book and many readers have recognized themselves and their families in it and have found it useful.It's meant to be read for entertainment as much as instruction. As a text on family therapy it has drawbacks. One limitation is that it's British and was published in 1983.The ideas about child development are Freudian and might be of special interest for someone who wants to learn about object-relations theory. Melanie Klein quarreled with Anna Freud to start the British object-relations school.As an example of their style of reasoning, Skynner tells Cleese that male transsexuals \\"typically have mothers who have given them a blissful infant experience but prolonged it passed the time when they should be helping\\" and fathers who are \\"usually nonentities\\". If the mother is \\"powerful and possessive\\" but less possessive than the transsexual mother, the boy becomes homosexual.To support such theories he uses phrases such as \\"experiments have shown\\" or \\"in my experience.\\""},{"Title":"Families and How to Survive Them","review":"This isn't a stereotypical self-help type of book and that makes it THE book that could save your marriage and/or the way you relate to your children.One warning - much of this book goes against the common wisdom of the day and the authors don't propose that parents mollycoddle their children. The focus is on teaching people to live in the real (NOT ideal) world and to learn to deal with it, to develop some backbone and realistic expectations.In short, this is a book which will keep you from seeing yourself as a victim and teach you to accept the inevitable unfairness in life - and to help your children develop similar strengths."},{"Title":"Families and How to Survive Them","review":"This book has been on my shelf and read countless time for over 2 decades.

White's The Sword in the Stone is a story that must be read. Nowhere in the movie do you get delicious bits like:\\"The cottage had a brass plate screwed on the garden gate. It said: Madame Mim, B.A. (Dom-Daniel) Pianoforte, Needlework, Necromancy.\\"Or how about the casual mention of Merlin in running shorts ... Merlin knitting his beard into the nightcap he's making ... Merlin's dishes washing themselves up, shouting, \\"Hey! Let's dunk the tea pot!\\"Or a falcon who's been mewed up too long and cannot keep from quoting all the bloody passages of Macbeth? (My personal favorite bit of deliciousness, since I have a similar character in my story.)Most people pick up the story of King Arthur from the day in the churchyard, when young Art pulls the sword from the stone and is hailed by all of Merry Old England as their sovereign lord. T.H. White, however, looks back to the innocent childhood of England's once and future king, the days when outlaws like Robin Wood (read: Hood) roamed the Forest Sauvage and knights spent their entire lives questing mysterious beasts.While certain passages did drag on and I felt like someone should remind White that young readers aren't interested in philosophy, and he harped about evolution more than once, this would make a wonderful read-aloud ... Ay say, the dialogue is absolutely lovely, what?"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"This is my first T.H. White book, and WOW I love it! The story was written in the 1930s, published in 1938. Around the time of CS Lewis and JRR Tolkein. I would say this book is unique and outstanding of the Narnia and The Lord of the Rings series. It is not comparable to any other books I've read. The Disney motion picture version of the book does not give away anything. I have the DVD and I find every detail of the plot is surprising. It is a great read for both children and the adults. I strongly recommanded it for readers of all age."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"I didn't really want to read this book at first, because it was for an English class of mine. When I started reading it I was pleasently suprised! I ended up enjoyng this book very much! I would recomend reading it to anyone looking for a humorous adventure story.My favorite character would have to to Merlin. Merlin is a good wizard. He plays a huge roll in this book. Merlin made this book funny and much more interesting. Why wouldn't T.H White put him in more of the story? My only complaint of this book would have to be Merlin not being even more invloved and humorous!This story has evry interesting character development also. Kay, Wart's best friend, future knight, and Sir Ecotr's son, is the character I enjoyed watching develop the most. Kay came across to me as a snob at the start of the book. Later in the book he shows his true colors when he crys to Wart. At the end I didn't like him again when he lied about pulling the sword from the stone, but then when he confessed that it truely was Wart I liked him again.I really enjolyed this book. It turned an unwanted English project into something I can look back and love. I would definately recomend this book. Thank you T.H White for the amazing read!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The book was perfect as if it had never been used.The shipment was fast.I recommande this produce ;) ."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"In a discussion with a friend about fantasy books, he recommended The Sword in the Stone by T.H. White. He said it was a classic piece of fantasy and that I needed to read it. Obviously, I had heard the title before, but aside from that, I knew basically nothing about the book. I was hoping to read something great - and in White's defense, maybe the book is great, but it's not at all what I was expecting and because of that I was sorely disappointed. T.H. White's \\"The Sword in the Stone\\" is a children's book. Despite that, it's a tough read both because it takes place in a medieval time period, and because the book itself was written (I'm assuming based on its first copyright date) back in 1939. For my tastes, the book is slow, uninteresting, and a chore to read. I suspect that this exact telling of the story is the basis for Disney's children's movie by the same title.If you're looking for a child's story and don't mind the antiquated language, then you may enjoy the book. If you're a fan of current fantasy and are looking for something to read, I don't know that I could recommend the book."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"T. H. White wrote The Sword in the Stone. He was one of President Kennedy's best and brightest. The Sword in the Stone is a fantasy novel, intended for adults, mostly due to the difficult working. It's purpose is to tell a story and to entertain. The title is self explanatory for anyone who has heard Arthurian legends before, but if not, it becomes obvious towards the end of the book.The Sword in the Stone tells the story of a young boy called the Wart who's adventures with the wizard Merlyn helped prepare him for his last adventure as the Wart and his first as Arthur. Wart is raised on a manor with his adopted father Sir Ector and stepbrother Kay. Kay gains an increasingly important role in the end. He and Wart slowly grow apart to the extent that he serves as one of the few antagonists. The language used in the book is one of the few challenges that I had with the book. I had a hard time with the way the book switched back and forth from Modern English to Old English. One of the main arguments in the book is \\"Might versus Right, or Strength vs. Justice.\\"I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historic fiction or fantasy. Despite the confusing grammar, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author did a great job of creating three dimensional characters and a complex but not confusing plot. I especially enjoyed how the author could shift from a serious dialogue between William Twyti and Robin Wood to a comical scene with Sir Grummore and King Pellinore."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"If you like books about King Arthur and all his adventures then you'll like this book. It is filled with magic and strange creatures a plenty. It is not just fun for children, but the whole family!

Having not read a children's classic in awhile, I had to get used to the vernacular all over again. Once I was able to follow it, the stories unfolded and I couldn't get enough. Mr. White truly knows how to get you to step into another world with ease. He takes all different kinds of characters and historical people to make this story work. I was truly pleased.The Young Wart, Arthur, was shy at first. He knew what his station in life would always be due to the fact that he didn't know who his parents were. Sir Ector was kind enough to take him under his wing. Yet there were certain things Wart knew he'd never do. Or so he thought. Merlyn was a fantastic character! I loved seeing a new take on Merlyn. The other characters of King Pelinore, Sir Ector, Madam Mim and others brought the cast to a completion. The range of their personalities were fun to watch unfold.The adventures were so much more fun than the Disney movie. I was truly impressed with how much was followed yet the things that were left out were my favorites. The beginning dragged for me but by the end, I was sad to see it end. This was a fun romp in period fiction and I am curious to see what else was written by this author. I wouldn't read this to anyone under the age of 10 only since there is some coarse language used. There were times I was surprised I didn't burst out into song with all the bits of songs that were part of the story!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is about a young boy called the Wart and all the interesting things he learns. His tutor, a magician named Merlyn, changes the Wart into many different animals. While he is an animal he learns there are many ways to look at life. He realizes life beyond castle walls is different and harder than most would think. The Wart becomes a well-educated young man who is very gentle but not afraid to stand up for what he believes. The book was very enjoyable because it always kept me guessing and had a good plot. The book kept me interested becasue the chapters never started slow and climaxed toward the end; for the most part the entire chapter was fun to read. I wanted to keep reading because the plot was never dull. In one chapter the Wart is on an adventure with Robin Wood; then in the next chapter he is watching an exciting jousting match. If you like a strong plot and exciting chapters, you will really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The book &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; by: T.H White, is about a young boy named wart along with many friends going on long journeys during the Middle Ages, through out royal land and castles, getting lost in the woods, and meeting strange mystical people along with meeting Merlin the magical magician. I really liked the book &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; because I found it very exiting and extremely interesting because once you get into it, it's very hard to put the book down. It's a book for all people because it has action, science/fiction, and comedy. Even though it is a short 288 page book, there is still a lot of action and there is definitely a lot of Medieval people, events, etc. The best part of reading &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; is that there is a lot of things to learn about and there is a lot of interesting parts in the book. If you really like a book with character and exiting action, comedy, and interesting facts, you should read &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;. I really think that the author &quot;T.H White&quot; did a very well job with keeping myself and everybody interested in the book and making it an extremely lovable book. In conclusion, I think &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; is one of the best Middle Ages books to read, it's an educational book, and especially, I think that more people should read it and get other books written by T.H White, because he writes the best medieval books."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is a fantastic book to read for several reasons.The first reason is the title, which sounds like an exciting adventure story. As soon as I looked at the cover with a magician and a young boy on it, I knew it wouild be something I would be interested in. The short summary on the inside of the cover told me enough about the story to know that I would read this from end to end. The other thind the summary told me was that the book was about King Arthur, who I've always wanted to read about. I picked out the book and immediately decided that this was something I would read.The main character is young Arthur. He is a young boy who is typical of young people in his time. He is brave, thoughful of others, and very respectful to his elders. When his tutor, the Magician Merlyn, begins his education, Arthur's curiosity and talent for learning become apparent. Even so, Arthur and his brother, Kay, run and play as normal kids would. Not too much is made of the fact that Arthur is adopted.It would be fair to say that Arthur is shown to be somebody who will grow into greatness but will be perfectly normal getting there.I really like this book because it is a fast-moving story with a great deal of adventure and magic. Arthur's adventures put him into all kinds of circumstances and problems. In fact, each adventure is a unique hapenning. The way the author weaves adventure and magic into his tales makes the book hard to put down. I especially liked the time when Merlyn turned Arthur into a bird. When Arthur was locked in a box and almost cooked by a witch, I enjoyed how Arthur used a goat as a messenger. This kind of descriptive writing made me feel like I was inside the book. I wouild have to say that this book is an exciting, magical adventure story, which I enjoy greatly."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"We got this book for my son's assigned summer reading from his school. The book itself is good and discussion worthy, and will make a good classroom topic, hitting upon some controversial topics. The book itself has some wear, but for the cost was a pretty good value. It had a bit of a musty smell, like it came from an old school or library. But, hey; it was used, so we weren't expecting perfection.I'd buy from this seller again. And, my son would recommend the book to others for a good read."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"I'm only in the middle of the book, but it is fantasic! My school teacher is reading the same book and can't put it down. She even reads in the middle of class! This is an amazing book to read and I am so wanting to read more and more every day. It's wonderful and an adventure with every new page. If you are most enterested in King Arthur then read it. It will tell you more then enough info about King Arthur. It is one of T.H.White's most fantasic and fanous story. It was amazing!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"Young Arthur, (known to everyone else as &quot;Wart&quot;,) learns from his tutor, Merlin, stuff that he could only dream about before, coming to life before his eyes. Like watching Jousts, turning in to fish, birds, and other animals, and going on adventures with Robin Wood,(commonly known as Robin Hood.) but makes mistakes, gets injured, and learns from them. And all of this only helps in his future life, and his quest, which is his destiny. I rated the sword in the stone a 5 because It was a extremely good book, and the only things that might affect my judgment is the fact that sometimes they use old English. It is sometimes hard to understand because some of the wording is a little old, and, and stuff like that. But T.H. White is able to incorporate a story of king Arthur, and a story full of distinct, funny and odd people, (basically, a comedy,) in to one great book. Another reason that I think that it is a good book because T.H.White gets really in depth throughout the whole book, he can describe every detail, in other words, he can really &quot;Paint a perfect picture.&quot; So all in all I say that if you are interested in King Arthur at all, you should definitely read this book! It does not matter if you are twelve or twenty-one, thirty or seventy, you will truly enjoy The Sword in The Stone. It is definitely a top ten on my list! If you like The Sword in the stone as much as I do, then I recommend reading The Once and Future King, also by T.H.White."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"I must admit, at first I wasn't keen on the idea of reading a novel based on Arthurian legend for English. Despite my love of the Disney cartoon, I felt certain that the book would be dull and slow-moving, with little or no comic relief, and cardboard characters. I was sure that knights and swordplay would hold no interest for me. Yet, as soon as I picked up The Sword in the Stone by T.H. White, I changed my mind. This well-written book was engrossing, lively, and humorous, three qualities which, based on my preconceived notions of the book, I never would have expected a novel on Arthurian legend to have.I grew up watching Walt Disney's cartoon version of the book, and it was always one of my favorites. But can you trust a Disney cartoon to be the same as the book? Because they always change the story so that it will appeal to younger audiences, it is difficult for Disney to stay accurate. To my surprse, the movie is actually rather true to the book.T.H. White's vivid characters really bring this fabulous story to life with lovable, animated personalities. As you follow Arthur (affectionately nicknamed &quot;Wart&quot;)on a series of wonderful, wild events under the tutelage of Merlyn, you grow to enjoy spending time with this eager character who is anxious to learn and is always up for an adventure. Merlyn, the slightly eccentric old magician who lives life backwards, and who has come to the Castle Savauge to tutor Arthur and Kay, is lovely, as well. Then there is the crazy, fun-loving King Pellinore, who spends his life on the trail of the Questin' Beast. With his many excellent portrayals. T.H. White makes you feel as though you've made some new friends.The unique plot of this book is one of the things that keeps you constantly wrapped up in it. From becoming a fish, to rescuing friends with Robin Wood (NOT Hood) and Maid Marian, to going on a possibly deadly boar hunt with the whole village, Arthur does it all. You are sure to be enthralled as Arthur sees what it's like to be an ant, an owl, and many other creatures. The fun, frolicking plot is like no other, so it always keeps you interested and waiting for more. And, of course, there is always the happy ending, which I won't give away for those of you who do not already know what it is. The plot is different in that it has several small dilemmas, rather than one major obstacle for Arthur to overcome. So, if you are looking for a suspenseful book that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this is not the book for you. But if you are looking for a comical book with a playful, whimsical plot, energetic, delightful characters, and an all-in-all happy mood, The Sword in the Stone is your book of choice."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"It has been many years since I read the works of T.H.

The book brought back fond memories of summers spent at my grandparents' home, and of reading the numerous works of children's literature in their home library.The Sword and the Stone is a wonderful work of fantasy, of Arthur's childhood and tutelage under the great wizard, Merlyn. It is full of fun and adventurous exploits, giving readers and anyone interested in Arthur a fantastical glimpse into Arthur's life during childhood. The Philomel edition is especially recommended for the beautiful, detailed, full color illustrations by artist Dennis Nolan. There are seventeen full-page color illustrations which enhance one's reading pleasure.

To read it is an undescribable experience.I recommend it uncondoitionally to all lovers of fantasy"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The book &quot;The Sword In The Stone&quot; written by T.H. White was a very exciting and interesting book. The book was about a young boy named The Wart brought up in a wealthy family of his father, Sir Ector, and his brother, Kay. He met a wizard who became his tutor but not any ordinary tutor. This tutor, Merlyn, turned The Wart into different animals and what-not to give Wart the greatest adventure of his life. I really liked this book because it was really exciting and kept you on your toes. The adventures that Wart was faced with were exciting, fun, and entertaining. One of the adventures that I liked the most was the first one The Wart was sent on. He was turned into a fish and seemed so vulnerable then because he needed to learn how to swim and to get used to the water. It was exciting! Even when the book started to get a little bleak the author would always come back with a new, fun adventure to keep you on your toes. There was only one point that I didn't like. The author would spend one out of about every five chapters just describing the scenery and the place they were in. That got rather monotonous to read.I would recommend this book to a skilled reader but no one under the age of ten.

We hold a lot of power within us, but not enough to fight our fates. Fascinating theories and themes such as these are presented and strongly portrayed in T.H. White's The Sword in the Stone. The inexorable power of destiny is beautifully illustrated in this book, which takes us through many adventures of the boyhood of legendary King Arthur.Readers gain a respect for young King Arthur (identified in this story as \\"the Wart\\") from the very start. Though the Wart is treated somewhat unkindly by his guardians, Sir Ector and Kay, he does what he knows is right in all situations. These situations include the first main incident of the story, in which the Wart bravely stays a whole night alone in a dark forest, simply to retrieve a servant's loose bird. He also keeps his head and his priorities straight despite his older brother Kay's naggings and his envy for Kay's station in society. The Wart is somewhat confused and unsure of his purpose in life, but soon his main guardian Sir Ector hires a wizard named Merlyn to tutor and educate the boy. Thus marks the beginning of the future king's great adventures and learning experiences. Putting to use his magical powers, the wizard educates the Wart by transforming him into several different creatures so that the boy can see life from various points of view. One day, as Arthur is trying to find a sword for Kay to use in a jousting match, he comes across a sword in a stone (which is the title's derivation). He struggles to pull it out for quite some time, then senses that something strange and unusual is in the air around him, something magical, and the sword easily slips out. His family and all the townspeople are shocked and somewhat dismayed when they hear the news, but nevertheless the meek, submissive, experienced Arthur inherits the throne. The ending ties up many loose ends and brings the whole story together in one great, triumphant, fulfilling close.Strange and contradicting as it may seem, I both dislike and love this detailed book. I dislike it because I feel that many parts are too long and drawn-out, especially descriptions of places and the Wart's out-of-body experiences. I love the story because it is very creative and poses thought-provoking theories and pieces of advice about life. I enjoy the humorous parts of this book, which are sporadically sprinkled within both casual and serious situations. I think that the young king's experiences are relevant and can be beneficial to many who seek different viewpoints of life.I personally recommend The Sword in the Stone to people who read at about the junior-high or high-school level, roughly age twelve and up, who are interested in Arthurian legend. I especially recommend it to males, as I feel that it is generally a male-directed book. I state this because there are very few female characters involved in the story, and those are very minor (yet not inferior) characters. It is possible that this is due to the fact that the author himself is a male. Nonetheless, The Sword in the Stone contains many important themes which will be beneficial to all types of people who choose to read the book."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"There are parts in the book that start to bore you at times.

The author certainly introduces some interesting characters, and overall, I found it a joy to read, and one of the few books I reread regularly."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"T.H.White must have published at least three slightly different versions of this story.When I read the full Once And Future King book a few years ago, there was no Madame Mim episode, there was a buttery version of the fairy castle (Robin Hood) episode, there was an Archimedes/Wild Geese episode, and some other minor changes/additions.When I read a paperback Sword In The Stone twenty years ago, there was a much nicer non-buttery version of the FairyCastle/RobinHood episode, and I don't think the Giant Galapas episode was there, etc.Now I've just read the illustrated hardcover Sword In The Stone edition, and the FairyCastle/RobinHood episode is replaced by an Anthropophagi/RobinHood episode, Giant Galapas is there, and the Archimedes/WildGeese isn't (its been replaced by an Archimedes/Athena episode).Anyone else notice these differences and have an explanation for them?"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Wart is a young boy from an unknown parentage who is raised by Sir Ector in The Sword in the Stone. Wart calls Sir Ector father, but it is Sir Ector's real son, Kay, who is destined to be knighted and Wart his squire. The Magician Merlyn is the tutor of both Wart and Kay, but he puts most of his efforts on Wart.The Sword in the Stone is book 1 of a 4 book series, The Once and Future King, by T.H. White (Terence Hanbury White) about King Arthur. There actually is no direct refernce to this story being about King Arthur until the end except for a few name drops here and there which one wouldn't even suspect if they weren't familiar with King Arthur's tales. It was pretty obvious who would eventually get named King Arthur.This book was written in the 1930s like Lord of the Rings, but reads very differently. The Sword in the Stone is basically written for the younger fantasy readers. First off it's rather short and secondly there isn't the character development or plot developments that you expect to see in adult epic fantasies.Wart's education from Merlyn consists mostly of observing the world from different animals like owls, badgers, ants, etc. They all play a part in the end in helping the true sword owner pull the unnamed sword (at this point at least) out of the stone.Well I can't say this was one of my favourites, but I did buy the entire The Once and Future King series on my e-book and I am a sucker for mythology, so I'll definitely finish it. It's an easy enough read that I don't really need to force myself to read it. I'm sure a younger audience (the target audience of this book) who aren't as familiar with King Arthur would get more out of this book than adult readers."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"So much fun. I love the Disney movie and there is a lot of the book that has been put in the movie. Merlin is a hoot and the Wart is a sensitive boy who likes learning. Most of the chapters are able to stand on their own, and it's like reading a collection of very short stories involving the same cast of characters. Merlin turns the Wart into a seriers of different animals as part of his education. Very inventive and fun to read."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"This is the first part of the Once and Future King series of novels.Wart, a young boy, initially has no idea who he really is. This is thestory of this young lad, and the events and lessons and trials thatlead to him becoming a leader. Of course, it details the bumbling andaccidents that lead him to drawing The Sword in the Stone."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"This is an interesting little book. I read it as part of my children's literature course back in 1999. The book is partially Arthurian Legend, part social commentary and part farce.I did not like the inappropriate references for the time of the story, trains, buses ... As well I didn't appreciate the mixing of Robin Hood (Wood) in the 12th Century with Arthur of the 6th Century.Yet all in all it was a fun book - easy to read."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is about King Arthur, as a boy called Wart, between the ages 10 to 16. Wart grew up in the castle of Sir Ector, with Sir Ector himself, and his son Kay. Wart is taught by the famous wizard known as Merlyn, how to be a man. Merlyn sends Wart on many magnificent and magical adventures, transforming him from one creature to the next and sending him on spectacular journeys and quests all through the land.The Sword in the Stone was a book that was easy to pick up and get right into, but also easy to put down and feel like you could almost fall asleep if you read one more page. It would change from interesting to dull consistently throughout the book. There were parts that were very detailed, and exciting, but other parts that were very boring, and hard to understand.The detail was so incredible that as you read you feel as though you are right there with the characters. The details help you to imagine things like Merlyn's blue and gold-starred robe to the exact movement of the sneaky snake as he approaches Wart. The exciting parts of the book tell fantastic fantasy stories that let your imagination run wild. The &quot;Wizard Duel&quot; between Madame Mim and Merlyn goes on for page after page as the two struggle to defeat one another. They use their enchantedpowers and fight for hours on end, until Merlyn thinks of a despising plan, and takes care of Madame Mim once and for all.There are parts in the book that start to get boring and can lose your attention quickly, but as soon as you are about to put the book down,Merlyn has once again performed his magic, and Wart is experiencing yet another splendid adventure. There was a part where Wart and Robin Hood travel with their army to fight against the Anthropophagi (a wild variety of ferocious beasts). They walk throught the woods for days before reaching their destination. This really bores an interested reader. There were many sections of the books that seemed confusing to me. I didn't understand the part where Merlyn transforms Wart into a bird and Wart flys down to the barn to talk with the other birds and hawks. The birds were talking nonsense words that were very hard to catch on to. I must say though that The Sword in the Stone was very appealing to me, despite the parts that I struggled to understand and read through."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"I enjoyed this book very much as a child but \\"get\\" much more of it now.--Funny, funny, funny, and not the least realistic or representative of the Dark Ages in which Arthur must have (may have) lived.-- White's jokes at the expense of the British upper class of the thirties is first-rate; and there are a few hints of the European conflict building at the time of publication. It is a little silly to try to find anything very profound in this one; for a wonderful and more serious treatment of the Arthurian legend, start with The Crystal Cave by Mary Stewart."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"\\"Sword in the Stone\\" is the must-read book of Arthuriana, an imaginative fantasy romp that has inspired all our ideas about the venerable Merlin and about King Arthur's boyhood. White infuses the book with whimsy, poignancy, and a mixture of early 20th-century England and medieval times.Sir Ector's ward Arthur (known as \\"Wart\\") has no idea what he's in for when he accompanies Ector's son Kay out on a hunt. When a bad-tempered hawk escapes and refuses to come out of a tree, Wart ends up staying behind all night in the hopes of recapturing it. But he's interrupted by an odd old man called Merlin and his talking owl Archimedes. Merlin captures the hawk -- and then comes home with Wart. Soon he is firmly established as tutor to the two boys.But they soon discover that nobody is quite like Merlin, and the lessons he has to teach Wart are more than just math and Latin. Merlin transforms Arthur into a fish, an owl, a hawk, and sends him on bizarre journeys with Robin Wood (Wood, not Hood -- a common mistake) and his band of Merry Men, a duel with an evil witch, a gathering of trees, a fumbling King and the Questing Beast, and capture in a sinister giant's castle.T.H. White was a wonderful author, and an even better comic author. His characters are fully fleshed and endearing (even the nasty ones), but at the same time there is a delightful lightness to them. There isn't a speck of realism in the entire book -- chronology is bent and spindled, magic and realism are twisted together, and readers won't care at all. In a sense, \\"Sword\\" seems almost to exist in a parallel universe where animals talk, Robin Hood chit-chats with the once and future king, and carnivorous humanoids roam through Britain.\\"Wart\\" is a good hero -- quiet, unassuming, thoughtful, and occasionally puts his foot in his mouth. His foster brother Kay is also good -- Kay is hot-tempered and a little loud-mouthed, but he is a nice person at heart. Merlin is the perfect crabby gray wizard, eccentric and unashamed to use his magic in a perfectly casual manner, and constantly a little befuddled due to his ability to live backwards in time. He'll endear himself to readers from the first page onward. There are dozens of equally funny characters: The always-questing King Pellinore and his Beast, the worried Sir Ector, the walking mustard-pot, the crabby but kindly owl Archimedes, and many, many more.White's writing goes at a slightly uneven clip: Sometimes it zips along quickly, at other times it crawls. He displays plenty of knowledge about medieval times, and seems a little too eager to reveal it to the readers. But his descriptions and dialogue are delightful, a mix of the modern and the medieval. There are some extremely frightening scenes, and some (such as the having to put down a fatally-injured dog) that will make you cry.Readers will come out of this book feeling like they have made a number of memorable, kindly friends. It's a must-read for anyone who loves the legends of Arthur."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"Finding a COMPLETE version of this book is difficult. When the Sword and the Stone was grafted onto the rest of the series to form the Once and Future King, T.H. White removed several scenes from the book. Growing up enjoying the Walt Disney version of the film, I was disappointed when I read the Once and Future King. Where was the wizard's duel between Merlyn and Madam Mim? Surely, Disney didn't come up with that on their own.Well, the truth is these lost parts are still out there if you wish to find them. Some of the lost episodes include: Kay and Wart taken captive by Madam Mim, a wizard's duel between Merlyn and Mim, Wart and Kay battle a giant who has taken King Pellinore captive, Wart becomes a snake, and Archimedes takes the Wart in bird form to meet his mother Athene and hear a song from the trees. The version I found that still contained these passages was published in 1963 and features Disney illustrations on the cover. I do not know if other versions include these chapters, but the Once and Future King does not.Some speculate that White thought these episodes to be too childish and light-hearted, but I think they are wonderful. The Sword in the Stone is a very difficult book for children. I believe it needs these light-hearted moments to offset the preachy life lessons. Don't get me wrong, I think the lessons that can be learned from the book are innumerable, but everyone needs a little fun with their learning.If you are looking to read the Sword in the Stone, I encourage you to seek out the oldest version with the chapters still in tact. They're worth it."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is a truly wonderful book. It is the classic story of young King Arthur, but told in greater depth and detail, and filled with wonderful, humorous characters. The tale so many times retold suddenly becomes fresh and original, as T.H. White's stunning narrative sweeps the reader into the world of Midieval England, and makes the old story come alive in a new and delightful way. Never before has anyone been able to make the old characters of Arthur and Merlyn, Sir Ector and King Pellinore come alive in such a real and fantastic way. The story is brought to life, and is better by far then the traditional telling of the tale. White does not only tell the simple story of the sword in the stone- here he tells the story of the boy who pulled it out. He goes back and tells us about the growing up of this boy, that we might better understand why it was he that was meant for this destiny, and what it was that shaped him for this task. And throughout the entire story, the book sparkles with humour, wit and charm, which is all the better because it is told in Old English. There are too many books these days written in modern language, using slang and twentieth century dialect, so the Sword in the Stone is a delightful change of pace. And while the Old English sounds perfectly authentic, it is not overly used, and is never difficult to understand. My nine year old sister understood it perfectly, when I read it to her. All in all, this story is the best retelling of any Arthurian legend that I have ever read. I would encourage anyone who has an interest in King Arthur to read this book."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Once and Future King, which is built upon and uses text from the Sword in the Stone, is one of my favorite books. Much like the Hobbit is a sometimes silly preamble to the Lord of the Rings, The Sword in the Stone is the less serious story of King Arthur as a boy that sets the stage for the novel, The Once and Future King. And like the Hobbit, while it can be occassionally silly- a deadly serious and powerful story is just below the surface.White was clearly impacted by the struggle to hold views of evolution and a God-centered world view, and was also clearly impacted by the tensions of war torn Europe. He weaves some fun stories of Robin Hood, life in a hawk mew, and light-hearted jousting in with all his explaining and metaphorizing, though. I can't imagine not liking the vivid imagery and exotic story-telling, and if you are a fan of any of the other initialed British writers you'll certainly feel at home with T.H. White. Read the Sword in the Stone- it won't take much time, but then by all means read The Once and Future King one day for the real masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"This is the book I read as a child and loved, then read again as a man and loved more. It is part of how I see the King Arthur legend. I will never part with my copy, and I will read it to my son when I have one."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"A boy named the Arthur, called Wart, livng during the Middle Ages, is taught by a magician about the past, present, and future, and about all creatures living on the Earth. When the opportunity arises for the Wart to become King, he must recall everything he has learned to pull the magic sword from the stone and become the new leader of England. I enjoyed this book because it had so many exciting battles and page turning adventures. Even a small bit about Robin Hood! The plot really doesn't appear until the last few chapters, where you realized that every story within the book was connected all along. It is nice to know that there are fun and interesting books to read about the Medeival times. I think that if you are looking for a book with lots of adventure, this is truely one that you should read."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is set in the Middle Ages, in a time of knights and magicians. Actual historical details are presented in the context of a fictional story. It is about the upbringing of young King Arthur. With the help of his tutor, Merlyn, Arthur experiences adventures, which help him to see life from different points of view. These other perspectives of the world will help him when he becomes king. Merlyn is training Arthur with quests, and a little magic. The quests Arthur accomplishes help him to be a more understanding person. Merlyn subjects Arthur to many different situations, some of which include; being turned into animals, meeting new people, and seeing different people living different lives. A key revelation about the magic of Merlyn occurs the first time that Arthur is introduced to his future tutor. While eating a meal, a mustard-pot gets up and walks to Arthur's plate, adds some mustard, and returns to its place. Later, Merlyn explains the order in which he lives his life, which is different from most people. As most people live time forwards, Merlyn lives it backwards. The significance of this is that it open's Arthur's eyes to a completely different way of looking at life. This is an example of one of the many perspectives Arthur will gain from Merlyn's influence. This slightly whimsical way to introduce lessons for Arthur's life is part of what makes this story so popular. Merlyn explains his perception of time in one sentence, stating, &quot;If you know what's going to happen to people, and not what has happened to them, it makes it so difficult to prevent it happening, if you don't want to have it happen,&quot; (39). This quote is essentially the reason Merlyn is tutoring Arthur. Merlyn's goal is to prepare Arthur for what is going to happen in the future. This gift of Merlyn's came in handy later in the story when Kay, Arthur's brother, and Arthur leave without telling their father. Sir Ector searches for them until he thinks of consulting Merlyn. &quot;The magician for the sake of peace and quietness to go with his nap in, had used his insight to tell Sir Ector exactly what the boys were doing, where they were, and when they might be expected to come back. He had prophesied their return to a minute,&quot; (162). Part of what makes this book so fun is the fantasy that someone can be looking out for us and protecting us while we are impetuous youngsters.While this was an entertaining and educational story, there were many unnecessary details. These frivolous details made for long stretches between the action sequences. I would recommend this book to those readers who prefer careful attention paid to details. For me, the stage setting tended to drag the story down a little. I would have enjoyed a little more action and frivolous and magical events. I like the way the character of the Wart was developed. I was able to notice his leadership ability and maturity level early on, and follow them as they progressed through the story. If knights in shining armor, castles, and mysticism fascinate you, this is the book for you. The Sword in the Stone is the most well known re-creation of Medieval England for young adults. It is a classic story that has been enjoyed by many generations and no doubt will be enjoyed by many, many more."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"\\"The Once and Future King\\" is a delightful series of stories, but this is by far the superior, and first off the rank. It is the story of Wart, a hapless orphan boy, and his adventures once his new tutor Merlin arrives on the scene (some of you may be aware of the Walt Disney animated movie of the same name).This is real adventure stuff and is appealing to both young readers and grown ups alike. Wat and his friends have all manner of exciting escapades as birds, as fish, and as combatants with witches, and in the background there is all the fanciful goings on of a very disorganised medieval castle.There are many novels which deal with the Arthurian legend, some well, most tastefully, and some take themselves entirely too seriously. This is just plain good fun and well written too. Enjoy yourself!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"&quot;The sword in the stone&quot;I would definitely recommend T.H. White's &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; to anyone faintly interested in The Dark Ages or The Arthurian legends, althought I think someone between the ages 12-25 would appreciate the book more. I say this because I don't think a young child or an adult would enjoy reading, or care for T.H. White's ideas on the simple subjects about some of the parts of everyday life that aren't usually thought about out loud. Some other people I know who are reading &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; think it is boring, but I think you just need to be in a reading mood to comprehend what you've read so you may enjoy this exquisite book.This is the first time I have absorbed any of the Arthurian legends. In my history classes studying The Dark Ages we never really spent any time on the legends or similiar thoughts about that time, because we were pressed for time. So, now, since I liked T.H. White's &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; very much, I have a good impression on all the legends about this mysterious era.Don't be fooled if you have seen the Disney movie &quot;The Sword in the Stone.&quot; It has the same general plot, but the book is mucher better (like most movies that come from a novel). The book is not just directed toawrds the taste of children, and there is much more of the story that the movie didn't present to it's audience.&quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; is a particular tale about King Arthur of England as a young boy. He is not the king in this story, though. Young Arthur has the nickname Wart(not as a mean gesture, but because it rhymes with Art, which is short for Arthur). This legend tells about the Wart, with his wizard tutor, Merlyn, who turns the Wart into animals to teach him about life lessons. He learns a lot from the animals he converses with. He learns things about the history of the world, the theory of life and education, courage, and respect for all types of living creatures. I think that it is quite interesting what these animals tell him. The Wart also teams up with Robin Wood (probably kwown to you as Robin Hood) and his clan and has an adventure that helped make him valiant. This lessons will help him become a magnificent king.I have always enojoyed historical fiction by authors like John Steinbeck and James Mitchner. I consider this book more of a historical fiction than a legend. I say this because during the story, it tells many historical facts about The Dark Ages, an era that I am not too familiar with. What I mean by historical facts, are not dates or names of battles and wars, or anything along those lines, but of such things that were part of the everyday life back in those days. Such things like castle structures and purposes, archery and jousting techniques, and all sorts of similar parts of their life. Mr White's reseach about this time has paid off greatly. His novel seems very complete because of the wonderful correct details about all aspects involved in the Wart's life.I love how T.H. White tries to explain the simple things that just happen without any thought involved. He explains things like how a human would fly like a bird, swim like a fish, or slither like a snake. The Wart doesn't have the instinct to do any of these tasks, so Merlyn teaches him. Someone would think it would be easy to fly, because the birds make it look easy, but I bet it would be very hard and weird. To the animals the skill comes naturally, and without thought, but it wouldn't come easily at all to a human being.Mr. White also tells the reader his theories on how some things came to be. For example he tells why all embryos look alike with their feeble hands and heavy, large heads. It doesn't matter if they are going to become a tadpole, an elephant, a peacock, or a human; they all are identical. He says that God told the embryos (in the 5-6 day of creation) to choose their specialties, and when alive they all would transform into that thing. I enjoy seeing these types of theories, true or not, about all sorts of the little and big things in life.If any of the ideas I have put across seems of interest of you, I recommend &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; very much. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"In The Sword in the Stone by Terence Hanbury White, fantasy and adventure are woven together to create a picturesque and suspenseful story set in Medieval England. The Sword in the Stone recreates the life of young King Arthur as he is taught how to be a gentleman by Merlyn, the powerful but absent-minded magician who lives life backwards. Young Arthur, who is commonly know as the &quot;Wart,&quot; finds himself entwined in many adventures, such as being magically transformed into a fish, a hawk, and a badger. He also meets the likes of Robin Wood, Maid Marian, and Little John on a dangerous adventure he goes on with Kay, his brother. All of the adventures he experiences in the book are part of his training. Merlyn wants him to view life from all different perspectives so that he will be prepared to become the king of England.While Arthur's older brother Kay is preparing for knighthood, it is discovered that King Uther Pendragon, the ruler of England, has died. There is word that there is a sword stuck in a stone which bears an inscription saying that whoever pulls out the sword is the &quot;rightwise king born of all England.&quot; Arthur stumbles upon this, not knowing it is the sword, and manages to pull it out, using everything Merlyn taught him.Merlyn is the key to The Sword in the Stone. If you removed his character from the book, you wouldn't have a story anymore; just a vague picture of a boy named Arthur. Merlyn personifies both humor and wisdom. The fact that he lives life backwards instead of forwards- knowing what will happen next as opposed to knowing about the past- makes him all the more important in this novel. He already knows in advance what the future holds for Arthur, and his training of the boy is really to prepare him for ruling England.Although The Sword in the Stone centers around a young boy's coming-of-age and story elements normally considered juvenile, this novel would be more appreciated by a mature audience, due to the wordiness. Those interested in Arthurian legend will love this book's twists on tradition. The novel starts at a crawl and then suddenly picks up pace, hurling one adventure after another at the reader. This sudden change is difficult to adjust to at first, but slowly you see that it is all part of T.H. White's genius. Arthur's life progressed in this same way, beginning slowly and then picking up speed, as he became tangled in Merlyn's world of magic and whimsy.I found The Sword in the Stone to be quite an engaging book once I got past all the fancy vocabulary and focused on the story. I admire how T.H. White took a historical legend and incorporated so many humorous fables. He was obviously a well-educated man who had a deep passion for Arthurian legend. The novel held some personal meaning for me, since I can relate to Arthur's never-ending need for knowledge, intellect and maturity.Give T.H. White's The Sword in the Stone a try. If you cannot swallow a mixture of imagination, satire and realism all in once shot, you might not want to attempt it. If you do happen to enjoy it, though, I promise you will want to read it repeatedly over time."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is the first part of The Once and Future King pentalogy (followed by The Witch in the Wood, The Ill-Made Knight, The Candle in the Wind and The Book of Merlyn).The Wart is a young orphan boy who lives in the castle of Sir Ector, his foster father.

It had a plot line that was uneventful and I lost interest constantly. The book had a good idea behind it but the final result was rushed and in need of detail. The book started out nice and slow describing life in the middle ages but as the middle to the end comes along, the best parts seem to leave as fast as they come. Wart, the main character, was seemed to be too childish for his age and his upbringing. He is constantly making choices that cause the book to loose its charm and originality. Merlin has a certain appeal to him and does not and is not getting the attention and time he disserves. Through out the plot line there was description (a little bit here a little bit there) and they were very good. But you can't make a good book on a couple of good parts. The middle ages theme was great and I thought it gave it some spunk, The author tells mindlessly of every thing of a young boys life in the middle ages. During the book there was some parts that were not rushed -and almost dragged out- but otherwise were not in enough detail for you to get the picture and understand it fully. In conclusion I think that The Sword in the Stone had the right though but was too rushed to its point across."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Childhood of a Legendary KingThe tale of King Arthur's youth is an enthralling one.

I had to read it for school and I'm going into 10th grade which doesn't make any sense to me. The plot seemed to be directed at 4th graders but no 4th grader would understand the language. I might have given T.H. White a little more credit had this been entirely his creation, but he didn't make up the story; it's an Arthurian Legend (obviously).

But one food server robot at a rest home facility on earth leads five elderly humans into the greatest discovery ever.I gave this four stars because this book kept me entertained for the most part. Does that mean my tastes in books are bad? Probably. I never woulda read this had I not stumbled over it in the dollar store bin. I picked it up because I wanted something different to read. The cover amused me and the storyline (albeit kinda cheesy sounding...pun intended) sounded plausible enough.I enjoyed the story. The humor was light and subtle but I got a few audible laughs here and there. Yes, the plot was kinda droll here and there, but I thought the concept of it all was interesting. It did have the whole 'its all been done before' feel to it. But it was perfect to relax and read at night. The characters were very real and the machines taking on personalities of their own was great too. If this was meant to be a parody, then I guess it went over my head. It did have somerather silly things in it, but the story seemed plausible enough for the futuristic time it was portrayed in.Oh well. I enjoyed it and that's what counts. Aside from a few light vulgarities and swear words, it was a pretty harmless story. I recommend it to those who like a fun science fiction story."},{"Title":"Codgerspace","review":"When Foster's novels are good, they're very good. When they're bad, they're horrid. Codgerspace is beyond bad. Foster tries to be funny in the vein of Douglas Adams, but humorous science fiction is among the most difficult arts, and here, he really muffs it up"},{"Title":"Codgerspace","review":"A classmate recommended I read some of Alan Dean Foster's non-Star Wars works (I have already readSplinter of the Mind's Eye, Star Wars from the Adventures of Luke Skywalker, andThe Approaching Storm). I read the back of this one and thought it might be similar toThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, an absolutely hilarious book. So, naturally, I bought it and read it.Plot:The remains of a leftover cheese sandwich cause all the AIs to begin to contemplate the universe and search for an alien intelligence. One particular AI, a food processor that works at a retirement home on Earth, actually discovers an alien spaceship with the assistance of five of the retirement home's populace (Shimoda, Hawkins, Mina Gelmann, Victor Iranaputra, and Wesley Follingston-Heath). The six must discover a way to keep the humans from obtaining the ship, and the ship from possibly destroying the humans--or having the enormous fleet that is quickly approaching the ship destroy the human civilization.Good:Although still not as funny as Hitchhiker's, this is a rather humorous book. There were a few scenes that I absolutely keeled over. I particularly loved how Ksarusix talked, Follingston-Heath (probably my favorite senior, although Hawkins was a kick), and the Autothor in general. The plot was pretty intriguing and was the primary reason I kept plugging through when part of me wanted to give up.Also, I enjoyed reading about the seniors. Too often books concentrate on the 20 - 30 set, which is far from representative of our society (particularly now when many of the baby boomers are hitting their later years). These five people were unique and although slightly caricatured, were enjoyable to read about. Each person spoke as I thought he or she would (with some slight exceptions on the part of Hawkins, who occasionally used words too advanced for his station).Then, when the aliens do appear (finally!), I enjoyed reading the description of them (kudos to Foster for avoiding the bipedal stereotype!) and how they talked. It was amusing to think that they would sound similar to humans--partly the result of a translator and partly the belief that aliens wouldn't be all that dissimilar from humans.Bad:First off, Foster probably wrote this book with a 3000 page thesaurus next to him. Words like \\"expostulate\\" crop up in Foster's world of everyday speech (particularly incongruous when you hear this from Hawkins, a retired blue collar worker). Yeah, I hear that everyday too. Not. And while the book was funny, I felt that Foster wrote in high society language (i.e. what I would hear from a word addict and not my best friend) so that when he delivered a joke, it came out even more funny. However, this grew very tiresome and even difficult to pick through.Then, we have the fact that between about page 75 and 225 absolutely nothing happens. We are introduced to the problem of the mechanicals, the quest for non-human intelligent life, and the discovery of an alien ship by 5 senior citizens, then Foster apparently got tired and decided to have his five main characters sit back on a beach for days at a time. That is not only insulting to seniors--to say that all they could think of after discovering something as important as an alien artifact is to find a beach and sit there contemplating what's going to happen instead of finding out what's going to happen (which happens about five times if I counted correctly)--but also very boring. Over those 150+ pages, we instead get to see how the other nations have reacted to this. Yawn.But even with these caveats, I was okay with the book (mostly) until about page 225. Then, we are introduced to Zabela Ashili, a hastily thrown together character that makes a miraculous change of heart in such record time, someone ought to call the Guiness Book of World Records people. She arrives in a rather interesting manner, but only Mina Gelmann has any qualms about her strange arrival, but these qualms promptly disappear over the next 5 pages or 7 days their time. Yup, Foster then skips over 7 days of bonding with new character, Ashili, and instead hastily summarizes the events. I figure by this time Foster's editor told him he had better'd finish this book soon. Either that or Foster couldn't think of anything else for the seniors to do on the beach (he already gave them sunshades and let them alter the temperature).Anyway, back to Ashili. So, we are introduced and supposed to bond with a woman who is thrown into the book only 75 pages before the end. Like that is going to happen. And then feel her pain when the seniors are threatened. I'm sorry, but I hardly know this woman and most of the important bonding parts were skimmed over. I don't really care if she's having second thoughts about what she's doing. In fact, I would feel a lot better if the characters we spent knowing over the past 275 pages were doing the actions instead of hovering in the background.Last problem with Ashili, I promise. The Candombleans had been portrayed as the ultimate fraternity/sorority. Up until Ashili, most Candombleans were either partying or hung-over. And we as the audience are supposed to suddenly believe that this culture can train up people like Ashili for undercover missions? I can think of one type of underCOVER mission they would be good for, but that wouldn't exactly gain her access to a spaceship, now would it?Last beef: why did Foster throw that twist about Follingston-Heath? Other than strip him of what made him most exciting, it really served no purpose to the story. Furthermore, it felt forced and dropped in as if Foster thought, \\"Geez, this sounds cool. Let's try it out here.\\"Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:There were quite a few da**, he**, sh**, and other foul words that I found a little surprising. Mina Gelmann is said to have several liaisons, the Candombleans are continuously dressed scantily (and at every opportunity described as such--Foster, what was on your mind, the story or the sexy women?), and the like. Violence is rather tame. A lawn mower threatens a human. That's pretty much the extent.Overall:Hm. What do I say about this? Codgerspace had a very interesting premise. But I despised perusing this novel with a dictionary in close proximity. And having to imbibe copious quantities of caffeinated beverages while the octogenarians convalesced on the artificial coastline composed of ground granite, sodium chloride, and solidified, translucent sandstone. And having a character composed of corrugated carbon-based tree products foisted on me of the way through the book. I have a few other Foster books that I'll probably read, but this was certainly not what I expected from Foster's non-Star Wars works. 5 stars to plot, 4 stars to the seniors, 2 stars to the pacing, and 1 star to the hasty poorly done character addition. All in all, I say 2.5 stars rounded to 3 stars."},{"Title":"Codgerspace","review":"I know that this book has been given bad reviews here, but what some might not realize is that it's intended as a parody (in the vein of Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy) and NOT a &quot;serious SF book.

The computers hae been developed to have artificial intelligence and are spread all over the galaxy. The computers accidentally began to wonder if there are others, besides humans, out there, machines or aliens. They are wondering (truly an accident, if he did not explain the happenstance, no one would imagine what it was that occurred to create these machines questioning existence) what the menaing of life is, existential philosphy, you know.Most all the machines people use have AI, down to the lawn mower and toasters. The 'codgers' live in upstate New York. The one fellow becomes bored and goes to help in the kitchen where he finds a robot going off to find intelligence from somewhere welse. They stumble onto a spaceship, they bring back the others, and the spaceship 'wakes up.' Now it takes them for the crew and does what they tell it to do. The situation gets all confused and no one has any idea of what the ship can do or what it will do, etc., so ship is sent of to space to just wait and see what happens.This is a peaceful story and everything works out for the best for everyone.

It was interesting because I hadn't read it for that result, but it was extremely valuable in putting me back in touch with WHY I do what I do and what it provides for me and for others.

It's the kind of book that you won't want to put down until the last page is read.

Karyn Pettigrew's reflections of her own life experiences add a personal touch that I easily connected with.

The book is well worth the cover price, ten-fold. Can't wait for Karyn's next release!"},{"Title":"I Quit, and Choose Work That Aligns with My Soul","review":"Despite the provocative title, this book is NOT about quitting. It is about being true to oneself and being proactive in finding one's true vocation. I had the pleasure of meeting the author, Karyn Pettigrew, at a recent seminar and she is just as inspiring in person as she is in print. She is able to strike that much sought-after balance between practicality and pursuing one's dreams. And she does so quite brilliantly. Each of the easy to read chapters challenges the reader to look deep inside with honesty. At the beginning of each chapter, Karyn includes an inspirational quote. The most eloquent one came from none other than Yoda of Star Wars! It says simply, &quot;There is no try. There is either do or do not.&quot; A very empowering book, written with authority and authenticity. As evidenced by the large crowd at a recent book signing in Chicago, the time has come for a book like this. It resonates a chord that is in all of us."},{"Title":"I Quit, and Choose Work That Aligns with My Soul","review":"Karyn Pettigrew has masterfully written a concise, straight forward approach to moving into what is one's true calling.

Great book - highly insightful and well written."},{"Title":"I Quit, and Choose Work That Aligns with My Soul","review":"If clarity, happiness and forward life motion are your goals, give this book your attention. In less than 150 pages, Pettigrew gives the reader her &quot;quitting and aligning&quot; story, applies her experience to a framework, complete with worksheets and exercises. I particularly liked the page of emotional descriptors: analytical types will likely find this immensely helpful. Then Pettigrew tells the stories of others, to show that the application of the intuitive method has meaning across the boundaries of education and experience. Because the book includes worksheets and meditations, I recommend that readers scan it informally first as a memoir, then dive into it like a high school workbook. It might also be a good book to consider as a group activity for friends starting a project, or for groups considering change together. My biggest single takeaway from the book was the following message: &quot;there are no friends or enemies, only teachers&quot;. That learning bias made this book a great addition to my mental library for growth and change."},{"Title":"Lit Life","review":"I bought this book based on the review in People Magazine, which just raved about this book.

They reminded me of people I've read about, and some are cameos from real celebs (Chevy Chase makes a real ass of himself!)... Wenzel is somewhere between Wolfe, Hemingway, Russo and B.E.Ellis. It's fun but still feels like you read literature. I just got my hardcover and am going to read it again. I CAN'T WAIT!"},{"Title":"Lit Life","review":"The promotional materials for this book do not do it justice.

Wenzel recreates the NY publishing demi-monde in such a way that it feels extremely accurate, and yet iviting. You feel like a fly on the wall. Furthermore, the characters are very well drawn. The do and say ridiculous things, but are never so over the top so as to become clowns. In fact, what this book does have, ultimately, is a great sense of humanity."},{"Title":"Lit Life","review":"As the novel begins, it seems you're in for comic satire, as young writer Kyle Clayton wakes up from a night of debauchery. And the book delivers plenty of behind-the-scenes laughs over what the book business is all about today. But the book quickly starts to deliver a much greater literary impact. Its greatest strength is its characters. They're not mere stereotypes or rip-offs of famous types -- Jay MacInerny, John Cheever, Candace Bushnell -- they become full-fledged characters with their own quirks and flaws. Wenzel does have a breezy style, but he can also be quite the stylist. There's a section in the head of the wife of the John-Cheever type -- her name is Meryl -- that is lyrical. The books is a very funny send-up of the way the American obsession with celebrity has overtaken the book business, but themes that transcend that business are also explored -- older men's search for proteges, young men's search for mentors, the attempts of self-absorbed fathers and rebellious daughters to connect, to name a few. There are some very poignant statements here about the limitations others' views of us put on our lives. The characters are likable -- even when they behave despicably -- because they're all so trapped by the public images they feel obligated to fulfill. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Lit Life","review":"then literature has a red-headed step child in Lit Life!

Surprising too, was the ending, which I expected to be far more pat.This is a breezy little novel that took me a few short hours to read, but I did read it pretty much straight through because I found it quite engaging. The main characters are full and well-developed, and their respective plights absorbing. I particularly enjoyed the insiders' view of the publishing industry--it appears to be a scary place, one that I will not likely visit during my lifetime as a struggling writer."},{"Title":"Lit Life","review":"The 1st time novelist is no doubt a master wordsman.

That's the question that pops to mind after finishing this pseudo roman a clef.Its formula is simple: take the last half-century of American lit, New York division only, and wrap it around the theme of an artist's struggle between the demands of art and the temptations of commerce.&quot;Lit Life&quot; would make a great party game, along the lines of the one played in the book, in which the first line of a novel is quoted and the players must come up with the book and author. Is Bret Easton Ellis or Jay McInery closer to Kyle Clayton, the brat pack hotshot who's eight years past the blazing success of his debut novel, now infested with writer's block and an adoration of alcohol, on the outs with his friends, his co-writers and his agent? Then there are his potential mentors: the elderly &quot;writer's writer&quot; -- meaning critical favorite but no sales -- Richard Whitehurst, whose last book, in the works for ten years, bombed (let's see, reclusive yet respected and depressive, that's William Gaddis, and the decade-long book that bombed could be &quot;The Tunnel,&quot; by William Gass); and Arthur Trebelaine, the popular writer with the Hemingwayesque reputation (Herman Wouk? Mario Puzo? How about Irwin Shaw? Discuss.)When Kyle's latest escapade made him persona non grata in Manhatten, he accepts Richard's invitation to spend the summer with him at his house on Long Island. There, he finds himself rejuvinated enough to resume writing, but he's also plunged into Whitehurst's crippled family, consisting of his estranged and attractive younger wife, the drug-addicted wild daughter who blames daddy for everything bad that's happened to her (Elizabeth Wurzel! Just kidding.). Kyle also finds himself becoming the rope in a tug-of-war between Richard and Arthur, whose close friendship is unraveling rapidly under the stress of jealousy, envy, paranoia and fear.Don't expect to find sympathetic characters; the three writers are sometimes charming, but all monsters in different ways, and their self-absorption makes me want to hit them with a clue stick. But if you're interested in the tribulations and paranoias of the writing life, &quot;Lit Life&quot; offers a stress-free, sometimes amusing voyage, sort of like the &quot;Pirates of the Carribbean&quot; ride at Disneyland: see the old-fashioned agent dunking pickles into his coffee at a deli meeting with a writer; see the rapacioius publisher threatening to sue to get Kyle's advance back; see the combination of back-biting and brown-nosing that goes on at a PEN party. Some of the story lines don't make sense. Would &quot;The Paris Review&quot; really favor a profile of Trebelaine over Whitehurst? And what did Chevy Chase do to Wenzel that earned him an extended cameo as a buffoon during a charity softball game on the Hamptons that co-starred Martha Stuart, Billy Joel and coach John Grisham?Wenzel displays a wonderful skill at crafting satirical barbs and effortless prose, which writers know takes a lot of work to achieve. &quot;Lit Life&quot; is a slightly pre-chewed chunk of summer fiction that can be read and digested before the weekend's over."},{"Title":"Lit Life","review":"I'm no literary guru or genius, but I know what I like when I see it, and I like this book -- a lot.Without sounding as if I'm saying that the story is plain, this book is proof that sometimes the way a story is told is more important than the story itself. Sure, the tale of the two major writer-characters is interesting, but without Wenzel's extraordinary character development, it might not be satisfying enough; Wenzel's efforts in this regard left me feeling not only that I knew the characters very well, but also that I had summered with them in the Hamptons. And what colorful characters they are! You may not uncover the meaning of life, but you will have a good time -- and isn't that what it's all about?If you've ever even contemplated writing a novel, or if you have a love affair as many of us do with all things New York (City and Hamptons, that is), then this book will give you pleasure.Well done, Mr. Wenzel!"},{"Title":"Lit Life","review":"Lit Life is Kurt Wenzel first novel, and is centered on three characters: Kyle Clayton, whose first novel was a huge success, but has written nothing else for years; Richard Whitehurst, who is called America's most underrated writer, having failed to achieve success despite a lifetime of hard work and respectable reviews; and Whitehurst's wife Meryl, who after decades of marriage to Whitehurst sees their relationship dying as a result of the writer's failure to achieve the success he has dreamed of. Clayton and Whitehurst could not seem more different -- Clayton has spent the years since his first novel getting drunk and chasing women, while Whitehurst has shown an almost monkish dedication to his work, to the point that he is alienated from his wife and daughter. However, the differences between the two result in a relationship. Clayton has long admired Whitehurst's work, and Whitehurst admires Clayton's work and envies his fame. By the time the two meet, that fame has gone sour -- Clayton finds himself listed in an article in New York magazine as one of the 100 most obnoxious New Yorkers. Whitehurst persuades Clayton to spend the summer with him in the Hamptons, and this intrusion into Whitehurst's settled life has consequences that no one could have expected.This description of the plot makes the book sound like grim reading. It is not. Clayton's escapades at throughout the book, as he gets drunk, behaves (at times) badly, and ponders the possibility of agreeing to product placement in his next book are all very funny. The last idea is not as fanciful as it sounds; a noted British novelist agreed to such a deal (I don't know if Wenzel anticipated it or not). While Wenzel has some interesting things to say about the life of a writer, he does so in a way that has broad appeal -- this is not a navel-gazing book. And Wenzel is quick to see the humor in his other charactes as well. The book is best described as a satire.Wenzel is a highly skilled writer. He moves the vantage point of the novel from Clayton, to Whitehurst, and to Meryl to show how the characters view themselves and each other. This is an effective way to flesh a character out. And Wenzel handles his three main characters well -- none of them are stereotypes.The book moves smoothly from comedy to tragedy, with an very effective ending. I look forward to Wenzel's next book."},{"Title":"Lit Life","review":"then literature has a red-headed step child in Lit Life!

His characters allow him great lattitude in terms of plot but it is essentially their personas on which the novel is predicated. Comparisons are sure to follow (and curse) this budding author. Wolfe, McInerney, Ellis, even a less sophisticated Fitzgerald.

You wanted to appreciate Richard for always trying so hard and for sticking to his guns, but it was very easy to get frustrated with his inability to live in the real world. The rest of the characters were so complex that when they did something that you would immediately hate them for; they made you think twice and put yourself in their shoes.Mixing the glamour of wealth with modern day NY, Wenzel brings you into world the East Coast literary scene. It&#8217;s F.Scott Fitzgerald meets Candice Bushnell (in a good way). It&#8217;s just great easy to read writing. The kind of book you can read on the beach with distractions and then back at home in solitude.On it&#8217;s day of release Wenzel&#8217;s book gets a glowing review from the NY Times, looks like the critics like him, now will the public turn him a into a success?I hope so because I can&#8217;t wait to read his next novel."},{"Title":"Lit Life","review":"I enjoyed this book. I sat down this morning at 10a.m. and at 5pm, I finished the last page feeling that I'd got my money's worth on the purchase price. Given that I don't feel that way with every new book that I read, I'd say that alone affords it a couple of stars.Wenzel has done a good job of describing the writer's life, presented a cast of characters which stand on their own as interesting, a fun to read story that yes, mixes Cheever and Bret Easten Ellis/Jay McInerney in a fun to read story about publishing, New York, celebrity, dysfunctional families, and the pleasures of making a fool out of yourself at a party of stuffed-shirts.Not only do I recommend this book....I'd buy his next one."},{"Title":"Lit Life","review":"I love this book! It has two writers wrestling their literary demons in the Hamptons which makes it really fun and beautiful. The characters qualities are very likeable, in that if you look to heroes who don't sell out on their art or craft, they are true people to look up to. Especially in a time when everybody is so commercial. I'm a writer and it really inspired me. There are moments of dramatic highs that have you gasping and humor that has you howling. What reviews haven't mentioned is the incredible family drama that unfolds in very intense, sad and beautiful ways. One of the most literary yet readable novels I've ever read."},{"Title":"Lit Life","review":"I'll be up front: this book was not what I was hoping for. I'd read in the descriptions that it was about two writers at different points in their lives spending together. I naively thought that meant they would form some sort of bond and learn about WRITING and life from each other. That never really materialized. Instead, \\"Lit Life\\" is a \\"satire\\" that demonstrates all that is wrong with the publishing industry; it is a book more concerned with dishing dirt than building an effective, meaningful story. In a world where sleaze sells, \\"Lit Life\\" is there with all the sleaze a modern reader could ask for. Drugs, drinking, sex, affairs, and ultimately a suicide; this book is like a literary soap opera.\\"Lit Life\\"'s main conundrum is that either you can be a great artist with no recognition like Richard Whitehurst or popular, rich, and not talented like Richard's nemesis Arthur. These two spend a summer trying to bend young, troubled author Kyle Clayton to their point of view. There is no real middle ground if you believe \\"Lit Life\\"; you're either one or the other. You can't be a wealthy and talented writer, can you? Unfortunately I don't know enough famous writers to answer that question, but I don't believe that for a moment. As a writer hoping to get published someday, I CAN'T believe that.Overall, my problem with \\"Lit Life\\" is that Wenzel glosses over important moments of the story. For example, readers never even see Richard invite Kyle to stay with him. Nor do readers see much of Richard and Kyle together during the summer; everything that Kyle learns from Richard is told second-hand instead of actually witnessed by the reader. Take Wenzel's word for it, Kyle was really influenced by Richard. Wait, wasn't that the whole crux of the story? Wasn't that THE story? So maybe it's just me, but I think we might want to flesh that out a little more than a couple paragraphs here and there. No, instead let's talk about another party, that's really what this story is about--parties.Enough of my ranting. If you're in the publishing industry then I suggest you read this book; this \\"satire\\" will probably be right up your alley. Or if you want some light airplane reading and want to believe that all writers are either toiling futilely or selling their souls to Hollywood, then \\"Lit Life\\" has you covered. For those few who want a book more interested in developing a story than dishing gossip, move on to something else.Was this review helpful to you? Nope. Was it helpful to me? You betcha."},{"Title":"Lit Life","review":"After reading the glowing New York Times review of this book, I went to the local bookstore and picked this one up--and loved it! It's the perfect summer read for smart people in that it's literary but also a tad on the trashy side at times. This is a page turner that reads like the best kind of movie, one that you take seriously but you also gasp and laugh as the plot progresses. One scene between the older writer, Richard Whitehurst, and his daughter, Kerry, will have you gasping!"},{"Title":"The Broadview Book of Medieval Anecdotes","review":"This book contains anecdotes, from various, various sources, but all written during the medieval centuries. It is actually divided up into these centuries, but begins in the Dark Ages around 300-399AD. Some of these anecdotes are flawed, as a result of being something which today we might call almost personal attacks (especially those by &quot;Procopius&quot;). However, everything has been gathered together by a master editor who consistently lists the sources and the names (where known-and this is a remarkable feat), and presents material that is invariably entertaining. I mean this sincerely - it is a book that you may not be able to put down. And - due to its format - it is easy to pick up again and browse during any period of time available."},{"Title":"Race, Place, and the Law 1836-1948","review":"Strictly speaking, apartheid in its literal legal form in South Africa, had no counterpart in post-Civil War United States. Or did it? This is the disturbing question raised by Delaney. He studies the legal apparatus in various American states, from before the Civil War to 1948. The largely successful attempts by segregationists to codify segregation into statutes is a disturbing echo of what the South African apartheid government was to do between 1948 and 1994.The book shows struggles by different parties in the US, spanning decades, on how physical racial segregation in neighbourhoods was mostly achieved. While many books on Jim Crow have talked about other aspects, Delaney focuses on the court struggles, and brings alive the tensions of those times."},{"Title":"My Friend Jesus","review":"I was wanting a book that would explain the relationship between God and Jesus to my girls, ages 3 and 5. I have loved all of Ella Lindvall's other books (the Bible Illustrated for Little Children and the Read Aloud Bible Stories). So, I took a chance and ordered this out of print book.This book talks about Jesus and is mostly biblical, but there are a few points that I didn't fully agree with about who Jesus is. Specifically, I think it will confuse my girls about what God has done because it gives Jesus the credit for saying that He needed to be sent to earth and die on a cross for people's sins. I don't think that is what the Bible says. Parts of it are worth reading to my daughters, but I wouldn't recommend purchasing it. It isn't worth $4+ cost of the book. It is a nice little paperback book, but there are other books that I think are better at conveying who Jesus is to Preschoolers, like Everything a Child (Kid) needs to know about God by Kenneth Taylor."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"Because Jerry Sittser experienced unimaginable loss, and faced it head-on, he is able to express the true pain and subsequent redemption of spirit. No candy-coated sentiments here. Just the truth, which goes straight to the heart."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"After my sister died this was a source of real comfort. It gave me a language for my grief and an analogy that compared a broken bone that heals with time to an amputation that changes you forever - both of which were very helpful."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"Jerry Sittser's book \\" A Grace Disguised\\" lends a hand to anyone who has ever suffered a loss. I was struggling with the loss of my wife of 31 years from breast cancer and this book was recommended by my Pastor. The insight I was able to get from reading this book was wonderful. Whatever type of loss you may have encountered, Jerry does a wonderful job of trying to explain God's role in our lives. If your hurting from a loss, this book will lend a hand to your recovery. Thanks for sharing Jerry!"},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"This booked helped me a great deal. I have recently lost my Mother through cancer, I felt like we had gone on a journey together as I had been her sole carer. Although the author was dealing with catastrophic loss and I wasn't, I still felt desperate to have someone to help me through the grief, suddenly there was this gaping hole to fill. The book helped me gain insight to the process of grief and didn't make me feel so alone and helped me to look at things with a different perspective. I did not realise there was a religious content in the book, I am not religious but it gave me food for thought and let me explore the possibilities of faith. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"This book was quoted by my Pastor during a sermon of how bad things happen to good people. i am grieving the sudden, unexpected tragic death of my 27 year old daughter this past December. This book helped me sort thoughts and feelings from the perspective and experience of someone who has sufferred sudden, unexpected multiple losses, including a daughter. Highly recommended it to any one going not only for loss due to death but any loss. truly through God's Grace and his unconditional love regardless of how we feel about him during the ordeal is how the soul grows."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"I have purchased probably 20 copies of this book to give to everyone I know who is grieving the loss of a loved one. It is an amazing book - completely different from all other books on grief and positively the most helpful one I have ever read. It helped me to get through the most difficult experience of my life!"},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"I am going through a very difficult time in my life and was advised to read A Grace Disguised. This book offers an amazing insight into the grieving process and acknowledges that everyone's healing process is completely unique to them. I felt encouraged and rejuvenated knowing that I could relate to the many emotions experienced by the author and so many others who may also be going through similar scenarios but have had their emotions or actions repressed and even belittled. I strongly recommend everyone read this book because it not only offers personal growth during troublesome times, it also may help guide those who have a friend or loved one experiencing a difficult loss to offer stronger support."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"A Grace Disguised by Gerald Sittser is by far the best book I have ever read on loss and grief. After my husband died, I read every grief book I could get my hands on, and none touched the depths of my heart and soul like this one did. He is painfully transparent about the grief that he experienced after his tragic loss of his mother, wife, and daughter. Seeing how God brought him to a new day helps those of us who are walking this same road have the hope that our God will do the same for us. Don't hesitate to read it!"},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"This book is a gem, a true gift to the church.

A fantastic resource for counselors and pastors as well as any believer experiencing catastrophic loss."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"This is an excellent book to help a person through any kind of loss. Identifies what grief is and how to go through the process of the darkness. Mr. Sittser very honestly and candidly explains and describes the emotional ups and downs of grief. A very helpful source for people who are in pain."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"The author lost his mother, wife, and daughter in one car accident (he and his other children survived the accident). The book shares how he dealt with it from a Christian but very real perspective. No platitudes or \\"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger\\" nonsense. It was very helpful to me after my wife died."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"This book was very helpful for me and family members when we lost a loved one unexpectedly. Mr. Sitter expressed a lot of what we were feeling in a very understanding and real way."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"I have been struggling with depression brought about by grief. My therapist recommended this book. I got a lot out of it....until about 3/4 of the way through the book when it become all about his evangelical theology and how believing that Jesus is the Son of God and died for my sins is the way to healing.I say this as a Christian who attends church regularly, reads theology, and is actively engaged in understanding God and living my faith every day. If I weren't any of these things, I think this book would get dropped faster than a hot stone.I finally just started flipping past the pages that were all about his theology. I skipped one chapter completely. Skimmed my way to the end. It's a shame because the first half / 75% of the book was interesting and helpful. This worldview/theology helped him enormously but if you're not already walking in his world, it comes across as yet another evangelical Christian sales pitch (even though I know he is speaking from deep within his heart).I'm so sorry to have to say that but it's how I, a Christian, truly experienced this book.If that part won't be a roadblock to you, his reflections on grief are thought-provoking and useful. His insight that the \\"5 stages of death and dying\\" (and, by extension, grieving) should actually be thought of as \\"the 5 most common ways to avoid dealing with death and dying and grieving before you really get down to dealing with it\\" was spot-on in my experience and based on what I've heard a surprising number of people say."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"I found this book to be especially helpful in the area of dealing with significant loses.

This book is a required read for a graduate level counseling course titled Grief, Trauma and Loss."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"I really needed this book. It was soothing in a way that other grief books had not been. There are not three easy steps to loss and grieving, no quick fix. Mr Sittser talks about living with loss and that's what we all have to do after the passing of a loved one...is to live without them. He speaks out of his own tragic loss but doesn't make his loss to be any more significant that yours...Sittser acknowledges that everyone's loss can be tragic and devastating. I have given this book to many grieving friends. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"Just finished this book from a dear friend who sent it to me after we lost our baby girl two weeks ago. I so appreciate that the author is inclusive of all losses and talks of big themes like grace and providence which are big enough to offer comfort and peace in the face of catastrophic loss. His tone is one of such emotional honesty and clarity that I know he owns these observations in his soul, they weren't outlined as part of an intellectual thesis or how-to manual. This book is a treasure, I will likely reread it again when I'm further along my journey."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"I became very 'obsessed' with understanding the grieving process, God's intention and my own pain.

I found it soothing and helpful, even though I don't share the author's religion, which is something worth pointing out because usually when religion enters the equation I find myself being put off, but this author writes about his faith in a very personal way that is neither preachy nor aggressive. I recommend the book highly for anyone who is going through the despair and anger of loss. There is something here that will help you, surprise you and give you strength. I'm giving it five stars because I can't find one bad thing to say about this book."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"How can I say this....

Never have I read a book that tackles the heart of the issue of suffering and the heart of humanity harmoniously and with such eloquence as Sitter's. Sittser engages his audience by peeling away the layers of his thought and into the depths of the pain that he suffered when his mother, wife, and youngest daughter were killed instantly after a head-on collision with a drunk driver. It is plain to see that he has spent countless hours in agony, reasoning out his thoughts, struggling with his faith, and just in living an ordinary life after the accident. The reader is a helpless and captive audience as he describes how he dealt with spiritual issues such as faith in God's sovereignty and emotional issues such as the inability to forgive. Through it all, Sittser recognized that he can never get over the tragedy, but he can allow it to grow him through the choices he makes in response to it.Personally, by the grace of God, I have never had to experience the mental, emotional, and spiritual anguish of such a tragedy. But after reading this book, I know that I am better prepared to deal with any such occurrence in my life for the future. Sittser's writing made me admire the resiliency of the human spirit, and also appreciate the role of faith in overcoming devastating loss. Sittser was able to overcome his anguish largely because of his well-grounded faith in the promises of God, and his faith in the absolute standards of morality and justice of which God is the source. I can only hope to be able to handle catastrophic losses (which he points out are inevitable) with such grace and sound mind. At the very least, this book made me appreciate all that I have at this moment, especially my wife, my family, and all who I hold dear.Ministry ImpactMany people respond in different ways to grief, and therefore to any remedy for it. There is no cure-all to the grief that catastrophic losses bring. However, Sittser is able to present a unique, first-hand perspective that may benefit many believers and non-believers alike in facing their loss and finding God's love and grace behind it. No one is able to connect with a mourner as much as another mourner. For the benefit of those situations where \\"just being there\\" is not enough, this book may be a welcome aide. It can be a gentle guide for the inconsolable spirit. I would suggest that anybody in pastoral ministry or counseling should read this book at least twice and internalize his main points in each chapter. I am likely to make this book a required reading for any staff that I train in the future. As every life is marked with times of great joy and times of great grief, I believe that all pastors should be prepared to face these events with their flock, whether those events are good or bad, and point toward God's hidden grace."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"This book was both disturbing and encouraging at the same time. It was disturbing because I realized how short my own response to tragedy fell as I read Dr. Sittser's account. He stuggled mightily to understand whether his relationship with God could survive his personal tragedy. As he confronted the tough questions he did so honestly and not withholding his true questions and feelings. It was encouraging to see how the honesty of this theologian was used by God to bring healing and hope.I am just now working through some of those questions 26 years after my wife died in an accident in which I was the driver. I only wish I could have dealt with those same questions in the years immediately following my loss and not so many years later. This book would have made such a difference in my life.I highly recommend Dr. Sittser's book to anyone dealing with loss, whether recent or delayed such as mine. The chapter on the Sovereignty of God is perhaps the best treatment of that subject I have ever read.Dr. Sittser's book on \\"The Will of God as a Way of Life\\" is a great followup to this book, as it gives practical ways to move on and discover what God would have you do with the experience of loss."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"I discovered this book 10 years ago after the death of my older sister. I thought I stumbled across this book by accident at a bookstore, but I know now that it was no accident. I am reading this book for the third time and it will never be put away on a shelf. It has new meaning and insight each time I read it over again. This little book is a gift from God."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"If you have lost someone you love then this book can really help you understand and put your loss in perspective. The author lost three generations of his own family in one auto accident, his mother, wife and daughter. His Biblical wisdom and thoughtfulness has me going back to read and re-read often. One quote, in particular, I keep going back to and back to is, \\"I did not get over the loss of my loved ones: rather I absorbed the loss into my life, like soil receives decaying matter, until it became a part of who I am.\\" This book has helped me immensely in dealing with the lose of my husband. I have also shared the book with many others. Right now I am reading it with friend who lost both a newborn child and her mother both within a year. I truly think this book has helped to give me a peace about the loss of my loved one that I could not have had without this author's uncanny understanding and willingness to share his thoughts."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"...when I received the phone call. I had stayed home from church with a sore heel when I picked up my phone to see my best friend was calling. It wasn't her though, it was someone else--her mother, calling to tell me that their dear girl was taken from us in a horrible accident. I had to break the news to one of her best friends, my daughter. The grief had our whole county reeling.After the dust settled, the funeral and memorials done, the semester over, I had time at the bookstore to comb through all the books on grief. Of course I looked over Lewis and the other major Christian writers, but they weren't of much use to myself and my pain. Lewis--God bless him--lost a wife to cancer after she had a full life. Our girl was 11.Sittser knows grief. He knows sudden, horrible, irrevocable death; trauma, tragedy and loss. Loss with a capital L. He lost his wife, his four-year-old daughter and his mother before his eyes during a drunk driving accident. As a well-respected Fuller seminarian, he was encouraged by his friends to write down his observation and addressed the concept and effects of catastrophic loss a full three years after the accident.Now that I have said why this book was relative to me, let me tell you why it's relative to you and everyone you know: he makes one thing firm--loss is loss, and cannot be qualified as more or less. He does not feel that his loss was greater than anyone else's, for all loss is relative to the person who is doing the losing, whether that someone's a parent, a unemployed mom, or a father trying to cope with his children after divorce. He clearly states that losing a job, for instance, is a loss. Rape is a loss. Divorce is a loss. Death constitutes a loss. Loss is loss is loss. This book adroitly and honestly discusses them all, his experience with grief in really honest detail. I'd like to point out here that this particular edition is the tenth anniversary, as well, and he covers the lives of himself and his children in the intervening years and would be a better buy that the original for it's epilogue.And before you finish reading this, can I offer some advice? If you're shopping for a friend that has just lost someone, give them a considerable amount of time, and then give them this book. For goodness sakes, don't bring over a copy of 90 Minutes in Heaven, (my friends had two by the end of the second day) especially to a grieving parent. Although that is an especially good book about suffering, his life went on. Our girl's didn't."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"I read this book because I knew Jerry and his wife when he was the chaplain at Northwestern college in Iowa. Now I'm a pastor's wife and deal with grief and loss regularly and in many different ways in our church. This book, by far is the best I've read because Jerry allows us to enter into his struggle with God with honesty and boldness that is often avoided by Christians. And, in the end, his conclusions are not nice, neat packages with bows or pithy sentiments, but real theology based on who God is, not who I want God to be."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"This book was recommended to me by a member of the Taylor University (Upland, IN) community in the wake of the tragedy of Spring 2006 that drew national attention after a senseless highway crash left five members of the college community dead as well as a mistaken identity crisis concerning one of the victims and survivors. Plenty of grief there to go around. I actually read it shortly after my own good friend had died of cancer. The author has known grief in his own family, but rather than focus on just his own story, he tells us about God's faithfulness in grief--not just \\"what happened\\" but \\"how it happens.\\" He offers hope in the midst of unspeakable pain,a way though the dark. I immediately bought ten copies and have already given them away. I will be getting another batch."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"Sittser, Jerry A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows Through Loss Grand Rapids:Zondervan, 1995. (184 pages)A Grace Disguised may well be the best and most impacting book that I have ever read on the issue of suffering; if not the best, it is certainly equal to C.S. Lewis' A Grief Observed. In this book the author Gerald Sittser describes his own loss and immediately identifies with the reader on a personal level. He describes the loss of his wife, the loss of his mother and the loss of his daughter all of whom met their end in a tragic automobile accident with a drunk driver. From his own experience and out of his own pain, anger and suffering, Jerry Sitter details his own perspectives on the human experience of suffering.Without the slightest hint of \\"it will be alright\\" or \\"all things happen for a reason\\" Sittser discusses the way loss can help people to grow and heal through forgiveness (not forgetness) and through being honest about ones experience with themselves and with their God. While reminding the reader that everyone suffers he also acknowledges that everyone's suffering is completely unique. The book is easy to read, uplifting and sorrowful and a must read for everyone in ministry."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"When a beloved family member was sexually assaulted and murdered, my life was turned upside by grief and anger. It colored every aspect of my life. I felt as though I might go crazy. I wanted to understand how God could allow such suffering in my life. I read so many books because I wanted relief, I wanted answers, I wanted peace about what happened and how it could possibly make sense in my life. I read Grief Observed, and When Bad Things Happen to Good People, and No Time for Goodbys, but this was the first book that really helped me begin to resolve all the pain caused by the murder. This book was a life saver for me, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is struggling to make sense of suffering in their lives, especially grief."},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","review":"I read this book twice after the passing of two husbands. As a counselor, I am familiar with many books on grief & loss. This book is the best I have read. It helped me to put my loss into perspective and to remember some very positive word pictures that the author gives. I have recommended it to several people who have also found it to be helpful. I keep at least one copy in my own personal library at all times because I value the book so much. I hope the author keeps expanding it and publishing it."},{"Title":"The British Museum Cookbook: 4,000 Years of International Cuisine","review":"My edition was purchased in 1988 on visit to the British Museum and is one of the treasures of my cooking library. My degrees are in History so this cookbook was a natural, and I enjoy it both for the excellent recipes & for the daily-life feeling the author brings to the food of each culture (Ancient Persia, Classical Greece, Ancient Egypt, Imperial Rome, Anglo-Saxon Britain, Pre-Conquest America, Medieval Europe, Renaissance Italy, Georgian England, & Imperial China).It's easy to use, measurements are graciously listed in 3 systems: metric weight, avoirdupois weight, & standard US-English cups/teaspoons/etc. The ingredients are easy-to-find at the local market (I live in the Pacific Northwest of the USA), & the author provides a number of alternate choices for the recipes where practical (i.e., \\"Hare, Rabbit, Veal or Chicken Stew with Herbs & Barley\\"). I've fed my family from the book for years & the kids liked both the food & the idea of eating something that might have been eaten by kids 1,000 years ago. For home-schooling parents this might be a tasty teaching tool - it was great fun for us!If you're concerned about authenticity with New World ingredients in Old World recipes that's not an issue: I've found that such are sometimes offered but usually as an alternate or to make the recipe more appealing to modern palates. The author always identifies the disparity in the intro to the recipe, or the specific food is offered as an alternate ('onion skins OR coffee for color'). The Pre-Conquest America section relies on the work of Elizabeth Lambert Ortiz, probably the premiere English language cookbook author of the cuisines of Mexico both modern & ancient, and Berriedale-Johnson is very clear about the recipes she has developed & those where she relies on the work of other authors. Incorporating the work of others, with their blessing of course, is a great strength of the book: it would be difficult indeed to research & recreate recipes for all these cultures even though there are only 10-12 recipes for each culture.This book is a true gem, but not a total beginner's cookbook: the author assumes you know or can find instruction for things like roasting hazelnuts. However there are no difficult techniques in the cooking itself - no massive medieval feasts in this book fortunately, just good food that we commoners would have eaten!"},{"Title":"The British Museum Cookbook: 4,000 Years of International Cuisine","review":"As a lover of Ancient History, I love this little book. The recipes may not be completely authentic - but then again, I'm not sure we'd want to eat what Ancient Egyptian peasants and Aztec warriors ate back then - but they are pretty good guesses based on current cuisine, written records and ingredients available at the time. More importantly, though, they are pretty good recipes. So I'd highly recommend this book for anyone who wants a taste of the ancient world that they actually can enjoy."},{"Title":"The British Museum Cookbook: 4,000 Years of International Cuisine","review":"Inspired by the collections in the British Museum (you might have guessed that from the title), this book contains recipes \\"to recreate a flavour of what fashionable ancient Greek society in Athens, Anglo-Saxon peasants in their villages... or late medieval Frenchmen might have eaten.\\"Unfortunately, since there are no known original recipes from the Aztecs, for example, the author has neglected to give any source material. In the \\"Classical Greece\\" section tomatoes and potatoes are specifically excluded [good] but an \\"Ancient Egypt\\" recipe calls for coffee [very bad]. I wouldn't use this as a reliable source when so many better-documented books are out there."},{"Title":"Cotton Candy Quilts: Using Feedsacks, Vintage and Reproduction Fabrics","review":"I have really enjoyed reading this book. I found it very informative and enjoyable and plan to use several of the patterns. I have purchased an additional copy to be part of a table decoration that I am making for the annual fall meeting of the Utah Quilt Guild. I've purchased about 15 books in the last 6 months and have enjoyed this one the most. I think it will sell very well. Our Guild has over 1000 members, and hopefully the book will get exposure at the meeting from vendors that are there.

If you want to visit Fort Williams and Spean Bridge (which are about 20 miles apart), you have to look under the F's and under the S's (over 100 pages apart) to find information about these two towns, rather than being able to turn a page or two, as the Frommer's or Eyewitness guides permit. Not user friendly at all. An alphabetical listing of cities/towns can be presented in the index, where it is easily referenced. The body of a good travel book is organized by region.Needless to say, I didn't even bother to pack the book when I went on my trip."},{"Title":"Superman: At Earth's End","review":"Released in 1995 as an Elseworld's story, SUPERMAN: AT EARTH'S END follows Superman in the last days of his life. The year is 2102 and the Earth has been devastated by some unnamed disaster. The atmosphere of the Earth is so polluted that it takes Superman two full years living in Sky City to restore his powers. Apparently living in Sky City also turns people animal-like because Superman now has muscles the size of a tank and has long white hair including a beard. However, after a year in Sky City, Superman learns that the androids who are running things now intend to nuke Gotham City because most of the freaks and criminals of the world reside there. Superman attempts to stop them and flees to Gotham. He's attacked by giant bat creatures that look like his long-dead pal Bruce Wayne. He eventually discovers that Bruce's body has been stolen by scientists performing cruel biogenetic experiments on the regular folk still living in Gotham City. Supported by a group of children warriors and a massive gun, Superman sets out to stop the experiments and bring back the body of Bruce Wayne. Oh, and the bad guy is Hitler. Yes, the story really is that bad.I've been reading Superman comics for a long time and SUPERMAN: AT EARTH'S END is the worst Superman story ever written. Superman with a beard? Superman having to spend two years almost in space to regenerate his powers? And once recharged those powers only last for a fight and a half? Superman has to use a gun to defeat Hitler? I can't believe D.C. gave the okay for this project to be published, let alone written. Don't waste your time reading this piece of garbage. Just leave it at Earth's end."},{"Title":"Superman: At Earth's End","review":"This comic was obviously created, most likely in committee, to carry a strong anti-gun message. It doesn't matter if you a pro-gun or anti-gun, this story is awful. Without getting into too much detail the basic story for Superman is that the world is forever doomed by its use of weaponry. Really, that is it, it sidetracks a bit and gives a couple pointless fights but really, all it does is spend it's time saying that guns are bad. Kids running around with guns, guns have guns mounted on them, Superman uses a gun, and then uses a BIG gun.What most likely happened was that executives at DC Comics wanted to come out in support of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban and the Clinton administration's policies. That ban passed shortly before this comic was out. What we got was Superman trying to teach kids that guns are why people are evil, heck it was the result of Hitler and the Third Reich's influence! And no, I'm not kidding about that one, yes, they actually double-Godwinned gun owners in this comic. The storyline is so ridiculous I'm not even certain the writer had his heart in it which the constant continuity problems would suggest.Again, this comic was merely a political gimmick, and regardless of your views on the subject is a horrible read."},{"Title":"Superman: At Earth's End","review":"Yeah, I admit it. This is a horrible story. It is an absolute train wreck. Probably the worst characterization of Superman I've ever seen, along with the most ham-fisted delivery of a moral ever put into a comic book. Even so, I really liked it! Like a train wreck, you can't look away. It is so bizarre that it is actually a fascinating read. I mean, think about it. Where else are you going to find...?1. Superman with a beard looking like Santa Claus? Or maybe \\"Hobo with a Shotgun\\"?2. Superman punching a guy in the guts, while yelling. \\"I AM. A MAN!\\"3. Superman fighting twisted DNA clones of Batman?4. Superman fighting twin Adolph Hitler clones?5. Superman wearing a massive utility belt?6. Superman with pretty much no powers, forced to use the most awesomely impractical weapon ever conceived for a comic book? The Expunger. When Supes puts on the Expunger, you know that the stuff's about to GO DOWN. That was an awesomely hilarious moment! It made for a great read.So yeah, this book is really lame. But the artwork is great, and the story is quite enjoyable. It is an \\"Elseworlds\\" title after all, and boy is it ever! But that's the point of these, isn't it? To have a comic that is completely different from the usual thing? In that regard, \\"Superman: At Earth's End\\" scores off the charts! I honestly did like it.The only thing I didn't like about it that it is a little short. About the size of two normal comics put together. Oh well...Another reviewer condemned it's \\"Gun Control\\" message. That really didn't bother me at all. Gun control is a complicated, nuanced thing. Here, it's just \\"Guns are bad. The end.\\" To some extent, I do agree with that. So the message itself didn't bother me. Nothing about this story bothered me, actually. I just wish Superman had been SLIGHTLY more like Superman, in that I wish he had had more of his powers. (And where'd his cape go?) But in the end, the EXPUNGER ruled! So if he had to lose his powers to don that great weapon, the people of humanity are much the better for it.Thank you, Supes. Thank you for saving us all!"},{"Title":"Superman: At Earth's End","review":"I completly agree with the other man! this is one of the greatest superman comics! It should be read by everyone.

You'll be amazed that you haven't heard of these things before. Smith and Kiger have this way of rolling out odd little details in a dry way that really build a humorous picture without trying to be funny. My favorite story was about 10 cent beer night at the Cleveland Indians baseball game in 1974. They start by telling how Cleveland was suffering from an image problem because the river had recently caught fire and the Cleveland Mayor had ignited his hair with a blow torch at a ribbon cutting ceremony. You know the rest of the story will only get better. Buy it. Read it. Quote it."},{"Title":"Oops: 20 Life Lessons from the Fiascoes That Shaped America","review":"In a very entertaining and informative account of what the authors considers \\"fiascos\\", the book narrates various incidents, fads, and \\"strategic thinking\\" that were...well, not so successful. A range of 'stories' from religious movements founded on interesting sex mores, y2k bug, paper fashion, battle of towers in Boston, plans for assasination of Castro, Cleveland Indians' beer promotion, and Edison killing an elephant (!) are all part of this book. Some stories are so interesting, it is a surprise that they have been obscure so far. On that front, the author scores full points. It is a little disappointing that the authors were not able to locate any interesting pictures or photos of the events narrated. Instead they focus on a very amateurish-looking \\"ingridient list\\" for each of the 'fiasco' narrated in the chapter. The book is very neatly organized - each chapter focusing on a specific event/trend. Quite humorous writing style adds to the enjoyment of the book. A good read."},{"Title":"Oops: 20 Life Lessons from the Fiascoes That Shaped America","review":"This book is an entertaining and informative look of some of the major fiascoes of American popular history. I have witnessed or at least heard about the majority of the mistakes displayed here. For example, I remember seeing the John Hancock Tower partially covered in plywood on childhood trips to Boston (although the book doesn't mention this, I believe that the surviving panes of glass went to Building #19, a locally famous salvage/overstock store here in the Boston area, for sale for the uses described by the authors). The authors do a good job in filling out the facts behind the fiascoes (I didn't realize that I wasn't the only one who couldn't stand Clippy). As a previous reviewer stated, the one problem that I did have with the book is a lack of a photo section, as items such as paper dresses, the Dodge LaFemme, the rockin' Tacoma Narrows Bridge & Flying Cars need to be seen. I also didn't care too much for the \\"receipe\\" section that ended each chapter. Despite this, I do recommend this book to be added to your own Dynamic File of Trivia."},{"Title":"The Art of Winning","review":"This is a formulaic book with a great message. The writing style may drive you nuts, but the message about the commitment to performance is there. My favorite people are those who truly love something, especially something with measured performance, and Dennis Conner clearly loves winning yacht races. This book isn't about yacht races (there are other Dennis Conner books about that), it's about winning at whatever you do. I return often to this book for motivation and ideas on how to improve."},{"Title":"The Art of Winning","review":"think this is a book for two reasons. Many motivational or business books are about a guy that either started a big company because of a great product and statistically that is just a small number of business people (like a Bill Gates) or they are an executive that was a success in a larger organization (like Jack Welch) or they got a head start with a family business (like Sumner Redstone or Ted Turner). But here is a book about a small business operator. He is much closer to the average guy. He was running in fact a small business both inside and outside of competitive yachting.Secondly he covers all the basic fundamentals in motivation and planning. I will not review them again here - you can look at the index - but it is simply a great summary of things to do and attitudes that must be developed.This is a short but powerful book just 200 pages long and costing now only $5.00."},{"Title":"The Art of Winning","review":"Both the best of books. There is no one better."},{"Title":"Living Water for Those Who Thirst","review":"The MOST wonderful, applicable & easy to understand devotional I've ever had.

It literally covers EVERY subject & gives me almost as much peace as the Bible at times since my subject need is already there and summarized.

It addresses some of life's basic struggles as well as some praises, and it also references several appropriate Bible verses. I only wish it did not refer to the NLT as the preferred Bible of choice to use in conjunction with this booklet.

Mr. Weible both asks and answers his own question, &quot;What Would Love Do Now&quot;, inarguably the real question we should be asking in today's society. And if you love yourself enough to enjoy with abandon, then read, immerse yourself in these bright pages, grab a latte or tea or soda, turn on your favorite music, settle in your favorite room... read aloud, read silently, sigh here and there, and share the dreams and sights and sounds these words communicate.

While the story contains no real surprises, it still managed to surprise me in its rich and loving detail. She obviously knows and loves New York. I was held at arms length from most of her characters until Isaac and Dolly came into focus during the second half of the book, but the set-up was not an entirely frustrating ride. Her ability to balance satire with a love for her characters held up from start to finish, and that is the most impressive aspect from my experience of reading this novel"},{"Title":"When the Sons of Heaven Meet the Daughters of the Earth","review":"It is a grand thing to be beautiful, young and rich. That statement has nothing to do with Ms. Eberstadt's novel. That's her. I read this book after being misinformed that it reflected something in fiction of the facts around Jean-Michel Basquiat's life. Well, Isaac - Ms. Eberstadt's vaporous lead character in this novel - is nothing like Basquiat neither in his physical description (Isaac is a lumbering, blond, blue-eyed New Hampshire farm boy) nor in his art (as described in her novel, Isaac's paintings are as overworked as Ms. Eberstadt's fevered writing). This book is only worth reading if you don't have to work for a living."},{"Title":"When the Sons of Heaven Meet the Daughters of the Earth","review":"A captivating look at New York City and the characters that made it what it was during the art boom of the 1980's this book was enjoyable, insightful, and knowledgeable.

Fortunately, I waited until it ended up in the remainder bin, and only paid $7 for it. The characters are shallow and one-dimensional, and the writing is so overwrought and pretentious; I found it painful to read. Ms. Eberstadt has no understanding of what it is to be an artist. She writes from the viewpoint of a rich society girl. I couldn't get through the book; I stopped halfway through in disgust."},{"Title":"When the Sons of Heaven Meet the Daughters of the Earth","review":"This was one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. After the first few pages, I got out my red pen to mark all of the grammatical errors. Then, when that became such a burden, and my husband got tired of my elbow in his ribs and my screech, &quot;Listen to THIS!&quot; - I gave it up!I really wanted to package it and mail it right back to the author. It was a terribly disappointing holiday read and I felt cheated after having read the glowing reviews.I want my money back!"},{"Title":"When the Sons of Heaven Meet the Daughters of the Earth","review":"Fernanda Eberstadt has the democratic eye of a satirist (everyone is fair game), but in The Sons of Heaven Meet the Daughters of the Earth, she's also mainly large-hearted toward her many characters, even as she mocks them for their illusions and fits of pique. The novel's title is also a paraphrase of its story. The son of Heaven is Isaac Hooker, a Harvard wunderkind from small-town New Hampshire who metamorphoses into a visionary painter, a William Blake of the Hell's Kitchen district of Manhattan. And the daughter of the Earth is Dolly Gebler, a soulful New York patron of the arts. One of the hard-working rich, she comes from Old Money and keeps to a punishing schedule of good works (committee meetings in the mornings, gallery openings at night), all in the service of her conviction that art can change the world. But at home she lives uneasily with her husband Alfred, their three children, and an assortment of maids in a shabbily grand apartment overlooking the Hudson.Dolly gets testy with Isaac and begins to drop in at his loft with picnics. (The first hamper contains enough food to last him a week: a side of smoked salmon, a loaf of black bread, a wheel of Brie.) And when Isaac needs a live model--\\"a buxom one,\\" for the shepherdess in his paintings, the reader can't help but be struck by how well the stout but voluptuous Dolly fits the job description. But how can their love affair happen? They live in different worlds and come from almost different generations and they are bashful.Isaac is in the habit of walking to Central Park in order to draw oak and plane trees as they emerge \\"from the heavy grey shadow of dawn--like the way you see cows sometimes looming in a field in the morning dark--surprised, comfortable.\\" He's teaching himself to draw, \\"moving from scratchy, crabbed, overworked, to loose and fluid as a skater's glide.\\" When Dolly asks him if he's drawing from nature, he says he is, but that it's \\"nature, New York City-style. Rats posing as sheep and crack dealers as shepherdesses. I go to Central Park weekend mornings, up by the Ramble where it's wild.\\"Dolly tells him that Central Park is where she goes, too--for her early morning walks, and she is soon making a detour up to the Ramble to find Isaac scribbling under a tree, so cold that even his pencil's got \\"chilblains.\\" They go off to a cafe called The Nectar for pancakes and coffee. And so begins their doomed romance, more intriguing by far than the more hackneyed affair Alfred is conducting with a young painter who teaches art to women prisoners on Rikers Island. But then Dolly and Isaac are idealists, while Alfred is a realist who believes that a society must choose between freedom and equality, and that to subscribe to the French Revolution's ideal of \\"liberty, equality, fraternity\\" is as idiotic as saying that water should be, all at the same time, \\"hot, cold, lukewarm\\".The Geblers own a farm on Long Island (Goose Neck Farm), and Dolly instals Isaac in this rural idyll in early spring, before her family makes its summer trek to the country. As he commandeers the children's icy playroom, he feels he's in paradise, his solitude a \\"blessed conjunction of space, light, air, birds, trees. He doesn't even feel chilly; the physical exercise of painting--\\"the pugilistic pounce, thrust, dance of it\\"--keeps him warm all day.The best parts of this book are the descriptions of paintings and painting, of landscape, both urban and rural, and of the rural within the urban (the Ramble and the Sheep Meadow in Central Park). Eberstadt can also be wonderfully scathing about the silliness of much of the New York art scene and she does a brilliant spoof of contemporary art criticism when she describes Isaac reading a review of his first one-man show: \\"The primal encounter in Hooker's Old Testament narratives, with their smeared and saturated iconography of transgression and redemption is that of the post-exilic urbanite grappling toward a Hegelian metatextuality, objectifying the dialogic tension between exile and the possibility of eternal recall while the seductiveness of his notched, crotchety surfaces never altogether eliminates the underlying reminder that the radical manufacture of our \\"humanness\\" demands a certain decorative distancing--decor as decorum.\\" (\\"Man,\\"says Isaac's friend, Casey, \\"I think this Spicer wants to get his hot little paws on your seductively notched crotch, guy, and maybe even--how does he put it?--do a little fancy transgression. Hey, this is a rave review, Hooker.\\")When a novel of ideas is as lively as this novel is, it's easy to forgive it its flaws, the chief one being Eberstadt's tendency to alter the form of address for her characters. Within a single chapter (and sometimes even on a single page) Dolly is \\"Mrs. Gebler\\", \\"Dolly Gebler\\", and \\"Dolly\\". Alfred suffers a similar fate. Eberstadt also occasionally too exactly reproduces the hesitancies of daily speech. Apart from these minor glitches, the book is amiable, untidy, bright and vital, and since it is, after all, a satire, it quite naturally lacks the narrative power of a tragedy. Only Dolly has an aura of the tragic about her, since only Dolly has fallen utterly and needfully in love."},{"Title":"When the Sons of Heaven Meet the Daughters of the Earth","review":"Amazing how delicately Eberstadt poses her vapid insights and observations, passing them off as high art when it is so painfully obvious she and her prose are the products of the Upper East Side, wealth, and publishing connections. This is rarified, elitist, and thoroughly contemptuous. Awful in what it represents."},{"Title":"When the Sons of Heaven Meet the Daughters of the Earth","review":"To enter another person's world, to see things as they see them, to allow for different reactions to similar circumstances is to connect with people in a powerful way. Such empathy, compassion, and insight are essential for succeeding with the Genuine Selling system and to living a fulfilling life of Genuine Success. Listening to the stories of people in circumstances different from your own is entertaining exercise that develops this important skill. This is one of three novels (When the Sons of Heaven Meet the Daughters of the Earth, Spidertown, and Ellen Foster) that I recommend to my clients for their unusually intimate and immersive experiences of worlds most business people never encounter. The practice these novels offer with escaping our own narrow versions of reality can help us to be more receptive to the various worlds of the people we manage and sell to every day.Ms. Eberstadt continues the story of an extraordinarily talented and tormented young man, be! gun in Isaac and His Devils (out-of-print), with his impact on the New York art scene in When the Sons of Heaven Meet the Daughters of the Earth. The book introduces us to a wide cast of realistically drawn characters who intereact in a believable and compelling manner while moving in moneyed and stylish circles open to very few.I am pleased if a novel provides me with insight into one type of person. I am thrilled that When the Sons of Heaven Meet the Daughters of the Earth took me deeply into the heads of three people: Alfred, the man who married so much money he never learned what he might have made of himself; Dolly, the heiress who loved the art milieu more than she cared about art; and Isaac, the brilliant artist whose personality and creations forced their compromises to the breaking point.Woven through the plot and evocation of place is intelligent writing about how art looks to its creators and appreciators. I had always thought of art in verbal terms, but ! Ms. Eberstadt uses words to evoke the visual and emotional ! experience of creating a painting or sculpture. It is like nothing else I have read and gave me a whole new appreciation for the visual mediums, yet another new world for me."},{"Title":"Courage of the Early Morning","review":"The courage of the early morning is the story of Billy bishop, the allieds leading air ace of ww1 with 72 kills, only 8 short of the red baron.The book is written by his son as the result of a promise made to his father before he passed away. And its suprisingly unbiased.William Bishop tells the story of his fathers upbrining touching on everything that might have attibuted to his great performance during ww1, but not shying away from his faults. He did very poorly during military school almost being thrown out and also during flight training almost being sent back for a second run, until his first kill.It's a great account of a Canadian Ace and a great man, it flows from his childhood, on through the war, and countiuing after the war until his death. You don't come out just knowing the pilot but the man behind the pilot.The pilot accounts tell in detail how he attained his kills, players of ww1 and even ww2 sims would be wise to learn and emulate his skills outlined in these pages. They are already helping me in my sims. Remarkably he has similar tactics as Erich Hartmann. Even though decades seperate them they found the same tactics that brought them high scores and kept them alive to live on after their respective wars.The book also contains a list of victories including:Date, Time, Hight, Location, and aircraft.And also included is a index.The only thing I would like to see would have been some pictures. It does however include some small maps of the areas he was stationed at.A great detailed story of an unlikly hero from a country that didn't even an air force at the beginning of the war but went on to attain more then even he may have been comfortable with at times."},{"Title":"Courage of the Early Morning","review":"Excellent true story of one of the very top aces of WW1 who shot 5 planes on his last day at the front"},{"Title":"Courage of the Early Morning","review":"Great historical review of Billy Bishop, highly recommended to anyone wishing to learn more about aerial combat in WWI than just the REd Baron.

Even my private instructor, as highly rated and wonderful as he is, has not been not able to communicate as clearly and simply as Chris Batha (my hero!) many things I had questioned and/or found confusing. In addition, the book isn't simply theory with no solutions; very deliberate exercises and suggestions are given for building the solid foundation and muscle memory that shotgunning requires. His passion for the sport, combined with his gift for clear and entertaining explanation that results in \\"AHA!\\" moments for the reader, produces down-to earth comparisons with golf, tennis, and even whiskey drinking. (A \\"wee dram\\", indeed.) His guidance has already improved my shooting and understanding immeasurably. This is a book I will read and re-read many times.

Sorry."},{"Title":"Breaking Clays: Target Tactics, Tips & Techniques","review":"Chris Batha is a master gun-fitter and experienced competition shotgunner. This book is intended as an introduction to all the major shooting sports -- trap, skeet, and sporting clays -- and covers everything from selecting a gun to pulling the trigger. I found it a useful book for several reasons: it's logical and linear, ie. you get from A to B easily; it has great easy to read illustrations; it's evenly paced and doesn't get bogged down in any particular part of shooting clays. (I bought this book because I had read a couple of articles in magazines he writes for which I had liked -- which were about shotgun loads, chokes, and patterning -- and which were frankly almost too technical for me to pay attention to.) This book doesn't fall into this trap (no pun intended); the counter-argument is, though, that as a great introduction to the shotgunning sports, it also doesn't go deep enough into the areas that I personally would have liked more of. For example, how might I correct for chasing clays and end up missing behind? or, why isn't more choke at greater distance necessarily better? In short, an easy-to-read, well-diagramed introduction to trap, skeet, and sporting clays and 5-stars worth for the complete novice but 4-stars for the intermediate shooter."},{"Title":"Breaking Clays: Target Tactics, Tips & Techniques","review":"I shot a bit of trap and clay pigeons as a kid and wasn't very good at it.

So to start off 2010, I will give my reactions to the book which are also positive. I think this book makes for an excellent introduction to the shotgun sport of clay shooting in all its forms. I found it to be very complete since it touched on all aspects of clay shooting in a very perceptive and experienced way. I believe the thrust of the book was intended for beginners in clay shooting, but there is so much common sense here that even more experienced shooters would benefit from reading it. I especially liked some of the \\"tips and tricks\\" Batha gives to help shooters with the hard targets (for example see page 131 on where to stand at skeet's High house station). Another aspect of Chris Batha's writing which I found most useful is his willingness to give both the pros and cons of various shooting methods. (You will find this in Chapter 9 -- \\"The Basics of Straight Shooting,\\" my favorite chapter in the book. Chapter 8 on \\"Gun Fit\\" was also very well done.)Even though this book was published originally in the UK in 2005, I think its advice transcends national boundaries and can be easily read and understood by clay shooters in North America and elsewhere (to their benefit).In a way I am not surprised that Mr. Batha's book touches all the bases since he also has. Not only has Chris Batha been a successful competitive clays shooter for decades, but he is also an experienced shooting instructor, custom gunfitter, and contributes articles on shotguns and shooting for a variety of publications on both sides of the Atlantic. (Presently, Chris Batha is the sportings clays writer for the U.S. magazine THE SHOOTING SPORTSMAN -- his columns are always well worth reading.)Even though I am primarily a game/field shooter, I found BREAKING CLAYS to be a most helpful read. I think I will get more out of my clay target practice sessions due to Chris Batha, and that in turn will make me a better field shot.In short, the clay target tactics, tips, and techniques presented in BREAKING CLAYS are very well done and I sincerely recommend this book to all readers and shooters."},{"Title":"Breaking Clays: Target Tactics, Tips & Techniques","review":"I've been shooting for 4 years now after taking 15 years off.

There are three possible responses to the free riders (Y/X):(A) That the benefits be denied Y/X;(B) That the costs cease to be imposed on X; or(C) That the costs be imposed upon Y/X.Klosko argues that (C), which is political obligation as we usually think of it, is only viable if (A) and (B) cannot be accomplished. This is why he restricts himself to large and obvious public goods and refrains from discussing redistributive justice and other governmental functions.This doesn't free him from the \\"limiting argument,\\" which denies that (C) is justified, even if (A) and (B) are impossible. Many of the problems with the text come when he discusses reasons to not believe such arguments. In the case of Nozik's examples of the neighborhood intercom system and the street sweeping association, for example, he argues that they aren't viable because of their triviality. Thus, when we switch to enlistment and National Defense, because to stakes are much higher and the benefits are universal, the obligation is assumed to be clear.This brings about the other of the major problems with this book, which is that Klosko often compares the results of his analysis of the fairness principle to our prejudices about political obligation. Although most of the book doesn't really require it, it often seems as though he's trying to patch together a system that agrees with our intuitions about what the community or the government should and shouldn't be able to impose upon an individual.The best aspect of the book is when Klosko discusses the bases of his theory, that of consequentialism (esp. Act-Utilitarianism), and that of contractualism. He's quite fair in his analyses and devotes time to explaining where, exactly, each of the three have strengths and where they have weaknesses as a theory of political obligation. This is also true of when he describes the arguments of philosophers (Rawls, Locke, Nozik); his counter arguments are, however, often unconvincing. Both of the appendices (\\"Parfit's Moral Arithmetic and the Obligation to Obey the Law\\" & \\"The Principle of Fairness and Political Attitudes\\"), in a strange twist for any book, are both readable and useful.The prose is clear, and ideas are well presented. It is a very fine overview of the subject."},{"Title":"Death of an Evangelista","review":"One of those rare books that is a good mystery and a good novel. Not a 'cozy' but basically traditional.

The characters are interesting and charming. Texana's husband is a vet, so there are even interesting animal characters.

I'm really glad I made the investment.Normally, I'm not a big fan of planar travel, but this book changed my mind. Inside, you will find a large number of clearly and concisely explained concepts that make adding Planes and Planar travel into your game a snap.I've always found D&D;'s Great Wheel concept of the Planes confounding and overly complex. Portals and Plains ditches the wheel. Instead, it provides you with sample planes and ways to integrate them. There's even a handy table for creating random planes using die rolls.I was especially fond of the more sci-fi oriented concepts like wormholes that connect two places on the same plane together. There are also new spells that allow even low level casters to take advantage of limited planar travel. The new monsters and planar races are an added bonus that form a large part of the book.The first chapter of the book was the only weak part for me. The guides for how to best utilize the core classes when traveling through the planes is interesting, but the new Prestige Classes and feats just take up space. But then, I'm not a Prestige Class fan.All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase and recommend it to anyone who wants to integrate the Planes into their game."},{"Title":"Legends & Lairs: Portals & Planes (d20 Fantasy Roleplaying Supplement)","review":"If you purchase WoC's Manual of the Planes, then this book has alternative/redundant rules for many of the points covered.

It was worth the wait. Excellent. The story is captivating and the characters are memorable. The environmental issues cannot go unnoticed, nor can the allusions to Noah's Ark. Verne takes some shots at the fur industry of North America during the mid-1800s. He criticizes their endless and mindless killing of animals just for the purpose of making a buck. The story also demonstrates the will of man and the power of faith in God when facing seemingly insurmountable odds."},{"Title":"THE FUR COUNTRY or Seventy Degrees North Latitude","review":"Of all the far-flung places in and outside of this world none fascinated and inspired Jules Verne more than our arctic regions. In The Adventures of Captain Hatteras (see my review), The Purchase of the North Pole, and in The Glacial Sphinx, a sequel to Edgar Allan Poe's wonderfully sustained novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket, Verne showed a keen familiarity and fascination with arctic science and exploration that thrill readers to this day. Even in his masterpiece Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea he traps the Nautilus under an icecap during a breathtaking, no pun intended, episode. In The Fur Country Verne once again takes us to the frigid outskirts of the Canadian Arctic, as he did earlier in Captain Hatteras. And its subtitle, 70 Degrees North Latitude, is a mere hint of the bone chilling tale about to unfold. The title refers to the development of the pelt industry by the Hudson's Bay Fur Company, which set up posts throughout the Northwest Territories to trap polar bears, foxes, beavers, martens, ermines, muskrats, polecats, seals and walruses, and hares. But as most Verne enthusiasts will rightly deduce, it is not that simple; something ominous and spectacular is in the offing.A group of pioneers and soldiers is led by Lt. Jasper Hobson to establish a trading post in Cape Bathurst overlooking the Arctic Ocean. Among the members of the expedition are two guests: a courageous and strong willed woman, a rarity in Verne fiction, named Paulina Barnett, and an astronomer named Thomas Black who comes along to observe a solar eclipse. However, the fort they construct is not on solid ground but part of an enormous iceberg that an earthquake dislodges from the mainland and sends it drifting westward. Will the 140 square mile island of ice and soil continue floating towards the Bering Strait and south to the warmer waters of the Pacific, break apart, dissolve and plunge the castaways into the deep? Or will they escape the disaster by constructing a ship that can sail them to the safety of terra firma?The idea of an ocean voyage via a massive vessel was something Verne had earlier explored in The Floating City, and later on in his fascinating satire The Floating Island. Both are noteworthy tomes, but The Fur Country stands apart as a highly suspenseful adventure with a rousing climax impossible to forget.

If I handed in a paper like this for my grad classes I would have been docked quite a bit!"},{"Title":"Paul:An Outline of his Theology","review":"Eschewing the Hegelian Paul of the Tubingen School, the liberal Paul of the pneumatic school, the mystical Paul of the 'history of religions' school, and the existentialist Paul proposed by Bultmann, Herman Ridderbos sought to secure the complex Pauline theology that had run afoul of higher-criticism. Ridderbos critiqued the divergence from the biblical Paul by showing that the revelation of the once-hidden mystery of Christ had for Paul a completely different sense.One of the greatest ongoing challenges to the historic faith is the conception of baptism promulgated by Anabaptism (those whom Luther called 'Schw&auml;rmerei' or Enthusiasts). The corporate dimensions of salvation that affect the ekklesia or 'assembly of God' are often overlooked in favor of the individual's conversion experience, whereby the soteriology of Paul suffers from a lack of objectivity in its ecclesiological dimension. 'We have already determined that with this old and new man one is not to think in the first place of the conversion of individual believers, but of the common mode of existence of 'the many' in Adam and in Christ respectively.' p 401Ridderbos firstly began with the elimination of the relevant non-Pauline texts which refer to Spirit baptism and may have a bearing on the polemic. An unhealthy preoccupation with 'the anointing' is rejected as he placed the undivided intent of those texts on the gift at regeneration, and definitely not a separate or second blessing: 'To our mind one will with the 'anointing' have to think directly of the gift of the Holy Spirit (Luke 4:18; Acts 10:38; 1 John 2:20, 27).' p 400 Furthermore, Ridderbos denied the prospect of regenerational baptism in stating that the proper perspective of baptism 'does not denote conversion.' p 404 A homiletical error that is often heard at baptismal events is the analogy that the baptized is himself/herself undergoing a symbolic burial and resurrection. Ridderbos rebuked this fanciful reading of Scripture: 'The death, burial and resurrection of which there is mention here are undoubtedly the death, burial and resurrection of Christ; to be buried with Him in baptism consequently means to participate by baptism in that death and that grave.' p 403Ridderbos certainly did not share the convictions as reflected in the content of modern commentators regarding baptism, and motivated his point even further with well-founded biblical exegesis: 'For this reason the expression 'to be baptized into Christ' (Rom 6:3 and Gal 3:27) cannot be simply interpreted as an abbreviation of the formula, 'to be baptized in the name of Christ', as is often assumed. Rather, this compressed expression has a more pregnant significance, in that it is the denotation of the union of the one baptized with Christ in this corporate sense, and thus with His death, burial and resurrection.' p 403'...because we have concluded this: that One has died for all, therefore all have died' 2 Cor 5:14'...so in Christ shall all be made alive' 1 Cor 15:22Augustine insisted: 'Therefore, just as that one man was predestined to be our head, so we being many, are predestined to be His members.'A Treatise On The Predestination Of The Saints, c.15; idem,On The Gift of Perseverancec.14 In a faithful exegesis of the Rom 6 and Col 2 references to baptism, Herman Ridderbos soberly assessed the issue at stake when stating that the preference for the Anabaptist position contains 'within it the danger of diverting attention from the specific significance Paul here ascribes to baptism'. p 403 For Paul the significance lies entirely in the new creation brought about by the redemptive-historical death and resurrection of Christ, which is entirely appropriated to the believer in his participation through baptism: 'For the old man, too, has once been crucified with Christ (Rom 6:6) and the laying aside of the old man in baptism signifies above all, therefore, participation in that unique event.' p 404 and 'To be baptized means also to participate in an actual sense in what once took place in Christ.' p 405Calvin exhorted us to see the greater truth in baptism as expressed by Paul in Romans 6:3-4: 'By these words, he not only exhorts us to imitation of Christ...but he traces the matter much higher, that Christ by baptism has made us partakers of His death, engrafting us into it.'Institutes4:15:5 Robert Reymond inserts an even broader pericope: 'When such passages as Rom 6:3-6, 1 Cor 12:13, Gal 3:27-28, and Col 2:11-12 are taken into account, it becomes plain that the nature of the relationship is one of union with Christ, more particularly, union with Christ in His crucifixion, death, burial, and resurrection - not just union with Him in the last two.'A New Systematic Theology Of The Christian Faithp 925Demonstrating our union with Christ as our corporate Head and Archegos, Ridderbos continued to amaze with an invaluable study of the Israelite fathers who 'were baptized into Moses' from 1 Cor 10, illustrating Paul's use of typology for incorporation into Christ comprehensively.'Christ has brought it to pass, that those that the Father has given Him should be brought into the household of God; that He, and His Father, and His people, should be, as it were, one society, one family; that the church should be, as it were, admitted into the society of the blessed Trinity.'

Few thoughts, musings, or nuances of expression go unrecorded. &quot;The Highwaymen&quot; continues in that tradition. Auletta aims to offer some sense of the men (and they're almost all male) who make the decisions about what the rest of us will be seeing, listening to and seeking for entertainment and how that software will be delivered. He delivers well-wrought profiles of these people through their deeds--which often contrast with their words, and that tension is illuminating. Finally, at the end of each piece are postscripts which offer the reader a scorecard; which of the fearless mogul's bold predictions came true, which crashed a burned: everybody thought interactive/VOD TV was going to take off--so far, it's been a stalled cash-disposal scheme that sucks in capital with no discernable result. The point is that for all their visionary claims, these people are no better at predicting the future than anybody else.

The book chronicles some of the most fascinating media personalities from Rupert Murdoch to Herb Allen to Barry Diller to John Malone to Edgar Bronfman Jr. to Bill Gates. This is a fascinating book by a guy who was given incredible access by a large number of media executives. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Highwaymen: Warriors of the Information Superhighway","review":"The highway being described in this book is the information superhighway and the people being discussed are its developers. Jumping to the postscript at the very end, Auletta observes &quot;while the Highwaymen enjoy immense power, they remain vulnerable&quot; (p. 355). This is the paradox presented throughout the book. The regulators, entrepreneurs, and public do a dance of vulnerability in the development of the new technologies as niches are being carved out. One of the realities of corporate growth is that as they become large, they sometimes lose the freshness associated with risk and creativity. Auletta says &quot;it becomes more difficult for them to maintain a focus, to make quick decisions, to stay creative&quot; (p. 134).The ancient concept of pathos is explored in 21st century corporate America. In describing how business decisions are made in Sumner Redstone's organizational culture, he quotes an associate as saying &quot;most deals are fifty percent emotion and fifty percent ecnomics&quot; (p. 61).Aulette spends a little time on media content, pointing out the hypocrisy of film producer Oliver Stone, who sees his distortions (to be even more accurate fabrications) as &quot;artistic freedom, while he demands strict accuracy from reporters covering him.The reader is left with numerous insights that would not be attained anywhere else. This book is a worthy read."},{"Title":"The Highwaymen: Warriors of the Information Superhighway","review":"This book made up of 17 New Yorker articles by Ken Auletta written during the 1990s chronicle the major power players in the media business. I enjoyed reading most of the articles especially the ones involving, Time Warner, Viacom, Disney and News Corp and the media moguls behind them. Auletta focuses in many of the ariticles about \\"The Human Factor\\" determining the decisions made at the highest levels. Quite often this factor trumps business factors such as increased revenue and profits. The perfect examples are the firing/resignation of Jeffrey Katzenberg at Disney and Frank Biondi at Viacom. Both made large contributions to their respective companies but in the end their personal relationship with their boss made the difference. Michael Eisner at Disney and Sumner Redstone at Viacom seemed to feel their personal power at risk and therefore decided to go forward without Katzenberg and Biondi. I enjoyed reading them as most of them are very well written and uses the narrative style that most business writing unfortunately does not use enough."},{"Title":"Kurt Hahn's Schools and Legacy","review":"Martin Flavin's account of the life and impact of German educator Kurt Hahn is a good place to start for anyone interested in the roots of the Outward Bound movement. Hahn's intuitive notion about the need to ignite the interests and abilities of the young within the context of challenge has had a dramatic effect on individuals worldwide, as well as progressive pedagogy. For those who have had an Outward Bound-esque experience, this book can serve as a historical tool for uncovering the roots of their experience. For educators interested in exploring the wilds of experiential education, Kurt Hahn's Schools and Legacy offers a concise map through the global reaches of Hahn's impact. Although I found this book extremely helpful, I settled on three stars for two reasons: poor editing (typos abound!), and the sense that much of the historical material was borrowed from Joshua Miner's Outward Bound USA (a five star find for Outward Bounders and educators alike...if you can get a hold of this out-of-print gem). All in all, if you are having trouble finding literature on Kurt Hahn, this book provides a solid headstart.

I then picked up &lt;u>The Pentagon's New Map.&lt;/u> I've lent out both the DVD of the presentation and the book several times. I believe it's a must read for anyone who wants to fully understand just what the heck is going on in the post-9/11 world.&lt;u>Blueprint for Action&lt;/u> is the follow-up to PNM and in many ways is a response to feedback that the presentation and book inspired. If PNM was the answer to \\"what the heck is going on\\" then BFA is the answer to \\"why the heck are we doing this anyway?\\" But most impressively, the \\"why\\" Barnett gives us is not some doom and gloom of what needs to be avoided, but what glory can be achieved.Barnett is joy to read as a writer, especially since many of his contemporaries like to bog down their works with a lot of jargon and 50-cent words that can alienate the average reader. Barnett needs no such tricks to make his work impressive. Audacious and bold by its very nature, BFA not only gives the big picture view of \\"where do we go from here?\\" but delights readers with glib analogies and (often biting) humor along the way:\\"I ended up lecturing at both Beijing University and the China Reform Forum, the think tank of the Central Party School in Beijing...One Chinese professor went so far as to say that since my work could never be received well in America but would naturally be understood in China, I should quit my job... to engage in the formulation of grand strategy for the Chinese, who, he noted, had more than enough grand strategic issues to deal with right now!...My reply to this intriguing offer was to say that if these reformers felt they had their hands full explaining the Theory of Peacefully Rising China to the world, imagine how busy I was trying to explain my Theory of Benevolently Warring America!\\" (pp 138-140) What I think I like best about Barnett's work, however, is that his grand strategy has practical application. He doesn't get stuck or lost describing only one part of the elephant. He truly sees the whole animal of political, economic, military, cultural connections across the globe and, with accuracy, can say \`if you do this action, you'll get this result.'He isn't seeing situations just from the American side, or the military side, or the Wall Street side. He puts the reader in the other guy's shoes (well, if you were being approached like this, wouldn't you react the same way too?) and draws on our own history to show just how those situations played out last time. Barnett not only gives us \\"A Future Worth Creating,\\" but shows us that he knows how to navigate from here and now to there and then.If you want a useful, realistic hope for the future, this is the book to read."},{"Title":"Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating","review":"It is rare that I read something truly original in the realm of foreign policy. Every two months, I get a new Foreign Affairs, where the lefty academics will come out of their ivory towers to tell us the world is America's fault, the right will tell us that we're the biggest nation on earth we should take avantage of it, while others tell us in 20/20 hindsight what we should have done.Thomas Barnett's first book was truly original, and pure genius.This book puports to be a blueprint for how to implement the things discussed in the first book. While I found myself disagreeing, it still forced me to thing about our foreign policy in new and interesting ways.Like what if China was a trust ally?Anyways, I reccommend the book for anyone interested in our foreign policy in this post-Cold-War,post 9/11 era.[...]"},{"Title":"Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating","review":"(Something tells me the reviewer from Publishers Weekly didn't even read this book and instead just penned the review based upon some crib notes).I won't debate any of Barnett's specific arguments as other reviwers have done.He makes very understanadable that in the past generation the world has become majority with free market societies. This represents an incredible challenge to reactionary forces in the Middle East. How to help the modernizing elements of Arab, Persian, Asian and LAtin American socieities navigate their way into the global community is the key question in Barnett's arguments. This is called 'Shrinking The Gap'.Rather than being a US led enterprise, Barnett makes if very clear this will be a cooperative efffort among the UN, the G-20 (20 largest economies), the ICC and the American military. The UN as your grand jury, the US military as your police force, the ICC as your criminal court witht the G-20 as your financier. A very intriguing possibility and one that should be discussed.Once you dispose of bad actors (Kim Il Jong , Chavez, Castro) you have to follow up with intense development and reconstruction. Barnett notes that our failure to do this in Iraq is the chief source of our troubles today. The ultimate idea is to bring failed states quickly into connection with the global community so they can reap the benefits of globalization. If one can revamp and stablize a failed state, then foreign investment will flow into new lost-cost labor centers.Overall, a very well thought out and provocative book. Barnett lays out his arguments logically and makes it easy to follow his train of thought.A major drawback of the book is Barnett's constant use of his own jargon (one sees this in his blog also). One gets the sense he is very much in love with his own words. This is why I only give it four stars."},{"Title":"Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating","review":"After reading the reviews of The Pentagon's New Map (although I have not read the book itself), I was anxious to read Barnett's second book for implementing the ideas from his first book, especially now that they have been tested and revised by countless interviews, reviews and military briefings. Barnett does not disappoint. Blueprint For Action is the most original, outside-the-box, out-on-a-limb position I have heard in a very long time. Whether you think his ideas will work or not, I highly recommend reading it because it suggests new ways of thinking about politics, war and our friends and enemies. It's refreshing to see someone, as noted by another reviewer, who doesn't spout Democratic or Republican dogma, but goes off on his own. Personally, I think it makes a lot of sense, in most areas, and we'd be a lot better off if our leaders adopted these strategies (which it sounds like they may be starting to).Some reviewers seem to get hung up on some facet of his book: \\"One part of his 400+ page book might be wrong\\" (gasp!), but if you are going to develop a blueprint for American strategy for the next few decades, who is not going to be wrong on some points? Another criticism I've read of Barnett is that he paints a rosy picture of how the world a priori is going to get better. He doesn't. He repeatedly hedges his vision, stating that there are many opportunities for derailment. (Otherwise, you wouldn't really need his book to help avoid them.)After seeing our country blunder into many nation-building exercises since the end of the Cold War, with or without a antecedent war, it's not a question of whether we want to or will get involved with future nation-building, it seems to be a matter of how we do it. Better to have a plan, a system, like Barnett uses or someone else with long-term vision, rather than a half-hazard, poorly thought out one that both Clinton and George W. have used in Yugoslavia, N. Korea, Iraq, etc.A must read for anyone interested in where our country should be going in the next decade."},{"Title":"Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating","review":"A few months ago, I offered a review of Barnett's landmark book, \\"The Pentagon's New Map.\\"http://whiterhinoreport.blogspot.com/2006/03/understanding-age-of-terror-review-of.htmlIn his latest offering, Barnett takes the logical next step in offering scenarios and a roadmap for how we might go about fashioning what he calls \\"a future worth creating.\\" What I like best about Barnett's writing is the fact that he communicates complex ideas clearly and succinctly - without \\"dumbing down\\" his arguments and chain of reasoning.I found this book fascinating and very encouraging in terms of how the U.S. as a nation can lead the way in fashioning a 21st century world that shrinks the gap between the \\"haves and have nots\\" - and more to the point - between the \\"connected and the disconnected.\\"Given the fact that I do not have a military background, I do not always trust or rely on my own judgment in assessing issues of military or global strategy. Fortunately, I have a number of friends who have had long and distinguished military careers, and I often use them as sounding boards to provide me with reality checks. As I was finishing up reading, \\"Blueprint for Action,\\" I had breakfast with Stan Genega, a West Point graduate who retired as a Major General in the U.S. Army. As I was seeking Stan's reaction to some of Barnett's groundbreaking and often iconoclastic ideas, I said: \\"From my vantage point as a lay person, I can find no flaw in Barnett's reasoning, logic, interpretation of the facts or prescriptive recommendations.\\" Gen. Genega responded, in essence, by saying: \\"I agree; I cannot find any flaws in his logic or analysis.\\"Halfway through this book, I discovered a passage that clearly expresses Barnett's rationale for writing this book, and explains the bridge between \\"The Pentagon's New Map,\\" and this sequel. The context of the following quotation is that Barnett is describing the overwhelming response he received when C-Span broadcast a PowerPoint briefing that is the essence of \\"The Pentagon's New Map\\":\\"At first, you are kind of embarrassed with gratitude expressed on that level. I mean, you feel as though you found someone's wallet and nothing more. But over time, as I got more familiar with the emotions being expressed, I began to realize why it was so crucial to move beyond the first book's broad diagnostic approach to this volume's far greater focus on prescriptions - a plan of action. Eventually, that buzz wears off . . . Well, you can't just leave people hanging like that. You just can't get them all jacked up with no place to go. When people say they're a \`convert' or \`sold,' you'd better have a better comeback than just \`That's nice to hear.' Moreover, your vision of the future can't just be some splendid description of a world they've got little hope of actually visiting. No, it needs to seem familiar enough that they can imagine themselves not just living there but also actually making the journey. The tale should be heroic, all right, because that imparts meaning to sacrifice, but it can't be fantastic, meaning no \`flying cars' or any other imagined technologies that save the day all on their own. People don't want their future handed to them on a silver platter; they want to build it on their own. What they need from you, the futurist, is just enough information - just enough vision - to give them the confidence to start hammering some stakes into the ground. They want to get rolling, because in the end, they're not interested in following you. They just want you to point the direction and then get out of the way.\\" (Page 204)The timing of my sharing this review is interesting. Just this morning, my friend, Tony Lorizio, sent me a link to a column in last Sunday's New York Daily News. The column was entitled: \\"It's WWIII, and U.S. is out of ideas\\"New York Daily News - http://www.nydailynews.comSunday, July 9th, 2006The author of the piece, who may have been Chicken Little, cites a string of recent events and concludes pessimistically that World War III is upon us, and we are fresh out of ideas to know how to begin to win the war.In stark contradistinction to this gloomy forecast - one that seems to be shared by many \\"average citizens\\" - Barnett offers a more informed and reasoned interpretation and analysis of current events and trends. And that is the genius and the hope of his \\"Blueprint for Action.\\"\\"al Qaeda, far from enjoying a winning streak, has instead sustained its movement largely by accepting defeat time and time again and shifting its center of gravity to some new locale . . . But the larger point is this: al Qaeda and the Salafi jihadist movement have won no battles over the years. Instead, they have lived as parasites within ongoing civil wars or easily corrupted failed states. Their history has been one long series of evacuations under duress. Like cockroaches in an apartment building, they are forced to flee to the next unit over every time the exterminator steps in to spray the current nesting place.\\" (Page 119)The gist of Barnett's thesis is that in the ongoing struggle to shrink the chasm that exists between the connected \\"Core\\" countries of the world and the disconnected \\"Gap\\" countries, the U.S. military and its allies must develop a two-part approach to solving problems. The warfare end will be conducted by what Barnett terms \\"the Leviathan\\" - the traditional might of the U.S. war machine. But when it comes to \\"wining the peace\\" - the kind of nation building that is proving to be such a bloody challenge in Iraq - a new kind of force, a System Administration force, must be stood up and take over when the Leviathan has accomplished its work.Barnett also argues convincingly that part of the process of moving a society into a globally connected condition involves a migration of much of its population from rural isolation to urban connectivity.\\"Terrorists have historically arisen from well-educated middle-class urban segments of society, not form the backward, disconnected rural segments, even as they often enlisted as the foot soldiers of these revolutionary movements. So it is managing that individual journey from the country to the city that lies at the heart of the Core's historic task of shrinking the Gap. If the Gap's populations cannot successfully make that trip, finding genuine economic and social connectivity, then there is little hope of making globalization truly global, for all that will happen with this migration is the concentration of disgruntled masses - the perfect source material for unrest, as noted by revolutionaries throughout history.\\" (Page 279)Barnett gives a reasonable and generationally based spin to his optimistic argument that the Echo Boomer generation - those born between 1980 and 1995 - represent a great source of hope:\\"Natural multitaskers because they grew up in conditions of universal connectivity (the oldest came of age as the Internet blossomed into a global phenomenon), the Echo Boomers are, in the words of one demographic study, \`totally plugged-in citizens of a worldwide community.' As such, they know multiculturalism not as something to be accepted, but as simply a fact of life, since over a third of this generation is nonwhite. Probably the least \`churched' generation in U.S. history, they are nonetheless deeply interested in making the world a better place. As historian Neil Howe describes Echo Boomers, they are far closer in outlook to the \`greatest generation' from World War II than their egocentric Baby Boomer parents. In short, they're \`more interested in building things up than tearing them down.'\\" (Pages 322-323)For this reason, Barnett is targeting his arguments at the emerging generation of military and political leaders who are Echo Boomers. The current generation of leadership, with rare exception, is too tied into the status quo, too committed to protecting their fiefdoms and too entrenched in the \\"military-industrial complex\\" to be able to listen with objective ears to the ideas being put forward by Barnett and his coreligionists who worship at the altar of \\"a future worth creating.\\"This book is a must read. You may not agree with all of Barnett's analysis and interpretation of history and current events, but to choose to ignore what he is saying would be a \\"sin of omission\\" that no thinking person should commit.Al"},{"Title":"Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating","review":"I tried to go into this book with an open mind, but I came out thinking that Barnett simply doesn't understand the world or its problems. He is like the armchair quarterback who thinks he can win the super bowl even though he never really played or understood the game.Barnett suggests, for example, a policy of total appeasment of China. All US strategic interests in the region are to be surrendered so the US can focus on fighting more wars like Iraq. Taiwan is to be sold out and given to China to make them \\"happy\\". Even thought China is a communist dictatorship, Barnett sees it as the great friend and partner of the united states. All the US needs to do is to stop opposing China's legitmate interest....and sell out every friend we have in East Asia...and we can fight more wars like Iraq to bring civilization to third-world garbage pits. Like certain people in the government, Barnett is willing to destroy the entire global strategic position of the united states to bring \\"democracy\\" to places like Iraq.In the case of Iran, its even worse. The solution to all of our problems with the leadership in Iran will apparently be solved if they love Israel more. So we should launch a diplomatic initiative to beg Iran to love Israel more for which America will surrender to all Iran's regional objectives including nuclear weapons and domination of the Persian Gulf. As with China, what he is promoting is a policy of appeasement so the US can apparently have more resources to fight more iraq-like wars.So what does America get in exchange for appeasing its strategic rivals in the world? Barnett wants the US go to war to oppose \\"socialism\\" in Venezuala and wherever else it appears. Somehow in Barnett's mind, China is not a threat or a rival to the US, neither is a nuclear armed Iran....but a third-rate nobody like Venezuala is a mortal threat to America that requires armed intervention, the overthrow of the government and thousands of Americans to teach them how to be free. Barnett is also in favor of \\"women's rights\\" in muslim as a cynical mechanism to be used to justify political intervention in muslim countries. Its not that Barnett cares about women. Their rights matter far less to him than using their rights as a means of forcing American-style secularization into the middle east. I might have called it original but for the fact that many neo-cons who have utter contempt for feminism have been promoting similar ideas for years.As in the pentagon's new map - his previous book - Barnett wants to see America as the New Jerusalem leading the world. The only thing wrong with America in his thinking is that we need to be more up front in taking over and civilizing every messed up basket case of a country in the world. The costs or the implications of what he is proposing don't bother him in the least. He doesn't, for example, think about where all these Americans are going to come from who are going to move to places like Somalia to bring civilization. Or how big a military is going to be required to protect all those people doing civil affairs work. Implicit in his strategy of appeasement I guess is that the US will dismantle its \\"useless\\" high-tech army are redeploy most of the people/money associated with it. Tanks, Carriers and Jet Fighters will no longer be necessary once we surrender all our friends in Asia to China. Barnett never goes that far, but I get the impression he wants to. In the end he is unwilling to even recognize the price tag of what he is proposing.My largest disagreement with Barnett is over the nature of America and what the mission of the American military is. To Barnett, America is a country whose destiny is to lead and save the world. The American military's mission is nothing less than to save the world from itself. To me, America is my country and the first task of Americans is to improve our country. The role of our military is not to solve the world's problems, but to defend the country against threats. A dictator in South America or Africa is not necessarly a threat to America. If a country harbours terrorists, thats a threat. If a country in South America nationalizes its telephone system, thats not a threat to anyone except the country itself.I think the book fails because of its appeasment of real strategic threats to America (China, Iran), its failure to make a case for why its in America's interests to fight all these wars and its failure to examine in a serious way how his \\"blueprint\\" is to be made real. Higher Taxes? Higher Deficits? A draft? Gutting the current military? Anyone can play Napoleon and come up with all sorts of grand strategy. The difference between playing and having a real strategy is in presenting a plan for how you realistically make it happen. Barnett fails to do so.I would suggest his other book \\"the pentagon's new map\\" over this one."},{"Title":"Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating","review":"Two things are evident after reading Blueprint for Action: one, Barnett is an unrelenting optimist and two, he continues to demonstrate an ability to think big (or horizontally as he puts it). BFA, as the title implies, is a mix of policy recommendations and predictions as Barnett seeks to map out the strategic vision he laid out in The Pentagon's New Map.In BFA, Barnett explains what it will take for the US to implement a global strategy for shrinking the GAP (the non-globalizing part of the world). He emphasizes that this process will start within the Pentagon, but must grow to encompass the US government as a whole and eventually the rest of the Core (nations that are pillars of globalization). Barnett envisions are re-organization of the US defense establishment that includes restructuring the force and the acquisition process to better fit the nation-building missions that have become central to US foreign policy. Similarly, Barnett also advocates for a cabinet-level post within the US government that would be solely responsible for post-conflict stability and reconstruction ops.Barnett argues that as the US enunciates these new priorities within its own government, it will signal to the rest of the world that it is serious about creating a process to shrink the Gap and will finally create the impetus to formalize a process by which the international community can agree upon the problems that require action, fund the operations, remove the bad actors, and provide for the reconstruction. Barnett sees it happening now with the G-8 and argues that the G-20 will be an ideal institution for this process in the future. Additionally, Barnett wants to cement globalization's spread by cementing a US-Chinese strategic relationship (over the grave of the North Korean regime) and a NATO-like Asian security alliance. Barnett is given to the idea that like it or not China is increasingly going to define the future of globalization and that America needs to cement the relationship now while we can get something out of it (taking down the DPRK).Barnett places less emphasis on democratic politics than most, instead believing that liberal economics will eventually pull the political processes of authoritarian states towards systems that we can live with. This, according to Barnett, is how we will have to shrink the Gap; actively working with some authoritarian regimes (China) and tolerating the existence of others as they open up their economies (Iran). Part of this is based on necessity (we can't do anything about it anyway so let's try and cut otherwise favorable deals) and part of this based on history (the richer people get the bigger role they demand in how their country is governed).BFA might scare away some because it is bold in its prescriptions but generally the recommendations he makes are sensible. Not necessarily because those specific ones will work but because they correctly identify the faults in the US government and the international community that hinder us from shrinking the Gap. Where BFA gets a little out there for me is in predicting future events. Barnett is overly optimistic in my opinion, but that is not a knock on his description of the current international system or what it will take to change it, just on the likelihood that we will get a solution right the first time. I think the world will eventually get on board with Barnett's general strategy, but how post-conflict Iraq shakes out will have a huge effect on the willingness of the rest of the world to engage in a US-led rebuilding effort in the near future, a \`Department of Everything Else' notwithstanding.This book is not as stimulating as PNM, but I did not expect it to be as PNM broke ground with a lot of new ideas while BFA simply tries to demonstrate how those ideas could come to fruition. Barnett does achieve his goal though; he shows his readers what the process can look like, and more importantly identifies the changes that need to be made to set that process in motion."},{"Title":"Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating","review":"I read this thinking it was a follow on to his first book.

The fact that the author's ideas were taken very seriously at the highest levels of the Bush administration is frightening, but not hard to believe.

However, on an important issue Dr. Barnett gets his information wrong. Because it is a central part of his plan to \\"process politically bankrupt states,\\" it is rather important.This review is taken from my blog. I hope the formatting came out OK:The International Criminal Court, an intergovernmental organization that has refused to promise not to prosecute Americans, is an important part of Dr. Barnett's \\"Blueprint for Action\\"It features in his sixth stage of \\"successfully processing politically bankrupt states\\"\\" 6. The final step in the process would involve the criminal prosecution of the indicted / apprehended parties in the International Criminal Court (ICC) located in The Hague, Netherlands (52)\\"And while Barnett argues for American, and International Peacekeeper, immunity from ICC prosecution\\" My prediction is this: While the U.S. Leviathan [blitzkrieg] force will never come under the purview of the ICC -- because it will remain deeply embedded in military law -- the far more internationalized SysAdmin [peacekeeper] force, including U.S. components, must reach some blanket-clause protection regarding its activities in the Gap. The reality is that the ICC was not set up to prosecute the \\"crimes\\" of peacekeepers and Core military personnel intervening inside the Gap, but rather to extend the Core's principles of war crimes into the Gap and, in this way, provide some sense of international consequence for what in these chronic civil wars, long-running terrorist campaigns, and brutal dictatorships. (68)\\"He assures us the ICC won't be complicated by entanglements with the United Nations:\\" Moving on to the last of the six pieces in this A-Z system, I personally place a strong emphasis on funneling any \\"suspects\\" we pick up in this process toward the International Criminal Court, an institution that is both free and independent of the UN system as was recently set up specifically to target individuals for prosecution of genocide, crimes against humanity, and related war crimes. (67)\\"To make sure his point is clear, Barnett later reiterates his suggestion\\" As for the trials, prisoners will need to be funneled toward the International Criminal Court, which is perfect for this sort of thing. But again, the Untied States, plus the Core group as a whole, would need to reach some direct modus vivendi with the court, and if that didn't work, the group would simply need to set up its own. But my guess is that the ICC would jump at the chance to be accredited in this additional manner, because so long as the United States considers it more of a threat to its ruling making than avenue for rule sharing with the rest of the Core, the ICC will remain vastly underutilized. And no, that wouldn't get us in bed uncomfortably with the UN, because the ICC is independent of the UN. (132)\\"Hmmm... regular readers of tdaxp may recall a note from International Law & Organization which seems to contradict this...\\" UNSC can vote to delay ICC proceedings for 1 year, renewable\\"So what does the Rome Statue of the International Criminal Court say about this? What does the ICC say about its relationship with the UN?\\" The States Parties to this Statute, ... Determined to these ends and for the sake of present and future generations, to establish an independent permanent International Criminal Court in relationship with the United Nations system, with jurisdiction over the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole, (Preamble)\\"Hmmm... that's a little vague... and it does say \\"permanent\\"The United Nations can refer cases to the International Criminal Court:\\" The Court may exercise its jurisdiction with respect to a crime referred to in article 5 inaccordance with the provisions of this Statute if: ... A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the Prosecutor by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations (Article XIII(b)).\\"And, like my notes said, can delay prosecutions... indefinitely\\" No investigation or prosecution may be commenced or proceeded with under this Statute fora period of 12 months after the Security Council, in a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of theCharter of the United Nations, has requested the Court to that effect; that request may be renewedby the Council under the same conditions. (Article XVI)\\"The treaty also mentions special roles for the Secretary-General, the General Assembly, and other UN organs, but the Security Council's power to start and stop prosecution hardly makes the ICC \\"free and independent of the UN system\\" or even just \\"independent of the UN.\\"Except maybe in UN speech.I am disappointed in Barnett's misleading statements. Perhaps he did not read the ICC treaty and has not read any good summaries of it. Or he very selectively used one word in the (non-binding) Preamble, \\"independent,\\" while ignoring the substantial dependency of the ICC outlined in the treaty itself."},{"Title":"Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating","review":"Mr. Barnett advocates for WTO-based globalization that he feels is now a fait accompli, or such is just inevitable, including the strategic geopolitical growth of a Chinese \\"co-prosperity sphere\\" within East Asia. He is very disturbed by the economic linkages between China and US, and he feels that Taiwan must be sold down the river in the name of free-trade globalization in order to avoid political tension. Barnett says that the \\"blank check\\" given to Taipei (under the Taiwan Relations Act) must be rescinded, and that Taiwan must be told to integrate with China someday soon. This strategic worldview is the tired old theory that global economic development will usurp the military option in strategic analysis of geopolitics. Mr. Barnett has a trade-based globalization blueprint for action that would avoid the next Opium War with China by essentially making Taiwan a trade concession to Beijing. If we would just give up Taiwan (under the San Francisco Peace Treaty, One China policy, and Taiwan Relations Act), then American corporate trade could continue unencumbered by messy legalities of the Taiwan status in the WTO. Mr. Barnett is a \\"classic\\" hardliner and China advocate for corporatist greed, but in his short-sightedness, Barnett summarily dismisses strategic roles of law of war and military issues in the Taiwan trade status. In rebuttal to Barnett and friends, Richard Hartzell wrote an insightful article \\"Understanding the San Francisco Peace Treaty's Disposition of Formosa and the Pescadores\\" (Harvard Asia Quarterly, Fall 2004) expounding on the strategic roles of WTO-based international trade laws and the Taiwan member status as a WTO \\"autonomous seperate customs territory\\". In the One China domain of the State Department lawyers, Hartzell argues the WTO-inspired formation of a \\"separate customs territory\\", which is separate from China under San Franscico Peace Treaty, also created a more temporary \\"WTO-status\\" within the Uniform Tariff Clause of the US Constutition. Mr. Barnett's foresight fails to also realize that the lobbist decoupling of \\"human rights\\" from China PNTR is very dangerous if it intends to also decouple the undefined \\"civil rights\\" of Taiwan Relations Act. Barnett clearly does not like any inconvenient footnotes of history in his grand strategic blueprints, but he should read the WTO-based footnotes on Taiwan membership status. His vision could be caught in a web of self-deceit, and that Taiwan trade issues could become a strategic catalyst for a \\"trade war\\". The next Opium War of 1841 (over the China trade issues like Taiwan WTO-status) is not going to see any future retirement of the Pentagon brass into the Barnett footnotes of American corporate history. Mr. Barnett fails to pay attention to details of the international trade law on Taiwan status in his grand designs of China free-trade. He can't sweep these details under the carpet without trampling upon \\"uniform tariff clause\\" and trade laws of America. Barnett's political separation of human rights and most-favor nation status for China for WTO membership did not do the same for the Taiwan status in WTO. Mr. Barnett is just blinded by American corporate greed in China, and he does not advocate any constitutional integrity on the China trade issues of the WTO, a multilateral treaty, and political separation of powers in spheres of foreign policy versus foreign commerce. In fact, the Barnett blueprint is a treaty cession of foreign commerce powers of the legislative branch to the WTO trade policy body. Taiwan is a WTO monkey wrench thrown into the Barnett blueprint. Actually, the Taiwan trade status is an 800 pound gorilla sitting on his globalization blueprint."},{"Title":"Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating","review":"Tom Barnett's militancy is questionably-suited for a world the US once led because of the appeal of its ideals and culture rather than the coercive dominance of its military. Barnett's realization that the US needs to learn to \\"win the peace\\", however is a grand idea.

In Barnettian terms, the US is becoming more like the New Core states (the BRICs - Brazil, Russia, India, and China) and less like Old Europe and Old Nippon. Stuff like that makes me want to read as many of Barnett's articles as possible.I used to see Bob Kaplan as the best foreign policy analyst. After 9/11, I literally bought every book that he wrote because he was the only person out there that made any sense. Everyone else was too Euro-centric and not focused enough on what was going on in the Gap. I still feel that Kaplan makes some good points now and then in strategic terms but he has become too military focused to give us the other side's point of view on things.I first saw Barnett when he did his spiel on C-Span about a year ago. His PowerPoint presentation really hit a nerve for me. However, I was more impressed with his description of recent history and how we got to where we are than on his future predictions. Barnett gives me the feeling that he knows for sure where we are headed (a positive and happy future) in a way that reminds me of Marx's prediction of the \\"inevitability of communism\\". Not to say that Barnett is a lefty, but you get the same feeling from hearing the neo-cons talking about Democracy in the Middle East.I want to believe that the future will be as sunny as Barnett thinks it will be, but the facts of history have shown repeatedly how progress can go backwards as well. For Example:China has gone to war with every country that borders it (except Nepal, Bhutan, and Myanmar) in the past 50 years. They took us on in Korea, only a year after the Communist take over in '49 (remember the \\"who lost China debate\\"). This was when we still had practically all the nuclear bombs in the world (the USSR only got them in '49). We had shown the world in '45 that we did not think twice about nuking Asians. And the Chinese still didn't care!The Chinese eliminated Tibet (now Xizang) in '59. They took on India in '62. They took on the Soviets over the Amur & Ussuri River islands in '69. They took on Vietnam in '79. Also, people don't realize now days but Hainan Island was one of the last areas of China controlled by Chiang Kai-Shek. From March to May 1950, the PLA's amphibious landing operations on Hainan Island captured the island for the Chinese communists. Taiwan, though, was too far away for any landings to occur.What I am saying, to be concise, is that the Chinese leadership is trained to believe in war as simply another tool in the toolbox. It is not that they think that America will attack them someday or that we will cut off their oil-supply as we did to Japan in September '41. No, what really threatens the Chinese government is that we pose a threat to them... PERIOD! They see any potential threat as something that you do not just accommodate, but take out. Barnett has a point when he says that we can't stop the Chinese from modernizing, but he needs to be more clear on how we can shape (i.e. deter) China's behavior from becoming more like ours in the future. I know that does sound pretty cynical.Germany and the UK were each other's biggest trade partners in 1913. Germany was building up their Kriegsmarine (Navy) in order to challenge the UK on the high seas. Germany knew that no one would challenge her on land, but it still needed a navy for world supremacy (read Mahan to figure out why that is). The fact that the Kaiser was Queen Victoria's first grandchild did not matter.I have studied this period a lot and it is ironic that in an interview the Kaiser gave to the London Times in 1912 about their naval build-up, Wilhelm II said that a strong German navy is not necessarily a threat to England. Rather, England may find the Kriegsmarine useful in the future when China and the Far East become harder to control.Today's China and pre-1913 Germany are so similar that it just shows you how ironic history can be.With that in mind, you should buy Barnett's book so that the book-publishing world sees that there are still enough people out there who are interested in stuff that goes deeper in its analysis than 99% of the other books being published today. Barnett also has an interesting blog that you should look at if you liked his previous book, PNM."},{"Title":"Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating","review":"Barnett elaborates on THE PENTAGON'S NEW MAP with further proposals to liberate the world with the U.S. military. The author seems to be in the grip of a form of globalist mania, and sees visions of a world Kantian peace. But for better or for worse there is no constituency for this dream -- the U.S. people certainly won't pay for it, and the global lenders that would make up the shortfall aren't going to pay for it either, as one can easily see from the intense enthusiasm they have shown for our brilliant little campaign in Mesopotamia.I have a Kantian dream too -- what if the U.S. gave up its unilateralist scheming and initiated a global entente, joining with the European Community and China, along with the rest of the world, in strengthening the U.N. and creating a truly multinational military with the specific purpose of peacemaking and peacekeeping? It would have the legitimacy that no U.S.-led forces will ever have, regardless of the latest clever variations on old counterinsurgency doctrines. Of course the U.S. couldn't unilaterally control the oil, as in the current plans, but we're going to have to rapidly replace oil with renewable energy anyway. Farfetched? You bet, but I'd put money on my dream before Barnett's.For a more realistic, and Realist, view of U.S. foreign policy, an excellent new book is Stephen M. Walt'sTAMING AMERICAN POWER(see my review). He examines how the rest of the world is responding to U.S. primacy, via balancing (which includes asymmetric strategies), balking, binding, and delegitimation. He critiques the Bush (Cheney/Rumsfeld) administration's Global Hegemony strategy, which is obviously failing, and after a look at Selective Engagement, which was the strategy of the Bush Sr. and Clinton administrations, recommends a return to Offshore Balancing, which has been U.S. strategy through most of its history, and which Walt says is a perfect fit for this period of U.S. primacy. This is not isolationism, but it would involve a reduction of forces in Europe and Asia, forcing other Great Powers to take on their own defense burdens. Walt calls for the abandonment of the dangerous so-called \\"preemptive war doctrine,\\" which of course is really a doctrine of PREVENTIVE WAR, offensive war. Walt, lamenting the hole the Bush Administration has put us in, says the U.S. is \\"a remarkably immature Great Power,\\" and that \\"Americans remain remarkably ignorant of the world.\\" This of course is the America that Barnett imagines will become a selfless, responsible, farsighted Empire in lieu of a world government, the Global Crusaders for Freedom, Justice and the American Way.May the Kantian dream of world peace come true someday, but in the meantime, as Shakespeare so memorably put it, perhaps \\"discretion is the better part of valor.\\""},{"Title":"Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating","review":"Barnett's prior book, The_Pentagon's_New_Map, presented a new explanation for the role of US military in the next decade or two.

DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating","review":"Strategic thinker Thomas Barnett's 2005 \\"Blueprint for Action\\" is a follow-up to his bestselling \\"The Pentagon's New Map.\\" Barnett's thesis is that globalization has divided the world into the haves and the have nots, and the United States is uniquely positioned to police the seams and reduce the friction between the two.There is much to recommend in this book. Barnett has a good handle on all the latest forward thinking on globalization and the asymmetric, netcentric and fourth generation warfare that seems to travel in its wake. His contacts in and around the Pentagon have given him some useful insight into where the military may think it will have to go in future. His ability to describe a big picture is both entertaining and educational.There are lots of challenges for Barnett and any other strategist. Visionary thinking often has a short shelf life, and shouldn't be confused with 20/20 hindsight. Circumstances relentlessly change. Certainly, it is by no means clear that the big picture that Barnett describes is the only possible version, let alone one that enjoys a political consensus in the United States or anywhere else. The Pentagon's forward thinking on any topic is ultimately dependent for implementation on the particular vision of the Administration it serves and the willingness of the American public to pay for it. In Barnett's case, it would seem unlikely that his vision will be bought wholesale.This book is recommended as an interesting read, full of new ideas and current terminology.

It's quite original, as it's based on reason and logic and proceeds from explicit assumptions -- typically unheard of in political debate. He also seems to cut quite neatly and orthogonally through the blue/red rhetoric, pissing off both sides and pleasing both sides.Now, I'm not going to go so far as to say his words are the final and total truth, but will say that a single page of Barnett's words seem to have a higher percentage of fresh and relevant truth than in 1000 pages of the hackneyed political bombast we have been hearing recently.Then again, Barnett speaks in the language of geeks, and as a geek myself, maybe I just understand him better than I understand the near incomprehensible babble of politicians."},{"Title":"Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating","review":"The United States stands at a threshold. It can withdraw into itself. Or it can seize a moment to forge the most peaceful period in human history, where war becomes unknown. Thomas P. M. Barnett, a former at the U.S. Naval War College professor and advisor to the Office of the Secretary of Defense maps a sweeping vision for the U.S. military in this the sequel to his influential The Pentagon's New Map.Barnett argues the U.S. military has a massive doctrinal flaw. It possesses unrivalled power to win wars. Yet has little ability to win the peace. Take Iraq. No thought was given to postwar stabilization and reconstruction.He advocates creating a new Department of Global Security. He foresees it being tasked with restoring countries after an armed intervention by U.S. forces. He argues the new department would also work to reduce economic and social instability in regions of the developing world that currently are \\"outside the map.\\"Barnett is an original foreign policy thinker. This book answers many of the questions left hanging with his first. For me, his insights place our foreign policy in a context I rarely see in my other reading."},{"Title":"Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating","review":"This book offers a comprehensive and cogent argument for American military intervention into the affairs of other countries, AND gives suggestions of how the American federal government should be changed to make these interventions as effective and efficient as possible, AND what foreign policy decisions should be made to this effect. Specifically, the book argues several things.1. Create a new Cabinet-level department whose sole job is to rebuild countries after the US military has taken control of them.2. Tell Taiwan that the US will not fight China for it, and work out a peace agreement with China that increases military trust and cooperation between the two.3. Work with East Asian countries towards a military intervention in N. Korea to remove their dictator.4. Accomodate Iran on its nuclear ambitions for a quid pro quo recognition of Israel's right to exist.5. Support human rights and specifically women's rights everywhere in the world.6. Encourage globalization by reducing trade barriers around the world.7. Take out Hugo Chavez of Venezuala and repudiate other socialist leaders throughout the world in various ways.8. Intervene in failed states around the world to promote democracy, human rights, and capitalism.Several recurring themes of this book that the author brings up over and over is the need for America to take charge, the need for America to show the way, and the ability of America to do these things. Yet in all his arguments, the author seems to forget, or is somehow ignorant of many things.1st, many failed or failing states reached that condition due in large part to foreign intervention, whether it be direct control by a foreign government, or indirect control by foreign corporations and/or foreign governments. Three good examples are Guatemala, Congo, and Afghanistan.Guatamela had its democratically elected leader overthrown in the 1950's by the CIA, and replaced with a dictator propped up by US economic and military power. Even after this dictator fell, the US supplied local militias in Guatemala and neighboring countries with weapons, training, money and logistical support as long as they publicly opposed communism. The result: well-armed militias that preyed on society thru kidnappings, murder, theft, bribery and other crimes throughout the 1980s and 1990s.In Congo, the first democratically-elected president, Patrice Lumumba, was assasinated by a CIA hitman who was then made dictator of the country. As long as he publicly repudiated the USSR and communism, the US supplied him weapons and money with which he used to bully around his people.In Afghanistan, first the Soviets invaded, and then the US and Muslim countries encouraged militant Muslims from around the world to go in there to fight the Soviets. The effect of both was to destroy civil society.Time and time again throughout the 20th century, the growth of democracy, freedom, and human rights in a country is often betrayed by the influence of foreign nations and/or corporations, usually American and American corporations. And now the author thinks America should intervene more in other countries!2nd, how should America decide which country to intervene in? This is an issue that the author really does not expound on. Historically, America has militarily intervened in the affairs of others only when America was attacked (Pearl Harbor, 9-11), when there was a clear material gain resulting from the intervention (the US taking over Native American tribal lands), or due to Cold War politics (Korea, Vietnam, Bay of Pigs, etc...). Unfortunately, many of the foreign interventions during the Cold War were often supported by US corporations that materially benefited. This connection is totally ignored by the author; the Pentagon is America's number one sales-force and acquisitions department. Whether its securing access to Middle East oil, or selling weapons to Third World countries to benefit some Congressman's district, most of America's foreign interventions are done out of pure and simple greed. Therefore, before America sets of on a series of foreign escapades, it needs to establish a process whereby greed is taken out of the decision-making on whether to invade another country or not.3rd, the author argues that we should help the rest of the world industrialize and modernize as fast as possible. Yet one of the key restraints upon this industrialization and modernization is enforcement of intellectual property rights, a subject almost unmentioned in this book. Is it coincidence that China, the world's fastest growing economy over the past two decades, is the scene of much infringement of patents and copyrights? I do not think so. Conversely, which geographical area in the industrialized world is most respective of US IP laws? Western Europe is the answer, and this is also the area of the world with the slowest growing economy over the past two decades? Again, is this pure coincidence? Probably not. If a company or individual had to pay for each idea it used that it did not come up with, the pace of innovation and product development would quickly grind to a halt. Yet as America leads the pack in globalization, the spread of US IP laws can and will stagnate economies in other countries, especially if these countries in turn cannot enforce their IP laws on Americans.4th, the author believes that American intervention in poorer countries should be aimed at increasing both production and consumption of goods and services that increase its ties with the rest of the world economy. He argues that increased consumption by people around the world will not lead to catastrophic disasters as many environmentalists have projected. Specifically, he shows how man-kind's per-capita consumption of goods has increased for centuries, accompanied by a general growth of the population. This is possible, according to the author, because of man's increasing knowledge of science and technology to manipulate and use the material world. True enough. The author has addressed the question of limited resources by giving the optimists' answer: man will continouosly improve his skills in using whatever resources are available.What the author fails to address is the increase in pollution due to increased per-capita consumption. Over the past 30 years; rates of various congenital and chronic diseases such as autism, cancer, muscular distrophy, mental illness, etc... have steadily increased in the US; even though Americans have access to better health care, better diets, and work in safer environments now than they did 30 years ago. What then is causing this slow and steady increase of various incurable diseases? Many scientists believe it is the various synthetic chemicals man emits into the natural environment as part of industrialization. A toxic oil spill cannot be mopped up like a forest can be replanted. A chemical leak into a river cannot be cleaned up as easily as say a river silted up with too much farmland runoff. In short, the environmental affects of modern industrialization is more than just over-consumption of resources; it is also the resulting pollution (often irreversible) of man's only home, the Earth. This pollution is barely addressed by the author.Last, the author fails to mention how the US public is to be prepared for a long haul of US interventions into other countries. During WWII, Americans were involved in the war effort in all sorts of ways: drafted, working in arms factories, serving in the government, selling war bonds, volunteering, etc... During the Cold War, the government again involved the local populace in the effort thru activities such as air raid drills, splurges in scientific research at universities and national labs, etc... The author fails to show how the government should engage and prepare the American population in this new war of \\"reducing the Gap\\". My personal suggestion, and one which I wished the author had made, is to send more Ameican high school and college students to study abroad every year. When American are more aware of the world, they will care more about it and be more willing to spend tax money helping it.Overall, this book is one long argument for interventionism. Its arguments are well-made but not watertight, and the author leaves many issues untouched. I personally would not recommend reading this book; there are better works in this genre."},{"Title":"Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating","review":"I ran into trouble on page 2 of this book when I was already tired of tripping over the author's ego. I picked this book up for 5.99 and I'm guessing the author is already thoroughly and rightfully discredited. The author promotes fascism (of the classical kind) to a degree comparable to Hilter's National Socialism - even despite that much overused metaphor.The author's main point is that \\"might makes right\\". It has never worked before and it won't work now. It is contrary to the American Perspective and well, the Constitution. The people won't stand for seeing their sons and daughters spill their blood for the CEOs and Chickenhawks who have never seen combat and don't know a thing about it.If adopted, this plan would lead to not only the destruction of the American way of life, but our country's existence. It should rightfully be consigned to the trash heap of history!"},{"Title":"Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating","review":"In this book, Barnett is proposing a system of utopian collective imperialism - a system under which the developed world would cooperate to impose order on the non-developed world. Both to prevent trouble and for the recipient's/victims' own good.Leaving ethical issues of imperium aside, there is a serious question as to the viability of this plan. Barnett is very willing to sacrifice conventional warfighting abilities in order to support his imperial forces. This might work - but only if the rest of the developed world goes along with it. A dubious proposition at best.I'd recommend reading this book - but only to be able to refute the arguments."},{"Title":"Eu, Malika Oufkir: Prisioneira do Rei","review":"This is the Portuguese text edition of a book that, on its face, held a lot of promise. Any story in which a mother and her children, as well as faithful family retainers, are unjustly imprisoned in squalid conditions for twenty years for an ostensible crime committed by the familial patriarch would certainly be of interest. Wrong! This is a tepid and disappointing book, poorly written and, most certainly, poorly edited. It is so filled with contradictions and inconsistencies, as to create somewhat of a credibility gap for the reader.The story revolves around the Oufkir family, who were, at one time, a prominent, highly respected, and well known Moroccan family. Their story is told by Malika Oufkir, who is the eldest daughter of the late General Oufkir, who was executed in August 1972, immediately following an aborted attempt to assassinate King Hassan II of Morocco, for whom he was the Minister of Defense. General's Oufkir's treasonous action was the catalyst for the tragic turn of events that were to engulf his family.After the aborted coup, the General's immediate family was placed under house arrest and four months later, along with two loyal family retainers who volunteered to share their fate, were whisked away to the first of several desert prisons that were to house them for the next fifteen years.As Malika tells it, hers was initially almost a fairy tale story. Brought up in luxurious surroundings, she suffered early heartbreak when, at the age of five, she was separated from her family and \\"adopted\\" by then King Muhammad V, so as to be a live in playmate for the King's daughter. This adoption is never really explained, and one has no idea what her parents' thoughts were on this issue. Malika lived in the Palace in the lap of luxury for many years. As a teenager, however, she moved back with her family, where, there too, she continued to live a very privileged life, steeped in luxury and money.After the Oufkirs' circumstances changed, theirs is truly a tragic story. There is little doubt that the conditions in their desert prisons were deplorable and squalid. With inadequate sanitation, insufficient food, no medical care, or educational provisions, the family was truly living a life of privation. Cutoff from the outside world, as they were, they truly were disenfranchised.Their escape from their last desert prison, an escape that brought their plight to the consciousness of the public, was amazing. But for their escape, there is no doubt in my mind that they would still be languishing in a desert prison today, barely alive, if not already dead. I salute their determination and ingenuity in making a desperate break for freedom.The problem lies in the telling of the story, which is so poorly told. Many things are left unexplained. No effort is made to ground the events that led to their family's downfall in a historical context. Whatever Malika said seems to have been what went into the final draft of this book, even if she contradicted herself a page or two later, which is the main problem with the book. There are so many inconsistencies with what Malika herself says, that the discerning reader is left to question much of what she represents.Malika comes across as a somewhat self-absorbed, vapid woman to whom fate dealt a harsh and unusually cruel hand. Her self absorption is most evident in that she barely acknowledges the sacrifice of the two faithful family retainers, who voluntarily shared their fate, nor does she discuss the impact that this had on them. It is also a little disconcerting that more does not come through about the perceptions the other family members had about this hellish experience. Their insight might have provided a little more balance and interest to the narrative. In the hands of a good writer and excellent editor, this book might have withstood scrutiny and met expectations.Sorry, Oprah, your book club selections are usually excellent. This one fails to make the grade."},{"Title":"The Younger Edda: Also Called Snorre's Edda, or the Prose Edda","review":"This seems to be an accurate translation of one of the few books that the old Norse wrote.

It is separated into three larger parts...The first is basically an explanation to Christian authorities. Unfortunately, this was written AFTER this mythology was the mainstream religion of the Norse. By the time it was recorded by Snorri (Snorre) Christianity had been spread to this area and to write this book would have been blasphemous without the explanation at the beginning. this is why people may see it as odd, as Andrew, a previous reviewer noted.The second part is the source of the best content, with the stories of the Norse that we have all become so fond of.The third part is a sad effort by Snorri to tell the king of Norway (I think that was it) how awesome he was. It didn't work, as Snorri was killed under commands of that king later on. Because of this bad writing, many believe Snorri didn't write the second part, and that he just compiled information provided by others. If you are familiar with the Poetic Edda, or the Older Edda, you will see that Snorri directly quoted from it's text.These are great stories.

I was a little shocked when the notes started out with Adam and Even and gave a hasty summary of biblical and then mythological characters from the ancient Greeks and Romans to explain that Odin and his kin were \\"real\\" mythological people.

Staring with an Asyncronus request object which hides the different browserspecific aproaches to getting a Request Object. The fact is thatjavascript is not fully defined, every implementation is slighlydifferent and (has the occational bug.In real development I fully intend to use an Ajax library However it is good to have an understading of hot only whatthe framework is doing but why and how it could be done differently.Another reviwer mentioned the lack of source code for the book.At the time os this review, source code is available, and itnow contains both .Net and Java Servlet implementations of mostpatterns."},{"Title":"Ajax Patterns and Best Practices (Expert's Voice)","review":"Hmm!!! What a great book!!!.I have been a tech monkey for quite a long time (self made IT person coming from a \\"hard sciences\\" background). IMHO, books getting raving reviews just have like 15-20% genuinely good information. I constantly find myself skipping whole paragraphs, pages and even chapters occasionally. I tend to only give my opinion to say something new or criticize an author and/or posters who, in my opinion, are either under or overselling and author/a book. No, this is not the way to become \\"popular\\" and/or get high ratings at amazon, as many people have joked about already commenting on amazons' posters..Well, with this book I found myself slowing down and carefully reading/studying each single sentence ;-) I, generally speaking, dislike the pretension of some of us, tech monkeys, while talking about coding (software development or whichever way you would like to call it) as if it were NOT merely some sort of scripting carpentry. I haven't still quite gotten where exactly the \\"science\\" in CS comes from. However, I thoroughly enjoyed Christian's thoughtful discourse, even though his explanations had sometimes and over philosophizing ring to them..This is not a book for \\"web designers\\" per se and/or people curious about AJAX. I would totally agree with the poster that said: \\"To date, I've read about four of the major Ajax titles from various publishers, and this is the best of them so far.\\" I not only pleasantly discovered that but also found Gross to be \\"another kind of animal\\". I don't quite follow the criticism of some other posters this book has densely way more good stuff that the few mistakes that might have here and there. Anyway here are the only \\"things\\" that I found \\"questionable\\", perhaps from my perspective/exposure/understanding or lack thereof:.1._ he tends to heavily use URLs as resource pointers in ways that I seem quite a bit unnatural at times. I like to think of the \\"/webapps\\" part of a URL as some sort of general/topical indicator. Page 123; I would tend to go \\"/comments/users?user_name\\", instead of \\"/users/[user_name]/comments\\" as he suggests. The topical issue, posting comments in this case, I find much more important than who is doing it..2._ sometimes while reading his code I wondered if ghe person writing the book was the same one coding ;-) On page 90, where the \\"Book\\" class is defined; I would rather go:public class Book{private String[][] aBkAtts = new String[][]{{\\"_ISBN\\",\\"\\"},{\\"_Author\\",\\"\\"},{\\"_Title\\",\\"\\"}};...}.and I think, he uses the same type of (to me constraining) coding style on page 350, when he talks about \\"Programmatically being specific and generic at the same time\\" and he goes on proposing the Extension pattern, when such a similar \\"expansive\\" attributes-values arrays would do, which he can also use while handling differences among search APIs.I would actually use a DS based on associative arrays with some hash map to quickly find the attribute-value through their indexes, but then I could imagine some people would complain about his code not being readable or something ;-) Most explanatory code in books is like this..3._ On page 205, he mistakenly considers some programming languages to be dynamic on the basis of being able to \\"define, add, or delete function modules or class types during execution and have the ability to persist those changes as work space for later execution\\". He says that \\"java and C# cannot do that, or at least as simply as dynamic languages\\". Well, I don't know about C#, but I couldn't find a -simpler- way to do exactly that in java or we might have a totally different interpretation of what \\"simplicity\\" means. All \\"languages\\" (including programming ones) as part of their very nature -must- have these abilities he enumerates..4._ On chapter 8, Persistent Communications Pattern, he engages in a long discussion of what he calls \\"the broken Internet\\" ... the bad part of the story being?!?! ;-) I think he over dramatizes what he considers to be broken in order to make his point of why is it the client that must poll the server..5._ on page 248, where he talks about one of AJAX Achilles heels the \\"waiting thread\\" server problem, I would probably used a centralized JMS-based asynchronous strategy to better deal with it..6._ on page 272 ..., I wonder what he meant when he says cookies can not be distinguished among different UA. Cookies are just a string that could be defined whichever way you want. Including scribbling in some UA-specifying data..7._ I would have spoken more about AJAX abuses, excesses and anti patterns in common used out there. Each \\"hot new thing\\" is overly abused and AJAX will/is. A good example of it you can find on chapter 11, \\"REST-based MVC pattern\\". For those of you that code java reread this article keeping in mind there is some superb technology called JavaWebStart as you read about the AJAX based \\"Lilina\\" blog aggregator you might have been salivating or wondering what the big deal was..My final thoughts would be: Danke schoen Christian Gross!"},{"Title":"Ajax Patterns and Best Practices (Expert's Voice)","review":"I read a lot of technical books in relation to my work as a software developer and also out of my interest in particular topics.

But the real issue is building Ajax applications that actually solve problems and use established techniques to do so. This book can help you move from \\"cool\\" to \\"correct\\"...

First there's the Intent (what is happening), followed by the Motivation (why the pattern is necessary). Applicability talks about when it should be used, and the Associated Patterns talks about other patterns that may work well with this one. The Architecture and Implementation sections go into the most detail, talking about how the pattern is laid out and built, as well as what issues might be encountered in the real world. The final section, Pattern Highlights, does a quick summary of the material and is a good overview/reminder of what was covered.This is an important addition to the Ajax books that are currently out on the market. I've always been a believer in the maxim \\"just because you can doesn't mean you should.\\" Because Ajax is \\"hot\\" right now, it's tempting to use it to build applications that might well be better designed without all the whistles and bells.

Although it isn't the \\"standard\\" way to do things, it tends to be much faster than creating the object model node by node... there are also some gotchas in the standard way, opposed to using InnerHTML.This aside, I just wanted to point out that AJAX is not a standard, so it is inherantly difficult to write about, and I commend any author who offers a pragmatic aproach to it... I personally have been developing web-based applications since the mid 90's, and appreciate a lot of the work in the past year and a half towards bringing these techniques more into widespread use... \\"Selling\\" a more featureful application before the ajax craze was much harder than it is now."},{"Title":"Ajax Patterns and Best Practices (Expert's Voice)","review":"While this book does present useful topics that are particularly relevant to AJAX applications, my main problem with it is the poorly edited and structured way it is written.The book is full of paragraphs like this one (found at the very beginning of the \\"Applicability section\\" of the \\"Decoupled Navigation Pattern\\"):\\"The Decoupled Navigation pattern is used when content is navigated. The statement is obtuse and does not really say anything because HTML content is always navigated. However, because of the way Dynamic HTML is used, content navigation is sometimes used to generate an effect. When links are used to generate effects, the Decoupled Navigation pattern does not apply.\\"That's the whole paragraph beginning to end -- what the heck is this trying to say? Apparently aware of how non-sensical this is, the author starts the next paragraph with \\"To clarify this explanation...\\" and then goes on to present an example of a website in Swiss German (I think), with no translation given. Two pages of more examples and a summary rules-of-thumb later, and the only implied take-away is that the Pattern applies when decision-making and data processing are required, and the contents of the page change but not completely.A few sections like this could be forgiven (and you could quibble as to why he had to write this example this way), but stuff like this prevails throughout every chapter. More often than not, ideas which with some thought could have been condensed into a few sentences, result in half a page of digressions and logical dead-ends.Here's another one:\\"The need to separate the resource from the representation has not been adequately explained, and some developers may wonder why it is necessary at all. After all, may websites work well and nobody has complained too loudly. The reason why many websites work well is because they have probably implemented the separation of resource from representation. And those that have not done so have received complaints.\\"Upon reading this, I feel some irreplaceable portion of my lifespan has just been wasted.At least one good thing this book does is that it only focuses on Patterns that are particular to an AJAX environment (e.g. Persistent Communications, Decouple Navigation, etc.), without wasting time on stuff that is applicable to other more general software design settings (which plenty of other books already cover of course).While the ideas in this book are interesting and potentially useful to somebody beginning to design an AJAX application, the writing style makes reading it a true chore. Surely there is better written stuff out there on AJAX software design."},{"Title":"Ajax Patterns and Best Practices (Expert's Voice)","review":"...which is ironic, because the author himself mentions that the reason Ajax is becoming so popular is that people demand better fit and finish in their presentation.This man DESPERATELY needs an editor (or a new/better one). Sentances run on and on, without ever getting directly to the point. Here's a great example of what's wrong with the book: in the first two chapters, he describes Ajax in painstaking (almost insulting) detail, but never really nails down WHAT \\"REST\\" is. Even after reading a section in the begining of Chapter 2, \\"Understanding REST Theory,\\" I had to go to the Wikipedia page to learn just EXACTLY what it is.This is a good resource for learning Ajax, but there are other good reasources out there, too -- ones that are better written and won't leave you fighting to understand what's going on through every page."},{"Title":"Ajax Patterns and Best Practices (Expert's Voice)","review":"This is an excellent theory and strategy book for AJAX. For the uninitiated, AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML. In short, it's the technology behind Web 2.0. New data is fetched from the server and/or presented dynamically through client side Javascript that calls server side sources, commonly XML. Instead of refreshing the entire page, individual elements are changed based on user input and new data pulled from the server. The level of interaction and sophistication involved in using AJAX makes it a force to be reckoned with. Because of that, it's essential to have a book that covers the underpinnings of this technology.True to the title of this book, it is packed with good theoretical discussions of how AJAX works and good strategies for how to use AJAX. Knowing all of the tricks isn't worth much unless you can apply your knowledge in a meaningful way. An example of what I considered impressive was the material on caching strategies: AJAX has always struck me as being a high-transfer way to presenting information and instead this section makes AJAX into a means of saving traffic.Unlike other books on AJAX, this book covers design patterns for the technology. How do you divide data for distribution? Answer: Use the Content Chunking Patterns. How do you effectively maintain state or at least the impression of maintenance? Answer: the persistent communications pattern. How do you make all of the potential data available at the user's fingertips? Answer: the infinite data pattern. In the nine patterns presented the author explores much of theory, and that helps you strategize when it comes time to code your own applications. Each pattern has a dedicated chapter that first presents the intent of the pattern, then the motivation for using it in the context of AJAX, a list of possible applications of the design pattern, and associated design patterns. Next, the design pattern's architecture is explained in the context of solving an actual problem. Finally, the implementation is shown via code and the user's interaction with various webpages. At the end of each pattern's chapter there are \\"highlights\\" of what has just been presented.Up to now concrete examples of using AJAX were copious and usable theory has been hard to come by, making this book a welcome volume. I know how to write Javascript, I know what XML is. What I needed to know was how to bring it all together using design patterns that make sense for AJAX. This book accomplished that. My one criticism is that the introductory material in chapters one and two seems a bit rushed, so absolute beginners might benefit by reading \\"Head Rush Ajax\\" first, which is an excellent yet more introductory text.I notice that Amazon does not show the table of contents, so I do that here:CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Ajax 1CHAPTER 2 The Nuts and Bolts of Ajax 19CHAPTER 3 Content Chunking Pattern 53CHAPTER 4 Cache Controller Pattern 79CHAPTER 5 Permutations Pattern 111CHAPTER 6 Decoupled Navigation Pattern 153CHAPTER 7 Representation Morphing Pattern 197CHAPTER 8 Persistent Communications Pattern 225CHAPTER 9 State Navigation Pattern 265CHAPTER 10 Infinite Data Pattern 303CHAPTER 11 REST-Based Model View Controller Pattern 333"},{"Title":"Ajax Patterns and Best Practices (Expert's Voice)","review":"This book was very useful as an introduction to AJAX. There are definitely practices that look useful, and ways to go about things that I will keep in mind.The author does not seem to know what a Design Pattern is. Most of the \\"patterns\\" that are introduced in this book are specific solutions. Design patterns are solutions to generic problems. The author jumps from pre-existing patterns being implemented for specific problems to introducing new \\"patterns\\" that only solve specific problems.The book is well written, but I think comprehension would be easier if he used a little UML. An example of this is his book class. Rather than building the whole class, he could have built a single class diagram, and then only shown the implementation of the non-trivial methods and properties. This would have taken less space, and been easier to read.Nothing in this book is rocket-science, but there are things that it might take a few projects to work out on your own. I think it is a great book for anyone who is interested in learning AJAX."},{"Title":"Ajax Patterns and Best Practices (Expert's Voice)","review":"I very much enjoyed reading this book and got a lot out of it. To date, I've read about four of the major Ajax titles from various publishers, and this is the best of them so far. Christian Gross uses a very friendly voice and makes tacking the technical concepts behind modern-day web programming with Ajax - often a difficult task to simplify by the writing community - very easy to grasp.But don't think just because Gross slyly defines the relationship of JavaScript, XML and HTTP that this is merely a book for the newbie. He uses some very advanced patterns soon into the book, and bases his fundamental asynchronous calls on one of the better models of safe and reliable cross-browser object instantiation through the use of a simple factory pattern. It's effective programming by way of intelligent design.I appreciated the fact that the patterns described within the book aren't those that are becoming commonplace among blogs, wikis and books, demonstrating the range of Ajax programming on today's web. Gross also mentions the idiosyncrasies of the major browsers in handling things like HTTP headers, caching, output display (or lack thereof), and other things you'll need to know.Perfect examples of these helpful patterns are those used for persistent communications, cache controlling and permutations for multi-device UI rendering. (I still would have liked to see Gross' take on the 'AutoSave' feature that's so copied by early Ajax adopters, but I won't hold it against him.)I also enjoyed the fact that the book kept coming back to REST-style programming, with the capstone chapter being an exhibit of MVC-style applications development on top of REST. Not enough has been published in mainstream print about working with, much less describing, REST systems, so this was another definite plus.He also references several languages in describing patterns and concepts, such as PHP, Python, C# and Java. While it is a bit of a stretch for those of us not using each one of the languages, it does show cross-platform effectiveness.Gross also breaks down the importance of coding object-oriented JavaScript, using prototypes, code reuse and other best practices concepts that may take a few re-reads to fully stick, but will make you a better overall programmer.

What this means is that the book explains how REST is used in developing Ajax web applications.REST is a style on how to send data between a client and a server. Until now, the basics client/server or browser/server requests has been the same for years no matter what server technology you use (ASP, PHP, and JSP). With Ajax the way data is passed and retrieved to the client id different now. So, the way we architect web applications must be different too. Common sense right? Well, this is the first book that I've seen so far that explains Ajax in this way.The first chapter goes into an overview of Ajax and how it has changed how web applications work. It gives some good examples of various Google web applications and explains how the data is sent to the client behind the scenes. It also talks about the various architectural styles of development.The second chapter starts focuses on REST theory and data will be sent via the XMLHttpRequest object. It gives a good detailed explanation of the methods and properties and a sample class written in JavaScript that can be used. It also illustrates a debugging process of this class (in Firebox) and shows you how to run through the different states of the XMLHttpRequest.The third chapter reviews a new pattern (\\"content chunking\\") which the author shows you how to incrementally build an HTML page while separating the logic so that each section of the site can be loaded by user interaction. It's something I've never even thought about as I've recently read different Ajax books. Unfortunately, I cannot go into detail of this chapter (otherwise I'd be writing a book), but believe me it is an eye opener.The fourth chapter reviews another pattern (\\"cache controller\\") which is the pattern how Google created Google Maps in how the site temporarily stores data per session. This is another reason to buy this book as well. Again, I've never seen this methodology discussed in any other Ajax book.The rest of the book goes through other patterns in developing Ajax web applications that will enlighten you in helping you create the next generation of web apps (web 2.0). This book is skinny (less than 400), but each chapter really goes straight to the point in explaining each pattern and how Ajax can really be used correctly.A definite must buy for any web developer wanting to truly understand Ajax."},{"Title":"Ajax Patterns and Best Practices (Expert's Voice)","review":"I sat down at a book store and went through four Ajax books for an hour. This one stood out as the best by far. I read it exclusively for another hour and I was not let down. I like the idea that the author takes a stand on the technologies that make sense to him (using REST specifically) and presents solutions based on those technologies. I do wish this book gave some more insight into how the server-side REST implementation works. From what I saw it just says something like the server gets data from a database and presents it in the correct xml form when it recieves a request at a specific URL. Very well written, no fluff.

If you want better, you'll have to spend quite a bit more money. My native Irani friend's native Irani mother said that she was ashamed that a westerner could write so accurately on a subject about which she had forgotten much. She herself ended up reading, enjoying, and praising this book about her own culture. That alone should say it all. While no volume, not even the $3420 Encyclopedia Iranica, could possibly cover everything, O'Shea's book taught me a variety of useful information in an entertaining way, and helped me to understand and appreciate my Irani friends better. This book is best read while interacting frequently with Iranians, otherwise it might not be as enjoyable."},{"Title":"Two Sons of Nippon","review":"In the jargon of the entertainment industry this book is a &quot;sleeper.&quot; Why it is not on the top ten list may be the fault of poor advertisement or not being reviewed by the right people. This author has said it all and given us new insight, and a new and fresh outlook upon the Japanese people prior to, during and after WWll. Their story is here, the historical facts and the way the author blends the story into them makes this a very entertaining and interesting read. Besides getting a history lesson one falls in love with the characters. At times one wants to laugh with them and cry with them,,all the emotions are here. When you finish reading this book you cannot but help coming away with a different feeling or attitude. From one page to another it will keep your interest and get you thinking about the events of the time. Did we know about Pearl Harbor or not? What really happened to Amelia Earhart? It is all here in this unique story."},{"Title":"Two Sons of Nippon","review":"I just finished reading this book. At first I thought perhaps it would be written more for the male reader as there were conflicts about WWII. But intetwined with the historical part lies a story of the lives of the characters who portray the historical part. By the end of the book one feels he has met, known, and understands these people. It is well written and holds one's attention to the last word. I recommend this book and know I will find myself reading it again."},{"Title":"Two Sons of Nippon","review":"Two Sons of Nippon was an interesting and emotional read for me. I was drawn to the strong characters created by J.J. Shay. Having recently returned from a stay in Japan, I was able to make comparisons of the Japan that I saw and the Japan of pre-WWII. Mr. Shay has done his research and presents some interesting questions about events prior to and during the war. He has sparked an interest and wonderment in me about this time in our history."},{"Title":"Disney's Princess Collection, Volume 1: Easy Piano","review":"I am a beginner, self teaching adult.I find that this book is still too hard for me even after a year of attempting them.

I'll work my way up there, but it's not like the other easy books that I have that it takes me awhile before I get it, but this one I'm still not skilled enough to get to even though I keep trying.I know skill level is subjective, so in the graded books, I am not beyond a level 3, so to be able to attempt all these songs, if you aren't above a level 3 in leveled piano books, don't expect this to be within playing capabilities for you."},{"Title":"Disney's Princess Collection, Volume 1: Easy Piano","review":"Book starts out with quite easy songs, and progresses to a little more complex songs.

It would be worth a lot more than 99 cents if it were useable. Unfortunately, It is completely useless in this version and is worth nothing. Anglo-Saxon (Old English) has characters that are not in the standard 26 Latin character set. This version garbles them so that they are not recognizeable. Even the text that you can make out ends up being split up in ways that make it hard to read. It is impossible to search for anything because of the character font problem.Too bad!

And when the subject at hand is as both contentious and in some respects fuzzy, as 'UFOlogy', it's easy to see why this important book has garned exactly two reviews, one of which was apparently based entirely on disagreement with the title, rather than the content.As to the book itself...while slightly dated at this point, almost a decade after publication (that being close the high-water mark of Alien Abduction books, Alien Autopsy TV specials, Aliens battling Mulder & Scully, etc.) it carefully traverses the history of the phenomena, not just since Kenneth Arnold's \\"flying saucers\\", but back into pre-history and up through the (then) current day.While the authors certainly draw their own conclusions, they remain careful to let all sides be heard and thoroughly examine various theories and hypothoses that have been put forth (to a bewildering degree) to *explain* what UFOs are about and what they might mean. And do so in a way that is engaging, readable and respectful.Those who come in with strongly preconcieved ideas (\\"it's all rubbish\\", \\"there's a government cover-up of the ETs\\", etc.) will either hate this book or have their worldview challenged. For those of us that think what the UFO phenomena might say about ourselves is important and worth trying to understand (whether that understanding is of a scientific, sociological, psychological, cultural, theological nature...) will find much of interest here and to them is highly recommended.Well-written, well-argued, handsome and with some terrific illustrations, this unjustly neglected volume remains a vital contribution to the field, even ten years after its publication."},{"Title":"UFO's and Ufology: The First 50 Years","review":"I found this book to be quite astonishing.

Gershenfeld uses the fabrication labs (fab lab) developed at MIT to work on social issues such as poverty, lack of communication and lack of resources. The fab labs are made up of collections of machines that are used to cut, carve, solder, machine, sand and mold materials together into a final product. These mechanical components are controlled by a computer program which acts as the user interface, allowing the user to input a design and receive a physical product. The book tells many stories about how the fab labs have been an enabling tool to the problem solvers of society. The book goes on to talk about the history of this vein of technology and its implications both now and in the future. It does a very good job describing different aspects of the technology, such as computer languages and circuit boards, in a way that a causal reader could understand. The book also contained sections telling about the history of different aspects of technology and ideas on what technology might bring in the future.The author, Gershenfeld, is a professor at MIT. He is the head of the Center for Bits and Atoms where he works in concert with physicists, computer scientists and members of other disciplines to use fab labs to help aspiring engineers and other individuals to solve individual and communal problems. Interdepartmental research has been a very important aspect in the development of personal fabricators (PF). Gershenfeld has a distinct bias towards MIT as it is his workplace but MIT also creates the perfect atmosphere for the development of PFs because of the researchers there understand the importance of interdepartmental cooperation.Throughout the book Gershenfeld displays his quest for knowledge and his desire to help people. He has used the fab labs to empower under-privileged inventors and make their dreams realities. The fab labs have empowered girls in urban Boston by giving them the opportunity to use the fab lab to create products to sell out of recycled trash. They made jewelry out of recycled trash and made $100 in one day at a high-tech craft sale.This book is targeted for an audience interested in learning about technology, particularly an audience that does not already know the details behind it. The book was written as a narrative to describe what personal fabrication is, how it was developed, and how it is helping society today.The material in the book is somewhat out dated, being from the early 2000s but the themes and anecdotes are still wonderful. It would be fascinating to see how far the technology for personal fabricators has progressed since the book was written and to hear about how they have helped out it the world recently.The book was split into four main sections. The first section described how the public interest in personal fabrication developed. The chapters were not numbered instead they were designated by short blurbs. The first chapter \\"How to make...\\" described the idea of personal fabrication and how it was introduced to the general public as a class called \\"How to make ( almost) anything.\\" The next chapter \\"...Almost anything\\" told four stories of the successful innovation shown by the students of that class when allowed free reign of a fab lab.The second main section was titled \\"The Past.\\" It detailed a brief history of technology and told of the people who made important contributions to technology. The next chapter \\"Hardware\\" told how the original process for bringing a product to completion was very complicated with a different computer program for each step of the process. This lead Gershenfeld to create a CAD program that rolled all programs into one better, more useable interface.The third main section \\"The Present\\" talked about the people who made individualized products with the MIT fab labs, how they made them and why they chose the products they did. The chapter \\"Subtraction\\" described the different tools used in subtractive machining such as a sign cutter, laser cutter, water-jet cutter, and NC mills. The chapter after that \\"Growing Inventors\\" told about three different people who used fab labs to help their under privileged communities. The next chapter \\"Additional\\" told about methods for fabrication that add on material instead of taking it away such as equality fabrication, vacuum forming, blow molding, injection molding and 3D printing. In the chapter after that \\"Building models\\" three people used the fab lab to produce digital and physical models to help streamline architectural projects. \\"Description\\" described the software and other techniques used to describe the project designs. The chapter \\"Playing at Work\\" told the stories of four people who used fab labs to create objects that were used as building blocks for other inventions. \\"Computation\\" detailed the difference between a microcontroller and a microcomputer and described how one would be made and then programmed. The chapter \\"Making sense\\" told the story of a man who ran a school of engineering and invention in rural India. He had obtained a fab lab through a partnership with MIT and he and his students were able to engineer solutions to common agricultural problems. \\"Instrumentation\\" talked about how sensors are necessary to solve many of the common rural problems. The next chapter \\"Network\\" told the stories of three people who used the fab lab technology to create networks to help solve each individual's problem. The chapter \\"Communication\\" described how the computer stores data and how programmers are able to \\"translate\\" between computer language and human languages. The next chapter \\"Art and Artillery\\" talked about three people who used the fab labs to create technology that was designed to engage people communally instead of individually. The chapter \\"Interaction\\" described the interfaces between computers and humans such as screens for visual interaction and speakers for audio interaction.The fourth and final section titled \\"The Future\\" talked about what fab labs and personal fabrication will become and the final chapter \\"Joy\\" talked about Bill Joy and his warning against self-replicating machines. He believed that self-replicating nanobots could pose an enormous danger if even one of them ever was turned against the human species because just one could create a dense populate of nanobots that would be capable of turning the world a bunch of \\"gray goo.\\" In the last chapter Gershenfeld stated that while the self-replicating nanobots could be a danger, the investigation of this technology should not be restricted because that could force the investigation underground where it could be picked up by terrorists. If the investigation is continued legally, the technology will remain available to be a benefit to society.I agree that the development of technology should not be stopped by the government. I believe that scientists and engineers should be taught to think about the ethics and implications of the work they are doing and they should consider the possible uses and implications of the technology they are developing.FAB should be required reading because it is a very clear example of how computers can be used in a beneficial way to give solutions to common social problems. It is also very informative and describes the technologies in a way that is easily understood by the reader.Overall the book is informative and upbeat. It looks at how personalized fabrication can be used to help manufacture the solutions to problems in underprivileged communities. Fab labs are wonderful because they provide opportunities for scientists who are religious (and those who are kindhearted) to live out their faith by taking care of the widows and orphans. Personal fabrication will open a whole new era in invention and will expedite finding solutions to common socio-economic problems of today."},{"Title":"FAB: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop--From Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication","review":"Ahead of its time and prophetic although as the author suggests, he was standing in the midst of that reality rising up. The book is kind of all over the map, but the stuff on personal fabrication was great, especially given when it was written.Things move fast today. While this book seems bit unfocused in a few respects it is razor sharp on the title. All of the digital revolution at the end connects to the world of atoms. We come full circle in one sense that it is back to individual artisans and craftspeople. However, each person is has a world class and ever advancing workshop and factory and distribution arm. And they can do it all from anywhere with no investment. Free software connected to both a global marketplace, delivery service and the ability to manufacture almost anything for very little touching nothing but a computer. Amazing.Makers: The New Industrial Revolutionis a 2012 look at this same revolution.Makers is great but is highlighting the same revolution as this in 2005. Still a great book and led to this one.

It is a short couple of pages on student projects from pupils of the author. Each 2 pages is a different project and summary, usually with a picture. That's ok, but it isn't the most exciting book then. The focus changes completely to just a list of ideas. Some are exciting, some are kinda boring.

This book is more of a sumation of some of the possibilities that microfabrication can bring to the world. This was a very good read and is inspiring to those with imagination. Well, if you don't have imagination, you probably aren't going to do too well when microfabrication tech truely becomes much more mainstream in the next 10 years--and it is coming despite any unenlightened assertions to the contrary. The 3D printing technology is already being proven and people with brains realize how fast printing technology comes down in price.Also, I've seen a computer controlled wood milling machine on the market for under 2k now; metal milling won't be too far behind. A clever person could put such things to good use in a small business framework.If you have an imagination, this book will be a good read.

You know the drill (pun intended): find the undisocvered player, take a sizeable position, add time, get rich.What I got I felt were a lot of examples about how fab students were able to get new technology to do new and interesting things, but if you're already a high tech version of a shade tree inventor this book leaves something to be desired. Good read, sure. But if you go sit under your own idea tree to come up with new things (starting with \\"what's the problem?\\") then the book may not give you enough beef. Questing for places online that are making the turn into desktop fab on a commercial scale to web-fab to desktop fab - such as [...] - are likely to result from more online searching.

The book is a historical summary of the work that MIT labs did. Neil got his PhD in Physics from Cornell University, dabbled into Computer Programming, examples were on C programming and some Assembly Language codes. It is easy to impress physics students these topics. But all computer students learn C and Assembly in the 1970s. They have very limited use today. Most of the equipment, laser cutters, and others were used in the 1960s. Yes, they may be useful in India, Ghana, but Norway?Fast forward to 2007, Microsoft is doing C# (sharp) .NET programming, Windows Vista and Office 2007. Jobs are created to support all these new softwares. With globalization and outsourcing, USA manufacturing jobs are done to 23% and service sector jobs are 77%.With NSF grants and student enthusiasm, Neil's CBA reseach continues. But MIT graduates do not get jobs in manufacturing or personal fabrications. They mostly find work in programming, business systems, or work in the financial sector in NYC. Is FAB a good training for these jobs?Conclusion, it is great that we can bring manufacturing back, but the reality is: FAB is not happening in USA any time soon."},{"Title":"FAB: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop--From Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication","review":"I'd like to know why my daughter's experience at Fab Lab was used in this book without my consent? Let's see, she's been attending Fab Lab on Saturdays during the school year for 2years now. Why didn't that warrant a request or prompt someone to inform me of what's going on. She is a minor. I also read the section of the book that she's mentioned in and the information is inaccurate."},{"Title":"FAB: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop--From Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication","review":"This book brings welcome attention to the neglected field of personal, general-purpose manufacturing. He argues that the technology is at roughly the stage that computing was when minicomputers were the leading edge, is good enough to tell us something about how full-fledged assemblers as envisioned by Drexler will be used, and that the main obstacle to people using it to build what they want is ignorance of what can be accomplished.The book presents interesting examples of people building things that most would assume were beyond their ability. But he does not do a good job of explaining what can and can't be accomplished. Too much of the book sounds like a fund-raising appeal for a charity, describing a needy person who was helped rather than focusing on the technology or design process. He is rather thoughtless about choosing what technical details to provide, giving examples of assembly language (something widely known, and hard enough to use that most of his target users will be deterred from making designs which need it), but when he describes novel ideas such as \\"printing\\" a kit that can be assembled into a house he is too cryptic for me to guess whether that method would improve on standard methods.I've tried thinking of things I might want to build, and I'm usually no closer to guessing whether it's feasible than before I read the book. For example, it would be nice if I could make a prototype of a seastead several feet in diameter, but none of the examples the book gives appear to involve methods which could make sturdy cylinders or hemispheres that large.The index leaves much to be desired - minicomputers are indexed under computers, and open source is indexed under software, when I expected to find them under m and o.And despite the lip service he pays to open source software, the CAM software he wrote comes with a vague license that doesn't meet the standard definition of open source."},{"Title":"FAB: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop--From Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication","review":"In general the book was interesting, however it seemed unfocused. Often Gershenfeld seemed to be rambling from one point to another without a logical transition. Indeed, sometimes a whole section seemed to lack a discreet point, but instead was just a series of observations.If you enjoy the topic the book will be interesting, but it lacks enough detail to be useable as a reference and the writing isn't quite focused enough to be IMHO a good read."},{"Title":"FAB: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop--From Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication","review":"As noted by other reviews, the begining of the book is quite an eye opener. The examples are excellent, but the book lacks focus and deeper research into what is being done by parties to come up with a personal fab lab that as individuals we can, lets say, \\"print\\" our personalized whole shirts, coats, shoes and beyond and when. What I like most in the book is the idea of teaching students hands on. I hope educators and politicians take this seriously, since hands-on-see-the-result inspires kids to pursue science and technology.

The first 17 pages and the chapter on \\"The Future\\" was almost worth the price of the book because of its more advanced and stimulating content, however the middle 95% of the book is a rehash of decades old computer and manufacturing technology. While the book is a good introduction for kids and people new to computer technology... Explaining ASCII, 1s/0s, quoting: \\"RISC design...that doesn't mean they are dangerous...\\", an Engineer will glaze over (even with our propensity for \\"dry\\" work as noted by Gershenfeld in the text).In reference to hydroelectric production in Ghana... \\"In 1996 about one gigawatt was produced for the whole country...\\". I would have hoped that author or some of the more clever MIT grad student proofreaders would have had the knowledge and/or diligence to differentiate between power and energy. GW-H maybe? (Myhrvold...did you open this book?)I also feel Neil's disdain of \\"shady business\\" capitalism does his students and world citizens a disservice. Money is neutral, neither good or bad, proper management can do good things. Journalists only publish the evil that discourages. Basic business mgmt certainly isn't rocket science. I would call for the Academic Community to get involved in active competitive entrepreneurship...and be the beacon in the wilderness.My disatisfaction was complete with the PC reference to how the advent of firearms was an \\"immoral\\" change on the battlefield...(as if murder by a closer sword was somehow moral). But the amusing part was where he later recounted a technology briefing with military/industrial complex Generals. One suggested that the fab technology should be controlled/export limited. The author was on the side that controls on his technology should not be instituted...as he agreed that the \\"bad guys would get their hands on it regardless of any attempted limits...\\" I somehow suspect that Neil is not a card carrying NRA member marching to preserve the 2nd Amendment and would still find a way to argue that a \\"fabbed\\" instrument of death is \\"moral\\" in comparison to my (locked up, but very capable) home defense Beretta. Nothing like holding two opposing thoughts in one mind.After being teased then insulted...I am left just seeing the missed opportunity for something concrete that would move our country ahead...other than book profits.Even though I can't afford to send my budding ME student to MIT, it is nice that we both can occasionally get to look at the OpenClassWare being sent overseas to our competitors for free.

I'm constantly searching for new topics and this week I did technology. Fab was a natural, so I finally read it.I found the book inspiring, entertaining, and exciting. The only downer, for me, was that his historical analysis was pretty shallow, but then I've studied a lot of history, especially the history of technology.His approach to getting the fab technology out in the field so that people without much access to the latest stuff can fabricate things they need felt right on to me.Oh yes, and he does explain how to fabricate larger stuff, using what he calls a \\"turtle.\\" Apparently you can program a device to crawl around and mark out on a surface the shape you need, which can then be cut out using the appropriate tools.Deborah"},{"Title":"FAB: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop--From Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication","review":"I had great expectations for this book. I had heard this book was about a new revolutionary idea, that we could all have the same level of production that big factories had, but we could have them in our garage. This sounded like a cool idea.Unfortunately this book doesn't do a great job of presenting the idea. The idea may be true, but this book wanders around from topic to topic. On page 56 the author says the book can be several things, advice for new business development, help for policy makers, and provide direction for technologists. This lack of focus dilutes the message of the book. Unfortunately the book only provides a few basic ideas and doesn't explore in depth the implications.There were a number of errors in recounting history. For example on page 82 the author implies that the British were still conducting slave trade at the turn of the 20th century. I also found it disturbing that the author felt it was reasonable that silk weavers destroyed the looms that were taking away their jobs. So if some new technology threatens ones livelihood, it is OK to break and burn. With this attitude we never would have adopted the plow.The central argument of the book seems a bit weak to me. As the power to produce becomes cheaper, I am sure there will be some changes in our society. But just because someone can have the power to produce a car in their garage doesn't mean very many people will produce their own car. The economics of personal production were not effectively address. We've had the personal production capabilities for building our own clothes for decades, but very few people use sewing machines to create their own clothes.On the plus side the book does read quickly. There are some interesting ideas.

The MIT FABLabs have been set up in a number of places around the world and this book tells us of the experiences that MIT students, et al, have undergone in setting them up and the things that they find people interested in making.There is nothing in this book about other people's developments in personal fabrication (such as Fab@home or RepRap) but these may have occurred after the book was written.All in all the book is a useful starting point introducing people to the perhaps novel idea of personal manufacturing, a growing field of endeavour."},{"Title":"FAB: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop--From Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication","review":"Following along on the latest \\"Maker\\" phenomenon this book gives a very upbeat blueprint for the future. Upbeat unless you are a large scale manufacturer.This book describes a project out of MIT to put the means of custom manufacture in the hands of everyone. And I do mean everyone. They have taken their scheme to the African continent, the most remote parts of India and the urban centers of the US.The premise is that small scale, custom manufacturing of any level of technology serves best when put into the hands of those who will us that technology.Perhaps the most refreshing fact revealed by this book is that the process was two way.

The term is used very sparingly in the Code. Theoretically, there should be no potential difference between the neutral conductor and ground.\\" In fact, in the 2005 NEC Handbook, it is used twice in Article 100, and 644 times overall. (It appears 315 times in the NEC itself.) Further, the neutral is not always grounded. In a large sidebar in Article 200 of the Handbook, it states \\"The grounded conductor is often, but not always, the neutral conductor. For example, in a single-phase 2-wire or in a 3-phase corner-grounded delta system, the intentionally grounded conductor is not a neutral conductor.\\" The author seems to have an inadequate grasp of his topic, both conceptually and factually.

Both my husband and I read it in one sitting. The plot was compelling, a real roller coaster ride with lots of complications and surprises.The characters were real and likable. I particularly liked the interactions between Klein and MacClough, and the bedroom scenes with Kira were...umm...attention getting!

As Americans increasingly get wired up, the major parties are increasingly using the Internet to build up and expand their base. Plus, it enables challengers like Howard Dean to aggressively solicit supporters.All these give an affirmative to the broad thrust of the book's speculations. It does indeed appear that the Internet/Web is an enabling of far broader grassroots participation in democracy.When the book discusses the live broadcasting of the British Parliament on TV, it turns out such events have had lesser impact on people. Partly because, like the radio broadcasts which British and Australian Parliaments have had for years, these attract only a small audience of diehards.In part, this might be due to those being broadcast media. Whereas, with the interactive nature of the Internet, with things like email, to some people this may be far more attractive."},{"Title":"Gun Crazy (BFI Film Classics)","review":"Kitses, a film professor at San Francisco State and author of the seminal Western study &quot;Horizons West,&quot; brings his full powers to bear on this, one of the finest B-movies ever made. Alternating between film history and textual analysis, Kitses weaves a brief but rich story of the unlikely genesis of an American cult classic. He also provides revealing insights on the film's relationships to the western genre. One of the best in the BFI Film Classics series"},{"Title":"Gun Crazy (BFI Film Classics)","review":"When I popped \\"Gun Crazy\\" into my DVD player a while back, I was just hoping for an entertaining \\"B-movie\\" experience... you know, guns, crooks on the lam, a tempress who tries to be good but just can't, all that kind of stuff. So I was quite surprised that, in addition to getting all those things, I also got an extremely well crafted, excellently directed film with great performances and complex things to say about guns, the American dream, child psychology, and gender roles. It was a great film. So, I wasn't surprised to later see that the British Film Institute produced one of its thin BFI Classics volumes about \\"Gun Crazy\\". Written by film scholar Jim Kitsis, this is a great examination of the movie and very entertaining to read. I particularly liked the 5-page or so postscript, which describes the author's visit to the home of Peggy Cummins, the female lead in the film, in 1995. Ms. Cummins shares lots of great stories about the film with the author, as well as her reactions to the author's opinions about the film. A highly recommended little book for those who enjoyed \\"Gun Crazy\\"."},{"Title":"Gun Crazy (BFI Film Classics)","review":"Within the first few pages of BFI's GUN CRAZY we have Jim Kitses making stylistic analogies between this intriguing film and CITIZEN KANE--and the provocative comments keep coming. Originally bogged down in the title DEADLY IS THE FEMALE, GUN CRAZY has gain much-deserved status with the passage of time. Kitses credits French writers with the first in-depth study of this cult classic, a film largely forgotten and ignored by Americans until the release of BONNIE AND CLYDE. He gives excellent information about the film noir genre, discussing its inherent symbolism and iconography (rain, deserted street, stranger and policeman), and even demonstrates how Gene Kelly turned all of this on its head during the uber-famous SINGIN' IN THE RAIN number. Specifically, he views the protaganists of GUN CRAZY as figures reminiscent of the Old West, their hyper-developed sense of individualism at odds with the hum-drum status quo--which, naturally, makes them noir, too. Particularly worthwhile is Kitses' handling of Bart Tare's fanatical relationship with guns, a topic the film never quite explains. Of course, censorship problems are addressed, with excerpts from various letters from the dubious Breen Office. The romantic coupling of Tare and Laurie Starr, a genuine love match, is dealt with at length and with sensitivity--they're not your usual noir couple. The book concludes with Kitses' recap of his meeting with Peggy Cummings, who played Laurie Starr. It's a charming anecdote to top off an excellent study of the wonderful film called GUN CRAZY."},{"Title":"Gun Crazy (BFI Film Classics)","review":"Jim Kitses did a wonderful job of remembering this great, great film, which was magnificently directed by Joseph H.

What it lacks in flash, though, it more than makes up for in well-researched content.Besides chapter-length descriptions of 16 Buddhist pilgrimage sites as they exist today, Australian monk Venerable S Dhammika has also included historical descriptions as written by Buddhist pilgrims of the 4th, 7th, 13th, and 19th centuries, giving the reader an idea of how these sites once thrived, declined and disappeared, and were finally rediscovered. Among the pilgrims Dhammika quotes are Chinese, Tibetan and Korean scholars, as well as the English archaeologists who unearthed these forgotten towns and monuments.Featuring black-and-white maps of each of the towns and their archaeological parks, the book includes chapters (ordered chronologically to follow the Buddha's life) on: Lumbini, Kapilavatthu, Bodh Gaya, Saranth, Gaya, Rajagaha, Nalanda, Patna, Vesali, Kosambi, Madhura, Gurpa, Lauriya Nandanger, Barabar and Nagarjuni Hills, Savatthi, Kusinagar.This is _the_ guidebook for the English-speaking pilgrim.#"},{"Title":"Middle Land, Middle Way","review":"-I returned from a pilgrimage to the sites mentioned in this guide and found this book especially useful. If you do not have a great deal of time for your pilgrimage, the value of the pilgrimage will be vastly increased by a suitable guidebook. This is one of the best, and can be used as a take-along book to each site you visit (you can also read ahead as you travel in India). The book is significantly smaller than the other guidebook I would recommend, called Along the Path. Compared with Along the Path, Middle Land leaves out most suttas and does not give as much general tourist information or as much information for other sites that may be of interest (such as Delhi or Pune), but you can carry Middle Path more easily in your purse or pocket. The two books make a nice complement and I would recommend them both. Incidentally, I would strongly recommend a pilgrimage through an organized Buddhist tour group (you can find information in many Buddhist journals although your should research them appropriately) rather than doing it on your own, unless you have considerable time.The author's credentials are excellent and he obviously loves his subject. I wish you well on your pilgrimage (either physically or as you travel in your imagination)."},{"Title":"Middle Land, Middle Way","review":"This is the only book that takes the reader on a pilgrimage of Buddhist India and doesn't conflate legend with history.

After their parents divorce, the gap between the girls' personalities--Mary the kindly extrovert, and Gretchen the malcontent--seem to widen. Gretchen spends more and more time confiding in her father's last gift, a beautiful doll who eeriely resembles the blond, blue-eyed twins. The doll, created by a Mexican dollmaker and bruja of great power, was created in order to grant a little girl's fondest wish, but Gretchen's only wish is to destroy her sister.The writing in this one is careful and direct, and the storyline a lovely, wicked twist on the whole good twin/bad twin and evil doll genre. Characters are drawn in broad and sometimes overly heavy strokes, but otherwise come across the page with wonderful individualism. The horror is not all supernatural: the sibling rivalry between Gretchen and Mary is often cruelly, painfully close to home, as is the nastiness of their parents' divorce, the panic of a narrowly averted non-custodial abduction, and the playground taunting against outcast Gretchen. Gretchen herself is a treat, coming across as both a lonely little girl and Rhoda from The Bad Seed. For a fan of the classic genre horror, it's definitely worth hunting for."},{"Title":"Doll/The","review":"Well it's not your typical \\"evil doll\\" tale, where it becomes animated and starts chasing people around with sharp knives. (As the cover would have you believe) Rather the story focuses on ten year-old twin girls, one good and one evil, this IS still a horror story after all.The doll is manufactured in one of those Cabbage Patch hospitals reminiscent of the 80's. For some reason there is a separate division, this was a very weak part of the story, in which the \\"dollmaker\\" an Incan priestess, manufactures her own special dolls and imbues them with certain powers. They have the ability to achieve the owner's deepest desires. So before you can say \\"Chuckie Rules,\\" the doll falls into the eager hands of the evil twin who uses it to make her sister's life miserable...even unto death!\\"The Doll\\" was such an enjoyable, quick read that I can forgive the underdeveloped \\"dollmaker\\" character."},{"Title":"Doll/The","review":"wow, other reviewers are really giving you the whole story. well, i won't. there are two twins and a mother. one twin (daddy's girl) receives a doll which has gone through a magical ritual. but it's not the common evil doll or evil twin story. it's perhaps a mix of both, sort of (you'll see) making it more original then it seems.

Or did it? This is the disturbing question raised by Delaney. He studies the legal apparatus in various American states, from before the Civil War to 1948. The largely successful attempts by segregationists to codify segregation into statutes is a disturbing echo of what the South African apartheid government was to do between 1948 and 1994.The book shows struggles by different parties in the US, spanning decades, on how physical racial segregation in neighbourhoods was mostly achieved.

Ultimately, it is a summary that will lead you (if you have the interest) to do further research.I do not believe that the story on gas turbines is yet fully told and there is still room for much more innovation in many areas, not least of which are the fuels, combustors and materials. It may yet have a &#34;George Jetson&#34; future, I for one hope it does."},{"Title":"Citadel of Dreams (Doctor Who)","review":"I won't give a summary of this book, i will only suggest that you read it. After reading 'citadel of dreams' i have become a dave stone fan. I'm now reading 'the slow empire' which is also quite excellent. But 'citadel of dreams' is very special, its odd to find a really good writer in the world of serial fiction but dave stone is the exception. i personally loved the mad hatter tea party scene, with the doctor camped out under an umbrella behind the tardis...perfectly in character with the sylvester mccoy doctor!!"},{"Title":"Citadel of Dreams (Doctor Who)","review":"It seemed appropriate that Dave Stone's CITADEL OF DREAMS would have a foreword by Andrew Cartmel, as a number of elements in the novella reminded me of the latter's own Doctor Who books. The Seventh Doctor is used quite sparingly, and is only really onscreen for a handful of pages. The book deals with psychic powers, something that Cartmel was fond of employing (in his fiction, I mean). Ace has a house, not totally unlike the dwelling at Allen Road that serves as her base of operations. And, of course, there's the old Cartmel standby: people soiling themselves. Oh dear; maybe some things would be better left unstolen.But superficial comparisons to Andrew Cartmel's work aside, I really found myself enjoying this. Of the Dave Stone books I've read so far, I would rate this as probably his strongest work. It contains a lot of the sort of thing that we've seen before from Stone, but it feels fresh and not at all tired. I get the impression that the shorter size of the novella format caused Stone to rely on his strengths. And as I'm someone who appreciates those strengths but fears his self-indulgences, I was grateful for that.The story concerns a city -- a city that we see from two separate time zones. At first, we aren't sure exactly how far apart temporally these two eras are. In one time, labeled &quot;before&quot;, we see a run-down, decaying inner city, with random crime and brutal, unfeeling authorities. In the &quot;after&quot; zone, there exists a utopia of sorts. But the people there seem to possess whacking great holes in their knowledge. The reader is lead through the mystery via a character named Joey Quine, who lives in the &quot;before&quot; time and has strange psychic abilities.I really enjoyed the parts of the story told from Quine's point of view. The sections concerning him coming to terms with and then taking advantage of his own unique mental abilities are told with sensitivity and style. This sort of thing could easily have been hooky and clich&eacute;d, but Dave Stone did a really good job, and frankly, I'm surprised; I didn't think he was capable of pulling it off.It's extremely well paced; I managed to read the entire thing in one sitting while looking to kill some time before (what turned out to be) the final Baltimore Ravens game of the 2003 season (sob!). The plot is not easy to follow, but rewarding when it all comes together at the end. I thought I was clever by spotting the book's Big Surprise by the midway point, but looking at reviews on the 'net, apparently everyone else figured it out too. I should mention that guessing what the twist was didn't diminish anything, as seeing how the story got there was still fun.Of course, some of Dave Stone's more annoying authorial tendencies are also on display here. He has a habit of throwing italics around with abandon to emphasize particular words, rather than structuring the sentence in such a way that the word is highlighted by the grammar instead of the font. (You know the type of thing I'm talking about. Pg 34: &quot;...it was hard to even *think* about it in terms of description...&quot; Pg 31: &quot;...there were certain obvious things he *could* do...&quot; Pg 77: &quot;...certain things that she *liked* about this world...&quot;) Although I find this annoying, repetitive and lazy, I'm not usually bothered by it when used in moderation. But here Stone seems to rely too heavily on this voice, using it sometimes three times a page. And, I swear, if Stone ever again describes an alien as being &quot;too different to describe&quot; or &quot;something which the human brain cannot possibly understand&quot;, I'll jump out the window. Okay, so Stone obviously can't describe an &quot;otherness&quot; concept without falling back on the same stock phrases. But can't we create some new stock phrases? Please?Overall, I enjoyed CITADEL OF DREAMS. It tells a good story quickly. Although the beginning is slow to get started, by the end the plot is bouncing along. It's a great way to spend a few hours; I just hope it brings you better luck than it brought me."},{"Title":"Citadel of Dreams (Doctor Who)","review":"The second Telos book is a poor follow-up to the opening adventure of this range Time and Relative.I have never been a fan of Dave Stone since I thought his stories are too weird for my taste.Like Time and Relative, the Doctor hardly appears at all in this book.While Time and Relative focussed heavily on Susan, Citadel of Dreams does not give the same treatment to Ace.Citadel of Dreams instead focusses on a character called Joey Quine.After reading the book I was completely baffled on what the story is about. If you had better luck understanding the story then congratulations."},{"Title":"God's Psychiatry","review":"The book &quot;God's Psychiatry&quot; is the most empowering book I have ever read. Through the understading of the 23rd Psalm, The Ten Commandents, The Lord's prayer, and the Beatitudes I found a much clearer understanding of who God is and my relationship with him. I am much more confident and happy for having read this book and I believe that any Christian who has ever been wounded in mind or spirit would benefit from this book. I have ordered three more copies of this book which I am sending to family and friends because I think it will be so helpful.I recommend this book wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"God's Psychiatry","review":"I recommend &quot;God's Psychiatry&quot; to all people, and especially to high school students.EXCERPT FROM BOOK: &quot;Temptation most often comes first as thoughts. In the secret places of our minds we dramatize and act out the thoughts. We read books that describe wickedness, we play with emotional dynamite as if it were a harmless toy. We get ourselves into dangerous situations and enjoy being there. We keep the wrong company.&quot;This book was copyrighted in 1953 and is still relative today; school violence. We can add television shows, movies, video games, internet sites, music videos, and more to the list of misused media outlets. We keep the wrong company and sometimes don't even realize the lust for temptation in our hearts. &quot;God's Psychiatry&quot; is a plain written companion to the reading of the scriptures. Thank you God for enabeling Charles L. Allen to produce this work. Amen."},{"Title":"God's Psychiatry","review":"This is a simple book that outlines the Bible's rules for mental health. It starts with an enlightened interpretation of Psalm 23 (The lord is my sheperd...)and moves on to the Ten Commandments, The Lord's Prayer, and the Beatitudes found in Matthew.What is most impressive about this book is that it sticks to the true meaning of the scriptures without getting too caught up in the author's own opinion. The author's insights and examples shed light on how these writings apply to today's problems. This book was written in 1953 and is still fresh, today. This short, practical book is the most useful self-help book that I've ever read (and I've read a bunch). You'll marvel at how these simple truths can really change your life."},{"Title":"God's Psychiatry","review":"I have read this book over and over and have continued to be inspired and uplifted in my Christian walk. I have taken notes and probably copied down a third of the text and committed it to heart. I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in psychiatry or desiring a closer relationship with God and your fellow man. After all, we were created by God, so it's not surprising that life changing rules come from Him and His Word. I believe all successful psychiatry could be traced to the principles found in the Bible"},{"Title":"God's Psychiatry","review":"We're reminded that as Christians, God is with us and &quot;There is power in His presence.&quot; God is active in the lives of believers. He told us He would be. &quot;Ability, talents, opportunity, material resources are really not ours. They are God's investments in us. And like any wise investor, God expects dividends,&quot; the author tell us. What He expects, we're told, for one thing, is to serve others. Bernard Shaw is quoted as saying, &quot;A gentleman is one who puts more into life than he takes out.&quot;The next time you're unjustly criticized, consider what he says about the source of such comments. &quot;It is a sure sign of an inferiority complex when a person tells of the faults of another.&quot;On significance, he tells us that no one was born apart from the will of God, that we existed in the mind of God before we were physically formed in the womb.Faith is a necessary component of the Christian life. William Carey is quoted from a sermon he gave in 1992, &quot;Expect great things from God, attempt great things for God.&quot;Examples of Jesus meeting practical daily needs are presented. The author couples this with inner longings and desires and writes, &quot;...He (Jesus) knows we have desires and wants beyond our bare necessities. We are not wild beasts.&quot;Near the conclusion he has a quote worth pondering. It helps a person see beyond self. Allen writes, &quot;No person ever really lives until he has found something worth dying for.&quot;This book will improve you life. It will help you to connect with everlasting realities. Its truths will transform your perceptions. You thoughts will be healthy as you medidate on its precepts."},{"Title":"God's Psychiatry","review":"I am a Licensed Professional Counselor. I first bought this book about 15 years ago. I am still buying it and giving it to my clients. My favorite part is the section on The 23 Psalm. It takes the psalm and breaks it into sections and explains what this means to the sheep. It shows the care that the Shepherd, Jesus, takes of His sheep and what effects it has on the sheep. I take the images of the Shepherd and how these actions would make the sheep feel cared for and protected and relaxed and comforted and put them into a mental picture or movie. Then when I am afraid or upset, I recite in my mind the 23 Psalm and picture the green pastures, and the still waters and the valley of the shadow of death where His rod and staff comfort me, and I am able to relax and rest in the assurance that God is in control and He is watching over me.The other sections are very good too.

We wouldn't be surprised he holds that view, he is, or was, a pastor and the son of a pastor; he's long had an opportunity to consider faith.Although there are relatively few and relatively inexhaustive reviews here, the greatest majority are enthusiastic; the book has gone through numerous editions in its nearly 60 years.If one were to try to boil down what would be helpful to know about the God we can know through the Bible, perhaps covering the 23rd Psalm, the 10 Commandments, The Lord's Prayer and the Beatitudes, as he does here, couldn't be improved upon. God as loving caretaker, as commander, as Creator Father and ultimate lover covers a lot of ground beautifully.I think the missing ingredient here is the dark side. Since Jesus himself, the opinion of non-Christians has been the impression not of mental health but insanity. Jesus had God, but he also had the cross. Paul rejoiced in suffering for God.

I learned to trust God deeper. I have learned to wait and listen to God more closely.This book spoke to me. I have since bought several copies and have given them to people I love, sharing that this touched my heart and because I love them want to share something this good and meaningful with them.I have always had a difficult relationship with my mother, and with the 10 commandments of \\"to honor your mother and father\\" has always been difficult due to past physical, emotional and spiritual abuse.I prayed on this for some time and started to really try to honor my mother, despite the past. I gave her a copy in Dec. as a Christmas gift, sharing that I was sharing this because I love her(I don't recall saying that often to her). A few months later, one night through a difficult day, I prayed, God I really would love to have a parent who shows me love and acceptance who can be there for me..that night..she changed.I couldn't believe it.I didn't trust it either, waiting for the fallout.Months later, day in and day out she is presenting as a loving, caring, nurturing mother with no request for herself.This is a God change.Since my reading of this book, I have changed myself, my life, my career,taking a leap of faith listening to direction, found the career I always dreamed of, my relationship with my mother has flipped for the good and I am a better, friend, spouse and mother..IT IS WORTH THE $6 and more.PLEASE AMAZON..KEEP THIS BOOK AVAILABLE TO OTHERS.

This book is the next best thing resurrecting Bobby. Bobby didn't write about his personal life in this book. It is subtitled \\"The Theatre in My Life\\" and that's what the book is about. Bobby was small of stature, but was a giant of the American theatre. He was an original member of the innovative Group Theatre of the 30s and then co-founded (with Elia Kazan and Cheryl Crawford) The Actors Studio. He acted and directed on Broadway and in Hollywood (during the \\"golden years\\" of both) as well as abroad. He had some big hits as a director (BRIGADOON and THE TEAHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON, to name two). But perhaps his greatest gift was that of teaching. (He taught Anne Bancroft, Maureen Stapleton and Meryl Streep, among many others.) His lectures on acting that he gave for an invited audience in the 50s were published under the title METHOD OR MADNESS and became perhaps the most influential book on acting for a whole generation. Bobby was great at using stories to make a point and this book is full of them, some of them hilarious, others unsettling. This book covers Bobby's very long career, which lasted more than fifty years. There is the usual parade of celebrities that appears in theatrical memoirs. This one has some great stories about Chaplin, Tallulah, Brando, James Dean and Marilyn Monroe, among many others. But the best parts of the book, for me, were those dealing with his philosophy of the theatre and what it ought to be. If you're serious about acting, get Bobby's METHOD OR MADNESS and ADVICE TO THE PLAYERS, too.This book had been on my shelf for about ten years, but I had never gotten around to reading it until now. What took me so long? It was very hard to tear myself away from this book and in a way I'm sorry it's over. Bobby was a great storyteller and I found his book mesmerizing. His was a great theatrical mind and this book is probably best appreciated by people who work in the theatre or seriously desire to do so. If you fall into that category, this book will remind you why you went into the theatre in the first place."},{"Title":"Conversations With Arrau","review":"First at all , I am not a Claudio Arrau fan .

Or does the human brain make use of cognitive processes that work only in specific domains? The latter alternative is called \`domain specificity' and is held to be the correct one throughout this book. The articles in the book argue for the hypothesis of domain specificity mostly from a philosophical point of view, and not a scientific one. The articles though do grant a large degree of insight into the current thinking on domain specificity. Via measurements and laboratory experiments, current research in neuroscience is beginning to shed more light on whether the brain is an \\"all-purpose\\" problem solver or a collection of independent modules geared toward specific tasks. All of the articles in the book are interesting, but only a few will be reviewed here due to reasons of space.The first article of the book, entitled \\"Toward a topography of mind: An introduction to domain specificity,\\" introduces the problem of domain specificity and how it arose historically. It is very tricky to define what a domain actually is, but the authors of this article take it up in some detail. They emphasize the Chomsky theory of natural language grammar as being one of the first most important examples of a domain-specific perspective. If the mind is modular, as Chomsky and the authors in this book assert, then damage to one module should not affect the cognitive abilities of another module. There are indications from experimental neuroscience that this is the case for abilities such as language, music, and mathematics for example. The authors mention some of this evidence in this article. Interestingly though, they believe that theories are domain specific. They argue for example, that a theory of biology cannot be applied to physics. However this is only partly true. For example, molecular biology can be interpreted completely in terms of physics. There are many other examples of theories designed for specific domains that work in others. In addition, the authors assert that theory construction is not necessary for \\"getting around the world.\\" This may be true in a certain weak sense, but finding a cure for cancer or \\"getting around\\" or traveling to other worlds requires highly sophisticated theories. The authors do however distinguish between \`scientific' theories and commonsense or \`folk' theories, the latter of which are needed in everyday life. They discuss some examples in the article that emphasize their assertion that \\"theoretical\\" beliefs are important in organizing input data. The authors also address the question of what a domain really is, noting at the same time that an explicit definition does not exist. They therefore rely on examples of domains, and characterize it as a body of knowledge that serves to identify and interpret phenomena sharing certain properties.In the second article of the book, entitled \\"The modularity of thought and the epidemiology of representations,\\" the author attempts to defend the view that thought processes themselves are also modular, and to explain his ideas on second topic in the title. The author believes that the modularity of thought is in no way incompatible with the diversity of human cultures, and much of the article is devoted to explaining why he thinks this is true. To this end, the author wants to distinguish between the \`actual' domain of a conceptual module and the \`proper' domain. The actual domain is the totality of information in the environment that satisfies the input conditions of the module. The \`proper' domain is the information that it is the module's biological function to process. The module will process information in its actual domain, regardless of whether or not this information is contained in its proper domain. This distinction the author believes will allow him to explain the wide variation in human cultures, for the actual domains have become larger than the proper domains. This allows the organization of vast amounts of information, and allows the distinguishing of what he calls \`cultural domains' of modules. For the author, an explanation of culture involves explaining why some representations become more widely distributed than others. This explanation he calls the \`epidemiology of representations', wherein information in human communities is thought of as competing for private and public space and time. Interestingly, the transmission of cultural information in his view induces in the actual domain of any module a proliferation of \`parasitic' information that acts like the proper domain of this module. He quotes music as being an example of this, but he is careful to point out that he has not supported his case in this regard by rigorous scientific evidence.In order to fit in to the evolutionary paradigm of modern science, the authors of the fourth article in the book, entitled \\"Origins of domain specificity: The evolution of functional organization\\", attempt to show how modules can be viewed as evolved adaptations. The authors emphasize very strongly the need for natural selection in explaining the existence of complex functional design, and that the evolved design of organisms is the result of events in the past and happened without anticipation of the present. Successful cognitive mechanisms of the present are the result of what has happened in the past. Domain-general mechanisms, the authors argue at length, cannot be reconciled with evolutionary biology. Generality is achieved at the price of effectiveness, and domain-specific mechanisms that are able to utilize the stable features of recurring situations will outperform general mechanisms that don't utilize these features. There are no domain-general criteria for success/failure that correlate with fitness. In addition, domain-general criteria are limited to what can be derived from perceptual information, and are subject to combinatorial explosion."},{"Title":"Mapping the Mind: Domain Specificity in Cognition and Culture","review":"While certainly putting forth a controversial view of cognition, this book includes contributions by many of the scientists in the forefront of the field, and provides a broad overview of thinking in this area.

I only wish Geoff had a second book."},{"Title":"Banjo primer","review":"Of the three banjo beginner books I purchased this is the one I find myself using most frequently.I purchased: Banjo Primer, by Geoff Hohwald; How to Play the 5-String Banjo, Third Edition (Banjo), by Pete Seeger; and Teach Yourself Bluegrass Banjo (Teach Yourself Bluegrass), by Tony Trischka.Banjo Primer is the book most easily used because it is very simple and easy to learn from. The songs that are taught take you step by step through the learning process and are played at two or three different speeds on the accompanying CD to help you progress. Even though the book is great, I find that I am going to take additional banjo lessons along with using the book, as I find myself developing bad playing habits already.These bad playing habits are covered in the book, but should be addressed by a professional teacher to help you develop good technique from the start.As far as the other books go...How to Play the 5-String Banjo, Third Edition (Banjo), by Pete Seeger, is a good book, but teaches a different style of banjo playing than most of us are familiar with. The book focuses primarily on frailing (strumming), rather than the finger-picking, Scruggs-style bluegrass that we all know. It's more \\"folky\\" oriented, but is an excellent book nonetheless. I have not really used it as a practice book, but the amount of information contained in the book about music and the history of the banjo makes it a worthwhile investment for any picker.I also purchased Teach Yourself Bluegrass Banjo (Teach Yourself Bluegrass), by Tony Trischka, because I am familiar with Tony Trischka's music, but the book seems to be geared more towards the intermediate/beginner level of playing. Once I've been taking lessons for a couple of months, I'll probably take another look at the book and use it. The CD that accompanies the book has all the songs, but because the titles are not explained as you're listening, it's easy to lose track of where you are on the CD and where you are in the book.Bottom Line: Banjo Primer, by Geoff Hohwald is a great beginner banjo book and I would recommend it to anyone who is learning to play the banjo."},{"Title":"Banjo primer","review":"So, there I was. A thirty-something workaholic looking for a new hobby to unwind a bit, but with very little in the way of musical experience. Nonetheless, inspired by a local Allison Kraus concert, I found a hot deal on a great used banjo on E-bay and I was off and running! What fun! I'm hooked on the 5-string twang!! About 3 months or so at 30-minutes a day (give or take) and I can play well enough to entertain myself - and my wife and the cat can at least stay in the same room!Not many banjo instructors in New England, so I thought I'd go in for a few good teach-yourself manuals. I bought four. In order of usefulness they were - Revised Banjo Primer by Geoff Hohwald - First Lessons Banjo by Jack Hatfied - How to Play the 5-string Banjo by Pete Seeger - How to Play Banjo by Tim Jumper.The Banjo Primer was the best of the lot. I was able to make good progress with about 30 minutes practice each day. The instructions were clear and the tunes were fun to play (Cripple Creek, Boil 'em Cabbage Down, Worried Man Blues). It was VERY helpful that the book came with a CD. Some lessons I just couldn't get until I heard them played, then they came easily. Each lesson is played at three speeds, but I've pretty much given up EVER matching the insanely fast top speed.First Lessons was next best. It also came with a useful CD with multiple speeds and I think I've at least got a shot at the top speed. It also includes tracks with only the backup musicians so you can jam on your own (I haven't reached that point yet). The choice of music wasn't as good - the intro claims that well-known songs are easier to learn, but I found them to be cliche and boring (Tom Dooley, Old Time Religion, Good Night Ladies). It was much more fun to learn a song I didn't know and finding myself actually playing something that sounds like bluegrass after the long struggle!Both books cover roughly the same techniques and both focus exclusively on Scruggs Style picking (all plucking, almost no chord strumming). It's turning into my favorite style. But my goal is to play well enough to sit in on a local bluegrass jam, so I've also started to learn other styles (e.g. frailing) that will let me strum on chords in the background to build confidence. For that I need other books, but so far I haven't found a good one.By all accounts, Pete Seeger's book seems to be the classic in the field. It started as a set of hand copied notes and it really is lots of fun to read. I hope that once I improve a bit more I'll be able to get more out of it. My guess is that its the book you'd want if you already had a community of pickers around to lend advice and guidance. As a teach-yourself manual though, I'm finding it tough going.How to Play Banjo is the worst of the lot. To my untrained eye it seems more like a guitar book than a bluegrass banjo book. The focus is on chords and strumming (which is good for my next step I suppose), but it's just boring. The instruction is minimal and the music uninteresting, at least to me. I tried several times to get into it but found myself quickly going back to the other manuals when I realized I was no longer looking forward to my practice times. I finally threw in the towel on this one when I used it to try to learn &quot;frailing&quot;. I like to think I'm a smart guy, but I just didn't get it. And I don't think it was me. Maybe if it came with a CD that I could listen to I could work it out. I'm now in the market for an alternative, but in the meantime I'll keep pickin' with the Scruggs Style.One last bit of advice. I highly recommend getting at least two books. I found myself much more motivated jumping back and forth between the Primer and First Lessons - when one got too hard or too boring, I'd work on the other for a few days. A great trick to keep from getting stuck. I'm in the market for some &quot;intermediate&quot; books next and I'll probably take the same approach.Happy Picking!!"},{"Title":"Banjo primer","review":"I ordered several banjo books, and this was the best. The author doesn't waste my time by trying to teach me &quot;Mary had a little lamb&quot; or &quot;She'll be coming around the mountain&quot;. Instead, good bluegrass tunes are taught almost from the start. The companion CD is excellent, in that it has each song played at 4 speeds, the last being at full speed with a band. 3 weeks later, I'm doing pretty good! I do recommend that you pick up a metronome though..."},{"Title":"Banjo primer","review":"I bought Geoff's Banjo Primer DVD and after working through that looked at the book and wish I had bought that instead.I'm dusting off my Banjo after about 20 years (I never did really learn much before) within a week was able to play the first four songs on the DVD (which I think are also the first four in the book) at Geoff's fast pace. I would expect a musically inclined beginner to spend a few months learning this material. At the end of it, you probably won't be ready to hop into a jam session or anything, but that's not to be expected of a primer.My only complaint is that Geoff presents each song in two speeeds (on the video at least and presumable on the CD as well) which are good learning speeds. He then gives the song at \\"medium jam speed\\" which is so fast I can't even begin to play it. Lots of practice doesn't seem to be moving me much in that direction and I wish he had given a few tips on speeding up once all of the songs are learned.The DVD doesn't seem to add a lot of value over the book (based on browsing the book in the store) and you will get several more songs with the book / CD combo than on the DVD."},{"Title":"Banjo primer","review":"This is an excellent book for beginning banjo players. The song arrangements are broken down by measures, which are practiced at different speeds. This approach demystifies the rather complicated-looking tableture. Eventually, the author combines the measures into their respective songs, which are also played at several speeds on the CD. Learning a specific lick for a specific song helps give me focus during my practice sessions."},{"Title":"Banjo primer","review":"This book is pretty good, with lots of information. The CD is a little discouraging, though, to a beginner. He plays the songs REALLY slow, and then kinda slow at a good \\"I've-played-the-guitar-for-years-but-never-the-banjo\\" beginner pace, but then the third time he calls \\"medium jam speed\\" and the implication of that is he would like to take it faster, but he's holding back for your benefit. The problem is it's about 20 times faster than the previous speed and he also doesn't play in the same rhythm, but adds some swing to it or something, so it's pretty hard to follow. Bottom line, this book/CD set is not step by step, but there's nothing like hours of repetitive practice to get you up to speed!"},{"Title":"Banjo primer","review":"I have no doubt Hohwald is a great banjo player, but he makes an awful teacher. The Banjo Primer only gives a sentence or two for each lesson, even the more complicated ones. Reading that something is \\"fairly difficult to perform\\" or \\"requires practice\\" doesn't really help the newbie who needs more information on WHY he's doing these exercises in the first place. The songs are fun, but the tab is incredibly lazy and does a horrible job describing the rhythm of the song. Hear it for yourself by listening to the audio CD: the recordings go from very slow to medium to melt-your-face-off fast (which Hohwald calls \\"medium\\" jam speed--thanks for that). Not only that, you're only hearing the real rhythm of the song at full-speed jam tempo; the slower versions don't have that bluegrass swing and just sound like extended versions of the exercises.I was very excited about learning the banjo and thought the Primer would be a good companion in lieu of a real-life instructor (I live in one of the states where you'd MOST expect to find a banjo teacher, but alas, if they're out there, they aren't speaking up). Instead, I've become increasingly frustrated with the lack of direction in the book and the knowledge that I can never master these great songs the way they were MEANT to be played. When I perform for my friends, I know the song must sound strange since the rhythm is pretty much a combination of improv and my best guesses. But I will continue to practice until I find something better."},{"Title":"Banjo primer","review":"The cd that comes with it is so scratched it cant be played so to me the book is useless and I have wasted my money"},{"Title":"Banjo primer","review":"I purchased Janet Davis' Teach Yourself Banjo book as well as the first DVD of the Murphy Method.

It certainly helps to be able to read, hear, and see the lesson.

Having worked in the field of quality assurance and testing for more than ten years, I can say that the author hits on many elements that I often see not practiced in various organizations and that should be. The &quot;Item&quot;-focused nature of the chapters (providing the fifty steps) are a great way to present this material and bring in mind, to this reader, Steve McConnell's &quot;Rapid Development&quot;, which did the same thing for development-related concerns. I had always wondered why the testing field did not have a book like that and now it does.If I had to pick one nitpick (and in the grand scheme of things it is probably a relatively small one), one thing I could probably do without was the use of the word &quot;nonfunctional testing&quot;. That is, unfortunately, a term all too often used in the discipline of testing and it should not be. For example, performance testing in the book is placed under the &quot;nonfunctional&quot; category and yet it is all about functionality: how quickly the functionality performs! The same thing with security: this is about how secure the application/site functions! (In other words, how secure the functionality is.) So this term is, I feel, incorrectly applied and as such will be used by more and more testers and this is often the stumbling block because usage of the term &quot;non-functional&quot; really often covers up what are, in effect, quality requirements and cost constraints. With that said, however, the material under the section on non-functional testing is well laid-out and is accurate in every respect, as far as I was concerned.The breakdown of the book in terms of chapters and then items within the chapters is right on the money. And some of the items are wonderful kernels of knowledge that all testers should keep in mind. For example, Item 17 is &quot;Verify that the System Supports Testability&quot;. This is a key concept that way too many testers seem to forget about early on and then have to deal with the ramifications of explaining why they cannot adequately test something later on. Yet another excellent element is Item 22, &quot;Derive Effective Test Cases from Requirements&quot;. My immediate thought is: okay, but what if there are no requirements? Well, the author covers that very point in an excellent manner. In fact that is what all the items do: they provide a solid reference point for a variety of topics that can be researched by the conscientious tester or analyst. This book is a distillation of a broad array of concepts, from requirements analysis to automated testing tools to evaluating how effective a tester is. This wide scope will, I think, give the book a broad appeal and it serves to make it clear that there is quite a bit going on in the world of testing.Overall, I think this is an excellent reference book for the average test group within an organization and is certainly worth having in your library if you in any way deal with the world of quality assurance or quality testing. It is rare that I give any book five stars (much less a testing book) but this one deserves it. Will you be an effective tester with this book? That all depends on how you apply what it talks about. But I can almost guarantee you will be an ineffective tester if you do not take much of what this book has to say seriously. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Effective Software Testing: 50 Specific Ways to Improve Your Testing","review":"My review of this book is based on my having recently read several others about software testing. In particular, \\"Test-Driven Development: By Example\\" by Kent Beck, where the basic premise is that the tests are written either before or simultaneously with the code. I have long believed that this approach is the best way to create quality code and I am skeptical about any other testing approach. The plans in this book can be considered as a broad overview of the testing strategy rather than down into the specifics of how to write tests for specific blocks of code.Many of the examples are in the realm of the obvious, but not always clearly implemented. For example, number 17 is \\"Verify that the system supports testability\\" and number 31is \\"Know the different types of testing-support tools.\\" In the case of 17, the word system is being used to describe large projects and the topic deals with verifying that it is possible to test the integrated system by tracking the source of errors and how the components interact with each other. Tracking down errors that arise when systems are integrated is very hard, and in general it is necessary to make the plans on how to track down such errors when the architecture for the system is being designed. Therefore, the point, which seems obvious, is in fact a very critical one.Determining what software testing tools are available is another very critical step in the effective, efficient testing of software. The enormous number of different pathways through modern software makes it impossible to use even the largest army of testers to check them all. Therefore, the only way to provide reasonable coverage of the options is to let other software examine it. Tools such as memory and other system resource checkers, source code scanners that look for \\"obvious\\" bugs, programs that generate test data sets either randomly or clustered about most likely values, and test generators can sometimes provide valuable assistance in cleaning code. When working in C/C++, I found a code scanner to be extremely helpful, and wrote a simple one some time ago. It searched for instances of a single \\"=\\" in Boolean expressions, semicolons immediately after if, while and for loops, and places where the delete command was used on pointers that might point to an array. It was simple, but it did find some bugs that quite likely would have taken me hours to find.The testing principles are organized into ten categories:* Requirements phase.* Test planning.* The testing team.* The system architecture.* Test design and documentation.* Unit testing.* Automated testing tools.* Automated testing: Selected best practices.* Nonfunctional testing.* Managing test execution.As you can see, the concept of testing is included from the very first stages of the project. This is essential, as it is very possible to incorporate something into the design that will make effective testing difficult or even impossible. Experienced software testers should be included in the planning from the first day of construction.I consider this book to be a companion volume to those that emphasis testing as part of coding. With this book and one of the others, you can raise the level of your software quality quotient, which makes the life of everyone much easier."},{"Title":"Effective Software Testing: 50 Specific Ways to Improve Your Testing","review":"Think of this book as a 300 page checklist that uncovers gaps in the testing process, some glaring and some more subtle. From that perspective you are not getting yet another book on how to test software, but insights into the author's extensive experience and knowledge. Therein lies the value of this book, and why it is applicable to not only software QA professionals at all experience levels, but to project managements, application support professionals, and developers.The book is divided into chapters that address a specific phase in the testing process, starting with requirements through to text execution. I won't dwell on the content that will be of particular interest to QA practitioners because the entire book applies. Instead, I'll cite the information that other stakeholders in application delivery will find useful because I believe this book has a much wider audience than just QA:- Chapter I (Requirements) should be read by project managers and the requirements team. It underscores the importance of integrating the QA team at the earliest stage of a project.- Chapter IV (System Architecture) shows the importance of communications between the architects and design team and the QA team. Specifically, if QA isn't working closely with architecture, designs may not be testable, which will impose significant costs downstream in the applications delivery process.- Chapter VI (Unit Testing) gives advice on how to effectively engage the development team in the overall quality strategy.- Chapter X (Managing Test Execution) has excellent advice on managing defects, which has a plethora of stakeholders and roles, from support, business and development domains. In addition, the guidance on bounding the test execution cycle is not of primary interest to project managers, but also to business stakeholders. It's a sad commentary on the way some organizations manage the test environment when advice for separating the test and development environments need to be included, but this commingling happens too often and I was happy to see it included in this chapter.This is not a 'how to test' book, it is a compilation of pitfalls and how to avoid them. It is a welcome addition to the growing software quality body of knowledge and one that I recommend highly."},{"Title":"Effective Software Testing: 50 Specific Ways to Improve Your Testing","review":"I proof-read this book and it was so good I felt compelled to read it a second time! I have read several of Elfriede's books and I always find them well organized and consistently readable.Elfriede is a well known authority in this field and in Effective Software Testing she has produced a state of the art handbook for a comprehensive testing effort.The format is very pragmatic. The book is split into different areas in a useful sequence and each area has an overview with seperate following chapters providing more detail. The chapters are concise and the subject area's contents are concentrated and free of jargon.We have implemented many of these precepts in our organization to very good effect. Highly reommended!"},{"Title":"Effective Software Testing: 50 Specific Ways to Improve Your Testing","review":"In Effective Software Testing Elfriede Dustin gave the software testing community their version of Scott Meyers' landmark Effective C++ which was in its first edition in 1992. Meyers created a style that software professionals have loved and other authors have emulated in which \\"items\\" are numbered which address specific and sometimes complex issues related to the subject at hand. Dustin applies this same style to the testing discipline with a high degree of success. Since the TOC is available for browsing on the product page, I won't repeat all of the high level topic areas in detail here. However, the items covered address a broad level of topics from foundations for all testing practices to specific areas in unit, functional, and non-functional testing. I recently became the manager for my company's automation and performance testing team after having spent 13 years in application development. I had some exposure to testing on the periphery of the projects that I've worked on, but there were aspects that I had not considered either fully or at all. While I don't have direct responsibility for functional testing, I found the material here beneficial to understand the big picture of testing organizations and how my team's work supports the functional testing.One way that Effective Software Testing differs from its C++ cousin is that it does tend to be more theoretical with general advice and guidelines. For managers looking for a good overview of testing along with good principles to abide by, this is a good place to start. However, there is a lot of detail or \\"rubber meets the road\\" type of material. Topics like equivalence partitioning and orthogonal arrays are described in a more qualitative way. I plan to look to other publications for a more detailed treatment of these topics. I didn't find any material that I disagreed with or that didn't resonate with my new role and responsibilities. I would recommend this book to managers new to software testing or managers and testers who are looking to improve their overall testing organization. With 50 items that span a mere 258 pages, it is very easy to read in spurts which is often necessary for the limited time that managers and other professionals have. Even at one item a day at the beginning of the day or over lunch, you can complete the book in 10 weeks.

It suggests approaches to testing that are in conflict with the Testing Life Cycle as contained in IEEE Standard 829, the Standard for Software Test Documentation. A reader would do well to first read &quot;Systematic Software Testing&quot; by Rick Craig and Stefan Jaskiel. Ms. Dustin seems to concentrate on developing Test Procedures and plays down the critical subject of Test Design. Also, though not labeled as such, much of this book seems aimed at testing in the web environment, as opposed to testing non-web systems (e.g., client-server, mainframe) or safety critical systems.This book offers several excellent points, such as Early Test Planning and discussion of the Test Environment, but tends to use terminology (e.g., test harness) that is used differently elsewhere in the software industry. Since the book doesn't contain a glossary, this can lead to reader confusion. The author's section on Test Automation is well-done, which one would expect from an industry-recognized test automation expert.There seem to be several misleading items in this book, including the author's definition of &quot;Black Box&quot; testing. Elsewhere in the software industry, this means &quot;Requirements-Based&quot; testing, but the author defines it as &quot;Validating correct behavior only by viewing the output of the user interface.&quot; This seems to be significantly restrictive in scope.

He died before his previous novel, YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, made it into print and GOLDEN GUN definitely reads like a rough draft.From reading Andrew Lycett's excellent biography of Fleming, it doesn't look like Fleming devoted much time to rewriting so perhaps the 007 well had pretty much run dry (Fleming had tried to kill Bond off eight books ago so the superspy's longevity surprised even his own creator!).It seems when Bond is facing an internal crisis, Fleming leaves it to others to notice, usually M consulting with neuro-specialists or psychiatrists. Several books begin this way as Fleming seems to avoid any real soul-searching in his secret agent. A mission then presents itself and 007 swings into action.This time he's sent to Jamaica--a somewhat lazy choice of locale since Fleming lived there and had already set LIVE AND LET DIE and DOCTOR NO there. (THUNDERBALL and parts of FOR YOUR EYES ONLY would take place in the neighboring Bahamas). His mission is to find a secret assassion who's flashy, loud and yanks a golden gun out in nearly every scene he's in. Very tough to find someone like that.Chapters feel like retreads of the other Bond books. The hoods' gathering from GOLDFINGER, the train climax from DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Mary Goodnight and Felix Leiter pop up, further straining any credibility. I don't know if Fleming could've pulled this off had he lived to rework it.This should give you an idea of how the book reads: the movie was better."},{"Title":"Man With The Golden Gun, The Last James Bond Novel #13","review":"Bond returns to the British Secret Service after being missing for a while.

This is a good story line but the book seems to be not totally finished and the character of James Bond is of a different personality in some aspects in this book. The book was published after the death of Ian Fleming. Much of the book was written by Fleming while he was ill and the story is not up to the standards of the other 007 novels. The book somewhat feels to be unfinished and the storyline is not as developed as in other past novels. I still love the book enough to have read it as a child and repurchase it as a Kindle edition to reread it. I rate it at 4 stars as it is still worth reading.

However, Bond is betrayed, leading to a series of deadly confrontations and a final showdown with the lethal Scaramanga.\\"The Man eith the Golden Gun\\" is highly recommended to fans of Ian Fleming's James Bond, who should find the story entertaining and the ending quite intriguing."},{"Title":"Man With The Golden Gun, The Last James Bond Novel #13","review":"Bond, presumed dead from his previous mission, reappears at HQ and in a brainwashed state attempts to kill M. After some reprogramming by the scecret service - which we are not privy to unfortunately - bond is given an assignment to kill a well known assasin. M figures that if Bond succeeds he will have earned back his status - if not - he will be dead. What follows is a somewhat atypical Bond novel. I have read about half of the Bond novels and this one is a little different. Bond seems tentative, morose and haunted in his return to Jamacia. There are also some plot devices that are difficult to take seriously (for example, Ms. Goodnight coming in though his hotel window?). The master assassin in the story is only vaguely interesting, and the organization he is a part of reminds me of the crime sydicate from Dr. No. All in all it is not a bad book - but there are certianly better in the series."},{"Title":"Man With The Golden Gun, The Last James Bond Novel #13","review":"Bond is sent to a mental institution and we don't read a page about what happens. There's a sign that things have gone wrong...'The Man with the Golden Gun' was an incomplete and wholly unfortunate way for Ian Fleming to go out. The last novel he worked on before dying in August 1964, 'Gun' only exists in a first draft and it was far from the vibrant tales that were his usual product. Fleming usually wrote a second version with reworkings of the material to improve balance and detail, making his thrillers amongst the greatest in popular literature.All that exists of 'Gun' is a kind of skeletal novel that Fleming, who was unhappy with the results, would have fleshed out in prior years. Publication of the existing novel was never a certainty; while the manuscript was generally approved by his copy editor William Plomer, publisher Jonathan Cape had reservations and asked critic Kingsley Amis to examine it. Fleming's semi-complete novel was released on April Fool's Day, 1965, to unfavorable but respectful reviews. A loosely-based film version with Roger Moore and Christopher Lee was also screened in 1974, but 'The Man with the Golden Gun' has kept an uneasy relationship with the Bond faithful.Where to start with a book that never really had its chance to succeed? For one thing, 'The Man with the Golden Gun' is not a completely bad novel; though it is pallid compared to Fleming's other work, it has small traces of the energy and dark humor that made his Bond character a great success. The overall problem is that 'Gun' reads exactly like what it is: a novel that was never truly finished. Only 180 to 190 pages depending on its edition ('Thunderball,' for comparison, runs about 270 pages), 'Gun' feels rushed, underdeveloped, and lacking in the typical Fleming spark.'Gun' picks up from Fleming's prior novel, 'You Only Live Twice,' in which Bond rubs elbows with Japanese intelligence while on a diplomatic mission and sets out to kill Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Bond disappeared in action and was assumed dead by the British government. After nearly a year, Bond emerges at the MI6 offices in London and is found to have been brainwashed by the Soviet Union. M. narrowly escapes an assassination attempt and, knowing of Bond's past value, commits him to a mental facility to be 'switched back.'As mentioned, the de-brainwashing period is not covered by Fleming at all. Time jumps forward between chapters and Bond is suddenly on a redemptive mission to Jamaica, where he must kill Francisco Scaramanga, a gun for hire who has murdered hundreds in Jamaica and Cuba alone. Scaramanga is a lower-grade villain - a gold pistol-wielding Catalan who struts around in modified Western gear. He is known for an accurate shot, thought to have major sexual prowess, and enjoys seeing people eaten by crocodiles.Bond flies to Jamaica, Fleming's home island in real life, and finds Scaramanga dealing with shady investors on a hotel. This novel is swamped in chance occurrences: Bond happens to meet up with his secretary Mary Goodnight, who has been transferred to the Jamaican branch of MI6; Bond happens to find a real estate auction listed in a Kingston newspaper, eventually meeting Scaramanga at the property; and Bond happens to be employed by Scaramanga as a bodyguard to watch over the deadbeats he's conducting business with. The business meetings, which Bond overhears, contain a lot of dull shop talk and the gangsters' aims are a muddled combination of organized crime and Cold War tactics. There are plans to sabotage the Jamaican sugar and metal industries, introduce gambling to the island, traffic marijuana, and increase dealings between the Mob and Communist intelligence.Probably the biggest letdowns of this novel are its villains. Compared to Dr. No and Blofeld, Scaramanga is just a deranged gunslinger from the backwoods. He is annoying rather than frightening and doesn't seem to pose any realistic threat to Bond. The group of hoodlums who surround him, complete with sleazy dispositions and tropical shirts, are dummies from a pistol range we're waiting for Bond to punch holes through. 'The Man with the Golden Gun' might've been saved by an effective villain or two, but Fleming completely fails in this respect.It seems clear from the novel's development that Fleming was a very ill man who would never finish the story. The way 'Gun' lackadaisically moves through its scenes and hobbles to a climax makes tension impossible to build. We are rushed from England to Jamaica and remain there for the length of this novel, almost as if Fleming didn't have the strength to leave his home island again. Most characters are underdeveloped and we don't see into 007's mind often enough.The hot backdrop gives Fleming a license for sexual innuendos on much cruder and more frequent levels than usual. Some of them are lewd to the point of tastelessness (a cabaret scene comes to mind) and I can't imagine a younger Fleming leaving them in after revisions. Speaking of frequency, there is plenty of repetition to go around in this novel, as the writing has an unusual number of repeated words and turns of phrase. Fleming also continues his habit of making sentences a bit too long to swallow at first reading, which is more forgivable in a better-written story.The best sections of this novel, believe it or not, feature Bond and Mary Goodnight. Goodnight, who was transferred to the Jamaican wing of MI6 after Bond's assumed death, catches up with her ex-supervisor and is shown to have more than a professional admiration for him. She is only in tight corners of the plot, but their relationship is portrayed in 'Gun' with an unusual amount of sensitivity. The scenes featuring Bond against Scaramanga and the Mob are so underachieving that Goodnight actually has a moment to shine.Thankfully, the twentieth century's most prolific espionage writer has left behind many superior novels for us to enjoy. 'The Man with the Golden Gun' might have been better off published as a tribute edition - perhaps even a facsimile of the original manuscript - instead of being pushed off as a legitimate entry to the Bond series. It's unlikely this novel will ever have a better reputation and the goofy film version, maligned by many fans, will not help its cause.'The Man with the Golden Gun' will remain on bookshelves as a curiosity piece for Bond fans. Other readers will probably be drawn to the novel after seeing its film, but you are best advised to read Fleming's well-written novels - 'Dr. No,' 'Thunderball,' 'Goldfinger,' and 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' amongst them. The Bond series has been recently marketed by Penguin Books in a handsome edition. The printing I've bought is a used 1965 hardcover by the New American Library. Its dust jacket is missing, which is kind of fitting for a novel that doesn't compare to its predecessors."},{"Title":"Man With The Golden Gun, The Last James Bond Novel #13","review":"Seems like Mr. Fleming took the day (or week, or month) off when he wrote this one. Absolutely awful. Perhaps he was ill at the time, whatever the excuse, there IS no excuse for this sorry excuse of a book. Reads like something a high schooler would write.

Bond's mind is &quot;scrubbed,&quot; and he is given a chance to redeem himself: he must take out Francisco Scaramanga, the Man with the Golden Gun, because he has been deemed too dangerous to live. Scaramanga's plan is not be as impressive as Goldfinger's or Hugo Drax's, but he is certainly in their class as a villain. With his single-action, gold-plated Colt .45 and his deadeye accuracy, Scaramanga is a villain to remeber. The novel has an almost claustrophobic feel, as Bond is confined to an unfinished hotel with his enemy. Forget about that disappointing movie, all the action is right here."},{"Title":"Man With The Golden Gun, The Last James Bond Novel #13","review":"&quot;The Man With the Golden Gun&quot; was published in 1965, the year after Ian Fleming's death, and was his last work of fiction to feature the character of James Bond. After the magnificent &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1964), which carried the Bond series to a level beyond its previous heights and remains Fleming's finest novel, many readers had high hopes that Fleming's final Bond outing would be of high quality as well. They were bound to be deeply disappointed.This is the worst published fiction (albeit posthumously) Fleming ever wrote; indeed, it is, by common consent, the worst of all the James Bond novels (including the much maligned &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;). Even some of John Gardner's later forays from the 1980s are better than this. Fleming is clearly uninspired, even bored, and the limp plot is in no way helped by the character of Scaramanga, who, rather than being menacing, is reduced by Fleming to an obnoxious, stupid, loudmouthed bully. Easily the worst villain Fleming ever conceived.This was written in the last months of Fleming's life, and it may have been a rough draft. Let us hope it was very rough. It probably should never have been published, but it is not worth reading unless one is a Bond completist."},{"Title":"Man With The Golden Gun, The Last James Bond Novel #13","review":"This is an incredible novel.Heart pounding from the begging to the suspensful ending.I defenitly reccomend reading this book!"},{"Title":"Man With The Golden Gun, The Last James Bond Novel #13","review":"I feel like all of the normal Bond elements were missing from this book.

I've purchased most of the audio books in the Bond series, & so far I've only had problems w/ one of them (On Her Majestie's Secret Service). A couple of the discs had what appeared to be glue (from the packaging?) on them & would not play properly. When I first encountered the problem, I called the 800 number on the box, fully expecting to get an automated answering service w/ menu options. To my surprise, a very pleasant woman named \\"Carol\\" answered, assuring me that there would be no problem getting a replacement disc to me free of charge. The entire phone call was over in a few minutes & left me feeling very happy w/ the company & w/ my purchase Thank you, Carol!As for the Blackstone Bond series audio books, Simon Vance does an outstanding job of narrating the books. Unlike some narrators I've encountered w/ other companies (such as Brilliance) who read descriptive passages AND dialogue using the SAME TONE so that it's difficult to tell which character is actually speaking, Vance gives each character his or her own voice and manner of speaking. It makes for a MUCH more pleasant & enjoyable listening experience.Part of the fun of the original Bond novels is seeing how they compare to the films that bare their titles. In many cases, there's scarcely any similarity at all (and sometimes none whatsoever). However, I actually enjoy that. Having seen the movies so many times, it's great not knowing what will happen next in the books. Fleming definitely enjoyed meting out \\"poetic justice\\" w/ regards to eliminating his villains. I've read all of the Fleming Bond books, either on audio or in print, and they are all worth-while. Once I have the entire Blackstone audio series, I plan to start over from the beginning & \\"read\\" them all again in sequence.The finale aboard the speeding train had some genuinely tense, even shocking moments. I really wondered what Bond was going to do and even doubted there was anything he COULD do.

Sure, it's not the best Bond novel -- that's probably &quot;On Her Majesty's Secret Service,&quot; although I've also got a soft spot for the unusual &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; -- but it's hardly a bad novel. Scaramanga, far from being a terrible villain, is actually one of the more memorable Fleming ever wrote. I enjoy the way in which he serves as a sort of dark mirror for Bond himself, and that makes me feel like Fleming was actually just trying something different with this novel.

Clearly it lacks the same glossy polish of earlier Bond novels, retreading plot points in routine, humorless fashion. Sent to Jamaica to kill \\"Pistols\\" Scaramanga, a hired killer responsible for shooting several fellow agents, Bond blunders his way in no time at all into his target's confidence, despite the fact Scaramunga has been warned an English spy has been sent to kill him.Hardly one to hide his light under a bushel, Scaramanga introduces himself to Bond as \\"The Man with the Golden Gun\\" and shows off his signature weapon by blowing away a couple of tame birds. \\"Mister, there's something quite extra about the smell of death,\\" Scaramanga tells Bond in the way of a job interview. \\"Care to try it?\\"If Fleming was challenging his readers to make sense of his overdone prose, I wasn't up to it. Another such moment happens when Bond reflects on alcohol: \\"The best drink of the day is just before the first one.\\"Adding to general confusion is Scaramanga's purpose in Jamaica. He's got a hotel there languishing amid the bindweed and interest rates, and while looking in, decides to see if he can raise some needed capital by laying waste to Jamaica's canefields and bauxite factories in exchange for Soviet and Cuban funding. Several mob guys and spies are on hand to basically listen to Scaramanga do his bad-guy Mickey Spillane thing and stare menacingly but impotently at his new English go-fer.There is certainly an underbaked quality to \\"Golden Gun\\" that begs the question if Fleming completed more than a first draft. Many of the transitions are whiplash-abrupt. The opener gives us a brainwashed Bond attempting to kill M, but just a few pages later he is winging off on M's latest assignment. Bond hardly lands at Kingston Airport before learning of Scaramanga's plans thanks to the first of many improbable coincidences.Bond makes some boneheaded moves over the course of the story, dithering ridiculously so Fleming or whomever can fill up some more pages. At one point, we learn he is being intentionally rude to Scaramanga and his killer crew in order to trip them up somehow. At another, he shows off his own gun skills by shooting a headdress off a frightened dancer. How this doesn't get him dumped off in a mangrove swamp is never clear, but it fills time.Regardless, this is more a novella than a novel, and so lamely conceived it seems unlikely any of Fleming's normally diligent editing and revising could have made this anything other than the stinker it is. After taking on Blofeld and SMERSH, what's a gun-happy triggerman for hire?The worst you can say about this book has already been said by \\"The JuRK\\" on this review thread: \\"The movie was better.\\" Too true. Ian Fleming saved the worst for last."},{"Title":"Man With The Golden Gun, The Last James Bond Novel #13","review":"To a certain extent, it feels unfair to criticize The Man With the Golden Gun, the last of Ian Fleming's original James Bond books. It is generally agreed that Fleming, seriously ill while writing this book, died before having a chance to rewrite his initial, sketchy drafts. The book itself was rushed out by Fleming's publishers and therefore, if it often reads like a first draft that's because it is.This is the book that finds James Bond returning to MI6 after being briefly brainwashed by the KGB. Needing to redeem himself in the eyes of M (who, in this book's rushed characterization, is at his most coldly unlikeable), Bond is sent to take out international assassin Paco Scaramanga, whose trademark is that he kills with a golden gun. As said, the entire book reads like a sketch of an idea (a short story really) and Fleming's prose and dialouge are (through not fault of his own) rough and unpolished. However, the book does have a few good points that are all the more remarkable when you consider the duress Fleming was under when he wrote it. Scaramanga is a potentially fascinating character, a wonderfully image of James Bond as if reflected in a funhouse mirror. Indeed, it is hard not to feel that if Fleming had lived to write a second draft, Scaramanga would be remembered as one of his most memorable villians, in league with Dr. No and Goldfinger. As well, there is wonderfully elegiac about the book's final chapter where Bond spends a few pages considering his legacy as a secret agent and his future in espionage. Fleming, surely knowing that this would be his final novel, uses the chapter to sum up all that he had written over the past 15 or so years and it serves as a nice tribute for the fans of the original James Bond, confirming everything that made us a fan in the first place. The Man with The Golden Gun isn't a book that accurately reflects the depth of Fleming's talent or the potential of the literary James Bond but it still has a few shiny moments that shows why Bond has endured."},{"Title":"Man With The Golden Gun, The Last James Bond Novel #13","review":"This is one of the original James Bond 007 novels written by Ian Fleming. The book is very different from the movie filmed in 1974. The entire novel is set in Jamaica - a favorite location of Ian Fleming. The novel and the movie of \\"Dr. No\\" were both set in Jamaica, and that was one of the few movies very faithful to an Ian Fleming novel. The villain in \\"The Man with the Golden Gun\\" is Francisco Scaramanga, but the character in the book differs markedly from the part played by Christopher Lee in the 1974 movie. The book character is much \\"rougher\\" whereas the part played by Lee was more refined and better mannered in public. Scaramanga in the book is a hit man doing business with Mafia gangsters from the USA, the Soviet secret service and the Cuban secret police. They have plans to enter the gambling business in Jamaica, to bribe public officials and to market illegal drugs. Scaramanga in the movie was a very affluent hit man paid off and funded largely by a Thai-Chinese business tycoon and by the Red Chinese communists, who provide him with a luxurious home on his own private island off the Chinese coast. The book character has \\"3 nipples\\" but is never shown with a woman, whereas the movie character has a relationship with a woman played by Maud Adams. It is even suggested by British intelligence in the book that Scaramanga may be a homosexual. The book character of Mary Goodnight is very English. She assists James Bond to a certain degree on his mission, but she is nothing like the supposed \\"dumb Blonde\\" character played by Brit Eckland in the 1974 movie. Both Maud Adams and Brit Eckland are Swedes in real life. The novel is set in Jamaica, whereas the movie was set in locales such as Lebanon, Hong Kong, Macao, Thailand and Red China.

After writing such marvellous, well plotted books as \\"Doctor No\\" and \\"Goldfinger\\", it is as if Fleming gave up when writing the later James Bond books. I suppose that by that time, the money was practically guaranteed and even his shopping list would have sold. \\"The Man with the Golden Gun\\" is the second last of Fleming's fourteen Bond adventures and like \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\" and \\"You Only Live Twice\\", it feels more like an extended short story than a fully developed novel. It's not just that it's shorter than the earlier novels; the level of detail of the earlier novels just isn't there. Furthermore, the villain and the \\"Bond girl\\", two of the main drawcards of the Bond series, just aren't up to par either. Although there is technically a \\"girl\\" in this book, in the form of Bond's former secretary, Mary Goodnight, she barely plays a part in the story, and although Scaramanga is a passable villain, he pales by comparison to Fleming's mega-villains such as Blofeld and Dr. No.This is not a terrible novel.

The main characters of this novel are James Bond, Mary Goodnight, Pistols Scaramanga, and Felix Leiter.The plot opens with Bond's attempt, while under KGB brainwashing, to assassinate M. After sorting that out, Bond is sent on a suicide mission to do what no one else has been able to do, kill the crack shot, Scaramanga.

All of this eventually culminates with a shootout on a train, with an eventual final shootout in a Jamaican swamp between Bond and Paco 'Pistols' Scaramanga. At conclusion of mission, recovering in a hospital, James is offered a knightship from the Queen, of which he sends reply to M. Is it to be 'Sir' James Bond or not?As stated by Raymond Benson: this is the \\"weakest novel in series, lacks the rich detail from other novels; unfinished\\". I would also add that due to the uneven style of writing, the novel moves back and forth from interesting sections to be offset with some that are somewhat wordy, possibly of interest only to Ian Fleming, if in fact Mr. Fleming wrote the entire book.Anyone interested in the Bond saga will find this necessary reading, however, most general readers will find this at best only a 3-star read.And the movie released in 1974 doesn't resemble the novel at all: moving the locations to Hong Kong and Bangkok with the focus of the action on Scaramanga and Chinese interest in developing solar energy as a weapon. Almost two entirely different stories!Ian Fleming was not at his best with this final writing, and the novel suffers from this, as to how an 'unfinished' book gets finished I have no info, but as a final legacy it is a testament to both Ian Fleming's durability and need to communicate one final time with his worldwide audience.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Man With The Golden Gun, The Last James Bond Novel #13","review":"They say that all good things must come to an end. In the case of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels, that end is with The Man with the Golden Gun. After this, there would only be a short story collection (Octopussy & The Living Daylights) to wrap up the set. Posthumously released (and supposedly concluded by a ghost writer), this book is generally considered one of the weaker of the Bond books, but I actually found it to be a pretty decent conclusion to the series.The book opens by resolving issues left open in You Only Live Twice (so if you don't want that book spoiled, read no further). Bond, having suffered a head injury, has lost most of his memory and has wound up in Soviet hands, where he is brainwashed into becoming an assassin. His target is M (whose name is revealed to be Miles Messervy). The plot is quickly foiled and Bond is sent to a clinic to be straightened out.To determine if Bond is still worthy of his 007 number, M dispatches him to Jamaica to kill Francisco Scaramanga, the title character who wields a special gold plated pistol. Scaramanga is one tough man, a sort of anti-Bond who is probably tougher than his hunter. A la Hamlet, Bond is a reluctant and hesitant killer, deferring his opportunities for finishing Scaramanga to instead infiltrate the Man with the Golden Gun's criminal enterprise. Eventually, like the Shakespearean character, procrastination will have to be replaced by action, leading to a showdown between the two.This works well as a final Bond novel, with none of the open issues that marked other recent books. Scaramanga is a worthy adversary and there's a decent amount of action. On the other hand, this is a bit shallower of a book than the two previous novels (On Her Majesty's Secret Service and You Only Live Twice) which both gave a deeper look into the British superspy. Overall, this is a good but not great book and a reasonably worthy conclusion to the Bond series."},{"Title":"Man With The Golden Gun, The Last James Bond Novel #13","review":"Very nice description, but a little short on the action.

This book seems to centralise more on James Bond the man and his inner thoughts, the lack of action is easily made up for with the mind games between Bond and Scaramanga leading upto the final gun fight !"},{"Title":"Man With The Golden Gun, The Last James Bond Novel #13","review":"The Man With The Golden Gun contains some great elements of the other Bond books. First, is Bond's return &quot;from the dead&quot; and near assassination of M--a great start. However, the entire story of Scaramanga being just another member of a Mafia-like group isn't as intriguing as Auric Goldfinger. Fleming is the master of building suspense near the climax--and he certainly does that here--especially during the train ride. However, the pace of the entire story isn't very exciting. It is a good follow-up to You Only Live Twice."},{"Title":"Man With The Golden Gun, The Last James Bond Novel #13","review":"The last completed Bond novel by Fleming is immensely readable, compact, tension filled and poignant.

Mainly, I did not care much for the beginning or the end. No spoilers here for those who have not yet enjoyed this one, but I found both to be implausible to the extent that they interfered with my enjoyment of the novel. And, by the way, I am not talking about that part of the ending dealing with Goodnight.Ian Fleming wrote this novel as he was dying of lung cancer, and it shows. The writing style is more uneven than other Bond novels, and the novel at times reads as though parts of it were stitched together, as indeed they may have been. In any case, the result is a serviceable Bond novel--not the best of the group, but an authentic member thereof that the Bond fan will not want to pass up.Despite its faults, this story has some notable strengths, including some realistic screwups by Bond, and the unforgettable nature of the Scaramanga character. I found Scaramanga to be one of the more memorable Bond villains, and perhaps one of the more authentic. This was a chap who more than gave Bond a run for his money, and this fact gives the novel a fast pace that makes up for some of its shortcomings.Overall, quite good, and quite recommended."},{"Title":"Man With The Golden Gun, The Last James Bond Novel #13","review":"This is the first 007 novel that I read, and I believe it is a great book.

In the book immediately before this one (\\"You Only Live Twice\\"), he writes a quasi-haiku through James Bond, who makes it up on the spot to try to counter his Japanese counterpart Tiger Tanaka;\\"You only live twiceOnce when you're bornOnce when you look death in the face\\"Well, Fleming was staring death in the face as he wrote this book, and there isn't much life in it. First, he resolves the cliff-hanger ending the earlier book by having Bond come back to England, showing up at good old Regents Park, and trying to whack M with a poison squirt gun! You see, when he showed up in Russia suffering from amnesia, the successor organization to SMERSH brainwashed him to go home and do it. As a way of making Bond expiate that act, M sends him out after Scaramanga, a new American gangster in the Clint Eastwood style (quite different from the suave movie character with that name). Despite the Central American bandito name, Francisco \\"Pistols\\" Scaramanga has the Eastwood style of blazing thunderous gun violence from a man who speaks with quiet menace. The main premise is recycled from \\"Goldfinger\\"; evil genius assembles a bunch of hoods to pull a huge heist. Fleming showed to the very end through his crude evil caricatures of Americans that, Felix Leiter as a notable token exception, he didn't like us very much as a group. If this book had indeed been the end of James Bond, 007 went out with a whimper rather than a bang. Bond buff Kinsley Amis gave us \\"Colonel Sun\\" under the pseudonym Robert Markham, a weak effort at best. Fortunately John Gardner, followed by Raymond Benson, proved that the right pen could keep Bond going, that while authors are mortal, a really great character isn't. The third star is for Fleming, God rest his soul.

The book is well organized and it is precise in its objective. The English short phrase or verb phrase is on the left side and the Spanish equivalent on the right. The book also provides quick tips as necessary that clarify potential gramatical queries. I found the book to be extemely useful because it does include the most common errors and also saves time in that you don't have to use the dictionary and sift through detailed information in search of a quick clarification. I recommend the book for intermediate to advanced level speakers but certainly can benefit beginners because the types of errors outlined can be committed by any bilingual speaker regardless of his/her level of Spanish.

The book contains some of the standard themes inherent in the drama -- the thugs, the incredibly sexy woman that no one can resist, betrayal, and death. However, it often defies expectations and leads the reader to really share with Billy's emotions. All the scenes, whether they be about torture, sex, familial love, or childish musings, connect to universal emotions.The only problem I had with this book was the ending. I was thoroughly enjoying it and unable to focus on my work until I finished but towards the very end it just got...unimpressive. While everything did wrap up well, it seemed more like an easy or expected conclusion than one that was original and fitting to the characters themselves. But overall, it's a great read."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"Billy Bathgate sucks you into a world of a down and out street wise kid who is seduced by a low level seedy mobster into being his protoge.

As an avid reader, i would like to strongly disagree with the crowd. Although all of Doctorow's books are \\"readable\\", meaning not falling asleep after reading each chapter, i feel that Billy Bathgate clearly stands out among these stories.The story is told through a seventeen year old boy and his life experiences in his neighborhood and in a gang. I found the plot to be extremely exciting in a few places in the book, meaning more than one climax, and it also described the harsh reality of poverty in the early 20th century. To accent this, each scene was described with intracate detail, and seriously, i had trouble putting this one down.My opinion may be biased, as i am seventeen myself, but i found that i could remarkably relate to many feelings Billy experienced. So if you are seventeen also, or if you are just interested in an exhilerating story, i strongly recommend Billy Bathgate over any other book written by Doctorow."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"E.L. Doctorow's descriptive historical fiction follows a period of time during the formative years of young Billy Bathgate a 15 year old fatherless street kid from the ghettoes of the Bronx. The time is the mid 1930's with the U.S. in the throes of the Depression. The advent of prohibition assured that gangsterism ruled the urban landscape.Bathgate who lived in a squalid and tiny tenement apartment with his mentally unbalanced Irish Catholic mom was hanging out on the streets doing juggling tricks at which he was adept. He unwittingly came to be noticed by the notorious mobster Dutch Schultz. Intrigued by the aura of the powerful crime boss, Bathgate soon ingratiated himself to the truculent Schultz. He became and errand boy and good luck charm to the gang. Nurtured under the wing of the fostering Otto \\"Abbadabba\\" Berman, the financial brains of the organization, Bathgate soon had both Schultz and Berman as father figures to esteem. Even at such a tender age he managed to discern both the good and evil in his surrogate fathers.Doctorow begins his novel on a tugboat in New York harbor. Bathgate has secreted himself aboard to witness the dispatching of a previously trustworthy lieutenant of Schultz, Bo Weinberg. Weinberg was being fitted for cement shoes and had been accompanied by a lovely young married socialite Drew Preston. Preston also aboard belowdecks would become Schultz's moll. Bathgate, now a trusted gang member, was commissioned with the duty of being Preston's protector.Schultz, being pursued for prosecution by among others Thomas E. Dewey, successfully petitioned the courts to move his trial to bucolic upstate Onondaga. The gang including Bathgate and Preston take up summer residence there with Schultz running his various illegal businesses by proxy. Schultz acting as the civic minded model citizen is positively influencing the town who will be his jury. As the trial approaches Berman at Schultz's request orders Bathgate to accompany Preston to Saratoga to get her out of the way. As a result of this episode, they have an affair. The lovesick Bathgate protects her from what he fears will be an assassination as she potentially becomes a liability in Schultz's eyes.The story follows further episodes of the inner workings of Schultz gang and Bathgates maturation under the guidance of his mentor Berman. Doctorow's finale assures that evil will be punished yet Bathgate is saved by his ability to recognize the difference between right and wrong and shelter himself from trouble.Doctorow is extremely accomplished in this genre of historical fiction. His expressive articulate descriptions of his settings is his trademark. He successfully manages to tranform fact into plausible intriguing storytelling with well developed and often ambiguous, conflicted characters."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"Much of E.L Doctorow's finest writing celebrates the vibrancy, brashness, and diversity of New York City. Doctorow's novels also show a fascination with secular Jews -- with individuals who abandon traditional Jewish religious practice and adopt various other types of life. Thus, \\"The Book of Daniel\\" explores New York City in the 1940s in a historical novel based upon the Rosenbergs. Doctorow's remarkable novel, \\"City of God,\\" explores contemporary New York City in the context of secular Jews and of highly liberal Jews who have adopted beliefs and practices far different from traditional Judaism.In \\"Billy Bathgate\\", Doctorow offers an unforgettable picture of gangland New York City and of Jewish mobsters dominated by the figure of Dutch Schultz, as Doctorow takes the reader away from the humdrum everyday and into a world of rawness, danger, and excitement. Life needs its dangers and risks, Doctorow seems to be telling the reader, if it is not to be stupyfing, dull, and conventional.\\"Billy Bathgate\\" is a coming-of-age story set in the New York City underworld of the 1930s. The book is told in the first person by its hero, the fifteen-year old Billy (who takes the name \\"Bathgate\\" from the chief commercial street in the East Bronx) who becomes attached to the gang led by the notorious Dutch Schultz (1902 -- 1935), born Arthur Flegenheimer to a poor Jewish family in the Bronx. The book is told in a breathy, highly excitable and emotive style appropriate to the voice of its young, naive protagonist. Billy's father had disappeared when the boy was young, and Billy lives with his poor, at best marginally sane mother. He seems destined for a life of petty thievery and cheap tawdry sex until Dutch Schultz notices the boy juggling on a street corner near a beer drop-off. Billy ingratiates himself with the Schultz gang in its declining days. Schultz becomes a father-figure to Billy. Schultz basks in the attention he receives from the boy and in his public notoriety.Doctorow has written a richly-textured historical novel which shows us New York City and the gangland world. While the reader comes to understand and sympathize with Billy, Doctorow does not allow the reader to lose site of the random viciousness of gangland life. There are scenes of shocking violence and killing, the most fully developed of which involves the murder of Schultz' former associate, Bo Weinberg. Dutch Schultz in all his brutality and intensity come to life in this book as do the members of his inner circle. His chief lieutenant, Otto Berman, known as \\"Abadabba\\" Berman, a mathematical genius, becomes a mentor to Billy and is one of the most sharply-drawn characters in the novel. At great peril to himself, Billy becomes involved with Schultz' final mistress. This affair becomes the focal point of his coming to a degree of self-understanding. Rival gangs and New York officialdom, including District Attorney Thomas Dewey also receive a rich portrayal.Much of the symbolism of the book revolves around the use of words and of change, as Billy Bathgate, Abadabba Berman, and Dutch Schultz, among others, adopt names not their own. Billy's skill at juggling, which appears at many points in the book, becomes a metaphor for the importance of adopting to change and of being light on one's feet if one is to succeed in the world. As Berman counsels Billy in many of their astonishing conversations, only the numbers are real while words change. Religion, and Jewish-Christian relations play a role in this book as well, illustrating the theme of constant change, as Dutch Schultz appears to convert from Judaism to Catholicism late in the novel. The book captures the fast-paced, slangy style of speech of its protagonists and includes as well heady, striking, and detailed passages of description.This is a tough-minded novel, a gripping read, and, in its own way, an inspring tale. \\"Billy Bathgate\\" is an unforgettable work by one of the United States' major living storytellers.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"I read somewhere that in BILLY BATHGATE Doctorow was writing a myth about capitalism, which seems about right. Doctorow is one of the few historical novelists who has something significant to say about American history and doesn't just appropriate famous historical figures to give their books marketing value (yes, I'm talking about BLONDE, by Joyce Carol Oates.) This book is pretty great. If you haven't read it, you'll enjoy it. If you like a good read -- interesting characters, humour, vivid imagery, and a suspenseful plot -- you'll love it. If you're interested in literary form and ideological engagement (like the capitalism comment above) you'll also enjoy it. This seems to be Doctorow's strength -- combining good old-fashioned narrative with serious literary critique in a way that should make Tom Wolfe jealous. The opening, where the gangster gets his feet cemented, sets a dazzling tone for the rest of the novel, and this is one book that keeps getting better as it goes on. Buy this one and enjoy."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"In Billy Bathgate, Doctorow writes a coming of age book about a 15-year-old boy from the Bronx. The story is set in the late 20's and early 30's. Billy, for all practical purposes, is an orphan who grows up on the tenement-lined streets. His life changes when he ingratiates himself with a local mobster named Dutch Schultz.Billy, at first, runs simple errands; gathering coffee and donuts and delivering money. Dutch, however, likes the kid and starts to train him for future endvours. Billy likes the money but soon realizes he is in thicker than he wants to be. However, the Mafia is his family and there can be no escape. The book takes Billy through the dangerous and exciting rise and fall of Dutch's empire.Doctorow writes a compelling novel in the sense that Doctorow has done his homework. There is a sense of authenticity when reading the historical and scenic descriptions. Billy's love scenes and the gritty action were described almost poetically. However, what turned me off was the writing itself. Too many run on sentences and often times I found that the scene changed, often radically, without any help to the reader. It was like a page or paragraph was missing. While the characters were colorful and interesting, I didn't have as much sympathy with Billy as I would have hoped. There is some sexual content, so young readers should be cautioned. Otherwise a pretty good story, especially if you like this historical era."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"Dutch Schultz was a notoriously violent, murdering New York gangster in the 1930's. Young Billy Bathgate rides his coattails on a downward spiral as Dutch by the time period of this book is a man gasping for breath and clawing for air as New York City and the infamous DA Thomas Dewey are closing in seeking to destroy Dutch and his dwindling gangster empire.This is a fictionalized account much like \\"Legs,\\" by William Kennedy. \\"Leg's,\\" tale was dished up by Jack Diamond's lawyer and this tale is witnessed by a young boy, Billy Bathgate, who hooks up with Schultz's mob as an errand boy and tries to make his own way upward in the New York City mob.There is a lot to like in this novel. The portrayal of Dutch Schultz is vivid and brimming with descriptions of a loud mad man with a violent temper surrounded by his faithful (pretty much) henchmen. Dutch was off the cuff and there is more than one grisly scene of him beating or killing a man because he just could not control his temper and the rest of the gang always had to contend with the aftermath of his rampages. Billy Bathgate is just a kid witnessing the ins and out of gangster life trying to pull his weight so he can become just like them. It's a good thing he is smart, otherwise he'd not last long, but as is the case he is a great character that this story follows through a suffering city full of heartbreak and triumph.The members of Dutch's gang are all present, in one form or another, such as: Otto (Abbadabba) Biederman, Dutch's financial planner who was a complete whiz with numbers, Lulu Rosenkrantz, the cold blooded killer, Michael O'Hanley, the driver, Bo Weinburg, who's unforgettable role starts off the novel, and many more characters who graced Depression Era New York City with blood, guts, and glory.This is an engaging tale of rags to riches, gun battles and coldbooded ruthless determination during a time when men could rise to power with a gang of devotees and a tommy gun to create his own reality and his own horrific downfall. If you enjoy reading about gangster hideouts, gun molls, illegal gambits and murdering gangsters in New York City during the depression, you'll enjoy this story. Equally memorable is Dutch's soliliquy which in history was a memorable speech that enthralled the media and G men alike with it's stream of consciousness rambling as though it contained important clues to the inside workings of a self-made mobster's livlihood and fortunes and the crimes that were committed to gain them. This alone definately makes the book worth an afternoon's read.This is a remarkably readable book.

It's true. Look it up.Much of the dialog occurs not as quotes but as statements, or long run-on sentences.This distorted prose makes the book a bit hard to get into initially, and leaves one feeling a bit dizzy.

On the surface, it's a simple story of the last few months of gangster Dutch Schultz's life. But Doctorow tells the story through the eyes of Billy Bathgate, a teenager who gets in with Schultz's gang as a go-fer. Doctorow's writing is, as always, superb, and more than just a recitation of facts, going deeply into the gangsters' world and their behaviors, and how they operated within society.I'm still not sure if Billy Bathgate was based on a real person or if he is entirely fictional, but telling the story through his experiences as a lesser member of the gang allowed an inside look at Schultz without disturbing the facts.A very readable and fascinating look into the New York crime scene of the 1930's."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"I know it seems odd to refer to a &quot;gangster&quot; novel as &quot;beautiful,&quot; but Billy Bathgate is just that.

Good length."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"Doctorow achieves a rare success in combining a rich poetic style with coherent and compelling storytelling in this coming-of-age novel which explores both the romantic mythos and brutal reality of classical American gangsterdom. Many writers have earned their reputation in part through their extravagant and experimental style. Yet, Doctorow climbs a step above these word-sculptors by never allowing his rococo flourishes and tangential tendencies to hinder plot and character development. The result is simply what every reader hopes for, a great story beautifully told.Only a couple of things depreciated this otherwise excellent novel. First, while Doctorow has written some of the best erotic scenes in all of literature, the sex in this book seemed almost too good to be true. I expect that for most fifteen year old boys sex with a gorgeous and experienced older woman would have been much more frightening, awkward, and difficult than it was for Billy. He really turns out to be a Don Juan -- that seems out of character for Billy and detracts from the psychological realism of the story. Also, Dutch Schultz's character seemed under developed considering the importance he plays in both Billy's life and in the overall plot. In spite of the flaws I highly recommend this novel. I give it a solid A."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"Doctorow, E. L., Billy Bathgate. 1989. New York, Penguin Plume, 1998.If he had never written any other published novel, I would acclaim this one as Doctorow's masterpiece. By subtle degrees, he brings us to sympathize and understand his young wannabe thug, Billy, who desperately tries to gain the attention and approval of Dutch Schultz, a lethal gangster of the 1930s. We're offered a plateful of deft perceptions, believable character drawings, and detailed descriptions of the times, the places, and the violence of the gang world. Obviously borrowing some characters from real life, Doctorow convinces the reader that whatever happened either really did or could have. His writing is absolutely gemlike in its precision. I found myself postponing the final 20 pages so as not to end the account. Enthralling. Five stars."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"Expert storyteller E.L. Doctorow wanted to write a novel about the life of the ruthless and slightly kooky 1930's gangster Dutch Schultz, and he chose to do it in an interesting manner. Rather than doing what most every other author might and delivering a straight re-telling of the events late in Schultz's bloody career, Doctorow used the device of creating a fifteen-year-old narrator, Billy Bathgate, to relate the tale and move it forward. Billy, a smart, tough, but somehow innocent working class kid, walks us through the last year in Schultz's life and tells us about the principal players in the story, Schultz's inner circle of thugs, the rival gangs, the accountant, Bo, who betrayed Schultz when he thought his boss was headed to prison (Schultz beat the tax evasion rap with a gutsy argument that involved protection from self-incrimination) and Billy describes the smoking hot redhead society girl, first the doomed accountant's girlfriend, then Schultz's girlfriend and later Billy's, who gets her rich-girl kicks hanging with mobsters, and who ultimately contributed far more to the gang's downfall than she ever cared to know.Billy leaves behind his none-too-sane mother and impoverished New York roots in a Jewish neighborhood and takes up as Schultz's mascot. He moves along with the gangsters as their expansionist ambitions abrade the more cautious goals of Lucky Luciano (a man so scary to Billy Bathgate that Billy never mentions him by name, even the half-century later in which the memoir of his youth is being told). He is there when Schultz plots to assassinate Thomas Dewey, future front runner in the race for the White House and then a prosecutor taking on the East Coast mob. Billy comes into the picture at the moment Schultz has reached the top of his career, and he rides the decline with him, right to the moment of the crime lord's collapse.Billy was a witness to the \\"hit\\" in a chop house that took out the inner circle of the Schultz gang, and somehow convinces us he sneaked into the hosptial room to listen to the dying Dutchman babble through his hours-long final words, in which the fatally-wounded gangster's stream of consciousness is recorded word for word in a version Billy cautions us differs slightly from the accepted transcript.In the closing chapter of the novel, Billy in his post-Dutch Schultz life, makes the stark transition from mobster's adopted little brother to ordinary teenager. He returns home to his mother, he goes to school, gets a job, eventually enlists in the military when the Second World War erupts. He lives as normal a life as possible. But Billy has a secret not even the piercing stare of Lucky Luciano was able to pry loose from him at his interrogation. Billy, you see, clever beyond words, has made off with the Schultz gang's fortune. He tells no one of this for years, knowing he is watched by the agents of Murder Incorporated. But when the time is right, decades in the future, a whole different age of American culture, when the Depression-era criminals like Dutch Schultz are the stuff of history books, he retrieves his justly-gotten gains and spends the crime lord's loot on a legitimate business enterprise of his own, and becomes a very rich man.Billy Bathgate is a novel that kicks some serious posterior. Doctorow is doubly gifted as a great storyteller and a master writer."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"I've only read two of Doctorow's books, this one and _The Book of Daniel_, and this novel is about as far from daniel as you can get (though both are excellent). It's an excellent story about a boy coming of age in the 20s and 30s as a sort of member of Dutch Shultz's gang. He learns lifes lessons from these men. Doctorow's prose is lyrical, a sort of irony when you put the beautiful language Doctorow uses with the violence and moral ambiguity of the characters. This is a great culmination of Doctorow's work."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"One of the great creative geniuses of our time, Doctorow kept me intrigued right until the very last page. I never felt the need to see the movie, sometimes that ruins it for me. The plot is killer and he's true to his subject. It kept me entertained and warded off the blahs during a boring teacher's conference."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"Great reading. Great prose. Great subject. What more can a reader ask for?This is about as romantic as the tenements of New York get."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"BILLY BATHGATE is E.L. Doctrow's poignant look at Depression era gangsterism through the eyes of the young boy after whom the book is named. Much to Doctrow's credit, there is no sentimentalizing or romanticizing of criminals here. Almost legendary gangster, Dutch Schultz, who befriends Billy, is depicted clearly as a vicious, sadistic thug teetering on the edge of insanity.Although it is the Dutchman who takes in the boy, Billy is drawn to Dutch's moll sexually, and to the gang's bookkeeper, Otto Berman, emotionally. Otto is the real key to the book. Billy, like Johnson's Boswell, is drawn to the accountant and his philosophy. Broken down, Otto explains to the boy that things like love, loyalty, knowledge, and spirit are meaningless--none of them can be proven. They are all bound by words. To Otto, words are just words. Numbers, however, are the only true language. One and one will always be two. Numbers never lie. (Spoken like a true accountant.) This has an enormous impact on a young boy whose mother is one step away from the nuthouse, and whose father took off years earlier.I gave this book four stars because I had just finished re-reading RAGTIME, and this came up a little short. On the other hand, maybe RAGTIME was too high a standard to hold it up to. In any event, this is not your typical gangster novel, as I hope this review has made apparent. It is a complex and profound book and should satisfy the most literary appetite.Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"Rarely does an award-winning work of literature read as easily as a Michael Crichton paperback. If you are in the mood for a quick read, you would normally turn to the pop fiction selections on your bookshelf and find something mindless and plot driven. If you are looking for a higher level of quality, such as a Pen/Faulker Award winner, you perhaps consciously prepare yourself for the added effort that reading a meaningful, elaborate, character-driven novel entails. You will almost certainly be rewarded for the effort, but it is an effort nonetheless. But in Billy Bathgate, E.L. Doctorow blends the depth, substance, and beauty of a quality work of literature with the pace, suspense, and rhythm of a mafia thriller. The result is an imminently readable novel that is also an important contribution to 20th century fiction.The plot itself bears much resemblance to countless other mafia stories, filled with shady characters, ruthless hit men, brutal murders, bribing of government officials, and steamy love affairs. The uniqueness lies in the fact that the narrator is a 15-year-old boy, Billy, eager to earn the trust of Dutch Schultz, the mafia kingpin, and his gang. He quickly progresses from simple errand boy, buying cigarettes and coffee, to a position of modest responsibility in this intriguing world of crime. Through Billy's somewhat nave, innocent eyes, we observe Dutch as he manages his empire, carries out hits against his enemies and disloyal employees, and struggles to evade the attempts of law enforcement to bring him down. The story takes us from New York City to Onondoga, a small town where Dutch's trial eventually takes place. And in the process, we witness the growth of a boy into a young man as he enters a world of big money, intense loyalty, and vindictive violence. Throughout, Doctorow's beautiful prose, gift for understatement, and masterful sense of timing create a remarkable novel that will linger in the reader's mind long after the last page has been read."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"An excellent tale of an aspiring young street tough's initiation into the dangers and excitment of the gangster life, circa the 1930's, this book captures its era and the personalities it portrays with an astonishing verve and veracity. The tone and \\"voice\\" feel right, speeding along brilliantly, while the tale, of a young fellow's awakening from gawking naivete to a certain street-smart cynicism, rings remarkably true. If there is a reason for reading fiction today, BILLY BATHGATE offers the perfect example: it is a means for carrying us into places and times now long gone which still may resonate in the contemporary soul. While the hero is a trifle too cloying for my tastes and seems rather more inured to the moral chaos he sees around him than his apparent sensibility suggests he should be, this is, finally, a small fault to find with such a deflty turned tale. Progressing from a 15-year old loner on street corners to mascot of the Dutch Schultz gang, as they hurtle down the spiral of their final decline, the self-named Billy Bathgate insinuates himself into the precarious confidences of this remakably unstable crew. Schultz, himself, the erratic gang leader, has already slipped into a dangerous condition of paranoia and isolation and his hangers-on live from moment to moment in fearful unease, unable to check the excesses of their leader or to separate themselves from him. Billy finds their life oddly mesmerizing as he gets sucked into witnessing outbursts of murder and coldly planned gangland executions, until his role brings him into the orbit of a flighty, if beautiful, society doll. Then a burgeoning adolescent crush seems to awaken him to what he has done and, as in a dream, he begins to seek a way out. The ending comes swiftly and will surprise those who have not yet seen the movie (which captures much, but not all, of the written tale). And yet the wrap-up is a little bit of a let-down (rather too pat, actually) and I longed to know more of who and what this Billy turned out to be. Yet, on balance, this was a fine novel and evidence, indeed, for the solid reputation Doctorow has earned.SWMauthor of The King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"Its not easy to grow up without a role model. This book is about the need for a boy, Billy, trying to find himself while growing up in a poor neighborhood in New York. Billy's character was a symbol similar to the character Holden Caulfield in the book Catcher and the Rye but the difference between the two characters was that Billy was a little bit less in control of his destiny and was led on more in this story.The character Billy becomes wrapped up in a gang led by an alcohol smuggler, Dutch Schultz, by doing menial tasks. But also he witnesses something brutal with the execution of one of Dutch's betrayers. Doctorow uses the naivety of Billy to accentuate the emotional scenes in the book and the execution in the beginning is merely one example.Billy is also expressed as an outcast from society trying to find himself a feel like he belongs somewhere. And that is how he gets wrapped up in the gang and never thinks twice about it. He most importantly wants Dutch to like him for its own sake. Other characters in the book are in the gang for ulterior motives from the accountant to the grunts and drivers, that's to be expected. But for Billy, he just wants to be liked.I thought that the scenes were pretty enjoyable. It's similar to the book of \\"The Catcher and the Rye\\" and the famous film \\"The Graduate\\" starring Dustin Hoffman who I believe is in the movie version of this book. Reading this book will make you think like a teenager and might even bring back some memories you might have of being unsure of yourself or wanting to be accepted within a group. It should take a week to a couple of weeks depending on the time in your reading sessions."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"Set in 1935, &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot; tells the story of how its title character, a 15-year-old street kid from the Bronx, apprentices himself to one of the most formidable gangsters in New York. Thomas E. Dewey, the special public prosecutor of New York who later was to run for president against Roosevelt and Truman, is making a name for himself by going after mob figures, and Dutch Schultz is one of his prime targets. Dutch's gang is involved in the operation of breweries, nightclubs, and labor unions, and they're not shy about disposing of their enemies through symbolically gruesome means, as we see what happens to two scab window washers. To evade taxes they launder their money through a small town upstate called Onondaga.Billy becomes attracted to the flamboyant gang and slowly ingratiates his way inside by doing small jobs for them. Besides the charismatic but tragic Dutch, other members include the friendly Otto Berman, who loves playing with numbers and becomes Billy's fatherly mentor, the brutish muscle Lulu, the silently perceptive Irving, and Mickey the driver. Billy narrates in the first person with a unique voice, using run-on sentences that display his enthusiasm to be playing with the big boys.The novel begins &quot;in medias res&quot; with a scene of one of Dutch's disloyal henchmen being fitted for a pair of cement shoes. The man's girlfriend, a voluptuous high-society blonde with a complicated private life, becomes Dutch's moll, and Dutch gives Billy the assignment to keep her company when the gang hides out in Onondaga for the summer. Eventually Billy realizes that her life might be in danger as a possible witness to her ex-boyfriend's murder, and one of the best parts of the novel is his clever plan to get her out of harm's way. In the novel's tense climax, Dutch plots to assassinate Dewey, an event which, if carried out, would certainly change the course of history as we know it.As in &quot;Ragtime,&quot; Doctorow is eminently able to evoke a romantic but realistic New York City of a time long past that perhaps was quieter but not necessarily more innocent sexually or morally. Doctorow obviously enjoys using the city and figures from history as a canvas on which to create his fiction, and his joy is infectious to the reader. I certainly wish I could have spent a teenage summer having Billy's experiences. Invoking the excitement of a boyhood adventure in an entirely original milieu, written with maturity and panache, &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot; is a novel Mark Twain would have saluted."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"Coming of age story meets historical fiction meets old timey true crime in this relatively absorbing tale of the waning months of legendary New York gangster Dutch Schultz. Set in 1934-35, the story is narrated by a poor, 15-year-old, Irish-Catholic dropout from the tenements of the East Bronx. Like all the other boys his age, Billy lives in awe of the city's big-time gangsters, and Schultz's money, charisma, and fame are powerful lures. Although Billy is fatherless and his mother is more than slightly unhinged, he's ambitious, and so manages to make himself useful as a gopher at Schultz's numbers-running headquarters, where he catches the eye of Otto Berman, Schultz's cerebral right-hand man.As Schultz's small empire of booze, broads, numbers, and extortion starts to crumble under pressure from the feds and more powerful competitors, Billy evolves from mascot to trusted intimate -- especially after witnessing the Schultz's murder of one of his main henchmen in a scene that results in Schultz's appropriation of the man's moll as his own. The moll turns out to be a kind of young society dame out for kicks, and as the gang lies low in the upstate town of Onondaga, she and Billy develop a secret friendship that implausibly turns torridly sexual. What's nice about the book is that Billy isn't a thoughtless foot soldier, but understands Schultz's temperament and increasing instability, and is honest in tempering the glamorous side of the kingpin's with a clear view of his brutality and excesses. And though Billy can't see an immediate exit for himself (nor does he especially want one), he does recognize that if the woman doesn't leave, she's in great danger. The highlight of the book is his scheme to engineer her separation from Schultz without letting her, or anyone in the gang onto what he's doing.Doctorow does an excellent job of showing the disintegration of the gang and of Schultz himself, as the inner circle stoically stands firm on what is clearly a sinking ship. In the final section, Schultz is under attack from special prosecutor Thomas Dewey (the future presidential candidate), and Billy is sent to follow him and work out a plan for his assassination. This sets the stage for a gripping ending which includes a classic gangland slaying, a meeting with Lucky Luciano, and Billy's attempt to make off with Schultz's rather substantial cash reserve. Which is not to say the book is a mere crime thriller -- there are strong running themes concerning identity and the American mythology of the self-made man. There's also Billy's quest for a father figure, not to mention his sexual awakening, loss of innocence, and more. Doctorow's prose is perhaps a little too restrained and the dialogue veers somewhat toward speechifying at times, but on the whole it reads well. The characterization is fairly vivid, although it's hard to stay away from the usual gangster and Depression-era stereotypes. Billy is somewhat problematic, a 15-year-old with altogether to much perception of the adult world around him. Of course, without this perception, there is no book, and this is a kind of necessary evil one comes across all too often in fiction narrated by teenagers and written by adults. It's a good book,but not a great one, and perhaps of greatest interest to those interested in New York of the mid-'30s."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"I recently finished Billy Bathgate, so the book is still fresh in my mind. I have to say, as a first-time reader of Doctorow, that I was not disappointed, and that I was definitely surprised. The surprise stemmed, probably, from the fact that I rarely read 'modern' authors. I find their work too cookie-cutter, lacking in imagery and effective language,extremely forgettable, and one dimensional. Well, Doctorow is none of these things. Personally, I don't think I will ever forget Billy Bathgate. The title character himself is too engaging to be forgotten, too understandable, human, and too deserving of just the right amounts of sympathy and exasperation. His narrative invokes memories of Holden Caulfield, Nick Carraway, and strangely enough, Dr. Watson. Doctorow peppers his text with delightful run-ons, sentence fragments, and old-fashioned American profanity. I say delightful because all three of these classic no-no's are incorporated perfectly into the words coming out of Billy's mouth and from his memory. Perfect grammar would be undesirable in this case, because Billy thinks in fragments and acts in run-ons. I think we would miss out on half of his personality and being if he didn't come across as a boy made out of the broken pieces of one big, dangling participle. Don't let reviews dissing the grammar deter you from reading this book, I suppose I'm trying to say. The imagery is beautiful, the descriptions (especially of people, but also of places, smells, buildings, scenes,) are sheer perfection. They hit the nail on the head. Sit back and watch the mental movie your mind will unfold for you. This is one of those books that will give you End-Of-Book-Withdrawal.I'm very much looking forward to reading Doctorow's other works."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"EL Doctrow's talent with language is a step or two or three or four beyond that of the average scrivener. And even of the somewhat above average scrivener. Most of us aspire to prose as good as his without ever quite achieving it. But sometimes in this book he is a bit undisciplined in the application of his talent, and gets himself in trouble as a result. It's evident right from the first chapter, when passages like this:\\"He had to have planned it because when we drove onto the dock the boat was there and the engine was running and you could see the water churning up phosphorescence in the river, which was the only light there was because there was no moon, nor no electric light either in the shack where the dockmaster should have been sitting, nor on the boat itself, and certainly not from the car, yet everyone knew where everything was....\\"...and this:\\"But anyway I wasn't thinking of any of this at the time, it was just something I had in me I could use if I had to, not even an idea but an instinct waiting in my brain in case I ever needed it, or else why would I have leapt lightly over the rail...\\"...establish his protagonist Billy Bathgate as a capable, savvy, and colloquially eloquent street urchin. Then, a few pages later, we get this:\\"I think now that the key to grace or elegance in any body, male or female, is the length of the neck, that when the neck is long several conclusions follow, such as a proper proportion of weight to height, a natural pride of posture, a gift for eye contact, a certain nimbleness of the spine and length of stride, all in all a kind of physical gladness in movement leading to athletic competence or a love for dancing. Whereas the short neck predicts a host of metaphysical afflictions, any one of which brings about the ineptitude for life that creates art, invention, great fortunes, and the murderous rages of the disordered spirit.\\"Those of you familiar with Mark Twain's hilarious evisceration of James Fenimore Cooper's literary offenses in \\"The Deerslayer\\" will recognize the problem. For those who aren't, think specifically of Twain's Rule #7:\\"They require that when a personage talks like an illustrated, gilt-edged, tree-calf, hand-tooled, seven- dollar Friendship's Offering in the beginning of a paragraph, he shall not talk like a negro minstrel in the end of it. But this rule is flung down and danced upon in the 'Deerslayer' tale.\\"Doctrow violates this rule too. Not as egregiously as Cooper, and not within one paragraph, and from the bottom up rather than the top down, but he still violates it. I'd have given Billy Bathgate a four or even five star rating if he'd been more consistent in his management of character voice."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate (BOMC)","review":"E.L.

Resenting their role as cannon fodder, fiercely independent, and blessed with a greater humanity than their bloodthirsty superiors, these five hundred men come to a crossroads. Under the leadership of their commander, Lieutenant Halliday - a wise, caring, yet brilliant officer - they decide that those responsible for a pointless war that devastated a country and corrupted a generation of young American men must be punished.So begins a new phase of the war - a phase that will shock a complacent America and bring the reality of war to their doorsteps. The men hijack an aircraft carrier and sail it from Vietnam, across the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, all the way to New York. As the ship progresses towards America's East Coast under radio silence, tensions rise in Washington as to the intentions of those on board. Nobody, not the President nor his National Security Advisor, can guess accurately what will happen next.And when an aircraft carrier loaded with thousands of tons of explosives and weapons arrives in New York with five hundred men bearing deadly intent, the consequences for New York and Washington, the soldiers sent to stop them, and ultimately the leadership of the nation, are deadly.This book details the campaign of these men in flashback, interspersed between snatches of the Congressional inquiry into Halliday's campaign, and subtly terrifying interrogation of the single man captured alive. A new, totalitarian America reveals itself in the aftermath of the war on Washington, and the point made by Halliday and his men is only proven.An America obsessed with the artifice of TV and Hollywood, spitting on its veterans even as it demanded ever more blood from them, wrapped up in consumerism, complacency and fear - all is laid bare in this brilliant novel that shows the average grunt on the ground often has a more highly-developed sense of morality than the leaders and citizenry who send them to war.A must-read."},{"Title":"Cut-Loose Quilts: Stack, Slice, Switch, and Sew","review":"This is a wonderful quilting book for anyone wanting to step out of their comfort zone and sew/make perfect quilts.

Charles Vivian, Compiled by Cooper EdensThe exciting and timeless tale about \\"the prince of thieves\\" is more beautiful than ever in this special \\"Classic Illustrated Edition\\" title. As with the series' previous titles -- \\"Peter Pan,\\" \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,\\" \\"Pinocchio\\" and \\"Aesop's Fables\\" -- \\"Robin Hood\\" is illustrated with a virtual best-of variety of color and black-and-white images from a collection of archival sources. There are more than 100 splendid images in all, dating from the 12th to the 20th century and created by artists as diverse as N.C. Wyeth, Howard Pyle, Walter Crane and Honor C. Appleton. The range is considerable, the fine-detail of the works is immensely impressive, the art restoration is impeccable, and each antique image is uniquely charming. The lack of a consistent visual style is initially jarring, but quickly it becomes apparent that this inconsistency is the very source of the book's appeal, particularly for retro fans attracted to ye olde graphics. The text itself remains loyal to E. Charles Vivian's classic version of the story -- with most of the content, spelling and grammar intact from the 1906 edition, making this respectful tribute to an old masterpiece worth its weight in gold marks."},{"Title":"Robin Hood: A Classic Illustrated Edition","review":"Robin Hood is a very interesting story that everyone should read. One thing that I liked about this book is that it is an adventure story where people take risks. As soon as one adventure is done, another starts right away, so it is endless adventure until the last page. In the story new things happen every page, which is another thing that I really like about this book. Also I like that Robin and his group help people in need and take from people who are wealthy.

The year is 1869, and Kate Whittington is a twenty-nine year old spinster teaching at the Catholic orphanage where she was left by her mother at the tender age of nine. One of the sisters tells Kate that their orphanage is to close and relocate to Minnesota. Because her mother was a prostitute, Kate has difficulty finding another place to live, not to mention a place to work.She discovers an advertisement in a newspaper where a Texas rancher is looking for a wife. She begins corresponding with the rancher and becomes enthralled with him after reading his letters. Kate and Reed Barton are married by proxy, and she travels to Texas to be with him.Upon her arrival in Texas, Kate discovers that Reed has been wounded when on a mission as a Texas Ranger. She nurses him back to health, only to discover that he neither wrote those letters to her nor wanted her as a wife.Though she is devestated, Kate agrees to stay on as Reed's housekeeper and care for his eight-year old son Daniel. This proves difficult as Daniel has recently been found after having been captured by the Comanches five years ago.Reed is shaken by his attraction to Kate as he has sworn off love thinking it an unnecessary emotion. His marriage to his first wife was difficult at best, and he is consumed with guilt concerning the manner in which she died.SUMMER MOON is an incredibly touching story that gives you an eyewitness view into the heart of the hero and heroine. Kate is such a remarkable woman, gifted with the ability to love though constantly faced with rejection, first from her mother and later from Reed. She is such a likeable heroine that one finds oneself crying with her as she faces heartache. Though damaged by his father's betrayal and the strained relationship with his first wife, Reed is strengthened by Kate's unconditional love enabling him to overcome the demons of his past. This is a truly superb novel, one that leads you on an emotional rollercoaster ride that will not soon be forgotten."},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"Summer Moon is the story of Kate Wittington, a woman who at the age of nine was dropped off at an orphanage by her prostitute mother. When Kate is twenty-nine the orphanage closes and she must decide what she's to do with her life. She answers an ad in the newspaper for a woman to be a mail-order bride. She takes a chance and answers the ad and is the lucky woman who is chosen to be the wife of Reed Benton. When she arrives in Texas she finds out the shocking truth. She married Reed Benton by proxy but he knows nothing of their marriage. It seems they were both tricked by Reed's father, Reed Benton Sr., a devious and scheming man who devised a plan to get his son back home to the Lone Star Ranch. When Reed Jr. returns to the ranch, wounded, and with his son who has been raised by the Commanche for the past six years he finds out he's married to Kate. Since he's wounded and can't care for his son he hires Kate on as his housekeeper and caregiver to his son Daniel.This book was very entertaining and very easy to read. The characters were very life-like and well developed. Every character in the book has a purpose and they serve their purpose well. Ms. Landis seems to have thought out her character before she began writing. Even the secondary characters are well rounded. They all add to the story in their own way.Summer Moon moves along at a steady pace. Again, the storyline seems to have been well thought out before the book was started. The author clearly had every scene planned out and this makes the book very enjoyable to read. The book doesn't seem choppy or hurriedly put together. It just seems like a well planned book about everyday characters on the Texas frontier.Summer Moon is an excellent read. I was able to finish this book in just two days. I couldn't put this book down. I wanted to find out what was going to happen but at the end didn't want the book to end. I felt like I personally knew the characters and could feel their emotions. Summer Moon is a great book and will make a great addition to any romance lover's or Western romance lover's library."},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"I enjoyed Summer Moon very much. Jill Marie Landis is a wonderful story teller - she keeps you captive with her great plot, and with her fabulous dialogue makes you feel her stories. I especially enjoy her historical facts that must require a lot of research, but are so woven in the story that you just get swept away. This novel made me feel a part of the Texas history, and I loved the main characters! I have read ALL of her books, and recommend them highly. Curl up, and enjoy her amazing ability to weave a romantic tale."},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"Summer moon is the story of Kate, an orphan turned schoolteacher and the love she has for Reed an ex-Texas ranger.Corresponding with Reed via letter she falls in love with him and agrees to a marriage by proxy. Little does she know that Reed knows nothing about the letters, and the letters were truly written by Reed's aging father in an elaborate scheme to get him to finally marry.While this plot is certainly nothing new, Jill manages to breath new life into an otherwise tired plotline, with her clear writing style and attention to historic detail.What I like most about Jill's writing is she manages to portray the predjudices and attitudes of the time without the 'politically correct' glasses worn by many romance authors. She simply states things as they are without making the heroine a radical reformer or an instrument of social change.My only real quibble with this book was I thought the hero Reed was a little to self-pitying as a character. If he isn't running away from his problems... IE, his dominating father, his wife who used him for his money, his son's problems acclimating to Anglo culture. He stands around making frustrating 'noises' and using the heroine. I would've much preferred the hero to be more mature and responsible.Surprisingly, the story is interesting enough to read, despite the under whelming hero. I would recommend this book to all Landis fans!"},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"I traditionally read books by Grisham and Koontz but was drawn to this book while browsing the local bookstore.

I liked the historican aspect of the book and the fact that the author told the story through a variety of perspectives, unlike most books I read. When i finished reading I was disappointed that I would no longer be reading about these interesting charachters. I would be willing to read other books by the same author after experiencing this story."},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"*Spoilers Throughout*Kate, daughter of a whore, but raised by nuns is finally taking her life into her own hands. For months she's been corresponding with Reed in Texas. They get married via proxy and she comes to claim her husband. But when she gets there her new \\"husband\\" has never heard of her and she discovers that it was Reed's father who wrote to her all those months, trying to get his son a bride. Reed is less than pleased. Reed has brought home his son Daniel, believed dead in the same raid that killed his mother, but instead he was taken and raised by the Comanche. Reed gets Kate to take care of Daniel until he can arrange an annulment.I have to start out by saying to me this book isn't a romance, it seems like it wants to be, but I never bought into any of the romantic elements. The first sex scene (1 of 2) was utterly bizarre. She is yet to actually say hello to the man because he was brought in wounded when she shows up. She thinks he is her husband and she goes to check on him as he is having a fever dream. Reed thinks she is his first wife, Becky, and afterwards they just forget about it. It's very weird that a woman RAISED BY NUNS is going to be so laid back about casual sex, that she isn't going to demand he does the right thing for her, that she isn't worried about a possible baby or something. I never believed that Reed cared for her and at the end I didn't believe that he actually loved her.For me I was much more invested in the storyline involving Reed's son, Daniel, or Fast Pony, as he calls himself. It seemed honest and realistic as we learn about his loyalty to his adopted family and also as he comes to terms with who his real father is and bonds with Kate. Also the character of Charm was, well, charming. She is a young former whore whom Kate befriends. All the characters are likable, there are no villains there. Even the Comanche are portrayed as sympathetic. The problem I have with this book is Reed. Everyone is so likable and real, while Reed might be real but he's not very likable. He is a typical wounded hero, who's wife ran around on him, holds himself responsible for losing his son and his wife's death and had a toxic relationship with his father. These are the kinds of heroes I just eat up, but Reed was too cold, he didn't care about any one or any thing and I couldn't feel any sympathy for him in the slightest.I know I am being rather negative, but I really did enjoy this book. It's a traditional western with cowboys and indians, saloons, and hot Texas sun, and if you don't mind that the romance here is a bit on the shallow side you will definitely enjoy this book.4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"I found the book to be absolutely wonderful. How Kate struggled to get what she really deserved in life and almost lost it. How she kept true to herself when it came to the preacher. The little boy just broke my heart.

With no place to go, Kate reads an ad from a Texas rancher wanting a wife, so she corresponds with him. She and Reed Benton hit it off by mail, marry by proxy, and she heads to his ranch.When Kate arrives at his ranch, she finds her father-in-law has just died. Her husband is recovering from a bullet he received during a Texas Ranger raid on a Comanche camp. His son Daniel behaves more like an Indian because that is where he has been raised for five years. Everything is a shocker to Kate, but she and Reed make love that night. The next day, Reed asks Kate who she is? Kate says they wed by proxy, but they conclude that his deceased father forged his signature. Reed keeps Kate as a temporary housekeeper to help him with Daniel, who wants to return to his tribe. She falls in love with the father and his son, but Reed refuses to acknowledge his love for Kate.SUMMER MOON is an exciting Americana romance that stars strong realistic characters struggling to do the right thing especially for Daniel. The story line is interesting as the reader becomes very familiar with Kate, Reed, and Daniel, which in turn allows understanding of each one's motives. Award winning Jill Marie Landis shows why she is held in high esteem by sub-genre fans and who adore a strong mid-nineteenth century tale of love."},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"I read Christian novels because they are usually clean.

But after reading one of the authors more current books, I was disappointed to find this one filled with mild foul language and detailed intimate scenes. I'm sorry I bought it.

But love wins out!This is a first read of Landis' writing. I would have enjoyed more historical material. Altho it was a cozy romance, I cannot see giving it a 4 and 5 star review.

I cannot write a fluffy novel like this and get it published!"},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"Summer Moon started strong the first 40 or so pages. After the first love scene however, it really went down hill and became somewhat boring and mediocre for me. I first became disappointed after the housekeeper Sophia and the father of the hero trick the heroine and the hero with the mail order bride scheme. Reed Benton, Junior the hero comes back to the Lone Star homestead, his father is dead and he is gravely injured after fighting as a Ranger in a Comanche Indian raid. He is seriously wounded. In his bed he mistakes the heroine as his dead wife and has sex with the her. I just find this plot very far-fetched. How many people have a romantic romp soon after being shot and wounded barely holding on to life? Not believable for me at all.Like other reviewers I was routing for the minister and Kate to get together, he was a much more attractive mate for the heroine, even though I knew by the obvious and predictable setups that Kate would wind up with Reed, who was not that endearing. Not a great romance if you're hoping that the two main characters do not wind up together. Grade C-very average"},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"What a yawn.

I picked this up at a UBS and read it on a long haul flight last week. I was quite disappointed. The author writes well enough but here is what I found problematical:1 - rather un-PC in dealing with the Comanches2 - redemption of the un-PC attitude not rectified until the epilogue3 - our hero wasn't much of a father (or son for that matter)4 - the heroine chose the wrong man, IMOThe secondary character, the Rev Preston Marshall, made a much more interesting and attractive hero than Reed Benton, and his emotions and feelings were deeper and far more sympathetic than Reed's. Reed, IMO, was very immature unlike the heroine, Kate. Kate's early years and 20s were tough and difficult but she rose to overcome them. Reed, however, acted like a spoilt rich boy, made a stupid choice of first wife (complete with the in-laws from hell) and treated his son very badly. Young Daniel, Reed's son, was perhaps the most interesting character of all as we are shown a white world through the eyes of a small boy captured in a Comanche raid and raised by apparently loving Indian parents.Not sure about this author. Magnolia Creek was also a good enough read though not outstanding. I am giving her one more try but if there is no improvement, may not continue with her. However, if Preston Marshall should ever get his own well-deserved story, I'll be in the queue to read it!"},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"This is the first historical romance novel that I've read in years as I've been concentrating more on contemporary women's fiction, but this story is quite different but it captured me and I enjoyed the author's formal use of language to set the tone in this charming tale set during the Indian American war. I found myself thinking of the characters after I turned the last page and that's always a sign of excellent writing and a great story.Kate Whittington spent her early years as the daughter of the town whore - not very well taken care of and ostracized by \\"polite society\\". When her mother realizes she can no longer take care of her, she abandons her on the steps of the local orphanage, where she grows to become an educated teacher, but trigger-shy about men, she remains unmarried but years for a family of her own but thinks that at almost 30, it may be too late. Then she spots an ad in a local newspaper placed by a man who lives far away in Texas, advertising for a mail-order bride.This tale may have been told before but Jill Marie Landis creates a fine drama and enlivens this story with vivid characters and the wild frontier of Texas as a fine backdrop. There's a twist to this story, the Texan that she thinks she's been corresponding with doesn't seem to know who she is and their first meeting is confusing but sets the stage for a battle of wills that neither is prepared for.As in most romance novels, the attraction is almost immediate, but Landis takes the time to slowly build her characters so that you discover their personalities and their histories in such a way that you begin to understand how their lives have led them to each other.We eventually learn that it was Reed, Sr. that wrote the letters to Kate, without his son knowing and her arrival comes at a bad time, or is it perfect timing? Reed, Jr. has recently discovered his son, Daniel, once abducted during an Indian raid on his property, where he wife was left injured and died shortly after. While embarking on another raid, he discovers that Daniel has been raised with the Indians and the boy does not wish to return to Lone Star with him, but Reed is not about to lose his son once again and forces him to return with him. Although sparks do fly between the two, the discovery of their marriage by proxy creates a difficult situation, but Kate decides to stay on as a housekeeper.Her primary responsibility is to care for Daniel. Once Kate lays eyes on the adorable, but heart-broken little boy, she finds the stirrings of love that she has felt for students in the past. She starts trying to teach him English and cares for him, initially as a house keeper and later finds that she loves him with a mother's heart.Eventually Kate finds companionship with the local preacher and maybe her hopes of love and family aren't lost when he professes his feelings for her. Can Kate put aside the feelings she has grown for Reed and instead plan a life with the minister? Will Reed let his second chance at love slip through his fingers? Jill Marie Landis keeps it very interesting as we find out the answer and we discover what love really means for all involved.I was impressed with the breadth of this novel and Landis' story telling talent. Once I got my head around the fact that this story is in a very specific genre, I was able to sustain my disbelief enough to get carried away in this story. I don't know if I'm going to continue to read more historical romance, but I was intrigued to find that Jill Marie Landis has written some contemporary novels and I'm looking forward to reading Heat Wave to see how she handles a modern-day story."},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"I enjoy a quality romance novel as well as I do any other well-written, creative book with memorable characters. Unfortunately, Summer Moon does not totally fit my bill. It will, however, likely satisfy avid readers of formula mass-market romance paperbacks.Kate Whittington, a prostitute's daughter raised in a Catholic orphanage in the late 1800s, answers a \\"wife wanted\\" ad and finds herself living in Texas with a landowner who may or may not actually be her husband. She is also charged with raising and taming the landowner's Comanche-raised son. Throw in sideplots involving a reforming prostitute, the landowner's best friend, and the town minister who falls in love with Kate and the book falls into a comfortable, predictable, formula romance.While Landis obviously knows how to write (the plot moves smoothly from event to event and her structure is clear), creativity does not seem to be her strong suit here. All her characters are predictably gorgeous, ruggedly handsome, sexy, and/or heroically beautiful. The plot is as predictable as a hot Texas summer, replete with cowboys and indians.Despite these negatives, Landis admirably limits the novel's most intimate moments to suggestively sexy scenes that stroke the libido without resorting to the graphic anatomical grossness so prevalent in today's romance books. And in the end, she deftly weaves her swooning prose into a predictable but romantic payoff that will please avid romance fans."},{"Title":"Summer Moon","review":"This was my first book by this author and I am not sure what to think.

This was one of the best books I have ever read.I'm a big fan of PC Doherty's historical mysteries, so in one sense I am a biased reviewer. This book was different from much of his series fiction however. He retains his excellent ability to make the reader feel as if he is living the historical period, capturing the details, both pleasant and gritty. He also nicely builds suspense as usual. What is different is that this not historical mystery but historical horror.The fantasy/horror element had a very catholic flavor. (Or at least, a flavor that seemed very catholic from my protestant viewpoint.) That is to say the 'rules' that the fantastic followed were compatible with the religious beliefs of Elizabethan England and Europe when the story occurs, and the struggles between catholic and protestant churches of the time is very much an element of the story.The characterizations and relationships of the main characters are very convincing. The romantic subplot that accompanies the main adventure/horror plot is well done, and nicely reinforces the main plot.I cannot say enough how much I approved of this book.

Paul Doherty has the rare talent of making you feel as though you are there, be it medieval England, or battling with Alexander. The sounds and smells of the period seem to waft from the pages of his books.Poor Rebecca Lennox, the eighteen-year-old daughter of a former priest is regarded as cursed by the local villagers. The reason for their fear is the fact that not only has Rebecca a cleft palate but she has the gift of second sight. She find solace in the statue of the Archangel St. Michael and prays to him constantly within the wall of her old parish church.But then a young Catholic priest arrives in the village and it seems that the poor girl has final found a confidant. The priest is not repelled by her infirmity and his gentleness reminds the girl of her beloved statue. But then things change when a new parson comes to the village.

First readers take pleasure in reading these on their own."},{"Title":"Scrambles amongst the Alps in the years 1860-69,","review":"Since I first read this little classic, Edward Whymper's book on scrambling in the Alps has always been my favorite mountaineering book. Something about his style of writing makes one feel they have not only read a delightful tale, they have actually incorporated it into their own memory. His pencil etchings are so evocative, you can almost smell the brisk air of Zermatt and feel the weathered texture of the Swiss dwelling. You can once again experience the thoughts of trepidation and anticipation which accompany a good outing in the mountains. This is Victorian mountain writing at its very best, in an age before high technology and polarfleece added safety and comfort but put some palpable distance between you and the experience and blunted the directness of your perceptions and observations. I've spent many of my own happy hours scrambling in the Alps, but somehow Whymper makes it seem like I'm doing it anew. Sure, it's always interesting to read of the difficulties of Everest or the tales of hardship on Half Dome, but Whymper was among the first, and high technology and modern photography have not allowed us to better put you into the heart of the experience."},{"Title":"Scrambles amongst the Alps in the years 1860-69,","review":"I read this as historical research but quickly fell in love with it as a work of literature. There's a lot of first-we-did-this and then-we-did-that, but when Whymper moves away from chronological reporting, he shows himself to be one hell of a good writer. His conquest of the Matterhorn and the tragedy that quickly followed give the book its emotional core. If you like adventure stories, I don't know how you don't love this."},{"Title":"Scrambles amongst the Alps in the years 1860-69,","review":"I have enjoyed very much reading this book. That's why I award it with 5 stars, it is amongst my favourite books of mountaneering, with Lionel's Terray Conquerers of the useless.Although it has some chapters with technical details about glaciers, railway tracks and so on, it is amazing to be involved in the gold age of alpinism."},{"Title":"Scrambles amongst the Alps in the years 1860-69,","review":"A wonderful story of non-technical climbing from the 19th century. Inspiring."},{"Title":"A Cowman's Wife","review":"A Cowman's Wife is a fasinating account of one woman's adventure in south-western Arizona. Mary Kidder Rak captured this chapter of her life in very personal and humurous terms as well as giving us a glimpse into ranch life in the early 1900's. If you're looking for a book that gives you an up close and personal view of the life of an adventurous woman or of life in the American SW., this is a must read! PS: Check your maps for the ranch Mary and her husband lived on, it's still a landmark!"},{"Title":"A Cowman's Wife","review":"As a native Arizonan, I spent many years in and around the area of the setting of this book. The descriptions are crisply accurate, and the author's affinity for the West emerges on every page. She tells mini-stories with wry amusement spiced with realism so that readers are drawn into the daily life that cattlemen of that era lived. As shown in the wolf hunt chapter, the daily wrestle with nature and life in the West is not minimized into misled modern concern for animals with fangs. This is no glamorous depiction.Readers aren't treated to romantic fake napery and crystal settings on the table as so many popular Western writers like to feature. Instead, there are honest portrayals of a happily satisfying life among the cactus, cowboys and horses."},{"Title":"How to Have a Big Wedding on a Small Budget: Cut Your Wedding Costs by Half--Or More!","review":"Boy, some really mean-spirited reviewers below! I bought the first edition of this book in 1990 when I was overwhelmed with planning my own wedding, and every other planning guide just assumed my family would jump at the chance to spend $10K (then the average wedding cost) on a one-day event. I thought then and still think this book was one of the best purchases I made that year, not because the ideas were so wonderful but because Warner's tone was so very encouraging -- you CAN have a classy wedding on a budget, even if you've never planned a large scale event before. I think so highly of it, I've recommended it to several friends. I found the organization suggestions particularly helpful. Yes, many of the ideas are found in other books, but how many wedding planning guides are you going to buy? This is a wedding, not the invasion of Normandy. The best aspect of this book is that it makes you think creatively of ways you can save money on your special day -- if you don't want to rent chairs from the local funeral home, maybe you can rent them from some other community organization. True, not everybody does have a cutting garden at their disposal, but I plan an annual event for 300 people at the height of the Maryland azalea season where people regularly &quot;donate&quot; cuttings from their bushes. If a suggestion isn't appropriate for your situation, move on. Just think creatively. And buy the book."},{"Title":"How to Have a Big Wedding on a Small Budget: Cut Your Wedding Costs by Half--Or More!","review":"I seriously doubt whether or not Diane Warner has planned anyone's wedding except her daughter's. Some of her &quot;brilliant&quot; money-saving ideas are just plain laughable. Can't afford a big cake? Make one out of Styrofoam and have someone stand behind it, serving a regular sheet cake. Can't afford a honeymoon? Tell everyone you know you're going to the Bahamas and stay at home for a week.Give me a break. Sometimes, cutting corners cuts good taste right in half."},{"Title":"How to Have a Big Wedding on a Small Budget: Cut Your Wedding Costs by Half--Or More!","review":"When we announced our engagement, all of our recently married friends gave us the books they used during their wedding planning and this book ended up with us. The title spoke to our needs since we are paying for the event ourselves yet would like to have a fancy affair. I agree with an earlier post which suggested that the author has most likely never planned a wedding other than her daughter's. She speaks of the specific budget cutting steps her family took and expects that they would work for everyone. She tries (but fails) to come across as an expert, but I found myself hesitant to trust her ideas. The amount of money in the various budgets she suggested were rediculously low to the point where I am sure she was making them up - she couldn't have honestly found these prices anywhere (believe me - I have tried). Some of her suggestions were just sad and I found myself wanting to hear from her daughter to see if she had really been happy with her wedding because I could not imagine including some of these very cheesy suggestions in my wedding. A much more helpful book is Bridal Bargains.Good luck with the plans!"},{"Title":"How to Have a Big Wedding on a Small Budget: Cut Your Wedding Costs by Half--Or More!","review":"I bought this book after I got engaged. I have since read it twice, looking for ideas that may help me save at my wedding. I found several ideas that I could try, although most are directed at the do-it-yourselfers. I can't seem to find the time to do all the planning, along with making decorations, baking food and growing flowers. As a young woman with a small baby to raise, I found this book helpful with some nice ideas, but without the time to do them in. Overall this was a good book for those that have the time and energy to make most of the wedding yourself. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people."},{"Title":"How to Have a Big Wedding on a Small Budget: Cut Your Wedding Costs by Half--Or More!","review":"Although this is not the best bridal budget book, its still, all in all, a good book with some good ideas. It does stress getting everyone involved, which for some, is welcoming. If you're a bride who has a family who's always giving you their 2 cents worth, this may be the budget planning book for you. It will get everyone involved in planning, helping and setting up for your wedding. If not, there are a few tips you can still use. Diane Warner has many books worth reading and I think she's knowledgeable in her ideas. This book is much better than Denise and Alan Fields' \\"Bridal Bargains\\". The book itself is more comfortable to read and hold (it's a standard size book with dark, large print, which \\"Bridal Bargains\\" is definetly not!) Besides, Diane Warner has some very original ideas which are legal and \\"Bridal Bargains\\" tells you some not so \\"authorized by law\\" ideas. Compare the two and I'm sure you'll agree, Diane Warner's \\"Big Wedding on a Small Budget\\" is much better! Just glimpse through and you'll see what I'm talking about."},{"Title":"How to Have a Big Wedding on a Small Budget: Cut Your Wedding Costs by Half--Or More!","review":"This book was a lifesaver! I called a friend who was an amateur photographer. I had her take some photos of us and also reviewed her portfolio. We discussed the photos she took of us and what we liked and didn't like. We made a list of must have shots and ideas we had in mind. They came out beautiful!The cake we purchased from Albertson's. Who would have thought of purchasing a cake from the grocery store? But I saved a couple hundred dollars and it was beautiful and delicious. I knew what I had in mind for the cake and the baker listened to my thoughts and added some from her own experience and we came up with the perfect cake! They make cakes often enough so they turn out beautifully, but not so often that they don't get excited about creating the perfect cake for you.These are a couple of the suggestions I used to save a ton of money. While not all worked for me, they did help me think creatively in planning and saving money on the things I needed to spend money on."},{"Title":"How to Have a Big Wedding on a Small Budget: Cut Your Wedding Costs by Half--Or More!","review":"I bought this book last year early in my wedding planning process. I was determined to have the wedding my fiance and I wanted and not what everyone else wanted or what other people expected. There are so many great ideas in here, though I might agree that some of them may not be my taste. My fiance and I were paying for our entire wedding ourselves and wanted to save some money for a downpayment on a house. With the ideas in here, we did just that, and even more than we expected. You obviously won't use every idea in this book but it really opens your eyes to other possibilities. You do yourself what you can handle, don't be afraid to ask for help, decide what you don't mind spending a little extra on (for us that was the photography) and you can have a ceremony, reception and honeymoon for an amount you are able to afford. People still tell me, nearly a year later, how beautiful our wedding was and how it really reflected *us*. This book gave us the ideas to do that within our budget."},{"Title":"How to Have a Big Wedding on a Small Budget: Cut Your Wedding Costs by Half--Or More!","review":"I bought this book when I began my wedding planning three years ago. I recently passed it on to my best friend with this caveat, which I'll share with other brides out there: the ideas aren't for everyone. Some of the ideas are quite practical, such as altering a dress you find elsewhere to fit you, whether it's from a family member, friend or you find it through the want ads. However, she does advocate asking a lot of people for help, which I personally think would be seen as begging for things you should never ask your guests for. I would never have felt comfortable going to my neighbors and asking to cut a bunch of flowers out of their yard (hello, most people plant flowers to have them in their yard, not to give them to you. Unless you live next door to Martha Stewart and get the flowers from her cutting garden, I don't think this is realistic) or asking them to bring a dish to my wedding. Although people do offer to help when you get engaged, I think it's insensitive and frankly tacky to ask them to take on a huge responsibility like making dishes or donating sheet cakes. I have a hard time believing that there are many people out there who are so poor they have to rely on neighbors to cater and decorate their wedding, and if you ask people to do these things you had better be dirt poor, because I wouldn't agree to do this kind of stuff while I was eyeing your brand-new car in the driveway. It is absolutely possible to have a nice wedding on a small budget -- my husband and I had a very elegant wedding, albeit only for 50 people, for under $4,000. I used some tips from this book and did a lot of the work myself, including making favors and centerpieces out of silk flowers. My advice is see what you can do yourself, but leave the stuff that requires a lot of expertise -- designing fresh flower arrangements, catering, cake-making, dressmaking -- to a professional. You wouldn't try to give yourself a root canal, so don't try to sew your own dress unless you have a lot of experience. (And as for relying on a family member or &quot;free seamstress&quot; to sew wedding or bridesmaid dresses -- forget it. There are some fantastically horrifying stories out there about brides who did this and paid the consequences on their wedding day -- which you don't really get to &quot;redo&quot; even if you get remarried.)"},{"Title":"How to Have a Big Wedding on a Small Budget: Cut Your Wedding Costs by Half--Or More!","review":"I enjoyed reading this book very much. Like many people said before, it's very comforting. I haven't been to many weddings and had no idea what is costing how much in a wedding. I really appreciate Ms. Warner's breakdown on average cost per category in different geographical areas. She then provides alternatives and gives estimates. It helps me decide how much I want to be involved in order to save money. From what I understand, this book is intended for those Do-It-Yourself-ers. That's why there isn't much information on choosing vendors. It's a mistake to compare it with Bridal Bargains. Both books are good, for different people. The only thing I don't like is the use of language such as &quot;Fool them with ...&quot; Other than that, it's a good book."},{"Title":"How to Have a Big Wedding on a Small Budget: Cut Your Wedding Costs by Half--Or More!","review":"I bought this book while planning my wedding in 1996, and found it invaluable! Yes you have to do some work, but what do you expect when you want to save money? Not all the ideas are for everyone, of course, but you can use whatever works for you and skip the rest -- if the photographer is important and the cake is not, splurge on the photographer and go cheap on the cake!I like that the author doesn't try to talk you out of having a beautiful wedding, but rather fits the beautiful wedding into whatever budget you have.

Yaaaah, no.Less than a chapter into it I had to look at the Copyright date to see how long ago it had been written. I'm sure she's a lovely person (I kinda feel bad for writing a bad review), but this book is really outdated.

I had no idea what I was getting into when I began planning mywedding and this book took me through the process step by step, providing wonderfully creative ideas along the way. If you are not willing to do some things yourself, her innovative ideas may not be practical for you. But let's face it, if you don't have a mint to spend on a one day event, you have to be willing to be a little creative, do some things for yourself, and ask for help from your friends and family. You will be amazed when this book helps you realize all of the (non-financial) resources they can provide to make your day special! With the help of this book, I managed to have a church wedding and dinner reception for 150 people, for just over $2500! I love knowing I had a hand in every aspect of planning my special day.I got so much out of this one that I also ended up getting her Honeymoon and Gifts and Decorations books, and have passed them all on to at least five other brides since then."},{"Title":"How to Have a Big Wedding on a Small Budget: Cut Your Wedding Costs by Half--Or More!","review":"this book was a lifesaver for me. i was really beginning to panic about where i was going to find the cash for my wedding. both my fiance and i are straight out of college and are working on student loans and are receiving no financial assistance from mom and dad. after looking at several estimates on all the costs, i became overwhelmed. i was sure i could only afford a wedding at the county courthouse. warner's book put things into perspective for me, and now i am excited about planning my own wedding and i've found i can have the extra special touches needed to have the story-book wedding. if you can't afford 20k for your wedding and don't mind doing some of the work yourself (or having family and friends help out), this book is perfect for you."},{"Title":"How to Have a Big Wedding on a Small Budget: Cut Your Wedding Costs by Half--Or More!","review":"I was referred to this book by another wedding planning book.

Like growing your own flowers -- it forgets to add that you'd have to start growing at least 2 years before the big day....and, you might not get any flowers worth displaying. And she really skirted over the fact that decorating with them would all have to happen **on your wedding day**. I'd rather spend the extra money and let someone else do it. That way I'd really have a wedding day and be a bride. Some of the ideas are good, but none of them are new -- they're in lots of other books and magazines. I read it once, cover to cover and haven't picked it up since then. And she always talked about her daughter's wedding -- it got to be a little much after the first 20 pages.

His spirit burns with rage and grieves with inexpressible sorrow; this book is glorious and beautiful, haunting and horrifying. Fishman's imagery is masterful as he describes the plight of defenseless victims with sensitivity and passion, yet provides readers with brief moments of beauty. He focuses on \\"wisps of memory ragged dips in thegrass\\" that represent the deaths of millions in a universe that cannot be healed. These are shattering poems of the death transports, camps, and burial sites where Jews hoped and prayed for a rescue that did not come.Maestros of death have existed since time began. The Holocaust was only one example. Fishman also revisits Vietnam, the Israeli Wars, and Hiroshima through the eyes of witnesses who survived to share that horror. Every place humans starve, burn, or wither, Fishman's heart is there. From the dark days of Hitler to the present, he mourns the losses and counts humanity's cost. His words are a ram's horn, a Shofar, aheart bringing truth out of darkness.

They sacked the place, burnt Chopin's Paris letters to his parents (preserved by his sister), and threw his Buchholtz piano from the window.\\"We were not there to hear it/ but we've learned the tune.\\"And though every song that follows in the next four sections also recounts destruction of some kind--the Jews of Toledo and the murder of Federico Garcia Lorca; 16 recountings of the Holocaust; poetic tales of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; and Israel's rebirth from ashes only to witness new conflagrations of Jews by suicide-- the poet finds \\"what I murmured to myself felt like the sweetest blessing.\\" And, with the epilogue comes his grandson, \\"A Child of the Millennium,\\" for whom \\"time ticks at his wrist like the gentlest rain.\\"For all the pain and suffering witnessed here, through Fishman's voice, there are also songs of life, in every page.--Alyssa A.

It is a concise and well written exposition of the term \\"discourse.\\" Sara Mills use and understanding of the term both historically and socially make this an invaluable tool to understanding the evolution of the term \\"discourse\\" from Foucault down to the systematic analysis of language and structure. She provides a foundation for the term while breaking down the complexities of the Foucauldian discourse theory and applying it to other critical theories that inform the way academics use language as a form of power, knowledge, and understanding. Mills outline moves the reader from the historical use and understanding of the term \\"discourse\\" to the process of the structure of discourse all the way to the application of discourse as a medium for critically reading, understanding, and analyzing the context of discourse through the the critical theories of Feminism, Colonial/Post-Colonial, and Sociolinguistic theories. This book packs a punch of formal and informal examples that helps the reader conceptualize the theoretical frameworks presented throughout the reading."},{"Title":"Mystery of the third mine (A Science fiction novel)","review":"I read this novel as a boy and later as an adult because I wanted to read it once more before giving it to a nephew. The third mine of the title is on an asteroid in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. What I found fun and interesting about the book is how Robert Lowndes carried contemporary life styles, crime, music, and baseball, into the future. The existence of outer space claim jumpers provides the context for the story, while Lowndes' imagination provided means for the good guys to combine their love of playing jazz with a form of morse code eye blinking to defeat listening devices. One of the characters chances on a baseball game being played on Ceres while he is fleeing criminals. I found Lowndes' description of how that game would be played in near zero gravity conditions delightful.I think this book would be a nice choice for any youngster looking for an easy read that combines mystery with science fiction."},{"Title":"TWENTY THREE YEARS: STUDY OF THE PROPHETIC CAREER OF MUHAMMAD","review":"This is the result of an angnostics study about Islam and Muhammad. It is well worth reading because it is a summation of the most important reflections one can have if it is supposed that Muhammads claims are erroneous and that Allah is not God. Moslems should read it certainly if they want to find out in which fields they have to prepare to give answers. Moslems often praise the infallibility of their prophet or their holy book. After reading this intelligent statement they might at least understand why their are people who think different. Muhammed is depicted as an extraordinairy, great man of his time and place, and the book he is responsible for should be regarded as a great book. But it appears to be the product of this man, more even of the political side of its originator.Although it is highly recommendable to read this book, there is yet a deficiency. Some arguments of the author are of the same faint quality as those arguments he wants to discuss away. His presupposition is that there is only the material and psychological world. And this narrows his horizon. A narrow horizon helps never really to get the full scope of reality.It might be called \\"scientific\\" and sober. But it is not the same as truth."},{"Title":"TWENTY THREE YEARS: STUDY OF THE PROPHETIC CAREER OF MUHAMMAD","review":"Ali Dashti is by no means a scholar and this book proves this point. This book is not a biography of Mohammad as it claims, but a book presenting a different view of how Mohammad and Islam emerged. Thus, when choosing to read this book, the reader should first have a background on Islam and the life of Mohammad, and use this book to get an opposing view on the issue.Clearly, as a biography this book is missing significant amount of well known and critical information. Also, as a scholarly work, it leaves a lot to be desired. His reasoning and documented notes are flawed or non-existent.The value of this book is in the fact that it provides an opposing view of Islam which is very much lacking, yet needed for a free thinking community. As such, this is a gutsy book which in my opinion will help in promoting free-thinking in the Islamic community even-though it will most likely promote hate in non-Moslem readers.This book provides ample ammo to those who want to discredit Islam although without sound proof or reasoning. But, note that Ali Dashti equally refutes Christianity and Judaism."},{"Title":"Admiral Harold R. Stark: Architect of Victory, 1939-1945 (Studies in Maritime History)","review":"There was curiosity in the air in the Navy in 1939 on who President Roosevelt was going to choose as the next Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) to succeed Admiral William D.Leahy. Roosevlt met with an assortment of head officer's abroad the USS Houston in the Caribbean before making his decision. After Roosevelt returned to Washington he made the announcement that Rear Admiral Harold R. Stark was to be the next (CNO). Stark was completely surprised by this, especially when there were over 50 admirals senior to him. Stark\`s appointment did not cause bitterness in any of the senior officers, because Stark was well known, and regarded as a good likeable person. It was said that Roosevelt met Stark for the first time in 1914 aboard the USS Patterson, when Stark was a Lieutenant ordered to take Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy, to his summer home. The trip itself must have sparked something because Roosevelt immediately became fond of Stark, which might have played a part in the Presidents decision in 1939. After Stark\`s appointment he quickly realized the challenge that was before him, he accepted the challenge with his head up and determined to do the best job he could. But Stark\`s term as (CNO) was hit with many hardships, the hardest would be his being at fault for not being ready when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941. Admiral Stark\`s life, especially the fruits of his hard work, would have been locked away forever in the military archives of history if it weren't for the endless work of B. Mitchell Simpson III resulting in his book, Admiral Harold R. Stark: Architect of Victory, 1939-1945. B. Mitchell Simpson III (1932-) spent 20 years researching the life of Admiral Stark, focusing on the controversial years of his term a (CNO). Simpson graduated from Colgate University, received an LLB from the University of Pennsylvania and a Ph D in history from the prestigious Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy (Tufts University). Simpson was also a Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy, which fueled in his love of Navy history. Simpson\`s other books showing his love of Navy history, the best know being War, Strategy, and Maritime power (1977). Simpson also co-authored with John B. Hattendorf and John R. Wadleigh, Sailors and Scholars: The Central History of the U.S. Naval war College (1989). Simpson's main thesis for the book is to shine a new light on Stark, removing the image of him only being remembered as the &quot;guy&quot; who was at fault for the many deaths of American soldiers at Pearl Harbor. The book starts by jumping right into Stark\`s career as (CNO) in 1939, and only gives a very brief summary of Stark\`s achievements before 1939 in the Preface. The book goes though a chronology World War II, with every move and almost every thought of Stark\`s from before we entered the war until the victory over Japan. The book ends with the U.S. investigations of the top military officers who were in control during the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. Simpson never fails to mention how Stark always had the Japanese on his mind before the attack, and how Stark kept his cool during the grueling questions of the investigations. Many important characters in this book included: President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, General George C. Marshal, and Admiral Ernest J. King were all friends and colleagues of Stark who all worked together in that difficult time in American history. Simpson tries to paint a different picture of Stark by describing in great detail Stark\`s Plan Dog memorandum, which helped persuade Congress to fund a two-ocean war. That act was described as one of the most important and strategic documents of World War II. Simpson also goes into great detail about Stark\`s work during the war instigating the BAC-1 conversations in 1941, being responsible for training and supporting the naval units involved in the 1944 Normandy invasion, and acting as an ambassador to Charles de Gaulle throughout most of the war. Simpson fails to capture the true essence of a complete biography by mostly writing about Stark's term as (CNO) till his retirement. Simpson's writing points more toward the good of Stark\`s administration than writing about any of the bad, which gives the reader the feeling that Simpson's sympathizing with Stark rather than just writing about his life. Many history reviewers agree that the downfall of this book is Simpson trying to clear Stark of blame for the attack on Pearl Harbor. A positive for the book is the accurate events of naval history and behind the scene accounts during the war. This makes the book highly recommended for college, university, and public libraries. Although Stark did his part throughout the war, he was not the Architect of Victory that Simpson states in the title."},{"Title":"Admiral Harold R.

In Playing My Mother's Blues, Valerie Wilson Wesley delves into the life of sisters Dani and Rose, and their mother Maria who now calls herself Mariah.Mariah married too young to a man much older than she. When Durrell Alexander comes along, his sweet-talking and tender lovemaking makes Mariah feel young again. Things are going well, until Mariah shoots him to death and goes to jail for twenty years. While reading the paper, she discovers that her ex- husband Hilton Dells has died. His death brings back memories of her daughters that she has not seen in twenty years. On the surface, it appears that her daughters are doing well. Dani is married, has a young child and is a successful woman in her own right. Rose, though not married is a successful educator. What Mariah does not know is what lies beneath the smiles. Dani, unhappy in her marriage has found happiness elsewhere, and is mimicking her mother's actions. Rose, happy with the secret rendezvous with her married lover, has discovered a lump in her (...). The funeral of Hilton Dells brings them face to face for the first time in two decades. When Dani's problem becomes evident and she flees the memorial service, Mariah follows her and takes her to her apartment to console her. Soon after, an angry Rose shows up at the apartment and all three women come to terms with the feelings of anger, abandonment and sorrow.I enjoyed how this story was told over the course of three days, the flashbacks and memories made me feel as if I was following the family from beginning to end. Flashing back in time, then fast forwarding to the present made each character complete and the story more dynamic. The transitions from past to present were smooth. I also enjoyed Wilson-Wesley's lyrical writing style. This is a book I highly recommend for your reading pleasure.JeanetteAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Playing My Mother's Blues","review":"Impetuous Maria left her spouse Hilton Dells for Durell Alexander. However, when she walked out on Hilton and became Mariah, she also abandoned her daughters seven year old Dani Carter and seventeen year old Rose. However, several months after she deserted her family for a love affair, the hotheaded Mariah killed her lover. She spent time in jail for the homicide while Hilton's sister Lucille raised her nieces especially the \\"baby\\".Maria reads an obit that Hilton just died. Whereas Dani overcame the betrayal, but remains curious about the woman she remembers filled with &eacute;lan; Rose has always acted as if their mom died years ago. Now the death of Hilton has brought to the surface the one guilt that Maria has tried to bury, abandoning her children. She wants to reconcile with them. Dani needs to understand her mom as she finds herself following her mother's path being marred with children, but having an affair. Rose, raging with rancor, wants nothing to do with the woman whose leaving devastated her. Lucille wants her former sister-in-law to stay away from her nieces. These four women meet ostensibly to bury Hilton but to exhume the past.The viewpoint constantly switches mostly between Mariah, Rose, and Dani, and to a much lesser degree Lucille so that the audience sees the same incident from dissimilar perspectives. For instance what seems like a molehill to Maria is Mt. Everest to Rose as each looks back to the late 1960s early 1970s differently. The fine character study enables the audience to understand how a pivotal event over two decades ago still fully impacts the players. Though at times the introspection can slow down the plot, fans will enjoy this family drama starring believable protagonists struggling to understand one another.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Playing My Mother's Blues","review":"As a believer in what \`goes around comes around', I found the story of mother and daughters very interesting. The ending did surprise me a bit, with the reasoning behind the actions of the mother, although the story does drive you to want to know - since you know there is a reason for their mysterious actions.Mariah (Maria) was a very interesting character. It was as if she had come to peace with the mistakes she made, yet she was determined to find out if others had forgiven her. I so enjoyed the way she allowed her honest and pure motherly love come out when reuniting with her daughters - her unashamed and open-armed way of welcoming them back to her life, not really caring what they felt about her, because she knew what she felt about them.Listening to Ms. Westly reading from the book gave me a deeper, richer insight to what Mariah (Maria) felt about her life. It's very enlightening when a reader can hear the story from the author herself.Rose, to me, was laden with guilt...so much that forgiveness was marred. I think she should have been more open to her mother. Dani was just young and the irony of her life is what made the story so deep to me, the fact that despite her ignorance she acted similarly to her mother. Lucille, I admired. She was loyal to her brother yet, open to hear the truth.Reading this book is highly recommended. It's a quick read that feels like a personal journal. It reads like non-fiction as it's realistic with a strong narrative.I enjoy Ms. Westly's book very much no matter the genre she writes in, from mystery to romance she's extremely talented and her stories touch the human in all of us ... right in the eye."},{"Title":"Playing My Mother's Blues","review":"I enjoyed this book. I have to disagree with the review stating that it was hard to tell who was speaking. I thought Ms. Wesley made it very clear as to which voice was being heard by giving each character her own chapter. I was a little surprised however by Rose having such a negative attitude with her mom..I mean she did play a part into the reason her mother was incarcerated. Although it does end with no closure, I am almost certain there will be a part II."},{"Title":"Playing My Mother's Blues","review":"I picked up this book Sunday and can't stop reading it. This book embodies what is missing in Black fiction today, a real plot. Maria, Dani, Rose are all good examples of the complex lives women lead today. Our mothers tell us to marry rich and well, but they never tell us we may have to up our happiness in return. Rose and Aunt Lucille show the other side of the spectrum, why give your life to a man when you can get everything you want on your own. I won't give away the end, but it was a shocker"},{"Title":"Playing My Mother's Blues","review":"If you enjoy Ms. Wesley's story-telling, you'll enjoy this story.

I hardly put it down and finished it faster than any other book I had read in a while. I had never read anything from this author before. I quickly ran out and picked up another one of her books. Great job."},{"Title":"Playing My Mother's Blues","review":"There were times when I carried this book with me everywhere I went, pausing so as not to walk into something. This was a book written out of many years of living, loving and observing. The woman who returns from jail and lives in the apartment with ugly furniture is very different from the woman Dani and Rose knew, the one who ran off with Durrell Alexander.Though life with Hilton Dells left a lot to be desired, namely love, the life Durrell Alexander has to offer is so much better and so much worse than anyone might imagine. It was there, in one of the vicious things that Durrell did to her that I soured a little, and yet it was true, just as if it'd happened.Things went well until I realized Rose's part in everything. I found it hard to like her then, hating so much when she'd played such a part. A child, yet a woman, that she was. Probably the biggest thing that I remember thinking when I'd finished this book was: Why doesn't Ms. Wesley get the same accolades as some other contemporary Black writers? This was a powerful book. I have no clue. Perhaps people know her best for her mysteries as I had previously. Those are wonderful too. I look forward to reading all of her titles."},{"Title":"Playing My Mother's Blues","review":"Valerie Wilson-Wesley transcends the \\"you go girl\\" stereotype that so much modern Black fiction has devolved into(even Terry McMillan has become a victim of the genre she unwittingly created).

In Playing My Mother's Blues, I have to give her credit for the storytelling aspect. The storyline itself, I found to be rather shallow. The mystic lasts until the very end of the story, so you don't have to read very much longer after the story comes together. It depends on what type of material \\"floats your boat\\", as to whether or not you'll like this book.

First, I must say that Valarie Wilson-Wesley is an outstanding author. Departing from her detective series, she has given us interesting characters in several unrelated books, which shows that she is confortable trying new techniques and styles. She also attempts to touch on topics like the dysfunctional family, incest, abuse, drug use, anger, and cheating. She does it well, in this one of her latest novel, by bringing several characters together who have been trying to survive emotionally since their mother left and was later jailed for killing her lover. And why the mother killed her lover is a secret that she and her daughter share. This interesting dynamic leads two daughters to grow up with various intimacy issues and challenges. Maybe the same old story, but told in a unique way. Because we see the author struggle with what to do in a family when the protigal mother returns and struggles with the question of \\"why did she leave\\"? and \\"what did it do to her children\\"? While the central character struggles to become part of her daughters lives, they struggle with who they became as a result of their mother's departure (One daughter is having an affair, while her husband has cheated. The other daughter is single but slept with her mother's deceased lover.). The theme of the story is simple, and probably one that other authors have tackled, however, this book was easy to read and offered insight into the importance of having a mother during your formative years.If for no other reason, if you love Wilson-Wesley, you'll enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Playing My Mother's Blues","review":"Wesley has given another wonderful story that lingers long after you close the book.

I enjoyed the story line, but I felt that there were too many things that were left unsaid. I felt as though the book ended rather abruptly. I was left with a lot of questions and was confused as to where she was going with some of the characters stories. She never really wrapped up the stroy. I hope that this means there is another book in the works to finish telling the story."},{"Title":"Playing My Mother's Blues","review":"The author gets right in there and tells the story; a good one at that. This book is a fast paced book; never a dull moment"},{"Title":"Death at the Bar","review":"I've just started reading Ngaio Marsh's mysteries, so I don't know if this book is a &quot;typical&quot; Marsh mystery, but I certainly hope so. The characters were well-drawn, and the plot quite brilliant. A man dies while playing darts, because it appears that a dart daubed with cyanide sticks in the back of his hand. Almost everyone has a motive, and the evidence at hand can point to almost any of them. Reading this novel is like threading a conch-shell. You slip in a piece of string and it snakes through various chambers and entries until it finally comes out at the end. I was a big Christie fan, but now I think I'll be moving on to Marsh."},{"Title":"Death at the Bar","review":"One of Marsh's most tightly-knit jobs. Victim a famous K.C., poisoned with KNC in the private taproom of a Devon inn while taking part in a demonstration of darts-throwing; plenty of good circumstantial detail leads to supposition of impossible crime. Alleyn, called in both by publican and by local police, does a splendid and fast (24 hours) job of discovering murderer, whose identity is a masterly demonstration in diverting suspicion from the most likely person. Method ingeniously simple, and hence convincing: a very neat job. Virtuoso display of logic at the end, including a delightful false solution propounded by a most amusing Chief Constable."},{"Title":"Death at the Bar","review":"Perhaps not one of her more richly written efforts, but buoyed by a marvellous mystery plot, set in a wonderful English pub. Darts and beer, a fatal combination."},{"Title":"Death at the Bar","review":"Three friends form London arrive at a remote inn to spend a couple of weeks on holiday. Norman is an artist and wants to spend his time painting; Simon is an actor and is taking a break and his cousin, Luke is a successful barrister. One of them will meet his death in this idyllic spot. Is it a terrible accident or is it murder? The inquest rules it is accident but the publican of The Plume of Feathers wants to clear the name of his hostelry and pays a visit to Roderick Alleyn at Scotland Yard.The local Chief Constable agrees to Alleyn investigating and it soon becomes clear that this is really murder. This is a well plotted novel with some fascinating twists and turns and a really ingenious murderer. Almost all of the suspects have secrets they are hiding from the police and almost all of them appear to be guilty though they seem to have no opportunity to actually do the deed.I totally failed to work out who did it though of course when you look back the clues are there staring you in the face! An excellent crime novel by a master of the genre."},{"Title":"Death at the Bar","review":"I am a fan of Ngaio Marsh and I'm trying to read all of her stories, but DEATH AT THE BAR was way below a Marsh standard. There was no mystery, from the moment the characters were introduced the reader knows who will die and who is the killer.The other characters who populate the bar are shallow and repulsive.DEATH AT THE BAR may have been an early manuscript that had been around collecting dust for want of a publisher that should have stayed in the bottom drawer.If you enjoy Ngaio Marsh you should read it, but I can not recommend it.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS."},{"Title":"Death at the Bar","review":"This is one of the longest Marsh novels of the 25 I've read so far (of the 32). She has lots of style. This one includes Inspector Fox but not the others in Alleyn's usual crew. The additional characters are well-drawn & intriguing IMHO, including an actor (Marsh has many stage-oriented novels--cf.Curtain Calls: Three Great Mysteries; Enter A Murderer; Night At the Vulcan; Killer Dolphin), an artist (she also has art-oriented ones such asArtists in Crime& Alleyn's wife Troy is a celebrated artist), a Barrister (the victim), & numerous country folk. The setting in a country inn adds charm to the novel as well. But, the best part is the mystery itself. Lots of motives, of course, & a supposedly impossible crime. The finger points to different suspects in cycles--very clever. I did guess part of it, but not the main part. The only drawback to me was the seeming serendipity of the storm & lights going out--and the rapidity of the culprit's movements. Poetic license I presume. My favorite lines in it are: p. 9: \\"His cousin had a trick of saying things that sounded a little like quotations from an interview with himself\\" & p. 293: \\"as conspicuous as a pitchfork in Paradise.\\" It's a delightful book--I'm torn between giving it 4 or 5 stars."},{"Title":"Masters of Color and Light: Homer, Sargent, and the American Watercolor Movement","review":"A good over view of how watercolor caught on in America and rose to the standard of English work in that medium. Worth getting for the chapter on William Trost Richards, who really ought to be part of an American Watercolor Triumverate, along with Homer and Sargent. There are out of print monographs on Richards but this seems to be the best place to see examples of his work if you can't get your hands on them."},{"Title":"Masters of Color and Light: Homer, Sargent, and the American Watercolor Movement","review":"This book is a thorough look at the events, popular tastes, critical commentaries and legacies that contributed to the history of watercolor in America. Written by a curator at the Brooklyn Museum, it is fairly well illustrated with examples of the exemplary artists' work, and is helpful in gaining an understanding of the struggles of this medium to be regarded as comparable to oil painting in its collectiblity or permanence.The illustrations are often smaller than one would like, so I would not recommend this book for artists who are looking for detailed, highly visible reproductions of Sargent or Homer, Richards, etc., but if you wish to learn a little of the history of watercoloring in America, this is certainly a fine book, and enjoyably readable as well."},{"Title":"The Big Idea","review":"The Big Idea is a great view into the world of great business innovation.

I was amazed that many of these innovations where thought of in a flash of inspiration, but took many, many years to be realized as products (Xerox, Polaroid and Barbie). I was also reminded of the personal and financial hardship that many of the entrepreneurial innovators faced. Many innovators had several (many) failures among the way to reaching their success.The Big Idea also impresses the need to copyright, patent and trademark your creation so that you can reap the rewards from the creation. There are also a couple of interesting examples of innovation within a corporate setting.If you want to innovate you need the commitment and persistence to stay with it for the long term. The Big Idea closes with the following lessons from innovators The Big Idea covers.1. Think of things that never were and ask, \\"why Not\\" - innovations is doing what others don't see2. The Power of One - Behind every great innovation there is typically a single individual driving it forward3. Keep It Simple, Stupid - complexity kills innovations4. First is best - own the consumers mind by being first5. Try, try again - when you fail... try again6. Risk Business - to hit homeruns you have to swing for the fence7.

Although the word &quot;visionary&quot; is overused in today's business world, these men and women were truly visionaries who marched to the beat of a different drummer. Strauss focuses on different rules of innovation in each chapter, and the book becomes a cohesive (although certainly not exhaustive) lesson on building a business."},{"Title":"The Big Idea","review":"This is a different sort of business book. Most are boring or self-important. This book was neither. Rather, it was a very enjoyable read while still being very useful. The stories were informative and entertaining, and, I thought, drove home the salient points. As an entrepreneur, it was helpful to see how others created great companies."},{"Title":"The Big Idea","review":"What a fascinating read this is. You realize that so many products (kitty litter, liquid paper, trivial pursuit etc.) were invented by very ordinary people living ordinary mundane lives and whose lives were transformed by a great idea. Truly inspirational."},{"Title":"Psychology and Sociology Applied to Medicine","review":"This book was recommended to us by our lecturer, I was ecstatic to find it at my local bookstore and bought it immediately despite having to pay double the amazon price since for some reason (taxes?) books are really expensive in my country... Anyway, I guess their aim was to have everything concise to fit something another book would have a whole chapter about in 2 pages, which I thought was a good thing at first, but that also meant A LOT of the detail was omitted!Throughout my psychology course, I was never able to get a single useful information out of this book. Whatever is in there is general enough to be of use to people wishing to read about psychology in their free time, but not for a medical student. I don't recommend this."},{"Title":"Psychology and Sociology Applied to Medicine","review":"This is a book which I thought it probably is not worthy of writing a review for it. It is a nonsense book and just a waste of time to read."},{"Title":"Lives of the Most Eminent Painters 2 Vol Set","review":"Received the two volume set of books and they were in better condition than I had expected. Fast delivery from the book store."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Since I enjoyed Charlaine Harris's Sookie series so much, I thought I would try another of her series also. It is an interesting premise that the main character, Harper Connelly, can find dead bodies, but this series was not as much fun as the Sookie series. Harper was traumatized by the event that caused her unusual talent, and relies heavily on her step-brother for emotional support. As a mystery series, it is interesting, and some of Harper's wise cracks are amusing, but Harper's fragility was worrisome to me. I'll probably read the next book in the series before I write this series off."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Harper Connelly is a nice girl who was hit by lightning and had a terrible stepfather and mother who forced her and her siblings to grow up FAST. Being hit by lightning caused Harper to gain \\"grave sight.\\" She has the ability to find a body, if she knows the general area where it might be, and she using her ability, now her profession, to help law enforcement and individuals and families find missing persons believed to be dead.Unfortunately, neither law enforcement, individuals or families want anything to do with her and even when her \\"grave sight\\" is proven to be incredibly real and deadly accurate (she even witnesses the last few moments of the dead person's life, as the dead persons themselves), all the aforementioned find her repugnant. This is a major theme in this first installment in particular which throws Harper and her stepbrother sidekick/caregiver into a scary small town with lots of secrets it'd like to hide but Harper may uncover much to her and her brother's detriment.Despite that good old small, creepy inbred town troupe, the story is stellar and scary! The characters are fresh and deep. I can't wait to pick up the second book in the series and crawl back into Charlaine Harris's sharp storytelling.Unfortunately, though this series came after the more popular Sookie Stackhouse book series that the HBO television series, True Blood is based on, it seems that Harris wrote the last and probably final novel in the Harper Connelly series in 2009."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"If you're looking for the exciting and dangerous love story as Sookie Stackhouse series, you'll be disappointed. Though Harper exudes the similar writing stye of Charlaine Harris, the story is just okay...not boring but neither captivating. There isn't much of the &#34;Danielle Steele&#34; lust the Sookie series has either."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I could tell from the start of the book that I was really going to enjoy this series just waiting for it to unfold the drama, suspense, and a little (sexual tension)!"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This is the first Charlaine Harris book I've read so didn't know what to expect. Story-wise it's a good mystery and I didn't guess the ending until...well, the end. I just never really felt connected to the characters though. Harper is really hard to figure out, one minute she's streetsmart and mouthy, the next she's a wreck and can't function because she's like a little-girl-lost. I'm not sure if this will be explained a little more in the next books but so far she's not that likeable. Her brother Tolliver is a bit of a mystery too and I'm still not sure what makes him tick.It's a good book but I'm hoping it will become a bit more fleshed out in the rest of the series. I was hoping for more of her special ability of being able to 'speak' to the departed and the story did revolve around this, but there wasn't very much of that side of things this time.It held my interest to find out where things were headed all the way through so I'd recommend it, but it's a fairly quick read and if I'm honest not a lot happened in this one."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"While the story itself is enjoyable if separated from the morose chain smoking voice that reads it, the narrator works hard to make sure you can't. I'm giving three stars because the story doesn't deserve less than that. However, when the only indication that something the characters say is supposed to be light or humorous is the narrator following it with the words \\"I/he teased\\" it is a very bad sign about the ability of the reader. Additionally the main character is supposed to be vulnerable but the closest the narrator seemed to be able to come was bitter. Given how well narrated the Sookie Stackhouse books are, this was a huge disappointment. The character of Harper Connelly is of course a very different character than Sookie, so while a different reading style is appropriate you still want some kind of spark of life within the character. I'm sure whoever directed it can also be held responsible but honestly, there was no range of emotion. It was as though the entire book and every character in it was seen through a depressive haze. It made me want to send the narrator some prozac and go find the book in paperback so she couldn't ruin the rest of the story for me.Seriously - who hired this woman and what were they thinking?"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I read all the Sookie Stackhouse novels, and adored them. After I rapidly read through all of those books, I decided I'd go in a different direction for a while. you know, try not being hooked on Charlaine Harris or even a series in general. It didn't last long. After Sookie, there was a serious void. Nothing I read could compare to Harris-nothing! Maybe because I'm a Southern female, maybe because I enjoy paranormal novels, maybe because I just like the way she creates characters...whatever the case, this book was just great. really. I love them. And I've already read the next in the series and I've just started An Ice Cold Grave. I love these books! If you're into mystery, sci fi, or just a good Southern series with a lot of laughs, these books are for you!"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"i never thought i would warm to this character from the fist page, but read a little further and i assure you, you will be spellbound. a thorougly entertianing read"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Although I love the True Blood novels written by Charlaine Harris I am not too fond of the Harper Connelly Mystery series she has written. I find them somewhat interesting but I find I get bored reading them. I have just started Book 2 and it is just ok. Not really recommended as an exciting, romantic novel series."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I read all of the Sookie Stackhouse books in about a week. I thought they were the most original and entertaining work I have read in quite a while. When I ran out of them, I moved on to this series thinking it would be just as good. I am sorry to say I was disappointed. While the characters are more realistic, the plot made no sense. I don't want to give it away, but I feel like Harris built up a good mystery only to provide a conclusion that had no thought. I'll probably read the next one just to see if it gets any better just because I liked the vampires so much."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"this is the first in the new series from C Harris. I have to say I didn't really like this one. I had it figured out half way through the book. But I did order all 3 in the series and enjoyed the second one very much. I fell that the characters and premise for this series is brilliant, just needs to keep within the Harris style of wit and sexual innuendo. I just started the third - Ice Cold Grave- and I'm moving right along with it. I believe I will like this one also.Keep um coming, Charlene!"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Okay I was fooled into getting this book by a person I know and it wasnt what I expected. For people who have read her other series please do not think that this book follows the sames lines or even the humor in this series. If you like mystery with a touch of suspense than this for you. Harper has powers that allows her to see death seeing as she was hit by lightening when she was younger. All in all it has good characters and a solid plot but for those as I said looking for another Sookie go elsewhere this series is for the mystery at heart readers."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I like Charlaine Harris in her darker mood. This book will probably appeal to fans of her Lily Bard series rather than her Teagarden series. The heroine is pretty screwed up and the power she has is not a comfortable one.If you are looking for a cozy it isn't here. If you are looking for a romance it isn't here either although she does make a connection. a connection that showes just how uncomfortable relationships can be for someone with her ability.The second book in the series is already out as I write this."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"i love Harris's Sookie Stackhouse seris so i gave this a try and i loved it. it was fast paced and full of mystery. i love Harris's writing stlye and her chracters. she tied things up real nice at the end. i recomend for a good weekend read."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I am such a fan of Harris' Southern Vampire series that I hesitated to read a book outside it. However, I think Harper and her special talents are right up there with Sookie and hers. This book is darker and more thoughtful, but Harris has another winner as far as I'm concerned. I just wish her books took longer to read!"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I pre-ordered this book as soon as I saw there was a new Charlaine Harris book coming out. I've only read her Southern Vampire books so far, and from the title I assumed that this would be a new installment. I got it and was disappointed for the two minutes before I started reading it - then I was blown away! I loved the main character and I thought she was very believable.Some reviewers thought there was a creepy sexual undertone between Harper and her stepbrother, and I must say I didn't find their relationship typical. That's the point, really - they had a very traumatic childhood in which they bonded very deeply, and neither of them is exactly a good candidate for a \\"normal\\" relationship. They are very scarred people doing the best they can - though I hope that won't include a sexual element.The \\"mystery\\" part was obvious even to me, and I never try to figure it out along the way. However, I'll buy anything else in the series, and am seriously considering starting on her other mysteries!"}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],W={key:0},H={key:1};function G(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",R,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",H,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",W,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const j=u(x,[["render",G],["__scopeId","data-v-d39e69dd"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/18.md","filePath":"people/18.md"}'),E={name:"people/18.md"},L=Object.assign(E,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{D as __pageData,L as default};
