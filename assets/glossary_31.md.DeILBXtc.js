All the information in the book (except the coordinates of the dive sites) is just as easily obtained from the local dive companies, so I simply dont see the point in purchasing the book.About the only good thing was it allows you to plan dives before you even get to Fiji. The book only had 3 dive sites listed for the Yasawa Islands - which have lots of good dive sites.Given the book was published in 2000 and I was in Fiji in 2009 I guess the book is basically getting quite dated now.Dive sites like Gotham City, which got its name after the Bat fish that live there, no longer seem to have any Bat fish.

With that in mind, I had real trouble connecting to any of the characters. And I found the violence a little more graphic than I was expecting from a suspenseful romance. The murderer's calling card is to cut off a man's genitalia and stuff it in their mouths. Yuk!Jazzy Talbot, owner of Cherokee Point, Tennessee's diner and bar, has spent her life longing for ladies man and member of the upper crest, Jamie Upton. Though they were high school sweethearts and he impregnated her at sixteen, he refused to marry her because he would lose his inheritance. But that hasn't kept him from hound-dogging her door even while he's engaged to be married to another woman. Jazzy's reputation as a loose woman and the fact that she'd publicly threatened Jamie's life makes her the prime suspect when Jamie's dead body is found.Caleb McCord is hiding from his past while living just outside his future. He's the only one aware that he is the lost Upton grandson and Jamie Upton's cousin. He works as a bouncer in Jazzy's club and finds himself drawn to her more and more everyday, but she can't seem to see him past Jamie's larger than life presence. When Jamie is murdered, Caleb is one of the only people who believe Jazzy's innocence. Struggling to keep her safe while fighting his own inner demons and his insecurities about becoming part of the Upton family, Caleb learns what it means to be part of a small town and the sacrifices one must make in the name of love.With enough characters milling about to keep you guessing just \`who done it', Beverly Barton weaves a good mystery. Though most of the characters reach no real resolution by the end of the book, and two serial killers coming to one small town in less than three months is highly unlikely, \\"The Last to Die\\" was still an interesting read. I'm definitely going to have to go back and read the first book \\"The Fifth Victim\\", and we'll all just have to wait to see what happens next."},{"Title":"LAST TO DIE","review":"In Cherokee Point, Tennessee, heir to a fortune Jamie Upton may be engaged but he still plays the field. One of his ladies is Jazzy Talbot, owner of Jazzy's Joint, a popular restaurant and bar. She knows she should stop seeing the philanderer, but so far has not cut the ties. However, a third party severs the connection when that person brutally kills Jamie.Most of the townsfolk believe that Jazzy killed her lover in a crime of passion because the evidence points towards someone he knew and trusted. However, Sheriff Butler and psychic Genny Madoc believe otherwise though they feel a woman committed the atrocity. Soon other murders follow and a frightened prime suspect Jazzy turns to her new bouncer, drifter Caleb McCord for protection, but neither expected love to spring up between them.This sequel is an exciting serial killer romance that gains the attention of readers from the start as everyone will wonder who the red haired killer is. Jazzy and Caleb are a delightful duo; however, the return of Genny from THE FIFTH VICTIM is duel edged as fans will enjoy reading her latest visions but also wonder how many serial killers stalk Cherokee Point (population control?). Still THE LAST TO DIE is a terse thriller that fans will appreciate and wonder who will be AS GOOD AS DEAD when Jazzy's doppelganger arrives in Cherokee Point next November.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"LAST TO DIE","review":"Another killer is on the loose in Cherokee Pointe, Tennessee. Town bad boy Jamie Upton is found brutally murdered, and all hands are pointing to his former lover, Jazzy Talbot.Jazzy and Jamie's lives have been intertwined since they were teens, and their illicit romance resulted in a teen pregnancy. Finding herself dumped, since Jamie would face disinheritance, Jazzy has always been Jamie's fall back gal when he is in town.With new man Caleb McCord suddenly playing an important role in her life, she works to exonerate herself from accusation. When another murder occurs, Jazzy has an alibi - Caleb - but when she finds out the secret of his past, will she be able to continue the relationship? Further complicating her life is the emergence of a woman bearing a striking resemblance to her - one that wants nothing to do with her.But there is a host of possible suspects including Jamie's latest fiance, her sister, any one of his other conquests in town, and Jazzy's \\"twin\\". Once again, psychic Genny steps in to help the police solve the mystery. What would the sheriff do without her?"},{"Title":"LAST TO DIE","review":"The second installment of the Cherokee Pointe trilogy is worth reading. I liked it better than THE FIFTH VICTIM.This is Jazzy's story. THE LAST TO DIE has a truly frightening killer, and a sexy man, Caleb McCord, who are both after Jazzy. The plot is good and suspenseful.Someone is brutally murdering people in Cherokee Pointe. Jazzy's high school sweetheart and long-time on-again off-again fling is the first to die. Jazzy comes under suspicion for his murder, and the following deaths. Caleb McCord, a drifter new to town, believes in her innocence and becomes her champion.The cast of characters, as in THE FIFTH VICTIM, are likable, although a bit stiff at times. However, they are memorable and I enjoyed spending time with them. Some of the character's emotions and thoughts are noted so many times that they become redundant, but THE LAST TO DIE is entertaining.Shelley Dawn, author ofSweet, Sweet JessieandDark Nights."},{"Title":"LAST TO DIE","review":"I think I like this one even better than The Fifth Victim.

I can't wait for the third and final book of the trilogy!The only thing I'm not looking forward to is the return of Reve. What a shallow, arogant creature she is! She believes she's better than everyone else who wasn't raised in money! Which is ironic considering she wasn't born into privilege but found in a dumpster! She was a complete snob, insulting, bigoted and downright cruel and those were her best qualities!

It was not quite as good as the first. Caleb and Jazzy's tale started off with likable but rather combustible characters in an interesting situation. I was somewhat disappointed with Caleb at the end. He goes off, leaving the woman he loves, when she is in considerable danger. Even though he swore to stay with her, he did not. He has not been honest with her. It made her very angry as she should have been. He leavces with his rich grandfather instead of staying and protecting her. Jazzy should consider selling out and seeing something of the rest of the world. This particular part of it has not been particularly good for her. The end of the book just sort of petered out with Jazzy appearing to lose some of her confidence in herself. I guess the author is going to tie things up in the final book, but she has to make us want to go there.

Every page has simple experiments to try to help you discover for yourself the most comfortable, healthy positions for body, desk, computer...The following was an epiphany for me (I'm right-handed) and illustrates his delicate balance between knowing what's good for you and letting you discover it for yourself:&quot;The number pad and cursor control keys are usually on the right side of the keyboard, and that means that when the alphabetic section is centered in front of you, the right end of the keyboard is about six inches further form your body's centerline than is the left end. Most people are right-handed and place the mouse to the right of the keyboard. Notice that if you do so, you will have to hold your arm considerably farther away from your side than if you place your mouse on the left of your keyboard. That extra extension of your arm will result in significant fatigue and strain in your shoulder and neck. It could even affect your back.&quot;It is a good idea to put the mouse on the left side of the keyboard--even though for right-handed people it takes a little getting used to...you will get used to it soon, and you will find that it will considerably lessen the work your arm has to do in using the mouse.&quot;Absolutely worth finding even though it's out of print.

I have to admit, I didn't exactly follow the &quot;program&quot; - I skipped to the section on sitting, which is what interested me. I have a chronic, mild, back problem, and I had searched and searched for a computer chair that would allow me to sit without pain. I had 3 loaner chairs from different companies, after trying about 20 at the display area at my university ergonomics group, and with all of them, my back hurt. Then I read and worked with Paul's book - and now I sit on a not wonderful chair, with a rolled up towel (and a cushion to make up for the seat), and I am comfortable, all day.

I was doing a lot of graphic work, lots of double clicking and dragging. Going weekly to the chiropractor relieved 20% of the pain. After one session with a Feldenkreis practioner, 80% of the pain was gone. She lent me the 1st edition of this book, which is what the review is based on.I've taken Feldenkreis lessons before, but never noticed much difference. I now realize that this pain has raised my awareness levels of my body in a way I didn't know before. Now I can do simple Feldenkreis lessons at home and feel a definite difference in muscles being looser and moving better. This book is great on raising my body awareness while I am at the computer.I've professional training in safety and ergonomics. I learned more from this book that was not covered in previous professional training. Understanding about the proper pelvis position while sitting and how it affects your arms was an eye opener. The general public has a misunderstanding of what good posture is supposed to look like.The only thing I would recommend is a more in depth chapter on the different types of mice (pointing devices) and keyboards available out there, their pros and cons. Having to choose a new pointing device and keyboard for myself has been a daunting task. I've already returned 2 keyboards with centrally located touchpads that relieved some of the pain, but not all. I'm now considering a vertical mouse and the comfort keyboard, which would keep my hands in the vertical position. Maybe this is covered in the new book edition or maybe this topic is too individual to be covered in a generic book.As the author mentioned to me in an e-mail:If you sensitize yourself to feelings of balance and ease in your body, you will be better able to detect which ergonomic devices are actually helpful.I particularly enjoyed having him respond to specific questions I posed.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Comfort at Your Computer: Body Awareness Training for Pain-Free Computer Use","review":"I completely disagree with the review below from 1/29/01.

Undoubtedly, Preterism does pose some serious thinking and paradigm shifts in Eschatological worldview. The issue is not about Calvinism, Dominion Theology or any other possible doctrine that the author feels need discuss. If I see an Author claim that they are going to provide Biblical response to the claims of Preterism, then I expect to see a point by point refutation. However, I have not seen Dr. Spargimino provide such information. He spends more time skirting the issue at hand. I am currently working on responding to this book and showing forth the inept reasoning in his dealings with Preterism and the lack of information regarding the so called problematic of Preterism"},{"Title":"The Anti-Prophets : The Challenge of Preterism","review":"To accept the view of this book, one must believe that Jesus and the apostles either did not speak the Word of God, or that they spoke in error, by the Spirit of God. Either way, it would mean that Jesus wasn't God--heresy #1. Whatever the reason, to believe that this book is right is to reject the full inerrancy and God-spiration of Scripture. Either the Bible is right, or Spargimino is right. If Spargimino is right, then it's time to find another religion, for then Christianity would have a book of deceit for its foundation."},{"Title":"The Anti-Prophets : The Challenge of Preterism","review":"Those who critique orthodox preterism tend to have the same problem: They read the Bible as though it was written yesterday and for them personally. Spargimino got a doctorate at seminary, but somehow managed not to learn his own lesson, instructing us that the Bible does need to be read with a first century eye. He never got that &quot;eye&quot; himself -- to see what I mean, check out Caird's excellent work, Language and Imagery of the Bible.Much of the book is spent arguing that a preterist view necessitates a &quot;replacement theology&quot; (the church is the new Israel and subject to all its blessings; Israel as it now exists is irrelevant -- why not say rather that Israel has been expanded to include Christians?) and leads to reconstructionism and a total preterist view. Funny, because I don't subscribe to any of these views and see no need to. Space is also devoted to Spargimino lamenting that when he believed preterism, it made it impossible for him to see any real significance in the day's headlines. Ironically, that is the very problem that preterists: the use of the newspaper as a guide to Biblical interpretation, with the result that dispensational eschatologists have fallen like a line of dominoes, from Lindsey to Van Impe to Whisenant. Will the lesson ever be learned? Not as long as writers like Spargimino let their hearts rule their heads when it comes to exegesis.This shows in the way Spargimino responds to preterist points on the Olivet Discourse. Preterist exegeis and theory is described in such terms as &quot;evasion&quot; [24], &quot;pathetic&quot; [27], &quot;blatant wresting of Scripture...[preterists must believe] God gave prophecy to confuse, not to reveal,&quot; [130] and so on; it's just the same argument: We need to read passages like Olivet in a &quot;literal, straightforward manner&quot; rather than grasping it in its context as symbolic apocalyptic -- which Spargimino disparingly refers to as reading it as &quot;gross exaggerations&quot;, which is the sort of spin-doctor description we would expect from uneducated persons who advise us to read the Bible like a newspaper. Yes, apocalyptic WAS &quot;exaggeration&quot; of a sort (actually, more like symbolic excess) -- and that's how those who read it in the first century understood and interpreted it.When actually confronting preterist arguments on Olivet at least, Spargimino often operates under the shortchange principle. The word &quot;world&quot; in Matt. 24:14 was the word used for the Roman Empire, not the whole earth. Spargimino's response: 1) To the NT writers, the Roman world was the entire world (which only would prove the preterist view! -- but it is false anyway; nations like India and China were known of, but not considered part of the Roman oikoumene; 2) preterists give no way for God to refer to the entire earth and would miss any such message (which is simply false, as Spargimino would know had he read DeMar carefully; the oik-word is a specific term, whereas Jesus' &quot;ends of the earth&quot; command offers a much broader delimitation). Isaiah could not refer in Ch. 13 to the 539 BC destruction of Babylon, in part because the Medes and Persians came from the east, where Isaiah says they will come from the north (13:3 -- as DeMar explains, but Spargimino also apparently missed, all ancient armies approached their city-prey from the north; approach from the east, west, and sometimes south [in the Northern Hemisphere during battle season] and you'll get the sun-in-your-eyes disadvantage). Matthew's end of the age must mean the end of the world (not a word about the two ages believed in by the Jews which frame this reference culturally). It doesn't look like Spargimino took any preterist writer seriously enough to read carefully what they had to say.It is clear that Spargimino has been blown away by what N. T. Wright calls &quot;the folly of trying to fit the hurricane of first-century Jewish theology into the bottle of late-modern western categories...&quot; His work adds nothing new to the debate other than another reason to worry that the era of inexpensive self-publishing has opened a few doors that would have been better not only left closed, but also nailed shut. I find it no surprise to hear that on his radio show Spargimino features the likes of KJV Onlyist Gail Riplinger. Let the level of scholarship speak for itself."},{"Title":"The Anti-Prophets : The Challenge of Preterism","review":"Many &quot;Christians&quot; whom believe in preterism will, without doubt and as already seen, disagree with Larry Spargimino's latest work, &quot;The Anti-Prophets: The Challenge of Preterism.&quot; Notwithstanding, this theological study analyzes preterism along with its basic concept and tenants. Preterism believes that Christ will not come back to earth in the future, that He already has around 70AD. Spargimino strips the preteristic belief down to a hermeneutical cause; incorrect exogesis of Scripture. Of course no preterist wants to hear this. The usual preterist recourse is to launch verbal assaults and claim some form of heresy upon the theologian speaking out. This is what the Pharisees did with Christ and His followers.Larry Spargimino has created an excellent resource that should be the staple of every seminary. His honest and insightful approach shows compassion for those who have become entangled in liberal theology. Christ will surely return and Spargimino details that quite clearly."},{"Title":"The Anti-Prophets : The Challenge of Preterism","review":"In this book, Dr. Larry Spargimino connects the unbiblical teaching of preterism with the dangerous Kingdom Now/Dominion Theology movement.

This short book(86 pgs) is a masterful presentation of a postal worker turned sculptor, complete with other sculpures by such masters as Isamu Noguchi and Brancusi who influenced him. The influences of these artists and African art is evident in the works of Mr.Mosley. The book gives tremendous insight into the trials and tribulations of this particular artist, beginning with his humble roots and concluding with his retirement from the post office and full dedication to his art. His works are superb creations, using various media to create sculptures that defify tradition. Thadeus has used avariety of means to express himself in art , often using wood that he acquired from city workers or stone that he collected from demolished buildings. His works in stone are impressive as well as his wood carvings. His leaving of chisel marks accentuates the rhythmn and texture of the mans soul. He often uses jazz to inspire him while he works and the results are marks left in the wood or stone that are highly rhythmic patterns that dance. This is an excellent book for anyone interested in understanding the mind of a sculptor, and seeing the path and works that define the experience. Undoubtably Thadeus Mosley is an American original contributing to the African- American experience with his tremendous art. Anyone interested in art, particularly sculpture will benefit from this book, I know I did. Easy to read the text can be read in one sitting and the photographs can be viewed over and over, they are truly marvelous and quite inspiring. Highly recommended for art enthuisiasts or those interested in the African-American experience."},{"Title":"Thaddeus Mosley: African American Sculptor","review":"This book is incredible. An interesting saga of one man's journey through life an art. A must read for all aspiring artists. An inspiration for young African-Americans and people on a whole about the rewards of dedication, discipline and self-faith. The art at the end of the book is breathtaking. It is like two books in one. I really enjoyed it. I not only learned about art per se, I was enlighened of the trials and tribulations of the African-American experience.

It is the story of a group of people, both black and white that relocates to an old plantation. Miss Minerva is a nice (white) woman who treats everyone kindly, but the racial stereotypes of black people are reinforced on almost every page. The black Uncle Jupiter is depicted as a shifty bootlegger that refuses to do a day's work and the blacks are described as an extremely superstitious group. The modern reader, especially the child, will likely have difficulty deciphering the speech patterns of the black characters.The now despised n-word is routinely used although there is no real expression of racial bigotry. All of the people get along and work and play together fairly well, which is somewhat surprising for any story about the 1920's. It is certainly a measure of how far this nation has progressed in the area of racial equality that this story, which would have been so progressive for the time, is now so incredibly archaic."},{"Title":"Everquest Realms of Norrath Forests of Faydark","review":"This isn't a PIECE OF FICTION.

Except for a few references to Angela Davis, Patti Hearst andturntables the book really did not deal with what was going on in 1973 andinstead focused on Najwa's trials and tribulations as the leader of hersorority. Her problems leading the sorority to me were not reflective ofthe time period and the book could have easily been set in the 80's or90's.The book discussed the community service of the sorority, but overall, hadthe effect of playing into the negative stereotypes about Greek lifeinstead of debunking the stereotypes. The only time the sisterhood becamethe least bit concerned about what was happening on campus was when a planthey hatched up negatively raised their profile on campus and they engagedin damage control by speaking out about injustices at the school.There was a touching story about the founder of the sorority but I did notthink it was successfully woven into the plot. The sacrifices of thefounder only served to make the activities of the sorority seem even moretrivial.The book did a good job capturing Najwa's uncertainty about her future andabout role as a leader on campus. To that end it may be enjoyed more byhigh school or college students. However, the author did not do enough withthe story line to make a non-Greek adult like me care about Najwa or hersorority.2 starsreviewed bymisrich"},{"Title":"There Was a Spirit","review":"THERE WAS A SPIRIT is a poignant portrayal of college life during the early 1970's. It focuses on the unique experiences of African-Americans attending a primarily white university during a period of political and racial upheaval. The story begins in the early part of the century when racial dynamics were even more intense and even life threatening. Readers are introduced to Sadie Mae, one of the founding members of Omega Pi Alpha Sorority. Her story is an attention grabber, and it immediately draws you into the book. However, to discover Sadie's full story, readers must first move ahead several decades and meet Najwa Jackson, the main character.Najwa Jackson is attending Casperton University, and is a proud member of Omega Pi Alpha Sorority. She has big plans for her senior year of college, particularly as it relates to the sorority because she has been elected chapter president. While on the surface she seems to have everything together, she deals with insecurity, loneliness and uncertainty about her future. As the story progresses, we meet her friends, family and associates, get a taste of Black Greek life, and a glimpse of political issues such as abortion and racism. Najwa's penchant for history her desire to learn more about Sadie's life and role as co-founder of the sorority, result in the discovery of a much more complete view of Sadie's life. What she unearths rocks the university to its very core.Kimberly Noelle has ambitiously taken a coming of age story and integrated past and present events while addressing relevant social and cultural issues. Because there were so many layers to the story, there were times when I found myself wondering how it would all fit together. The author immediately piqued my interest in Sadie's story, but then shifts and focuses on Najwa. Sadie's story was sparsely dispersed throughout the book and while it was eventually resolved, I found myself getting frustrated. In addition, there were times when I felt the scenes depicting college and sorority life were tedious, at times adding length, but not much else. However, I am glad I stuck with the book because, in the end, the story was heartfelt and satisfying.

She is given the most treasured gift from her father, the deed to five acres of farmland in Casperton, Illinois. As she walks home from work, she dreams of how to keep the promise to develop the land. While enjoying her newfound wealth, she is viciously attacked by a white man and left for dead. Night stretches into morning before Sadie's friends find her teetering on the edge of consciousness. Before Sadie dies, she whispers a request for Anna to fulfill. It is with that promise Omega Pi Alpha Sorority is born.The story fast-forwards to 1973 at Casperton University; Najwa Jackson is the president of the Gamma Chapter of Omega Pi Alpha. During her senior year, she pledges to move the sorority to the forefront on campus. As the semester begins, Najwa along with her line sisters, Carla and Lynette, navigate the Greek life political landscape forging Gamma Chapter forward. Things begin to unravel as Keisha, commits the ultimate crime against another chapter member. In Najwa's attempt to save face for the chapter, she plots with the help of Carla and Lynette, to have Keisha expelled from school.As the second semester commences, Najwa finds the chapter at a turning point and decides to take up the cause to have Keisha's name cleared. In doing so, Najwa points to the fact that Black students are always given harsher punishments than White students. The plot thickens as she discovers the details surrounding the death of the sorority's founder. As the puzzle pieces start to connect, Casperton's darkest secret may be revealed. Has Najwa started the Black Pride movement, which may revolutionize the campus and the town?THERE WAS A SPIRIT accurately depicts sorority life and what could have happened at a predominately white campus. The characters are authentic and story line is original. THERE WAS A SPIRIT was truly a page-turner giving a realistic view inside the inner workings of Greek life at the undergraduate level. A must read for those who enjoy historical fiction. Hopefully, Noelle won't keep us waiting long for the next installment for Omega Pi Alpha and Casperton University.Reviewed by M.

It takes place in 1928, early in Maigret's career, and involves a unique visit to Maigret's childhood home, the village of Saint-Fiacre. Maigret Goes Home is a compelling story, one in which the mystery puzzle, the characters themselves, their psychology, and the intriguing locale all share front stage.Maigret is investigating an anonymous note warning that a death will occur during the first Mass on All Soul's Day at Saint-Fiacre. With Maigret in attendance, Countess de Saint-Fiacre dies during the mass from heart failure. Maigret is convinced of foul play, but evidence is lacking.The aristocratic family of de Saint-Fiacre has suffered financial and moral decline since the death of Count some years ago. As Maigret's investigation proceeds, his disappointment with his childhood home grows. Nonetheless, Maigret's remains influenced by vestiges of his childhood admiration for the imposing Count de Saint-Fiacre, now dead for many years. The suspects are many, and the ending is less predictable than some Maigret stories.My copy of Maigret Goes Home is a good quality, standard size paperback published by Harvest Books in 1990. Translated by Robert Baldick. The inside cover lists about forty Maigret titles available from Harvest Books. For those new to Georges Simenon, he wrote 75 novels and 28 short stories involving the highly popular Maigret from 1931 to 1972.Note: Simenon did not adhere to a strict chronological sequence. That is, later stories often returned to a younger Maigret. Furthermore, many Maigret stories were not translated to English until many years after their release in France. Consequently, the English publication date is not a reliable indication to the time period of a particular Maigret story."},{"Title":"Maigret Goes Home","review":"The Moulin police receive an anonymous note that \\"a crime will be committed in the church at Saint-Fiacre during the first mass on All Souls Day.\\" They forward the note to Paris, assuming it's a practical joke.But Saint Fiacre is Maigret's hometown, and he decides to attend that mass.Sure enough, the Countess of Saint-Fiacre drops dead in church. The doctor diagnoses heart failure, but how to explain the note that foretold this natural death? Was the failure of her heart somehow induced? And by whom?Wonderful complications ensue. The young heir is a good-for-nothing playboy in need of money. The secretary was actually the lover of the aging countess. Even the village priest is behaving strangely.Curiously, it's the suspects themselves who solve the mystery more than Maigret, whose presence alone is somehow enough to bring out the truth.An excellent Maigret subtly enriched by the Chief Inspector's nostalgic flashbacks."},{"Title":"Famous Problems and Their Mathematicians (Teacher Ideas Press)","review":"This book is designed to cope with the demand and interrests of teacher or people how are interest in mathematic, and is the best way to win young people for the usually boring and dry asumed subject.

Anytime a friend or relative has anxiety issues, I get them a book and recommend Recovery. It was a lifesaver for our family."},{"Title":"Mental Health through Will-training: A System of Self-help in Psychotherapy as Practiced by Recovery, Incorporated,","review":"In most respects this book and it's author, Abraham Low, were decades ahead of their time. Although this particular book was not published until 1950, Low was advancing the methods described in it before he founded Recovery, Inc. (now Recovery International, but generally referred to simply as Recovery) in 1937; a network of mutual-support groups for former mental patients. The technique of \\"spotting\\" thoughts and behaviors in this book that lead to \\"temper\\" (behavior resulting from emotions like resentment, impatience, indignation, disgust, hatred, shame, inadequacy, hopelessness and despair) are comparable toAaron T. Beck's Cognitive TherapyandAlbert Ellis' Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy.In other respects, this book is in lockstep with the year it was published. Readers may have difficulty relating to discussions about the thrill of automobiling at speeds of 50 miles per hour, and new \\"mechanical conveniences\\" like refrigeration, electricity and gasoline. Many of the examples and stories in this book deal with traditional nuclear family themes; with the man as the head of the household and his wife playing a subservient role. It is important to remember that this book is going on sixty years old, and that for its time, its ideas, particularly that mental patients were not hopeless and could recover, were very progressive.It's difficult to resist comparing Recovery withAlcoholics Anonymous(AA) as they were founded independently within just two years of each other and both are voluntary organizations for of people with similar illnesses aiding each other in a common purpose. The million dollar question: why are there only a few hundred Recovery meetings worldwide, while there are over 110,000 AA meetings?There are remarkable similarities between the two programs. Both of them ask members to preserve anonymity, to overcome resentments, to place a premium on creating peace and serenity, to defer gratification for the sake of long-term goals. Both programs see self-centeredness as a cause of illness, encourage discursive thinking and discourage mixing politics with recovery. The only real incompatibility is the method suggested for changing behavior. In AA members surrender to or cooperate with the will of their Higher Power, whereas in Recovery members are expected to follow direction of their physician and \\"command their muscles\\" to behave rightly. In Recovery language, \\"muscles train the brain\\" (a sort of layperson's phrase for a kind ofHebbian learning), in this way, members slowly learn to behave correctly. In each case the result is the same, members slowly learn new habits; one through a spiritual method and another through a secular method.According to the peer-reviewed literature (see specifically Marc Galanter's research on Recovery and Christine Timko's work on AA) they are both effective programs for dealing with the problems members present with, so the deficiency is not the methods.Abraham Low was born in Poland and educated in Austria at the University of Vienna, and while his command of English was solid when he wrote this book, reading some of his earlier works (such hasManage Your Fears Manage Your AngerorThe Techniques of Self-help in Psychiatric After-care) it is obvious that English was not his first language. More than that, it's difficult to tell if he meant this book for Recovery members or if it was written more for an audience of other physicians or professionals interested in the organization. It is detailed and encyclopedic, but it is not warm or inspiring. Low was very good at communicating tactfully and technically, but his writing lacked the charisma of someone like AA's founder, Bill Wilson.Another possibility is that the demographic Recovery deals with, people with serious mental illness, is not as good of fit for being treated in self-help groups as are alcoholics. Frequent meetings may be more of a benefit to alcoholics who are always in danger of a relapse than people gradually trying to improve themselves. AA, however, describes people in their program as changing slowly over a period of time. The third most popular twelve-step group, Al-Anon, treats co-dependency. It would seem that self-help groups are useful for helping people gradually recover from a variety of chronic problems.Recovery's program, as outlined in this book, relies heavily on a physician overseeing Recovery members and working closely with Recovery groups. Low played this role until 1952 when he suggested that Recovery become more of a stand-alone mutual-support organization. AA's program never relied on professional help in the same manner. Still, other programs for people with mental illness that assiduously follow AA's model (such asEmotions Anonymous,Neurotics Anonymousand GROW) each, like Recovery, have yet to move out of obscurity in to the mainstream.With several organizations facilitating support groups for people with mental illness (to the list above you can add the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill and the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance) it could be there is a significant factor of confusion both for individuals looking for a group and for mental health professional referring members to such a group."},{"Title":"Mental Health through Will-training: A System of Self-help in Psychotherapy as Practiced by Recovery, Incorporated,","review":"This is a terrific book in good shape.

This also includes anxiety disorders which so many of us suffer from. Alcoholics Anonymous costs nothing for the treatment of alcoholism. And Recovery, Inc. costs a recommended donation of $2 for a 2-hour meeting. A.A. works despite the technocrats and their twisted statistics. The Mad Scientists. And Recovery, Inc. has been helping people all over the world for mental problems. And this is their Bible just as &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; or the Big Blue Book is the Bible of A.A. Dr. Low had created a system of cognitive behavioral therapy that works! Then came the &quot;new breed&quot; of healers who promised us self-esteem in ten weeks or 3 minutes a day. They ignored Low (ripped him off actually) and attacked A.A. They are not a &quot;well-meaning&quot; breed of lion tamers. In this book, you will learn about &quot;The Courage to Make Mistakes&quot;. You will find that the first goal in mental health is to shoot for being average. Whether you think you are Napolean or &quot;exceptional&quot;, you can afford to be average according to Dr. Low. This was all stated way before Drs. Ellis and Beck decided they were the new scientists of mental health. Dr. Low created the cognitive-behavioralapproach way before these gentlemen. The only difference is that his approach works. Please refer to &quot;recovery-inc.com&quot; on the net. A diagnosis from a qualified physician comes first in Low's method. Then you will be allowed to attend meetings. Yes, you can leave early. That is part of recovery. &quot;Spotting&quot; when you are beating yourself up with thoughts. And you &quot;encourage&quot; yourself for your progress. The people seem very intelligent and kind. Both my psychiatrist and therapist are ga-ga about Recovery, Inc. They love it and recommended it to me. The changes are swift and lasting. But not in 10 weeks or 3 minutes. It's very much of a shame that A.A. and Recovery Inc., which originated in the thirties when people were not looking for a &quot;quick fix&quot;, are now being over-looked by the new intelligensia. Many have been hurt by these pseudo-intellectuals from the sixties. Dr. Low emphasizes that we go into a &quot;DANGER&quot; alert kind of status all the time. Many need to change this to &quot;DISTRESSING&quot;. As he states in the book, sometimes a headache is just a headache and not a brain tumor! I am so grateful to Recovery, Inc. and it's kind members. Along with A.A. and my Insight Meditation course (also available from Amazon.com), I don't feel that I will ever be truly lacking in the ability to love others and to be loved in return. Thank you."},{"Title":"Mental Health through Will-training: A System of Self-help in Psychotherapy as Practiced by Recovery, Incorporated,","review":"This book is for those who desire self-help using a cognitive method. Dr. Low was an unrecognized pioneer in the mental health field; he has been credited by his patients with saving many lives. The book is extremely practical. It may encourage readers to participate in a self-help organization founded in 1937 which has in the intervening years become international in scope. One may choose portions of the book that are applicable. After having read the book more than 25 years ago and consulting it as a resource, I recommend it for those suffering from mental/emotional afflictions for whom self-help is appropriate. Recovery does not replace a professional, but rather works with him/her."},{"Title":"Mental Health through Will-training: A System of Self-help in Psychotherapy as Practiced by Recovery, Incorporated,","review":"I attended my first group meeting when Treasure Rice was president when there were only 3 people attending. We met every week at the home of one of the members. I had a fear of cancer. Went from one doctor to another. In 1970 my worst fear came true. I had melanoma (skin cancer) 2% of the population had it. I had a skin graft and was cured. Ten years ago I had a mastectomy and was able to get through that through my Recovery training. I also had a complete hysterectomy four years ago and now have osteoporosis. Because this book stresses that the WILL is what gets you through ANY situation and it shows you how to get through every day, sometimes 1 hour at a time or 1 minute at a time. It is the fear that seems overwhelming. I learned that most of the things in life are trivialities and that through my will which instructs me to face my fear and that I can bear the discomfort. I now have peace of mind in my life. I am a retired legal secretary and am busy every day. I volunteer at the local theatre and usher so I get to see the shows. I also volunteer at the Senior Center in the exercise room and I go to the Spa for water exercises. I have used this book and its teachings in raising my children (daughter 49, son 46) who have used it in their lives. One may feel helpless but you are not hopeless. Anything is possible. I keep a positive attitude and always have a sense of humor. This book covers everything in one's life and shows you step by step how to handle any situation that you are experiencing.

And I believe her. But some of us need more heavy &quot;Head Work&quot; I believe. Real &quot;Trench Warfare&quot;. Dr. Low teaches you cognitive-behavioral therapy in this book. But he doesn't leave it there. Daily readings. And ONE TWO-HOUR MEETING A WEEK WITH OTHER NUT CASES! Why am I screaming? Because it is easy to sit at your computer and be mean. But you can't getaway with this in real life. I read most of Low's book after my first meeting. I felt excruciating anxiety for 4 days BEFORE THE MEETING! I'm screaming again, right? Sorry. And my reading didn't really DIG IN until I got to the meeting. You say something and then everybody else contributes and then these cognitive techniques are really cut into your brain. This is the main text. So it is one-third of the program. The other two parts are daily application and one meeting a week. It seems that people with psychological problems make TREMENDOUS demands on themselves. This book will re-wire your brain. And that may take awhile. But remember this. According to Dr. Low, when you cut a &quot;temper&quot; sequence of working yourself up into anxiety and anger or down into depression, you will be automatically reducing those HIGHER STRESSORS which you will have to confront. Let's make it simple. Asking a question of somebody on the street may cause incredible anxiety. Let's say 99. But if you &quot;spot&quot; this scenerio and replace it with realistic thoughts (&quot;I'm not doing anything wrong&quot;) and endorse yourself (&quot;I did just fine&quot;) - this process will reduce the the anxiety of public speaking, say, from 1,000 to 859. Good deal, huh? As Low says, &quot;Strike at the Weakest Link&quot;. If your dog dies and you have a BIG DEPRESSION of 876, let us say, and you practice this program and your spouse dies, you might only get hit with a 700! Whereas, before, it might have been 7,000, given you a stroke, and put you in a hospital. Do buy the book. I could philosophize about all the chapters (Like &quot;The Courage to Make Mistakes&quot;, chapter 30), but I think you now understand the whole purpose of the text.

Of course the two engage in hot jungle love before proclaiming their undying devotion to each other.This book was a real chore to finish. In fact, if this was my fist SB book, it would also be the last. Poor writing, lame dialog, and a generally uninteresting plot make this a pretty poor entry in Brown's list of hits.

She does it several times and I thought it lead to a more interesting read.The novel is a biography of a family, primarily during the first half of the twentieth century beginning with the flight to Canada in 1913 by Yakov Lapinsky following a progrom in Russia. He meets up with a cousin in Toronto and they become peddlers. Yakov marries and he and his wife have four sons. The family survives through the Depression, a riot by a group of Nazi sympathizers in 1933, World War II, and its aftermath.One of the sons, Sonny, becomes a professional and highly successful boxer and there is a lot of information about the world of boxing. The author assumes the role of his grandson.The influence of criminals on businesses and sports that help the family survive is detailed as are disasterous invasions that Canadian soldiers died in while trying to fight the Germans in France.The role and effects of guilt play a tremendous part in this family's story. Yacov was not able to save his younger brother in Russia. His youngest son suffers a major brain injury in the riot in Canada. Everyone is blamed and everyone considers himself/herself guilty. The biggest effect is the way Yakov treats his sons because of his guilt.It cleverly shows the doctor jovially explaining their son's brain injury to his parents, who lack the language skills and education to understand is technical explanation. The way Yakov treats his family is mirrored in the way Sonny treats his.In many ways I found this a difficult book to read, especially the scenes during World War II, but it was definitely worth it."},{"Title":"The Five Books of Moses Lapinsky","review":"It was purely happenchance that I came across this novel. I was in a musty, basement second-hand bookshop, looking for something else entirely, when I found it. Well, 'we found each other' is probably more appropriate, given the end result: an almost perfectly satisfying reading experience. (Full disclosure: I was sold by the cover...and the jacket blurbs. What can I tell you; I'm a sucker for great artwork and tasty marketing. To be truthful, the packaging, the cue words, the intimation of what the novel promised was what had me reaching for my wallet.)My personal reading preference is for literatary novels, featuring prose that has me, as a writer, wishing I'd written it. I crave if not the transcendent, then the staggering. As novelist, I have a love of powerful prose. As a screenwriter, I have an appreciation of the visual. But either way, I love a great story. A tale well-told. 'The Five Books of Moses Lapinsky' is strong on the storytelling...if not exactly scoring top marks on the literary impact.The story spans (if only tangentally) a century and three continents. And yet it's fiercely focused on a Toronto family. It has Sonny Lapinsky at its core, but everyone plays a part, everyone has something to contribute. What I appreciated most about Ms Tulchinsky's efforts was that she chose to mix things up chronologically, and how well she managed the mix; the layout was refreshing. And I never felt anything but confidence coming off the page. I don't think 'masterful' is too great an adjective to use in this regard.As for the actual writing, her literary 'chops'... Well, I chose the title of my review carefully. Her style is simple. As in 'spare and effective'. There is nothing strained about it, nothing flowery. It reminded me of Richard Russo's...although hers is even more factual. That she writes in the present-tense undoubtedly magnifies the effect. No, it's not Ann-Marie MacDonald's 'Fall on Your Knees'. (And granted, I'm not sure Ms Tulchinsky has it in her to write that way, or whether she'd even want to.) But the novel did captivate me completely from start to finish.And in conclusion, I'll pay Ms Tulchinsky as heartfelt a compliment as I can: it would make an incredible film/mini-series. Oh; did I mention I was a screenwriter...?"},{"Title":"The Five Books of Moses Lapinsky","review":"The Five Books of Moses Lapinsky by Karen X. Tulchinsky is a phenomenal deviation from her previous style. Although I have come to love her wit, humorous characterizations and dialogues in previous books, I appreciate the maturity of her latest achievement. Her novel is based on the Christie Pits riots and depicts the four brothers of the Lapinsky family struggling through the depression into the fifties. In so doing, she connects a multitude of characters on whom the brothers rely and paints an exceptional portrayal of resistance.Tulchinsky's keen eye for injustice, which her reader's have become accustomed to, is different and arguable much more advanced than in her previous fiction. Centering her characters around the horribly ambivalent situation of Canadian Jewish immigrants during the Second World War, she captures a slice of Canadian identity often left untold. In addition, she convincingly exposes hypocrisies surrounding her closeted gay character through his relationship to the military and his family and surroundings. As tragic as many of the chapters of The Five Books are, Tulchinsky still delivers humour and moments of lightness laced with profound triumph.It is no small feat to build such a massive conglomerate of intertwined tales around a central metaphor. In The Five Books, that metaphor is boxing or, if one wants to make a broader leap, fighting. The book demonstrates what I believe Tulchinsky is trying to share - that fighting must be methodical, structured, practiced and, most importantly, that the struggle to win a fight begins and ends in the heart."},{"Title":"The Five Books of Moses Lapinsky","review":"Like \\"Schmadrian,\\" I came across this book by accident -- in a bargain bin, and I was drawn in by the title and the description brought it to the counter. The book was a really fun read. I grew up on my father's stories of Jewish prizefighters in the '40s, and have done a lot of reading about them. [My dad's were in New Jersey and New York, but old immigrant cities in the New World really aren't so different.] Karen Tulchinsky created a character in Sonny Lapinsky who is filled with motivation to do all the things he needed to become a champion fighter but not wear that belt as a father and husband. This is a complex, character-driven novel which was well researched and well executed.There are only two minor disappointments. One, the title gave me the impression that the story would unfold in a way that mirrors The Bible. That doesn't happen. Second, as a writer, Karen Tulchinsky's focus seems to be on lesbian erotica -- which leads me to believe we're not going to see another historical sports novel from her. This is a shame, because this effort is filled with promise and I'd love to read another."},{"Title":"National Statuary Hall: Guidebook for a walking tour","review":"One of the most distinctive features of the United States Capitol is its collection of statues assembled from each state. &quot;National Statuary Hall: Guidebook for a Walking Tour&quot; helps to bring this collection alive -- to better share a sense of the history found in every corner of the building.&quot;National Statuary Hall: Guidebook for a Walking Tour&quot; is both thoroughly researched and easy to use. Both the content and the layout of the book excellent in every regard. In the terms of layout, the design of the Capitol itself presents an author with difficulty. The arrangement of works of art can often be confusing. However in this guidebook, the collection is presented in a logical fashion - which lends itself easily to a \`walking tour'. Each statue has a detailed description and biographical sketch of the individual, which helps a visitor understand the importance of the individuals represented in the collection.I would highly recommend this book to anyone planning a visit to the Capitol, or to anyone simply interested in the \`slice' of American history represented by the 96 statues found in the Statuary Hall Collection of the Capitol."},{"Title":"National Statuary Hall: Guidebook for a walking tour","review":"This is a wonderfully concise and entertaining guide to the statuary in the U.S. Capitol donated by the 50 states.

We relive this Chicago boy's first impressions, like a remake of \\"Abbot & Costello Meet the Wolf Man.\\"It is not reality TV, but it is reality, as Dillon is introduced to dormitory life, his little iron cot, a cold-water-only faucet and fear of the Lord.For the young lads in a high school seminary of that era, there was no political correctness or a civil right. They didn't know what rights were, so they didn't miss them.Their formative years revolved around an education by qualified teachers, sports, choir, games, band, theater, shenanigans, penance, spiritual exercises and more shenanigans.The food was \\"cheap, ill-prepared and tasteless.\\" Would Dillon have a story to tell if they had menus and bonbons for dessert? He says the kids learned etiquette and to enjoy Government Surplus food. Meals were in silence with lectors reading the Lives of the Saints. Dillon contends the whole milieu developed character and characters--like \\"Dogs\\" O'Donohue, \\"Shorty\\" Long, and \\"Whisky John\\" Doyle. Could anything good come from classmates with nicknames like that? But much good did evolve as these young men went on to become \\"powerhouses as teachers and leaders, welcome in any school,\\" as the author proudly points out.The Christian Brothers are not a monastic order. \\"Yet bits and pieces of monasticism,\\" Dillon writes, \\"cobbled together the day of the brother teaching in the schools, and to some extent, the day of the junior novice in the high school seminary.\\" It was a time when, he says, \\"Religious formation meant cultivating the fullness of the Christian life in each young man through regular participation in the Mass, the liturgy, the sacraments. It meant the greenhouse growing of personal prayer life, of a community life, and a continual reaffirmation of the choice to be a Christian Brother...\\"\\"House of Formation\\" is an enjoyable read if just for the nostalgia, but Dillon didn't spend 21 years as a scholar and teaching brother in schools and at his old seminary, to be sentimental. He is also curious how it fell apart. All the men in his high school seminary class eventually left the order. Dillon himself was laicized in 1976 and is now widowed, remarried, raising a family.With a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, and as a professor of education at the University of California, Riverside, he shares his soul-searched evaluations with the reader.There is no \\"alumni association\\" as such for the men who left after living a communal life for years. Brothers who left the order, Dillon says, \\"disappeared into the night and did not reappear.\\" The order did not permit members to communicate with an \\"ex\\" brother.Dillon describes the typical leave-taking as the stuff of \\"horror stories.\\" No money, no job, no housing, clothing or possessions, \\"often with only a train ticket or city bus fare; emotional confusion-fear, guilt, bitterness, shame...\\" his list of social disintegration goes on.But one maverick brother who left the order in 1948 formed a loose-knit club for \\"ex\\"s of the 1930s and \`40s. Dillon reports many of these men were able to maintain lifelong friendships with a number of their former seminary teachers.A breakthrough came in 1986 when a reunion was organized for the centenary of the old seminary in Missouri. The \\"ex\\"s were invited to bring their wives and children, and a healing process began.Today, thanks to the Internet and through the research Dillon did for this book, and a sequel, men estranged for 50 years are connecting and swapping memories and their life-after stories.The religious order now hosts yearly reunions and special anniversary get-togethers. It is a time to rejoice. It is also a time when a Christian Brother's average age is past retirement.Dillon opens up the final pages to human perspectives by his remaining band of brothers and ex-brothers of various ages. Their comments are poignant and succinct.Like any good teacher, the author adds a glossary, source list and index.Whatever brassy book you've read lately berating the church for her faults, read this one as a saving grace."},{"Title":"Advertising Media Planning: A Brand Management Approach","review":"I am relatively new to the advertising field and was anxious to receive this book to broaden my knowledge.

Basic life textures explained in simple detail, such as water droplets, wood, rust and glass. I would have rated it a five star had he included landscapes such as sky and those tough clouds. Don't confuse &quot;textures&quot; with scraping off layeres of wax. &quot;Textures&quot; described here are creating the look of textures such as rock, aged wood, and tree bark. His pictures of &quot;shiny metal&quot; are beautiful but his example doesn't show how to create that specific metal."},{"Title":"Creating Textures in Colored Pencil","review":"The real merit of this book is the absolutely gorgeous drawings which, if not for the title, I wouldn't have beleived were colored pencil. It is wonderful to see colored pencil treated with the same legitamacy as acrylic or oils, and I now look forward to \\"painting\\" with my pencils.The most useful aspect of the book is the rev iew of materials, where the author breaks down how to use rubber cement thinner, odorless turpentine, and colored markers to enhance your colored pencils, as well as various artistic tools.Before I used this book, my colored pencils always were grainy, and I didn't even really realize it. There were too many \\"flecks\\", too much white showing through the paper. This book taught me a technique called burnishing, which has dramatically and instantly improved my drawings, I'm sure it can do the same for you. I also am experimenting more with layers, after looking at the phenominal results that can be achieved.My only complaint is the lack of detailed how-to's. The individual colors used are explained, and there is some break down of the process, but not enough to produce satisfactory results. However, I think it is definatley worth the modest price, and would recommend it to anyone interested in this medium."},{"Title":"Creating Textures in Colored Pencil","review":"I have a Bachelor degree in drawing and had no problem getting the hang of any drawing tool except for coloured pencils. Several years ago I took a class specifically on drawing with colour pencil and was disappointed when the teacher told me that I'd have to settle for a light layered application of the pencil on paper so as not to develop wax bloom--what I wanted out of the pencil was rich, vibrant colours, not something washed out. I put down my Prismacolours and resigned having to use them to colour in my anatomy colouring book, not for actual drawing.That's why I was encouraged when I found and read my way through \\"Creating Textures in Colored Pencil\\". The author mentions the use of burnishing to build layered colour so it is rich and vibrant, as well as the use of solvents. He also mentions different coloured pencils, like water-soluable pencils, which I normally would use not for drawing but for fine touches on my watercolours, and oil-based coloured pencils. After reading this book it feels like a whole new world of drawing has opened up to me, in addition to my use of graphite, conte crayon, pastels, and of course what I already do in paint.Incidentally, the author addresses dealing with wax bloom by spraying the drawing with several layers of workable fixative--I've also heard that wiping the bloom with a paper towel will remove the cloudiness.Mr. Greene includes several examples of items to draw, including step-by-step instructions with colours mentioned. I'm sure those would be great for the beginning/intermediate student to build up skills and confidence; that sort of thing doesn't appeal to me as I'm used to grabbing tools and drawing from life.I think this is a great basic book on how to handle the medium. As for handling textures, I thought some were very well done while others were not as realistic as I would like. It has very nice full colour reproduction and is very easy to read."},{"Title":"Creating Textures in Colored Pencil","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer who stated that there were not enough how tos in the book.

Though I agree with previous reviewers in that I wish it had been a little more detailed in its presentation of instructions, the success I still achieved from the pages was still more than I had had with any other book in my colored pencil library (the exception being Ann Kullberg's Colored Pencil Portraits which is truly the master work for me).Despite its lack of a detailed step-by-step, you can't go wrong with this book as a reference material.

TaylorThroughout history there have been struggles to make America a safer place, improve our local communities and the communication with our fellow people. The book entitled Harlem Between Heaven and Hell by Monique M. Taylor depicts the struggles Harlem has overcome as their neighborhoods fell looking at the issues of race, class, culture and the gentrification of Harlem. After Harlem had hit rock bottom the only way for improvement was upward. To do so middle class people needed to move into the neighborhoods to help improve the livelihood and well being of Harlem residents. This book is a good read if you are interested in gentrification and the struggles of fitting into a rundown community. I didn't like how the book was compiled of bits and pieces of individual interviews. Although what the interviewees have a lot of interesting information to say, it becomes a bit confusing to me at times, trying to keep them straight. Also, the book primarily focused on how Harlem needed the black middle class to help bring the community back together, Monique's words seemed to be a bit contradicting at the end. I agree with the fact that different classes are needed to keep the community whole, but to depend on one class in general makes no sense. At the end of the book Monique says that depending on the black middle class will not solve their problems. There you can see how her words are contradicting.Overall the ideas presented in this book made sense for the most part I agreed with them or at least understood why Monique felt the need to mention them. Harlem needed the black gentry to make their move in to make sure the community didn't get any worse. If you like books that are more personal, relating the main issues to real people, then this book is one you might want to check out. Personally, I like books that are more structured but that is my opinion. Learning about Harlem can be very interesting, especially with the Harlem Renaissance just the history of Harlem altogether. Monique M. Taylor writes a lot of important information. If you are unfamiliar with the gentrification of Harlem then this book might appeal to you."},{"Title":"Harlem Between Heaven And Hell","review":"Harlem is almost completely unique in the U.S. in that the residents are actively trying to keep the city's (black) population predominantly black. Whereas in most cases (as in the definition of the word \`ghetto') black areas are kept black by society and other forces, citizens and officials in Harlem try to promote immigration of black citizens from the rest of the city and country. Many of these new citizens of Harlem however are members of the middle class, many of whom work in Manhattan or other \`white' areas of town, and are consequently moving in with people who although are black, are not of similar economic means. This of course creates not necessarily conflict among neighbors (although it often does), but a very unique blend of behavioral differences with which then new residents have to deal. Moving to a mostly black neighborhood is a godsend for many African-American members of the middle class, says Ms. Taylor. They note feeling constantly like outsiders. Being a minority among mostly white people in their jobs, in Ivy League and other upstanding educational institutions, and in their former homes in more upscale areas they often felt out of place. Several individuals interviewed in the book mention being mistaken for bellhops in the elevators of buildings in which they lived. In these same buildings young white people would ask them \`what they were doing there', or \`how they got there'. Despite being professionals, dressing similarly to their white peers, talking just like them, having been educated, and obviously having a respectable career just as they did, they didn't feel welcome. They also felt as if they had to constantly try to represent their people, as respectable black citizens, as if the way they were judged as individuals would be the way the black community would be judged. This of course added yet more stress to an already tougher than usual life. Living in Harlem, among fellow African-Americans, they said, just eased the stress they felt all day at work. Once they got home none of these problems were left with which they had to deal. Many of the problems found in Harlem could be tolerated in comparison to the problems they found living in white areas. As for the book itself, being a man with a very short attention span, I found it somewhat hard to read, but as an informative book by my standards it was good. It is packed with as much information as one would need about modern Harlem, and especially with people's personal views, experiences, and accounts of the city. A great deal of the book is in residents' words, which adds authenticity as well as flavor. The book is of course meant for a reasonably astute readership, as the vocabulary is quite advanced and it can't be skimmed. For a wide range of views and accounts of Harlem, New York, in any case, Harlem: Between Heaven and Hell is a great source of insight."},{"Title":"Harlem Between Heaven And Hell","review":"After reading Harlem between Heaven and Hell, I think that the argument that Taylor was trying to make was that of how people of the same race can live together in an area over time. I think she was trying to show how people of the same race, but yet different economic status or class structure could live amongst each other. This book gives a voice to all different types of people from who they were, who they have become, and how they got there, whether it was through racial or economic freedoms or struggles throughout their living in Harlem. I also think that in Taylor's argument she was trying to argue the issue of race relations and how they changed over time, along with the changes on other conflicts and issues surrounding the area. Taylor argued that there were social changes present and that feelings and emotions had over these changes were either opinions or outlooks that were embraced or ridiculed by the public.This book tells a story of the history of Harlem. Taylor is able to show the history of Harlem throughout its time from starting out at its humble beginnings in the 1920's through the 1930's and at its not so good times in the 1960's and 1970's, and at other periods of time in-between. I think Taylor did this to have the audience get a better understanding of all the issues and situations that happened in Harlem. Harlem was a place where the middle-class African American population could settle and expand on their own culture and make connections with other races and groups of people. At its beginnings, Harlem became a booming place for people to come to for inspiration, and to start a new understanding of art, music, and culture for people to be proud of, especially those of African-American ethnicity and diversity.In the book, I think Taylor is able to covey here argument of how the African-American middle class was able to make it through community and neighborhood struggles with those of similar racial but diverse economic conditions with the help of talking to people who lived or know of what went about in Harlem. Taylor was able to conduct interview with many different kind of people. She spoke to people who had professions, those who were married or single, and those with or without children. This book was interesting because so this aspect. The interviews were able to give a new perspective on the history of Harlem, its development, activism tat went on, and other connections made. I think this was able to help Taylor's argument by showing other perspectives and experiences of those who lived in Harlem. It gave these people a voice to try and explain and describe their personal struggles with racial and economic conflict.I think this book also explores the stresses that the African-American middle-class went through while living in Harlem. They had to go through a lot of social change even in the very beginning of Harlem. Stresses such as inequality and activism, among other things, played a large role in the racial and class struggles in the communities of Harlem. This culture needed to learn how to work together to make their conditions better and more effective. Each person needed to learn from the next and needed to listen to one another to better understand where everyone was coming from, even if they weren't at the same status as their neighbor."},{"Title":"Harlem Between Heaven And Hell","review":"Harlem: Between Heaven and Hell is about the ongoing struggle between race and class that exists in Harlem. The main conflict is based on gentrification and economics. Monique M. Taylor uses interviews with middle class African Americans as support for her claims. Harlem used to be considered a \\"black Mecca\\", but more recently has become overtaken with poverty and deterioration, which is where we see the heaven and hell complex come into play. In her introduction Monique M. Taylor lays out the objectives of the book and goes on to explain them throughout the rest of it.In the first chapter Taylor gives us a look into Harlem and its history as an African American community, a heaven. She points to significance in literature as well as other art forms, using such historical figures as Langston Hughes, to illustrate Harlem's importance in the black community. After the times of the Harlem renaissance there is a shift where Harlem becomes \\"just another festering black ghetto\\"(17). This is the beginning of hell in Harlem.Taylor introduces to the idea of \\"insiders and outsiders\\", long time residents of Harlem and newcomers to Harlem, respectively. Here we see a conflict between whites and blacks about the gentrification of Harlem. The question raised is whether this reconstruction of a community is \\"in Harlem or for Harlem?\\"(30). Many insiders see the white gentry as having motives that are not in the interest of the community and will lead to the displacement of those already in Harlem. They also see the middle class black gentry as a threat and as outsiders. While there is no racial tension between the lower and middle class blacks, there is certainly class tension. Some argue that race should not be the issue, but instead it should be about capital. Whoever has the money will be most beneficial to the community because there has been no supply to satisfy the demand of the housing market since the government so much of the housing (37). So while some think that whites could help Harlem economically with the addition of businesses, while others fear they may bring an uncomfortable undertone to the community and take over the whole community through displacement.Harlemites are also suspicious of the Black gentry and their motives. Because they have money people assume they have no interest in the black community and only want to restore the community for financial gain, thus leading to displacement. Through her interviews with members of the middle class black \\"outsiders\\", Taylor shows that they do admittedly have economic interests, but are also interested in being in a community where they are surrounded by their people. She illustrates the struggle for middle class blacks between home and work very well. As a result of their race they are uncomfortable at work in the white corporate world, and then they go home to Harlem expecting acceptance, but again face rejection because they have money. The black gentry argue that they want the same thing for Harlem that they insiders want, which is a nice place to live and that with their money that is possible. There is also the conflict between the private and public aspects of the lives of the black middle class. Taylor points to \\"the stoop\\" as an example where the middle class ride a fine of being respected and resented (120). In an attempt to avoid trash and loitering they will prohibit neighbors from sitting on their stoop. This could be seen by lower class people as a way to show that the middle class is too good for them, but based on the interviews it is more often taken as a request that gains them respect. In Chapter 5, Taylor sets out to show how the community in Harlem can have an incredible emphasis on togetherness. She demonstrates this by showing the importance of institutions like church and businesses as social networks. While there is tension between classes, many times there is a coming together on political issues for the sake of Harlem. There is also a constant sense of looking out for others, while they look out for you. This is even extending to the middle class. Some see the black middle class a resource with their college educations. Later Taylor claims that the black gentry's \\"ability to move in and out of Harlem to work, shop, and socialize means that their...is part-time and voluntary.\\"(168). Following that she concludes that because of this they cannot be expected to solve Harlem's problem. From this I see Taylor as saying that it is up to the insiders to fix their community and to not depend on the middle class to make the changes.Overall I thought the book was just ok. I think that Taylor could have interviewed insider residents of Harlem to get a better picture of the conflict, rather than just getting the gentry side. I also found it hard to figure out what side of the issue Taylor herself was on. Another thing I wonder is how accurate her portrayal of the middle class was. It seems that everyone had similar ideas, so what about the black middle class people who had no interest in preserving the traditional Harlem and were just in it for the money? While I thought the book was a bit hard to get through and repetitive, I think that her use of interviews did have an affect that made her claims seem more valid."},{"Title":"Electrifying Medicine: How Electricity Sparked a Medical Revolution","review":"This is a nicely illustrated, clearly written book. . . .

Author Christopher Wilson does a wonderful job of taking the reader into an era that will never be seen again. From the '30s through the '50s the rich lived their lives showing only what was appropriate for the public to see. Any questionable behavior was covered up by their wealth. Enter Jimmy Donahue. Here was a very rich, spoiled, irresponsible, homosexual mama's boy who used his personality and charm to accomplish anything he set his mind to. This included his attempt to be the obsession of both the Duke and Duchess. It wasn't a far cry to upset an already dysfunctional marriage but it was interesting to read the winding road to hell that Donahue lead them to. What's also very interesting is the bizarre relationship Wilson writes of between Donahue and his mother Jessie - very controlling and always covering up every scandal involvoing her son. This book is complete gossip but if that's your liking this book is for you. For all his shocking exploits, in the end, Jimmy Donahue ended up a mere unknown. A complete opposite of how hard he tried to stay in the public eye."},{"Title":"Dancing with the Devil: The Windsors and Jimmy Donahue","review":"OK, so the author isn't going to win the Nobel Prize for Literature for this book.

I must have read at least 10 to 15 books about the couple, and despite what the one of the reviewers said, I've only come across a few rare references to him.

I enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Dancing with the Devil: The Windsors and Jimmy Donahue","review":"3Dancing With the Devil : The Windsors and Jimmy Donahue2 is a sweeping adventure of scandal and euphoria among glitzy cafe society, adeptly brought to life by biographer Christopher Wilson.In this case, the name 3Donahue,2 is directly related to a very famous name: Woolworth. When 35 &amp; 102 chainstore mogul Frank Winfield Woolworth died in 1919, he left as part of his substantial legacy great hopes for his cherubic grandchildren. He visualized his heirs evolving into hardworking, benefic, God-fearing, and rational adults. But alas, if he did happen to look down from the heavens years later, I know that several of his descendants would have provoked a disgruntled sigh; including the spendthrift, serial divorcee Barbara Hutton...But the mischievous, downright extraordinary exploits of his grandson Jimmy Donahue would have sent Woolworth longing for Divine intervention. The fact is that, the only thing Frank Woolworth and his grandson Jimmy shared (other than a notable gene pool) was a compulsion for the spotlight.That compulsion, along with a host of others (some advantageous, most unsavory) are unveiled in this wonderful, fast-paced book. In Dancing With the Devil, we meet dashing Jimmy Donahue, a man who had entirely too much free time on his hands, and entirely too much money at his disposal. We learn that Jimmy1s access to money, along with his excessive adoration for luxury, his psychological baggage (he even witnessed the suicide of his manic depressive and bisexual father) and the questionable role model Jimmy found in his jetsetting mother --all combined to create an intriguing, complex and colorful personality. Wilson depicts an international playboy who defied reigning sexual taboos and balked at authority, yet was sometimes ridden by deep guilt. Donahue exhibited such random amounts of innocent rakishness and sensual greed; of hearfelt generosity and rash wastefulness-- that even his closest contemporaries were not sure what to think of him.Wilson expertly peppers his historical accounts with authentic detail, smoothly leading us into post WWII Paris, then sweeping us back to the United States to the playgrounds of Palm Beach and Long Island. Clearly, Wilson did a great deal of research on this book, conducting scores of interviews and tracking down hard to find information.Of course, Wilson1s readers are also treated to little known details about the odd triangle between Jimmy Donahue and the Windsors, thus providing an interesting account of the last untold episode in their lives.As in Jimmy Donahue1s life, there is nary a dull moment in Dancing With the Devil. (Do check out the 3Acknowledgments2 which reads like a Who1s Who in and of itself). Definitely recommended!"},{"Title":"Dancing with the Devil: The Windsors and Jimmy Donahue","review":"I read all the reviews of this when it came out a few years ago, and am only mildly disappointed to find that the full copy (obtained at The Strand: hard cover, last copy) tells me nothing new other than that Jimmy Donahue didn't much apply himself at Choate.This is biography lite, highly entertaining, scantily referenced and hence easy to capsule into a 500-word review. Not a great book or a good book, but a fun book. The sort of book you or I could write over a long weekend simply by Googling a few names and following sources referenced in Wikipedia. In fact, I suspect that is how Christopher Wilson wrote it. He's not big on apparatus. There is a bibliography, true, but it consists mostly of books by names on the order of Charles Higham (you know, the guy who claimed Errol Flynn was both homosexual AND a Nazi spy!). Almost no footnotes, of course. Wilson has a slim grasp on history altogether. He thinks King Charles II was executed (he wasn't). He passes on, as accepted fact, the posthumous tale about how Cardinal Spellman of New York was a notorious homosexual and cruised for new partners to \\"deflower\\" after the noon Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral. On one page Wilson tells you that the Duchess of Windsor underwent a hysterectomy, on the next he relates the old camp rumor that she was a genetic male with AIS; apparently he doesn't know enough to note a contradiction.The book seems to have originated in an earlier biography of Barbara Hutton, Jimmy's first cousin and fellow heir to the F. W. Woolworth fortune. There was almost as much information about Jimmy in that book as there is here. The juiciest bit, which Wilson repeats and expands upon before discrediting, is about the sailor whom Jimmy picked up at Cerutti's in 1945. During a drunken party, someone decided to shave the sailor's body hair and accidentally emasculated him. The Woolworth millions hushed up the story. That is the tale as related by that reliable source Truman Capote. Of course it is not true. (It wasn't a sailor, it was a salesman. Sailor, salesman, what's the difference? Oh, and he may have had a bite out of his ear. But $200,000 was the Woolworth payoff, according to Wilson, and the salesman never had to work again.)Wilson does not have much of a handle on the exact relationship between Donahue and the Duchess, but speculates there was some sort of emotional bonding and maybe some oral sex. He spends many pages speculating why this may have been so. In addition, Donahue and his mother gave the Windsors a lot of money, and that no doubt lubricated the friendship. But then Jimmy was generous with the New York Foundling Hospital and other charitable enterprises as well, so the Windsors weren't the only beneficiaries of this degenerate scamp. Possibly Jimmy just felt sorry for the abandoned and downtrodden.Good guy, Jimmy. Deserves a decent biography."},{"Title":"Dancing with the Devil: The Windsors and Jimmy Donahue","review":"There is a riveting book to be written about the odd, multi-faceted triangle shared by Woolworth heir Jimmy Donahue and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Unfortunately, this book only skims the surface. Rarely do any of the players come to life. More examples of Donahue's supposed wit and cavalier charm, in lieu of his often grotesque pranks, would be welcome. The writing is prosaic and plodding. I often had the feeling the author was writing under the gun of an impending deadline -- there is a rushed quality to much of the book. Still, worth reading if you're fascinated, as I am, about the Windsors, a fascinating era, and great wealth and opportunity squandered."},{"Title":"Dancing with the Devil: The Windsors and Jimmy Donahue","review":"This book doesn't do much more than re-hash rumor, gossip and innuendo--and some facts--that I've already read in better-written, more thorough and scholarly biographies of the Windsors. I didn't notice any glaring inaccuracies; on the other hand, I didn't notice that the author broke any new ground. He seems to have relied heavily on previously published biographies of the Duke, the Duchess, and the British Royal Family in general, all of which a serious Windsorite will have already read. Also--let's face it--we read books like this one to be titillated, and the author fails utterly to titillate us. Save your money."},{"Title":"Dancing with the Devil: The Windsors and Jimmy Donahue","review":"But, the story is so tawdry & Jimmy Donahue so scurvy, it's a hard read. The author presents information about his upbringing that tries to make you feel a little sympathy for Donahue but it's hard to feel sympathy for such a loser. The Duke & Duchess of Windsor were wastes of human beings, too. The more you read about them the more discouraged you get. What wasted opportunities! They could have done so much good but were such selfish, self-centered & STUPID people. No wonder the Royal Family can't stand to hear their names mentioned. The book reads kind of like a prolonged Dominick Dunne article in Vanity Fair."},{"Title":"Dancing with the Devil: The Windsors and Jimmy Donahue","review":"You'd think an author couldn't go wrong with this cast of characters, ultra chic jet set locations, and deliciously lewd sex play.

No God in that, and none of this mass killing, so that point is mootJapan doesn't have any \\"God and Jesus\\", no mass killings.NOTE: So These countries don't have mentally ILL????The USA is a whole mix of kids and religions is what set some kids off, upper class mixing with lower class, shy with jocks, different religions, all combined. This has never happened in the society in history, all of this mixing. Yes we are trying to \\"have a go at it\\", and for the most part its working, but nothing is 100% perfect.Everyone is getting it wrong, flat wrongThis author claims it's a mental illness that these shooters suffer from. It has NOTHING to do with a \\"mental illness\\", that's flat wrongo. I saw her on TV on the Bill Curtis rampage special she has no make up on, and is making a TV appearance, so that must be how she is, women with no make up on, and especially those who need it, always turn out to be radicals, and who trust a radicals view? Not many.Oh no, I just put her down, will she go postal now? And have you notice a woman has never gone postal with a gun? Why? Because women, while they do suicide, they don't take it out on others, only themselves because they blame themselves if something goes wrong. If a woman has a weakness, a physical handicap, she still by because she can still get a man, IF she wants to, for a weakness in a woman does not bother a man, what's the only thing a man is really after? Hint hint, right you guessed it. More so if a woman has a weakness many men will take advantage of that and want her more, as man is a dominator and likes a weakness, to give him power. So bottom line is a woman with a physical impairment, or someone who doesn't fit in with a \\"click\\", can always find a man, if she wants one.Well, the author doesn't get it. zero stars for calling it a mental illness, when its not. Or it would happen in other countries, for if we have mentally ill in the USA, then the rest of the world has some also. Where are the mass killers in other countries???Cho's speech problem, the columbine killers were small kids, any weakness in a male, he then can have problems with girls/ women and asserting himself in any \\"male ranks\\". For females are the opposite, they do *not* like a weakness in males. Also males, have the need by nature to be strong, and if other boys/men treat them as lesser thans, over time, it builds up. If you do not suffer from anything physical, then you will NOT ever get this, I don't care how many degrees you have, how much money you have, how observant you are of the world, how smart you are, male or female, you will never get it.Look at the animal world in the wild?, who gets all the females? The strongest male.Males that get \\"excluded\\" from others turn inward, and start watching everyone and everything else from the outside in, they just watch and watch. See others having a good time. They just watch and watch and watch. It builds and builds and builds.There isn't any \\"counseling\\" or \\"meds\\" that is going to change anything, I said, there isn't any counseling or meds that is going to change anything. That's a flat red flag for people that push that flat don't get it, and think they do, or are trying to get it.You have a person that is \\"removed\\" from society, through \\"default\\" meaning its NOT anything they have done, but its how others are treating them, then your going to have people that \\"check out\\", for humans do not life to be alone. Animals like to be alone, hence, no suicides in the animal world. Yet more proof we are not animals, but that's another conversation.This book does not really bring anything new to the table, but is worth having if for no other reason than it has a history of shootings that stretches all the way back to the 70's. (All trends, graphs and studies usually start in the 90's when the killings reached their appex.) It was interesting to see that back then the trend tended to be \\"Shoot Authority Figures!\\" as opposed to today's killers who tend to hunt their peers instead.Exactly, and when did the all the \\"times change\\" and we all started to live with each other? In the 1970's , right? and no one did one of these rampages before the 1970's, right? *RIGHT*Lastly, all these kinds of problems happen in big large schools, right? RightEveryone is getting it wrong, flat wrong. What I just said are \\"the\\" answers, and I do not have a PHD, but I have a physical problem, so I know.You either get to the point where you except it, through faith that after your outta here from this planet life will be better, or you succumb to it and always seeking help of the world, meds, counseling, nothing changes, then you lose it. For the nearly 99% of those who lose it and commit suicide they do it alone, and you never here about them, right? For the few that get so pissed off that they fell they need to send a message, and take out as many as they can on the way, that's what they do. I am surprised it doesn't happen more often, isn't anybody else? So we can be thankful for that.Bottom line is, each generation of kids come along, none of them know about what has happened in history, kids being kids bulling and making fun of and excluding others has gone on for as long as time has been going on, nothing new here, nothing will change. All this new age of counseling and meds is a phony Band-Aid. Sure it helps suppress and save a few people, keeps some in check, but it doesn't change the problem. And I know many will debate it's not supposed to, it's only to help one person at a time, deal with their \\"own\\" stuff. But it's not working, more meds and counseling is going on than ever in history, and suicide is higher now than ever, right? Yes we have more of a world population, but the ratio is higher now than ever. Maybe that's because guns are new over the last few centuries, which is by far the most used method, especially by males.I guess the only way outta all this is to move to the mountains and live an easy life! Well, that's no answer either, why do you think they have so many lil bars in all over in every mountain area.Interesting mankind's continual needs to be around people no matter where in the world, we hate solitary, but many animals in the wild the world over will only live solitary, and they prefer it.God is playing tricks on us?Could be, for although my wife likes it, my hair just doesn't grow much on my head anymore, where I want it, yet it continues to grow plenty on my face, where I don't want it, so man has to shave his face till he gets old and dies, yet many males have so little on the top of the head.Yep, God \\"is\\" playing tricks on us haha"},{"Title":"Rampage: The Social Roots Of School Shootings","review":"Rampage misses the elephant in the living room.Although the public schools account for about 85% of the student population in the United States, they represent nearly 100% of the fatal shootings. This is statistically significant and is no accident.For although the authors fail to mention it, the main reason for this discrepancy is that the public schools are basically amoral. God, prayer, and even american tradition are absent from them.The separation of church from state has not kept religion out of the public schools. Far from it. Rather amoral secular humanism has become the de facto form of worship there.Among other things, this has removed much of the inner self restraint that traditionally kept students in line which in turn has lead to school shootings."},{"Title":"Rampage: The Social Roots Of School Shootings","review":"This book, gives a new perspective on school shootings. The author creates a new theory behind the roots of these happenings. It gives the background, accounts of students, faculty, community officials, and community members perspectives to these shootings as well. Overall, it helps the reader to put school shootings into perspective."},{"Title":"Rampage: The Social Roots Of School Shootings","review":"There is much to recommend this book. It provides a well-researched explanation for the ultimate causes of rampage school shootings. The book does an excellent job of refuting the myth that these tragedies have a simplistic explanation. The authors make a very compelling case that Columbine-style school shootings happen only when a tragic combination of necessary-but-not-sufficient factors are present.Unfortunately, the book falters when it comes to providing practical strategies for the prevention of rampage school shootings. For example, the authors repeatedly acknowledge bullying and teasing as major causative factors that push some youths toward committing these tragic attacks. As the authors note, most of the shooters were bullied severely -- some almost to the point of torture.Given that, one would have expected the book to devote a good amount of space to prevention of bullying in schools. Unfortunately, the book devotes less than two pages devoted to a discussion of ways to prevent bullying and other forms of harassment in schools. Teenage bullies, of course, are not stupid -- nearly all bullying takes place out of the view of teachers and school administrators. Much research has shown that teachers and administrators tend to dramatically underestimate the size of this problem, simply because they see only a small percentage of the harassment that actually occurs. The book neglects this point almost entirely, which is very unfortunate because there are a number of strategies that have been shown to be effective and that are fairly easy for school systems to implement.Similarly, the book devotes much space to the widespread availability of guns as a factor, yet offers precious little in the way of suggestions for what to do to prevent desperately disturbed teenagers from gaining access to them.Given that, I would strongly recommend the book for understanding the causes of these tragedies. Just don't expect much in the way of practical suggestions for prevention."},{"Title":"Rampage: The Social Roots Of School Shootings","review":"I'm using this book for a college course called Criminology & Delinquency.

School shooters such as Cho Seung-Hui are not born raging to kill. They are molded through abuse. Cho is a textbook example of the type of school shooter featured in these in-depth case studies - shy, socially awkward, and tormented by high school classmates.The social climates at the high schools attended by school shooters are typically vicious and hateful, with rampant sexual harassment of girls and women and antigay harassment of less dominant boys.At Columbine High School, the most famous school shooting site studied in this book, jocks reigned supreme. The state wrestling champion, the leader of a clique of athlete bullies and the symbol of injustice for school shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, was allowed to park his $100,000 Hummer all day in a 15-minute parking space. The school indulged athletes' rampant sexual and racial bullying and physical abuse of others, including Harris and Kleboldand were given free license to abuse others. A coach did nothing when the athletes targeted a Jewish boy in gym class, singing songs about Hitler when he made a basket, pinning him to the ground and doing \\"body twisters\\" that left him bruised all over, and threatening to set him on fire.Many of the school shooters featured in this book endured antigay harassment that contributed to their rage. Barry Loukaitis, who killed a teacher and two students in Washington state, was taunted by school jocks as a \\"faggot.\\" Luke Woodham in Mississippi, who killed two students and wounded seven others, was often called \\"gay\\" by classmates. Michael Carneal, who killed three fellow students and wounded five in Kentucky, was labeled as \\"gay\\" in the school newspaper. Charles Williams in Santee, California, who shot at 15 students and adults and killed two, had been derided as \\"a skinny faggot.\\"According to an Associated Press news account (4/20/07), Cho endured similar abuse to the shooters featured in this book: \\"Classmates in Virginia, where Cho grew up, said he was teased and picked on, apparently because of shyness and his strange, mumbly way of speaking. Once, in English class at Westfield High School in Chantilly, Va., when the teacher had the students read aloud, Cho looked down when it was his turn, said Chris Davids, a Virginia Tech senior and high school classmate. After the teacher threatened him with an F for participation, Cho began reading in a strange, deep voice that sounded \\"like he had something in his mouth,\\" Davids said. \\"The whole class started laughing and pointing and saying, \`Go back to China,'\\" Davids said. [In middle school, another student is quoted as saying,]\\"There were just some people who were really mean to him and they would push him down and laugh at him. He didn't speak English really well and they would really make fun of him.\\" \\""},{"Title":"Rampage: The Social Roots Of School Shootings","review":"This is a pretty remarkable book. It is quite scholarly in nature, but gripping and accessible reading. As a teacher in a secondary school, I found it fascinating because it belies many of the popular misconceptions about schools and school shootings. It studies the students themselves, the school climates, the social pressures and situations, and the role of the family. I found myself nodding at various points and reading it aloud to whoever was in range. I have asked that it be ordered for our district's professional library. It's pertinent for any educator, but also for parents and concerned community members. It doesn't make me afraid, but it has made me reconsider some of the things I have taken for granted and it makes me more aware of student behavior and concerns. Above all it speaks to our need to better communicate within the school, and between the school and the family."},{"Title":"Rampage: The Social Roots Of School Shootings","review":"The first thing one has to do, when trying to take a serious look at the subject of school shootings, is to put things in perspective. After all, despite the shocking and graphic images seen during the media frenzies following these events, the actual statistics do not support an epidemic of violence in schools. Less than 1% of homicides and suicides among school-age children actually occur in or around school grounds. 99% of the violence that school-age children are subjected to happens outside of school grounds and outside of school hours. Kids in violent urban neighborhoods are statistically safer in the classroom during school hours than in any waking hours.That aside, I began working my way through this book, and trying to keep a disciplined perspective on things, on February 13th, a couple weeks ago, the day before the shootings at NIU. Besides the coincidence in the timing, the NIU shooting was the first of its kind where I had to worry about people very close to me being involved. Millions of kids represented statistically mean nothing compared to a single horrific story involving the real people who populate my life. It was a tragic reminder for me that no one is immune to gut reactions.There is no minimizing the importance of this topic, and not just because we want to avoid future tragedies, but also because the discussion sheds light on themes that affect multiple aspects of our shared culture and our collective quality of life.The authors here take an interesting approach. The automatic responses from most people, as far as preventative approaches, would be limited access to guns and a greater focus on screening for individuals who are likely to perpetrate these horrendous crimes. But, for a myriad of reasons, not all of which are simply political, neither of these approaches end up being straightforward. I could rant on and on about gun laws, we all have strong opinions, but that would steer me too far off course.As far as predictive strategies, focused on identifying adolescents likely to commit serious acts of mass violence, you have the same statistical problems you would have trying to screen for a very rare form of a medical illness. The more rare the event, the greater the ratio of false positives versus true positives for any measure. This is not necessarily a problem, if resources are ample, costs of screening are low, and the outcome of being falsely screened in is completely benign. But in the real world, designing an accurate screening tool that is practical and not potentially harmful is not an easy task. Believe me. There are many researchers who have dedicated their entire careers to this without producing a demonstrably valid instrument.The authors of \\"Rampage\\" draw on their extensive fieldwork in the aftermaths of two school shootings, as well as other data in the literature, and come to the conclusion that best solutions will be found in \\"the insights of sociology over psychology.\\" The authors extensively review the popular explanations that get filtered down to us: mental illness, the \\"he just snapped\\" most-proximate-cause explanations, family problems, a culture of violence, bullying, peer influences, changing communities, media violence, the copycat effect, and gun availability. Katherine Newman et al. also report insightfully on the aftermath of these tragedies in their towns. There is an important chapter, \\"Blame and Forgiveness,\\" which talks about the role faith plays in the public mediation of blame and responsibility. All explanations are explored thoughtfully, nothing is dismissed, but Newman et al. effectively argue that clinging to any one of these over-simplifications may be comforting but ultimately contribute to missing the big picture.After reviewing the details of two particular school shootings, they tell us \\"there is nothing spontaneous about a rampage school shooting.\\" School shooters, and the rest of us, inhabit complex and dynamic social and institutional worlds: \\"There are reasons why the shooters don't go out quietly when they decide to address their social dilemmas. They arrive at these tragic solutions after a period of small trials and big errors.\\" From their perspective, solutions lie not in preventative models as much as in risk management models: \\"...the best bet we have for prevention lies not in trying to identify the people whoa re going to shoot their teachers and classmates- though preventative mental health measures are good policy across the board- but rather on intercepting the flow of information when the threats fly.\\" Solutions have to do with the organization of schools and the relationships between individuals, families, and our institutions. All of this is handled with appropriate humility. The authors never pretend they have it all figured out. They acknowledge that any intervention will meet resistance and may have unpredictable negative consequences. But they certainly do a lot to advance the discussion.So, guess what. Zero-tolerance policies that preordain overreaction- such as expelling a student for giving a friend an aspirin, instituting punitive penalties for specific language with no regard to context, or gang-marshalling a kid to the psychiatric emergency room instead of allowing them a minute to take space and collect themselves- are counter-productive. It works against fostering a sense of belonging within the school, and it discourages the flow of important information from students to administrators or counselors. It works against a sense of sharing information in good faith.Improving the sense of trust and connection between kids, families, schools, and communities sounds like an over-simplistic solution. But it isn't. It's as simple or complex as you want to make it, but ultimately it will prove to be a much more effective way to decrease violence than intensifying efforts to label kids as potential sociopaths.If I had to pick a beef with the authors, I would say that it would have been nice to see more about mental health services in the schools. The authors do endorse this, but it is a brief discussion. I would have wanted it emphasized that kids with trauma histories typically present with anxiety, hypervigilance, irritability, and a tendency to misinterpret social cues. They may react to perceived bullying or intimidation from peers or staff, and the typical \\"show of force\\" response to their behaviors will typically increase oppositionality, ultimately making no one safer.In a brief summary, I can't do justice to a topic that the authors here spend nearly 400 pages discussing. So get the book and read it. I highly recommend this book for reading that is important and serious, but also written at a very accessible level. It manages to be very compelling reading, a hard book to put down, which is quite an accomplishment for such a heavy and heartrending subject."},{"Title":"Rampage: The Social Roots Of School Shootings","review":"An in-depth look at two school shooting cases, supplemented by statistics about the trends in school shootings over recent decades. Because each member of this group of sociologists writes his/her own chapter, there is some repetition of information, but the gain in reading each contribution is to understand the multiplicity of factors which coalesce in the shootings. It's not as simple as violent video games, or bullying, or family life, or youth culture, or socioeconomic status, or racism, or academic success. One key factor, among several others, is the tendency of school personnel and community members to overlook children's signs of distress and to give kids the chance to start over in a new year, neglecting to accumulate a historical record of kids' transgressions and thereby succombing to a kind of wishful thinking that kids will turn out okay in the end. So many do, but those who turn violent have escaped the radar of the adult world."},{"Title":"Rampage: The Social Roots Of School Shootings","review":"With the thwarting of yet another rampage shooting making headlines in Massachusetts, and one that allegedly involves the son of a chief of police, the relevance of Katherine Newman's study has been dramatically underlined. I read the book as the parent of teenagers and found it both chilling and informative. Chilling because it appears that the discovery of such plots is still often fortuitous. The excellent analysis of why these shootings occur gives no easy reassurance but does offer some help for us to understand and, hopefully, points to some ways in which we can help abort other shootings. \\"Rampage\\" is informative because the authors study not just what led to the news headlines but include an examination of how the communities coped in the aftermath of the tragedies.

He has always been loved and for good reason. Nevertheless, for a deeper understanding of the text and a critical examination of the features of Herodotus' style as a master storyteller, James Romm's Herodotus is a superb volume. With clarity and skill, Mr. Romm takes the reader through the Histories, always with one eye focused on the man, on Herodotus himself. This volume lives up to the foreward and the expectations set forth by Mr. Herrington, the Hermes Books foudning editor, in that foreward. The general reader will find this volume useful and enjoyable. I should not overstate, however. Romm's book does not provide what we might call a reading of Herodotus but rather it allows the reader to appreciate the Histories more by pointing out continuing themes and main features of Herodotus' storytelling. This book will be recieved well by any serious student of Herodotus, ancient history, or the classics."},{"Title":"Herodotus (Hermes Books Series)","review":"This \\"Herodotus\\" is not the work of the \\"father of history\\" but a commentary on that work. Author James Romm takes a thematic approach to his explication of \\"The Histories\\". His chapters - with titles such as \\"From Homer to Herodotus\\", \\"The Structure of the Earth\\", and \\"Persians and Greeks\\" - choose certain aspects of Herodotus' treatment and subject them to further analysis and explanation.Romm has no particular ax to grind or thesis to extol. He evidences an enthusiasm and appreciation of Herodotus without needing to take him at face value. Although there is much retracing of \\"The Histories\\" necessary to providing the right context for his discussions, Romm tries as much as possible to avoid simply retelling Herodotus.Much of what Romm accomplishes is the pulling together of threads from various parts of \\"The Histories\\" and exposing us to aspects of the work that we might not have fully grasped in a first reading. For example in a chapter titled \\"The Kingdom of Culture\\", Romm treats the frequently evenhanded way in which Herodotus deals with other cultures. Along the way, Romm reminds us that it was only in Herodotus' day that the Greeks had begun to think of themselves as possessing a common cultural identity of their own. In Romm's reading, it was in fact the Persian invasions of Greece that both accelerated the Greek development of self-identity and their recognition of cultural variability within the \\"non-Greek-speaking\\" world, a variability which Herodotus exalts in discovering and presenting.Romm further illuminates this cluster of ideas through his apparently deep knowledge of the history of the Greek language. In Homer, he tells us, the collective words \\"Hellenes\\" and \\"barboroi\\" do not appear. When we translate Herodotus' use of \\"barboroi\\" as \\"barbarians\\", we are perhaps giving it a modern interpretation that Herodotus did not usually intend. For him, it seldom carries a value judgment, instead simply marking the subjects as not of the Greek-speaking world. There are many such helpful linguistic insights in Romm's chapters.Part of a series on ancient writers, this is a relatively short book, but manages to absorbingly treat many different themes. It concludes with a \\"Bibliographical Note\\" that gives useful perspectives on both alternative translations of \\"The Histories\\" and longer general studies of Herodotus.Romm will best be read with an existing knowledge of Herodotus and his work. But it will certainly make a subsequent reading of \\"The Histories\\" yield up more of its nuances, presumptions, and purposes."},{"Title":"Herodotus (Hermes Books Series)","review":"Always loved the old historical stories. Great book, great price, with fast ship. Thanks for the old world charm & grace."},{"Title":"Herodotus (Hermes Books Series)","review":"The first two reviews are excellent and cover the book well. I have just one bone to pick with Romm: on p. 12f he says, \\"...Milton, author of the last long epic that is still widely read (even if mainly by college students)....\\" I wonder why he does not mention Nikos Kazantzakis' The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel - 333,333 lines - perhaps it is the author's impression that it is \\"not widely read\\". I've read it and found it to be very powerful and inspired me to read Homer, Virgil and Joyce - no small accomplishment.As a newcomer to the classics I found Romm very helpful in preparing me to read the Histories."},{"Title":"MenArtWar","review":"Men-Art-War by Mikulas Kolya is a book of philosophical short stories about topics pertaining to modern civilization. In his book, Kolya makes an attempt to open the reader's mind to the hypocrisy inherent in our society. The book is short (a little over 150 pages) with ten short stories that fly by quickly. It is ideal for the short attention span--ironically the same trait that Kolya mocks in his stories about art. Men-Art-War is a quick and interesting read, with no signs of tolerance for the nonsense that permeates our society.This book was published by iUniverse, which is a small self-publishing company. Wordiness, awkward sentences and mechanical errors can be found without difficulty. Also, readers will find a lack of connection with the characters in the book, as the author neglects character development. Instead, the author focuses primarily on the philosophy of book, and yet luckily for him, the ideas are interesting enough to raise some eyebrows. The characters are used as two-dimensional tools to help facilitate communication with the reader. For instance, in the story \\"The Movie Star\\", the main character is a famous actor from Hollywood (he's a vegan, a coke addict and very promiscuous) who finds himself lost in a backwoods town after speeding and crashing his Ferrari. He walks into an old tavern looking for help and encounters three working-class men who hate the word \\"red-neck\\". As the scenario would suggest, awkwardness rises, they begin drinking and stupid things are said. Eventually the awkwardness turns into aggression. The story is black and white, but serves as a good example of how Kolya uses scenarios to depict his philosophies.The book covers grounds that could deem it highly controversial; possibly a reason no mainstream publisher has accepted it. Kolya stops at nothing to expose what he believes are wrong with contemporary generations. Religion, art, and even the leaders of our country fall victim to his indignation. In \\"The Confession\\", Kolya bashes Christianity via a priest who believes that celibacy is leading our society to ruins. The belief is that bloodlines are important to leadership, intelligence and morals; and yet the people who should be reproducing are single and working to improve themselves, while the people having all the children are the people too stupid to control it.The most important aspect of the book is its portrayal of the masses. Ignorance, weakness and subservience are all characteristics of the average person these days. In \\"The Historian\\", an old man writes a letter before his execution to his grandson confessing that he had changed historical accounts of Genghis Khan. In the letter, he warns the boy of powerful people when he writes that it is \\"violence--only ever violence--that lies behind the success of mighty men.\\" The leaders of countries tell of their allegiance to God and their opposition to violence, and yet simultaneously use force to keep the masses in line; they use war for their own interests.The book is very inspiring and is likely to make you feel uncomfortable at times. It challenges convention and therefore is likely to anger many readers. But the ideas are unique because they will ring in your mind long after you finish reading. The entire book suggests we as a civilization are failing more and more each day to meet the expectations and dreams of the past. Instead, standards are lowering rapidly as ignorance becomes ramped."},{"Title":"MenArtWar","review":"On Earth, the competition of life is never ending. Individuals by themselves are vulnerable; thus nature shapes life, and from this force groups necessarily emerge. Each group develops distinct ways of survival which are constantly tested, growing stronger with endurance or weakening with decay and eventually going extinct. Among the hominids, the Cro-Magnon man has developed many traits for survival but the quintessential ability--the distinctly unique limb of their survival--is imagination, which, when structuralized with symbolism and enacted through idealism, is responsible for the whole of human domination and supremacy.In Men-Art-War, Kolya, with ten succinct and easily digestible short stores, deals with the faculty of imagination extensively, demonstrating its expression throughout history as well as its corruption in the modern West. We are shown how the acceptance of force--the striving for the feeling of power--as an extension of our inherent nature leads to a more fulfilling, meaningful life not just in a socio-historical sense but to the individual psychology as well; and how the cogs of modernity strive to conquer, subvert and burry this impulse.Contextually, the themes of this book present modernity, with its assurance of progress through technology, reverence for the illusion of safety and passivity and pity as the impetus of moral action, as a direct affront to the very nature of mankind, instead positing that life should be about transcending difficulties and overcoming adversities, no matter how daunting the task or how easy the alternative, through glorious art and glorious war: \\"Facilis descensus Averni.\\" Nietzsche's Will to Power and Kaczynski's Power Process are strongly implicated.Rarely dose a work of contemporary fiction conflate with my personal beliefs as Men-Art-War has, which made reading it a rich, refreshing and fulfilling experience. For those of a dissimilar weltanschauung, much of this book might be difficult, challenging or even offensive, but such reactions to a different point of view are the impetus of intellectual growth and should be sought out rather than avoided if one is honest about such a pursuit. Kolya's characters also provide many artistic, literary and historical references for one to explore if the wish.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"MenArtWar","review":"Alternate Title: Of Lastmen, Farce, and Boors [A personal exegesis by MK]Kitschean postmodern vomit. Reading a few excerpts was enough to engender immediate disgust with the book. Kolya, which must be a pseudonym, is at best a 3rd rate paraphrast and a full blown philosophaster from Los Angeles. Quoted in brief for your displeasure:\\"Alfred was deep in thought, staring at the table, staring past it, through it somehow. His mind was elsewhere, he waved his hand and absently mumbled, \\"Nietzsche wasn't a philosopher, he was a prophet,\\" before returning to silence. Brian realized, somewhat regretfully, that he should have given the man time to formulate a response to his questions and not immediately heap new ones on top. He excused himself and went to the bathroom.\\" pg. 76\\"The Random\\" is a kitschy set of pastisches centered on the refrain \\"-You know me\\" [the damning narrator/conscience of the observed] which follows after every banal description of every day events in various people.\\"The Atelier\\" is a dialogue between the author and \\"Grandfather\\" Friedrich [Nietzsche]. In the latter's sense of the word, the author is \\"German\\" par excellence. Books like these were anticipated by N. and are the reasons for which he wrote Ecce Homo. Richard Wagner would be made ticklish by this text, the aforementioned philosopher, humorously enraged.Do-Not-Buy or Read-This-Sad Farce of a BookIf you can prevent someone from reading this pseudo-philosophical jabberwocky trash then do it. I am personally setting fire to my copy in the near future, just after I write a dedication to Al Gore (e.g. MANBEARPIG) in it."},{"Title":"The Industrial Revolution In World History: Second Edition (Essays in World History)","review":"Stearns has written here a very broad description of how the industrial revolution evolved, or failed to evolve, in many countries over the last two centuries. This is a very big task, and has no well defined beginning or end, nor even very many milestones. Moreover, there are, according to Stearns, nearly as many paths to development as there are countries that develop. No tipping points, no critical inventions and no heroic personalities either. While I suppose there is a certain truth to this point of view, and may even be historically accurate, it makes for a somewhat dull read. I prefer to have my history laced with a few gee-whizes accomplished by some impossibly heroic figures. But that's just me.His recitation of the changes that took place is almost formless, without generalities, or even much definition. While it was certainly humbling to contemplate the breadth of his scholarship, I didn't get what I was looking for out of this work--some hypotheses or possible explanations for what happened. I appreciate the difficulty of the problem and the mystery of ultimate historical causation, but the author would have been better off, I think, if he had taken a little stab at it, at least.The book has four maps and a dozen or so illustrations, but only five graphs--and most of those are ridiculously parsimonious in the amount of data shown. Surely in a subject of this scope, tables and better graphs would have helped to organize it.Despite these shortcomings, I think the book is a worthwhile contribution to the history of a very important part of the human story, and I'm glad to have read it."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"This is one of my top-ten all time favorites! It's a funny, insightful and totally absorbing little mystery set in the early 20th century. (The electricity is shut off at midnight because the power station employees go home.)A maiden aunt and her 20-something niece and nephew rent a farm in upstate New York for one summer. The house is rumored to be haunted and there are plenty of strange goings-on at the place. When a visitor is shot late one night alone in the billiard room, the mystery only deepens.I really enjoyed this and have highly recommended it to everyone. The plot is simple and there aren't a lot of distracting sub-plots or over-agonizing of the characters. It's very charming and enjoyable. Some people may find it simplistic and not nearly over-dramatic enough (it was written in the early 1900's) but it was fun and intriguing.One word of warning, however, the book is VERY dated as far as ethnic sensibilities are concerned. It may be offensive to some and downright weird to others."},{"Title":"An introduction to the history of western Europe","review":"This is a very good \\"introduction\\" to the history of Europe. It covers most of the important events in the history of Europe, and very masterfully succeeds in keeping a thread among them. It starts from Roman downfall at around 500 AD and finishes with year 1900. It is pretty amazing that the author anticipates further clashes in Europe which happened in few years time (world war I). It not only covers the historical events and wars, but also gives a good insight into the cultural and social aspects of the time. For example, it digs into the reasons of Roman downfall, renaissance, and the feudal system. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"An introduction to the history of western Europe","review":"I quote from the first chapter:\\" We must learn, above all, to study sympathetically institutions and beliefs that we are tempted at first to declare absurd and unreasonable.

Instead, however, of merely condemning the practice, we must, as historical students, endeavor to see why practically everyone in the thirteenth century, even the wisest and most tender-hearted, agree that such a fearful punishment was the appropriate one for a heretic.\\"This is book about the political and cultural history of western Europe, published in 1902, well before the world wars or any of the other sweeping historical changes to Europe in the 20th century. It's a book that opines on the nature of political franchise, war, and militarism, written scant years after the American civil war by a professor at Colombia before America had a major military role in the affairs of the world. A history of Europe written when Germany was still a loose confederation of states guided by Bismarck, Russia was ruled by a Tsar, and the country of my birth was but a single jewel in a vast colonial empire. Words cannot express how fascinating this unique historical perspective on history turned out to be.A quick word of warning- this is a book intimately involved with fluctuating political boundaries, maps and empires. The kindle edition includes none of the images and maps of the physical book. Without reference to maps, some of the descriptions of the book can be a bit confusing.

And I admit - it is well written, comprehensive and told me a lot about the last 1,000 years of Europe.However, its obvious disadvantage is that it was written over 110 years ago - omitting all historical facts discovered since.But the main problem - and it's a very basic and important one - is the total absence of dozens or more maps - it is difficult to visualize Austria ruling The Netherlands without a visual image.The best part about it is the price - $0.00 - thus making it well worth reading with all the caveats I've said above"},{"Title":"An introduction to the history of western Europe","review":"I \\"purchased\\" this item at Kindle Store for free.It is a well written concise and short introduction to History of Western Europe.

Nevertheless, as a non-historian I found the book really interesting. After the end of each chapter, the author presents a couple of references for those interested in reading more about a giving topic.I am not giving 5 starts, because in my opinion some maps could facilitate comprehension and were not included. Instead the author simply mentions: regions, rivers, cities, etc. I am not sure how good was the editorial process in 1902, probably not good enough to include so many illustrations in a book like this one.

Until the point when you realize the mother, Claire Fontaine, had simply refused to recognize, deal with, or otherwise acknowledge that her daughter Mia had issues, for over a decade. She'll have you believe the girl just woke up one day and started wearing black and using heroin. It is apparent Claire was so self-centered, self-absorbed or had her head in the sand as a parent for so long, one is not surprised her daughter went to such lengths to get her attention.The 'school' Mia was sent to sounded like a place where they brainwash you how to talk constantly about how you feel, every waking second of the day, as if you are the only person on the planet. Kind of like a place to learn to be just as self-centered and self-absorbed as your Mother.I hate to stereotype, but the book is such the quintessential \\"LA screenwriter\\" therapy-speak spew it is painful to read.I did finish it, as I felt I should in order to write a fair review.

(They make a list of books to send with your child when you ship them off to whichever WWASP program hasn't been shut down yet. This book was listed, along with a Laura Schlessinger book, 7 Habits books, and Chicken Soup for the Soul books. Make whatever judgements you want.) And yet, I was surprised by how nauseating this mother/daughter pair were able to make this book.It's not well-written, which is fine, because most memoirs aren't and that's not why I read them. The story is tragic enough, what brought the family to this precipice. Judgements really don't need to me made (I did question how the child lived a secret life for a year at age 14/15, but addiction is insidious) about how families deal with addictions this severe, that cause a child (or, hell, anyone) to choose a life like the one the daughter was choosing.What got troubling was the absolute party-line that the mother took and the daughter learned to take. Claire's personification of the kids at Morava was disgusting in its simplicity. We get it, Morava = good for kids that are lost. (Boys rapping, girls dancing, swinging their ponytails. I vomited in my mouth at the oversimplification.) The mother and other parents were latched onto Morava as if it was truly a magical place and not just a series of structures that were in place to contain and manage. Everything is black and white to this woman, and eventually, this pair.By the end, as this pair spouts the party line, it's sickening to read. There is much evidence that as humans, we need to find worth where we have invested much money. I think it was Claire who said that other people will watch them communicating and remark that they are quite remarkable in their ability to give and receive feedback. Umm, they are probably laughing at you. Because you sound like overly self-involved jerks who don't know how to talk to each other. And they don't. The end is \\"program speak\\" in all of the most nauseating ways.If you want WWASP propaganda, pick this up. If you want anything accurate, anything with some distance, anyone who hasn't thoroughly downed the Kool-Aid, look elsewhere. And do look online at some of the real happenings at WWASP and why they can't keep facilities open. Why so many of these teen escort companies share leaders or backers with WWASP, with Teen Help, with the facilities that re-open in closed WWASP facilities when they are shut down for abuses. And, if you are so inclined, look at the history of ToughLove, of Synanon, of Straight, how all of this has filtered down and how none of it has been found to be \\"best practices\\"/evidence-based practice for youth."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"Claire and Mia Fontaine, with brutal honesty, draw readers into their cyclical journey of love, fear, betrayal, and hope.

The type of \\"therapy\\" daughter Mia is subjected to -kidnapped by paid \\"escorts\\", involuntarily locked up in a Czech facility, then transferred to a facility in the US that unashamedly has a seclusion area call The Hobbit, a tiny, windowless, toiletless lockup--is as primitive and unsubstantiated as drilling a hole in the skull of a person suffering mental illness. Just because it seems to have helped Mia doesn't make coerced, locked down, behavior modification \\"treatment\\" any more humane or effective than a chisel to the head--it's just more subtle, lengthy and expensive.Read \\"Help at Any Cost\\" by Maia Szalavitz if you have any interest in this area.

I had no idea there were rehabilitation centers like the places in this book. These facilities blew me away, especially the teachers, counselors, psychologists, and social workers. Fantastic. Absolutely brilliant.This is a story about a mother-daughter relationship, disgusting fathers who sexually abuse their daughters, daughters who become drug addicts, mothers who think they can make it all better, and in the end, realizing the only way out is to simply let go...allowing the victim to choose to heal themselves, survive themselves, transform themselves.... and live.But letting go is like falling off a cliff or jumping off a ledge...the unknown can be unbearable. But the reader will realize, this is exactly what this mother must do to save her daughter. Sometimes letting go--- is the only way one can finally live. But what one never lets go of is LOVE."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book much more than I expected. I looked forward to escaping into their world and found a great deal of information about recovery and self realization. The mom daughter relationship is complicated, codependent and fragile. It reminds me of my relationship w/ my mom. The substance and sexual abuse is boldly and honestly described. I was pulling for both Mia and her mom by the end of the book. I thank them for sharing their story"},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"As the mother of an addicted daughter, every word spoken, every thought and action in the book has pretty much happened at my home.

It was extremely realistic, take it from one who is living it."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"...but an amazing memoir none the less. I saw so many aspects of mine and my mother's relationship in this book it made me want to go back 23 years and start over. A great read-I was unable to put it down-a MUST for any mother having problems with their children. A great read for anyone else with an open mind. It's not all fluff and feathers and pretty happy mother daughter relationships...for (#@ sake, people, read the book flap. It's an intensely honest, poignant, and captivating account of all of the emotions that follow incest and abuse..and the healing that follows."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"My wife and I had friends of many years. They had a daughter and we watched her grow up. Bright, outgoing, happy. Then all at once, it seemed like overnight, the child was no longer bright, outgoing and happy. She was troubled - deeply troubled. It was more than drugs - worse than drugs. They tried eveything, nothing worked. Then they found a program, call it tough love or psychobabble, call it what you will. The program was Morava and it was in the Czech Republic...the Czech Republic, for God sake! We were skeptical but we kept our mouths shut and waited for what we thought would be an unfortunate conclusion. It never came to that. When the girl came home, a year - more than a year - later, she was her old self, cured, transformed, everything her parents had hoped for. She finished her education, graduated from a prestigious university and today holds an enviable position with a respected business organization.Then we saw an interview on television with a woman and her daughter who had gone through the same thing and found Morava to be the answer to their prayers. Together they had written a book about the whole experience. The book was titled \\"Come Back.\\" We got a copy, read it and loaned it to our friends. \\"Yes,\\" they said. \\"That's how it was. It saved our daughter's life, saved our lives.\\" We were no longer skeptical. Anyone with the misfortune to find themselves in such a situation should read this book. Before you do anything else, before you give up, read \\"Come Back.\\" Beyond being a remarkable testament, it's a wonderful read, beautifully written and imaginatively structured, going as it does from the mother's voice to the daughter's. Claire Fontaine and her daughter Mia have written a book everyone will find intriguing even if they're lucky enough to have well adjusted children. I'm glad we found \\"Come Back\\" and we wish Claire and Mia the best of luck with it.

There were a few \\"boring\\" parts, but all together I would highly reccomend this book!"},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This book was a walking advertisment for human rights abuse.There have been many credible allegations of brainwashing, physical abuse and denial of a proper education from children who attended programmes run by WWASPS, the organisation which ran Morava academy and Spring Creek lodge. The therapudic methods described in this book have been discredited by mainstream psychiatry. Abuse is why Morava was \\"oddly closed down\\". Other WWASP schools to \\"oddly close down\\" in other countries have included Dundee ranch, High impact and Casa by the Sea. There are readily available photographs of children being kept in dog cages at one of these offshore schools. Could this be what prompted authorities to step in? who knows?it is wonderful to see that Mia went on to be a college graduate and a published writer. Many of her peers have not been so lucky. This is because their \\"progressive\\" education did not involve being taught anything. Students have been just given books & then asked to answer multiple choice questions.Parents who sent their kids to WWASPS Ivy ridge, for example had to get refunded a portion of the fees as their kids diplomas were useless. Read this book with a critical eye. Mia was lucky to come out alive."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This is a strange memoir written by Claire and Mia Fontaine (not their real names) about bizarre WWASP schools (prison-like residential teen boot camps) and how they helped Mia conquer drug addiction. However, this book almost seems like a pro-WWASP book to counter all the negative press WWASP schools receive. A lot of this book was unbelievable, too. Weak writing. I'm not sure I believe that Clair Fontaine actually is a screenwriter, either. Could be the next literary hoax....."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I found the book to be a very good read. A young troubled girl who runs away and does drugs in order to escape the memories and nightmares of abuses from a father's hands. A mother who will stop at nothing to help her daughter return to her as the loving child she wants so hard to remember. The catch is, you never really like or understand the mother's point of view.She \\"forgets\\" that a therapist tells her that when the daughter becomes a teenager, the memories and emotions will begin to have an effect on the daughter again? How does a mother \\"forget\\" this kind of statement. Then she send her daughter to a school in a foreign country that will not give her any indication of how their system works other than \\"we use points and levels.\\" The school tells her to EXPECT letters saying there is abuse and torture and not only not question those claims, but ignore them all together. The mother blindly believes the school and waits for them to correct her child with no parent/child counseling.Let's not forget the seminars for the parents. The participants must be seated after the music is turned off (much like a game for elementary age children). They must never question the leader (much like what we expect from elementary age children)- or they can but get some circular reason why the leader is correct. They must \\"stare\\" at other participants without looking away, cannot takes notes, and must share intimate secrets with other participants (that they have known for less than a few hours). Then they are sent home too exhausted to think about the day and come back for the next day and the next day of more insanity.Identical seminars on done with the children. Who are too young to even question the \\"theraputic\\" qualities of the sessions. I do, however, find the daughter to be very likable and can see how she could view the schools as symbolic parents (as they actually spend time with the child and show some sort of discipline). Although, I do wonder about the child near the end that leave in \\"The Hobbit\\". (A small prison-like room that reminds me of Cool Hand Luke. I suppose the girl in-prisoned had a \\"failure to communicate\\" with the staff.)The book was more believable as a fiction (and quite a good read when viewed that way.) But the thing I most got out of the book, is the hours spent on the internet looking up Morova, Spring Creek and their sister schools. (I viewed a very interesting documentary by the Montana PBS station - Who's Watching the Kids.) Although you can't believe everything you read on the anti-wilderness school sites, I'm not sure you can believe everything you read in this book, either."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This book is an absolute must read for anyone with an interest or understanding of how insidious and destructive the tough love industry is.

Living in California and raising teens here it makes me ashamed to live in such a liberal state, where parents really have No Rights. For that and some of the things about the drug world I really got an education. The book went downhill for me when Mia went into treatment for years it seemed. The book really seemed to drag on and on with Mother and daughter analyzing every detail of their lives. I felt more compassion for Claire's Mother, than I did for Clair. I tended to skip a lot toward the end of the story. It is an o.k. read just not riveting"},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"My book took twice as long to arrive as stated and when it did it was a very old publishing completely dog-eared and the edges look warped like someone had pre-read poolside and splashed water on it. Not Pleased."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"Claire Fontaine is a very clever writer, and I could not put the book down until about after half-way. Then I had difficulty wading through Mia Fontaine's contributions. It completely changed the bookreading experience for me. I'm sure this book is much more meaningful to those who have had those specific experiences with their children....I had many of them with my daughter, so it's not like I couldn't relate. I feel the daughter's contribution was overemphasized, and did not match the qualitative experience of the first part of the book. No teenager's diary is ever interesting from my point of view. Anne Frank is the exception. Revealing, yes. Worthwhile reading, no, unless it's your teenager. I just couldn't finish the book after 3/4 of the way through. Too much detail from the daughter that didn't really matter from my perspective. Excerpts (small) of the daughter's contribution would have been sufficient. And since I read the back cover, I knew the outcome. No need to bother with the trifling stuff - which includes the mother's screenplay excerpts. The story took on the flavor of two women who don't understand that the trivia they shared did nothing for the overall story, only got in the way, and... are they perhaps too self-absorbed, I began to wonder."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"It was OK.

I enjoyed reading this memoir as much as any I've read.

However, all will leave with a better understanding of what can be accomplished with unrelenting love and determination."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"It's about time someone who was actually IN a behavior mod school wrote something postitive about them! I was in Spring Creek with Mia and while it wasn't a perfect system (no school is)they're NOT abusive, they DON'T brainwash you and it really helped me out. I really recommend this book to anyone wants an HONEST account of these school, not a biased and sensationalizing one.Aside from the schools, it's also just a really good read for anyone dealing (or who knows someone dealing with) with addiction or abuse. The lessons Mia and Claire learn along their journey to recovery gave me a broader understanding of myself and can benefit ANYONE wanting to improve themselves and their relationships, particularly that with their mother."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"To the negative reviewers, if you HAVE lived through this situation, and encountered problems, then I understand your grief.If you have not, and are just taking third party comments as gospel, then you need to take a step back.This story should be read by every parent of every teenager in America. Even if your children go through life without any problems you probably know someone who could learn from these folks experiences. At least, it could help you to understand what others may be going through.I know many Graduates of Casa By the Sea, and several other WWASP schools, They TOTALLY refute the claims in the Lawsuits.These processes DO work, the Schools are completely OPEN to examination and the students currently in the program ARE being helped.In conversations with hundreds of parents with kid's in these schools, I have found that they tried everything else to try to heal their children and found that the kids were able to \\"fool\\" every other method, especially the weekly Psychiatrist visits.I have close personal friends with kid's in programs, both WWASP and others that are very similar, that had spent Thousands of dollars on every other type of therapy with NOTHING to show for it, except a more worldly juvenile delinquent.This VERY DIRECT and enlightening book does not PROMOTE the schools, in fact it shows them, WART's and all. Please, before rattling off another bad review, READ THE BOOK.This is a VERY personal story that deserves to be read before commenting.Do these schools have problems, Yes, Their clientel are generally on their Last Chance. By the time their parents have given up on every other method, these kids have become tough as nails and have learned that they do not have to do what anyone says.There are going to be problems. The People running the schools are human.Go to a ANY public school ANY day of the week, you will see the kid's that need these programs. Just try to control them, after you pick your teeth up, then write your politically correct opinions.This is a wonderful book and the Author's deserve better than what these negative reviewers have given."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I couldn't put this book down. I appreciated the authors honesty and willingness to share such a horrible time in their life and I was so happy to see that there are parents out there who make every sacrifice to save their child. There is explicit language from the teens point of view but it was really where she was at in her life so it was real."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I'll say first off that I understand this book has caused some controversy regarding its authenticity and the extreme schools that are featured within it. I don't know enough about the school system to really comment on that, so I won't try. As for whether it's a true story or not - all I can say if it's a fake of some kind it's a masterful one. Although my outward behaviour was very different (I never did drugs, for starters!), the depiction of a child coping with abuse and the long term trauma it inflicts on everyone involved is absolutely spot on.OK, disclaimer over: Overall, this is not an easy book - fortunately, at no time do the authors describe in graphic detail what happened to Mia, but the situation and the affects of the abuse are dealt with honestly and viscerally. There were many times when I found myself in tears.Mia is an accomplished writer - her sections are honest, sometimes brutal. Claire's sections were, for me, less visceral (probably at least partly because I have no experience of being a mother), but she is a wonderful writer. Mia is no slouch when it comes to writing good prose, but her mum is very talented.Having said it's not an easy book, I would add that that is only the subject matter. I got through the book fairly fast given that it's a reasonably long book and obviously given the subject matter.Probably the strongest element, for me, is the very real, very honest, and in my experience absolutely spot on portrayal of the way abuse affects a child's thoughts and feelings, self esteem and self image, and the way double lives and differing behaviours, compartmentalising of knowledge, lack of trust etc manifest.This is not an easy or pleasant read, and the measures to which Mia's parents go to try and curb her increasingly extreme and self-destructive behaviours are not pink and fluffy bedtime reading. Don't go to this for enjoyment!That said, I think it is a valuable book, one that may open some readers' eyes to the prevalence and the effects of abuse, and make them think twice about the assumptions they make regarding substance abusers and the homeless. For that reason alone, I think this is a book that should be widely read."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"very impressed i first had it sent to a p.o box but it wouldnt be accepted there, so they emailed me back to see if i had another address they could send it to. and they did right away."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"Both mother and daughter are excellent writers.

I was given hope at a time when I had very little. I have since read this book several times. It inspired me to go on. It gave me hope that I could also one day have my daughter come back to me and she has. At times this book had such rawness and pain it was difficult to read. Both daughter and mother describe in such detail, events as they unfolded. The pain is very real. I was inspired because through another's story I found what I knew all along: Your loved one is still in there and they want to be found and made whole again. This Mother had the courage to never give up on her daughter, no matter how hard the battle."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I just got done reading this book and it was very helpful for me as I have a daughter in a drug rehab center for over 4 months now. It has given me insight as to how drug rehabs and systems will work if they are done right and if the patient works with the program. I truely agree with the toughness of the centers she had to go to. That is the only way to make these young kids recover. So many therapist and centers are to easy on these young adults. I found that books like this really help this process better than reading all those self help books. It hits true to many things. It is very well written. I just love how their journey which was a long hard road worked out for them. It is a book that can help many mothers as well as fathers and loved ones to make sense and learn of their addicted loved one in their life. It gives you hope. This book is a must for families in need."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This is absolutely the best book I have ever read on addiction, love, relationships. Although \\"comeback\\" is about the journey between a mother and daughter, anyone can relate to the substance, Father, son, husband, wife, friends. I bought two books and plan to buy more to give to friends. Ironically, it was recommended to me by my 18 year old grandson."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"The cover shows a little girl, aloft. Her mother's open hands are at the bottom of the photograph. It's a lovely, joyous picture. And one that every parent can relate to. Because the picture is a complete metaphor for our idealized relationship with our kids --- we launch our children heavenward, and revel in what we see: beautiful purity backed by a pure blue sky. What comes next is certain --- we'll catch them. Without fail. Because that's our first, our most important mission in life: to serve our children and protect them until they're able to take flight on their own.But in Chicago, in the early '80s, Claire Fontaine --- for legal reasons, a pseudonym --- makes a seemingly innocent mistake, the kind made by any number of young women in love: She marries the wrong guy. Nick is a Golden Child of Mayflower stock. Well, not so golden. He smokes as much dope as he grows. And his family has views about sex that are --- well, \\"progressive\\" might not be the right word for it. \\"Sick\\" and \\"incestuous\\" come closer.Claire and Nick have a daughter, Mia. Nick, who has long enjoyed nude gardening, now likes to wander about the house in the buff, pressing his two-year-old daughter against him. Clair objects. Nick has a stunning comeback: \\"Sex isn't something children should be protected from, Claire. It's like protecting them from good food or music.\\" And, soon, he moves on to abuse his child. And, of course, to beat his wife and wreck their home.Claire is confused, numb, slow to bolt. Taking Mia to the doctor is a defeat --- the pediatrician, impressed by Nick's name, defends him. Judges prefer more tests to making definitive rulings. No professional cares to hear from Mia, who remembers everything and is now terrified of her father. Finally --- at great length --- Nick is ordered to undergo therapy as a condition of seeing his child. He declines.When Mia is five, Claire meets Paul. He is handsome and decent, and he loves Mia the way a father should. Off they go to Los Angeles, where Mia becomes a top student at a prestigious private school and Claire establishes herself as a screenwriter. The past? Buried.But life turns out to be like a horror movie; when you least expect it, the monster returns. When Mia is 15, she runs away. Her true friends and her real life, she says in the note she leaves behind, are on the streets. Oh, dear parents, don't worry: \\"I have a Swiss army knife and mace.\\"Right. A double life. Claire and Paul have missed it. The weight loss, the red faces, the pictures of dead punk heroes and books about street kids --- hey, she kept her grades up. And now Mia's off in the rain, probably to Venice Beach, where castaways find free drugs in exchange for free sex.It gets crazy from here. How low can a girl fall? To a van. To skinheads. To heroin. And the thing about the bottom...well, as Emmylou Harris sings, \\"One thing they don't tell you about the blues/When you got em/You keep on falling cause there ain't no bottom/There ain't no end.\\" There's always worse, always greater degradation.It hurt me --- I mean: physically --- to read this stuff. I wanted to kill Nick. To shake Mia. Claire? I don't know. I'm a parent. Of a daughter. Mostly, I kept muttering, \\"Please, God, not me....\\"But then there's sunlight: a tough love school run by Americans in the Czech Republic. It's like a jail. You don't talk without permission. You earn tiny privileges by observing the rules to the letter, go back to square one if you screw up. And the administrators are in your face 24/7.But do not think for one second that this is a story about the reclamation of screwed-up teens. This is a book about families, and the parents are on the hook too. Indeed, they're on a much bigger hook. For not only must they learn how to adjust whatever behavior that contributed to their kids' spectacular delinquency, they must learn to relate to the very different child who will be coming home. In short, they must undergo a mirror of the therapy their kids are getting.I don't think I'm the only reader who --- at midpoint in this book, when the therapy kicks in --- stops reading a book about Mia and Claire and starts reading one that's much more personal. There are no spectators here. Some of the failings you're reading about --- if you're like me, they're yours too. And so the book morphs into a harsh, raw and yet altogether loving confrontation. A wake-up call. With a message that comes down to this: Look at what's there. Look how you deal with it. Look how it affects others. And, hardest of all, look what you get out of it.To say there's a happy ending of this joint memoir is wrong. There's a happy beginning. When you get to the end, you'll want to cheer.You don't have to be a parent with a death-bent kid to need this book --- just a parent who knows it's possible to communicate better with your child, but doesn't know quite how. Which is pretty much all of us."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This memoir was one of the hardest books i have ever had to read and I am a big reader of this genre.The story of a mother who does not seem her 15 year old self desctruct in front of her own eyes. Is nothing short of brilliant.What I liked most was the raw honesty in this book. From the compelling beginning where the parents admit they \\"never had a clue\\" (scary) to the denial that anything was really bad to admitting that life was never going to be the same again.A wonderful read."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"Come Back is a great read! The story is gripping, and filled with rich moments--I laughed and cried. But the power of the story goes much deeper than that. As a teacher, I work with troubled teens, and have seen their parents go through hell the way Claire Fontaine did. This is an important book, because the events leading to drug-addicted Mia's capture and her ultimate healing are true, and they offer fresh insight into what it takes to help this generation. The \\"cowboy therapist\\" who held a mirror to Mia while she was in the tough love program showed me the balance of limit-setting and authentic caring that is effective in helping kids like Mia. I loved that we hear both voices-- mother and daughter. Each is an exceptional writer--I was amazed. Sometimes their perspectives are in sharp discord. But as the story unfolds, and Mia begins to reclaim her innocence and her joy, they find a genuine harmony."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"Every once in a while, I read a book so moving, that I find myself in awe. For me, this was one of those books. Five years ago, I graduated from Spring Creek Lodge after spending nearly two years in the program. To this day, memories of my experience play a huge role in my life. The sad thing is that no one ever talks about it. And even of those who are willing, only the people who have experienced it can truly understand. To read something that is so straightforward and honest... something that truly captures the essence of the experience was truly refreshing. So many people have so many negative things to say about their experience (understandably), but so few people are willing to listen to the stories of the people who the program helped. I, for one, am thankful for this book. Almost everyday in my life people ask me about my experience in the program, but I find myself hard pressed to come up with an adequate description. I have always joked that it would take a book for someone to truly get a glimpse of my experience, but I never thought that book would exist. Well... here it is. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I believe the main purpose of this book is to show an example of how one's parent(s) must go to every extreme to save their child from drugs; even if that includes taking them against their will.The program that she belonged to didn't seem too harsh at all. What some people forget to realize is they are dealing with DRUG ADDICTS. Besides using, we've perfected the art of manipulation when it comes to getting what we want & bending any rule to get it.The bittersweet part of this book is that unfortunately, only the affluent can afford this type of program. This leaves most middle and all low income out in the dust. So, while it is a beautiful story about the bond between a mom & her daughter, it cannot be ignored that this type of care is not available to all. That is a shame as every life holds the same value.I do highly recommend this book. It's easy reading & goes into the thoughts of Mia Fontaine and her mom, Claire. Both are going thru emotional rollercoasters. This book is also suitable for adolescents."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"We purchased this book based on recommendations from a parent forum associated with residential schools. Our daughter is currently in one of these schools so we read it with intense focus. Not only did this book give us a perspective that was interesting and informative to us, it is also very well written. I picked it up on Friday morning and finished it on Saturday evening using every waking minute that I was not busy with work or chores.This book depicts the school environment quite accurately.

This breath-taking memoir, written alternately throughout from both the mother's and the daughter's experience, tells of their gut wrenching journey through hell and back, when the 15 year old sinks into a world of drug abuse and all the manipulative behavior, hostility, lies, family sickness, and frustration working with the system that comes with it. It is extremely well written, open and honest, mercifully bringing a generous amount of humor into the mix. Every parent and child is going to find something to relate to here on some level. The story is about a seemingly well adjusted happy couple with an A-student child that slowly disintegrates into a nightmare one can only hope never touches one's life...but often does. It is presented in a way that is insightful, instructive, painful and redeeming, ugly and beautiful, funny and brutal, and always entertaining. Reading \\"Come Back\\" was a powerful experience for me; it made me eager to work toward becoming a better person, not an easy task for any book. My thanks to the authors Claire and Mia Fontaine for presenting their story so very well."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I hate using superlatives, but this book blew me away. I picked it up because I liked the cover and didn't leave my friend's apartment for another four hours. Besides being an incredible story, the writing was beautiful and the message profound. I'm a professional now and though I wasn't quite as rebellious as a teen, I was no angel. I liked that it's a joint memoir because while Mia's voice was the one I could relate to, what Claire wrote gave me an idea of what my mother went through - a bit of a wake-up call for me. Not many books stay with me after i'm done - this one did."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"No doubt. This is the most insightful parenting resource on the market. I have two daughters, so I could relate to some of the relationship issues that mothers and daughters face. The perspective gained by listening to Claire's thoughts followed by Mia's thoughts was so overwhelming and calming at the same time. As a mother I could see myself clearer and how I don't SEE my children for who they are, but as an extension of me. Sometimes we need someone to hit us over the head with a shovel to really get something that is so clearly in front us. On a side note...I don't think you have to have a child in distress to gain from this book. This is one of those books that gives you the answer to \\"would things have been different if I knew then what I know now?.

Both mother and daughter write their tales well, and you can see the growth happen through the story. The catharsis is not sudden; the recovery is not fast. It is hard work to achieve the well-deserved forward momentum they have at the end of the book.There is also a small amount of revenge - not nearly enough, but just a little to make you almost smile.It's a terrible tale that deserves to be told.

Mother and daughter seamlessly intertwine their stories together and I felt as though I was there throughout their struggles... laughing and crying and working through the demons in my own closet. Their openness and vulnerability made me commit to trying to correct the path I am already leading my own young daughter down and I thank them for opening my eyes before it was already too late."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This book was a wake-up call for me because when things get bad, things are always worse for somebody else in the world. That is a very easy thing to forget and I once again realized I was guilty for taking my own reality for granted. A good recommedation for those who draw a line between fate and miracles."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"An amazing true story of the love between a parent and a child who overcame every parents nightmare. After being in a reader's slump for quite a few months this book caught my attention while shopping (not for a book). From the first page on, I could not put this book down and wanted to know more.I am now out of my slump! Thank you Fontaine ladies!"},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I picked this book up because I am a new mother, and I am already intrigued by the bond between myself and my daughter. After the first sentence, I was hooked. Many of the negative reviews say not to use the book as a guide to help a troubled teen, but I don't feel that's how it was intended. This book depicts a long journey of a mother and daughter, who use sheer honesty and humor to tell their story. I would recommend this book again and again to anyone interested in the incredible bond between a mother and her daughter."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"A great book, not even what I expected, and not boring, Very easy to follow to keep the reader interested."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This is the most profound book I have read in 2007. I think about it often and my book group seems to revisit it every month even though we read it 6 months ago. This is a raw story of healing and torment, not self indulgent or too self absorbed like many other acclaimed memoirs. I loved it and could not put it down"},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I truly love both Claire and Mia. I really related to Claire as a mother myself of teenagers and I related to Mia from when I was a teenager. Their stories parallel the lives of my Mom and I but to a lesser degree. Wonderful book!"},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This book touched my heart and had me crying so many times because it touched my very soul as Claire and Mia described situations that I have lived through with my daughter. A lot of their story was not the same as ours, but in their descriptions of what was going on in their minds and hearts during the horrific experience, they touched the very core of my being. I have felt the feelings that they Claire was so eloquently able to put into words for me. The things that Mia said could have come right out of my daughter's mouth. The second half of the book that describes the recovery process in detail was also something that I could relate to and it also helped me to better understand and \\"get my head around\\" the recovery process. Although I did not want to put this book down, on many occasions I was not able to find time to read it for several weeks. When I picked it up again, I was right back there with them immediately as if I had never stopped reading. I wish to thank Claire and Mia for writing this book from their hearts. I will share this book with others who I think will be touched by it also. I highly recommend this book if you have gone through any type of drug/alcohol abuse with your teenager, or if your child has been abused. These authors have given us a book that can bring hope into the lives of many parents and their wayward children."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I don't normally write reviews but I had to for this book. If you have ever had to deal with any kind of abuse in your life (sexually, physical, or verbal) this book really hits home. You can relate so well to their feelings in the book. EXCELLENTLY WRITTEN!!!"},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"\`Come Back' is a heart-wrenching, true story of a mother/daughter relationship and what intense love can do to save someone. It is the story of a young woman who, at an early age, is abused by her biological father and can never come to terms with it. She is haunted by his image, and she labels herself a dirty and broken person. Her self-destructive way of dealing with her emotional pain horrifies her perfectionistic mother, Clare, and drives her entire family to the brink of collapse.The book begins as the daughter, Mia, has run away, leaving her upper-middle class home with two loving parents (mom and step-dad) to pursue a life of drugs, alcohol and despair. After leaving her home, Mia begins living off friends, moving from house to bus to park bench- smoking dope, shooting heroin and sleeping around. When Mia is found (through her mother's fervent searching), the real journey begins- the journey of Mia's recovery. It is a long and arduous road, which leaves her over-achieving mother stymied, and it brings the family to its knees in an effort to save Mia. The unorthodox treatment program Mia is forced to participate in enables both mother and daughter to essentially \\"rehab\\" together, learning about themselves and each other, and bringing an end to the destructive and emotionally draining way they had been living. This story is told by both players- Mia and her mother Clare- and they write candidly of the journey taking them to a place where they could understand each other and become friends as well as mother and daughter. There are times when you will have tears of joy or sorrow, and there will be times when you are ticked off by the mess kids and parents alike can make of their lives. If you have a relationship with an addict, you'll appreciate this book for all the things it teaches you about parenting, personal growth and most of all tough and real love."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"A very emotional book about a mother daughter relationship. Its shocking and beautiful. You'll never forget this book. Moderate read, not hard just long.(took me about 3 days)"},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I wouldn't have bought this book on my own, but I picked it off my girlfriend's nightstand and read it cover to cover. My little sister is an addict and though it was really hard for me at times, reading Mia's parts gave me hope and a better understanding of what my sister's going through and how I can maybe help her. I was also really surprised to find that a lot of the things Mia learned about herself in the specialty school she was in apply quite a bit to my own life - gulp :)I rarely read anything besides comics and the sports page, so if I'm saying to read this, you know it's gotta be good!"},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"Just wanted to warn you, if you are the kind of person (like me) who sometimes carries the weight of the world on your shoulders and are profoundly affected by injustices done to children, this might be too much for you, too! I had to stop before the first chapter was over because I was crying. Too true and too sad. So obviously, it is very well written!"},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This is a wonderful book. Hard to read, especially when you're a parent of teens, but beautifully written by the mother, and heartwrenchingly written by the daughter who went through hell and back.I loved the book and got a lot out of it. I would recommend it to any parent of teens. Amazing !"},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This story saddened, surprised, shocked and touched me. When my book club read this early last year, I wasn't able to attend, so I shelved the book. Am I glad I dedided to pick it up a year later. I feel like I learned a lot about relationships from hearing this mother/daughter story. It reminds us all to hope and stay strong in any family crisis because afterall, blood is thicker than water!"},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"Mia Fontaine experienced sexual abuse by her father at an early age. Her self-destructive behavior entering her early teens may be familiar to many sex abuse survivors but her recovery, likely is not. Many families would not be as supportive, as aggressive in ensuring therapy or have the financial means to provide it. As an MSW student, I feel limited in my abilities to provide counseling to clients at this point. For that reason, I gave my copy of this book to a sexual abuse survivor and adolescent client of mine. She read it cover to cover in one week and said it was very helpful. She was going to give it to her mother to read. Any one who is interested in sexual abuse survivors or is one themselves is likely to find this book a valuable collection to their library."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"Do not trust the picture Claire Fontaine paints of WWASP rehab centers in this book. I implore anyone considering sending their child to rehab NOT to use this book as a guide. If you are considering sending your child to a rehab or boot camp of any kind, I BEG you to read Maia Szalavitz's _Help At Any Cost_ so you can get another and, in my opinion, far more accurate perspective of what these rehabs are really like._Help At Any Cost_ is not a memoir (the other books I mention are). Rather, it is an analysis and expose of treatment programs like the one Mia Fontaine was in. In fact, Szalavitz writes about Mia Fontaine's program. She describes some of the very same people that Fontaine does -- but Szalavitz's description of them is quite different from Fontaine's. She does not see them as heroes. She sees them as abusers and has the information to back it up.What Ms. Szalavitz reveals is quite disturbing -- she shows how these rehabs have inflicted emotional, physical, and sexual abuse on their teenage clients. These programs have been responsible for the brutal deaths of vulnerable young people.You can also read _Gone To The Crazies_, by Alison Weaver, to learn the truth about these programs. Weaver went through Cascade, a treatment program similar to the WWASP program. Weaver has the honesty and courage to admit how much it damaged her, how dreadful and destructive and completely ineffective it really was. She talks about the sexual and emotional abuse inflicted by the counselors on the teenagers while she was at Cascade. She also bravely identifies the program for what it is - a cult. She realizes she was brainwashed (the Fontaines might want to take a good, long look at that) and recognizes that Cascade uses \\"tactics employeed in Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Soviet Union, and Mao's China.\\"According to Weaver, most Cascade graduates use drugs again. She did. Not only were the Cascade students not \\"cured,\\" they were far more messed up than they had been before Cascade. In addition to having the same old drug and other problems they had prior to Cascade, they had a whole new set of problems that stemmed from the abusive \\"therapy\\" that Cascade offered -- they type of \\"therapy\\" described by the shockingly ignorant and in-denial Claire Fontaine.If you still aren't convinced, read _Jesus Land_, by Julia Scheeres. She was placed in Escuela Caribe, a religious rehab center in the Dominican Republic by her parents. The brutality and cruelty that Escuela Caribe offered as \\"therapy\\" will sound familiar to people who have read _Come Back_, but Scheeres, unlike Fontaine, knows enough to call this \\"therapy\\" by its real name -- ABUSE. That abuse was not only emotional, it was physical as well. The scene where Ms. Scheeres describes seeing a skinny, 13 year old boy brutally beaten by a 40 year old counselor will stay with you for a long time.If you don't want to read _Gone To The Crazies_ or _Jesus Land_ or _Help At Any Cost_, a simple google search will tell you all you need to know about WWASP and other rehabs and about Glenda and Steve Roach, the people who ran Morava, the first rehab Mia went to. Claire Fontaine describes them in a glowing, heart-warming way. You will find different information online, to put it mildly. After you read about them, ask yourself if you would like being under the \\"care\\" of such people. Ask yourself if you would allow anyone you loved to be under their \\"care.\\" Then, finally, ask yourself why Ms. Fontaine thinks they are good, caring, helpful people, and why she felt it was good to leave her troubled daughter with them.If you want to learn even more, google \\"The Straights\\" or \\"Straight Program\\" and \\"Mel Sembler\\" or \\"Synanon.\\"Claire Fontaine probably loves her daughter. However, she is a master of denial. She has spent a lifetime making excuses and looking the other way as she allows her daughter to stay in horrifically abusive situations. Instead of recognizing that certain behaviors are WRONG, she pretends that everything will be fine. She ignored every red flag with her husband and she ignored those same flags with Morova.Please do not make the same mistake she did. Do not allow your children or anyone you care about to wind up in one of these dreadful rehabs, boot camps, wilderness camps, or therapeutic communities. Don't just trust in your desperation that everything will be okay. Do your homework and protect your children."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"Comeback was an engaging read. A troubled teenager is sent away to a rehab/school. The mother & daughter individually write about their encounter enabling the reader to learn each of their viewpoints. It was interesting to see how they each went through different but similar experiences throughout the \\"process\\" and end up at a mutual place. I was uncertain about liking it in the beginning but overall I learned from the book & found myself thinking about it in applications to my life & others' too. I felt the daughter's writing was more sincere & the mothers's was more forced - as if she was writing to write vs writing honestly about the experience."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"Reading books is one of my favorite hobbies, so needless to say I read a lot of books. I could not put this book down. I have a 2 1/2 year old daughter and every time I would read this book I would want to hold her even tighter than I already do. This mother and daughter tale is so endearing, and I am glad that my husband bought it for me. I would reccomend this book to anyone, especially to all the mothers out there."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"What an amazing book,it is so honest and raw, but also funny and up-lifting. The way Claire and Mia repaired their relationship was so illuminating for me. Even though my life is very different than Mia's, I saw myself in her in ways that made me realize how easily I blame my mom for a lot of things instead of seeing some of my own responsibility. This book makes you see how much power we have to change our lives if we have the courage and the love. It is also a joy to read a book so well written.Highly recommended for anyone any age!"},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This memoir by both a mother and a daughter rivals the novel \\"Cost\\" in its picture of the way drug abuse ravages a family. The entire family must heal in order for the child too find a way to change, accept, feel safe and loved. This was an amazing book that I recommend to every parent before the kids hit their teens, to all families coping with drug abuse, and to those in recovery."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This book grabbed me from the very beginning, it is written that way. The reader can't help but feel as if he/she is part of the story. The story is a true story of a mother's love and how that love helped to get daughter Mia out of her misery. Mia is a beautiful girl and Claire (her Mom) is a very courageous woman. My children are still little, but I'm glad I read the book because it gives me hope in case my children would ever get tangled in the web of hopelessness and misery. I have actually talked to Claire through an email. Claire and Mia are working on another book about their trip (I think around the world or so) together. \\"Come Back\\" is a perfect title, because Claire literally needed to get Mia back from Mia's own little world. I highly recommend this book. It is a true story, that shows how the Love of a Mother conquered, but also how the Love of a daughter led her back to her mother's arms."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

I am one of those people that always has a book in her hand and I have to say, this is the BEST book I've read in years. It is all together brutally HONEST, FUNNY and HEART-WARMING. The writing was PHENOMENAL. And the people in the book were all so REAL and LOVABLE. Just like the person in the last review, I absolutely could not put this book down. I was actually upset when I got to my subway stop and would have to stop reading for 5 minutes. Now that I have finished Comeback, all I can do is hope that Claire and Mia Fontaine PUT OUT ANOTHER BOOK - Please! and soon! I can't wait to hear more. I really miss Claire and Mia."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I found this very true to life. Although the circumstances were different for me, Claire described my feelings perfectly. It was nice to know that someone, somewhere, really understands what I am going through. It gave me hope."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK!If your going through tough teenage daughter years or want some insite to be prepared...My daughter went through a difficult time age 13-16, and I could relate to Claire on so many levels. Remember that there is always HOPE! My daughter is now 19 and just finished her 1st semester in college and got straight A's!!! For all the other Moms out there dealing with teenage daughter issues...KEEP STRONG!"},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I loved this book. I bought it for all my friends and co-workers who have children or work within the realm of psychology or social work with children. I recommend this to anyonw who has a child who has been sexually abused, a single parent raising a child, or anyone who really wants to know the deep truth of how what we do as parents,and what we say to our children can truely leave a mark forever within them."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"...but an amazing memoir none the less. I saw so many aspects of mine and my mother's relationship in this book it made me want to go back 23 years and start over. A great read-I was unable to put it down-a MUST for any mother having problems with their children. A great read for anyone else with an open mind. It's not all fluff and feathers and pretty happy mother daughter relationships...for (#@ sake, people, read the book flap. It's an intensely honest, poignant, and captivating account of all of the emotions that follow incest and abuse."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"The first part of the book reads well. It's heart-wrenching to listen to Claire recount losing her daughter. However, about 2/3rds of the way through, the book starts reading like a late night infomercial for Morava and WWASP's. As a recovering adolescent addict myself, I understand and relate to Mia's story. And I'm sure my mother relates to Claire, but its hard to swallow the whole book as truth. While I was reading the first 100 pages, I really felt for both Mia and Claire. The emotion is raw and blunt and you know how much both women are suffering. But after finishing the whole book, I feel like those first 100 pages are more about over-dramatically screaming \\"Look how horrible and dysfunctional we are!\\" in order to set up the advertisement for Morava in the latter part. By the time you trudge though the WWASP propaganda on pages 100-300, all those raw experiences from the first 100 pages seem cheapened. The \\"propaganda\\" pages feel forced and fake. I don't doubt that Mia and Claire both suffered mightily. I don't doubt that they needed outside help to overcome years of abuse and dysfunctional behavior, but I can't believe completely in the message the book is sending, that \\"WWASP's are the ONLY way you'll ever come to truly understand yourself. Psychologists, mental health facilities, etc are just lies.\\" I think the book would hold a lot more value if the last half of it didn't feel like a cheap commercial."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This is a wonderful book for any parent to read. It can happen to anyone. I love the way the book is written and how honest Claire and Mia are about what they went through.Unbelievable book. Must read."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This book touched me on many levels. As a new parent I found the relationship between Mia and Claire to be enlightening. As a human I found its honesty to be raw, which I think is something we need more of in our society.Come Back is very well-written and handles a dark subject delicately and with humor when appropriate. It flows really well and I found that I was thinking about Claire and Mia nearly every day while reading the book. After reading it I had to google Mia just to make sure that she's still doing well. That's how much I cared about her and Claire after reading this book.An unintended result of this book (for myself and I'm assuming for the authors) is that it really caused me to look at my own life. The book acted as a mirror to see where I am not being completely honest with myself and how I am avoiding being the best me that I can be.Come Back- it is engaging and honest. The authors share their fears and love with the reader in a most-trusting way. If only the readers could author a book titled Give Back for Mia and Claire."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"Come Back by Claire and Mia Fontaine is one of the most important books I've ever read. Passionate, heart wrenching and unflinching in their honesty, this talented mother and daughter take us on an intimate journey as they literally go through hell and back to reclaim their true selves and each other. Their unforgettable story unfolds through Claire and Mia's interwoven voices with resounding intensity, honesty, humor, and courage.Kudos to Claire and Mia Fontaine for breaking the silence that all too often shrouds incest and drug abuse, and for having the courage to open up their hearts and lives so that others may know that they are not alone. A must read for every woman! A+"},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This is a wonderful book about the healing process between a mother and daughter. Healing this relationship (mother/daughter) can be quite challenging and this book will give you the hope and the peace that it is quite possible.It is a well written, reflective book about how even as a Mother you may think you are doing everything right... only to find you have lost your child. It is also written from the daughters point of view, that when you need the most help and you feel lost, reaching out to your mother is possible (hard, yes) but possible.This mother daughter team is brilliant. They are working in an area of relationship that every woman can relate to. Why? Because the mother daughter relationship is quite hard. But important. And quite powerful.This is a great book."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This is the best book I've read to date on this subject matter. I would recommend it toany parent or child going through addiction. Easy to read and understand. Very well written."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This book was riveting, insightful, tough, hopeful, and I would recommend it, especially for anyone who experienced sexual assault as a victim or as a relative or friend of one. I learned a lot and felt I was living the experience alongside Claire and Mia, seeing this issue from many sides. Great read."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"It sounds wrong to say it, but I love this book.It sounds wrong because this story is awful and emotionally challenging.The story is about a mother (Claire) who has a baby (Mia) with a sexually abusive and violent person. Mia is molested, and Claire is beaten.Thankfully Claire and Mia leave him while Mia is still a kid.Unfortunately, to Claires horror, Mia turns about to be sexually promiscuous and a drug addict. She runs away from home, and the rest of the story is about her mothers fight to get her daughter back and off the streets/drugs and the struggle of recovering from the violence and sex abuse she witnessed as a toddler.Throughout the book I was shocked and sad at times.Its an interesting read, I highly reccommend this book."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of our therapist to help understand my daughter's behavior. It was very painful to read both sides of the trial, both from the parent's perspective, but also from the child. It was a page turner as you struggle to find out how it ends and if there is hope for your own situation.There were times when the messages were just too powerful and I had to put the book away for a few minutes, it's that good.I am a father but there is great insight into this tale of a mother & daughter going to hell and back for anyone that is related to someone with these problems."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"My mother and I both read this story. She (43 years old)and I (17 years old) both enjoyed every moment. This story definitely opened my eyes. It was touching and sad to see how much this mother and daughter went through. This is no doubt one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I'm not a mom or an addict, but found Comeback to be fascinating. There's a depth and a universal truth to it that I haven't found in many other memoirs. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"Awesome book. The way it is written in the first person by both authors really works for this book. I highly recommend this book for any parent who has had or has a teenager that is going thru troubling times. The book is even more relatable if a parent has a teen already enrolled in a therapeutic schooling program. This is the best non-fiction book I have ever read due to the personal impact it made on me."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I bought the book because i have a 3 year old daughter and i was excited to read a book about a mother daughter relationship, especially one that covered the difficult teen years that I have to look forward to! What I didn't expect after just reading the first chapter was all the disturbing parts regarding her 3 - 4 year old being sexually molested by her drug addict husband who obviously grew up in an environment that made that horrendous behaviour seem permissible. Had I known I was going to be subjected to reading that, I would not have bought the book. I understand that if you have a child going through drug issues it is probably an insightful book to read. But I would have liked to have known that there was incest involving a toddler in this book before I bought it. I found it too troubling to read. Just a heads up. Maybe it wouldn't offend others as it has me but I thought I would at least put it out there. I am returning the book tomorrow as I can't read anymore."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I loved this book from page one, word one. It really does prove that love can conquer all and that there is always hope. You don't have to be a parent with a child going through similar things or even a parent to benefit from this book. A must read!"},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I purchased this book for my wife. She could not put it down. She enjoyed it tremendously. Highly recommended to anyone."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"Although this book touches on some very serious and heavy subjects (incest, drug use, run always, rehab), it does do in an interesting format.

There are better books on this topic but this was book is a start."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This book touched me to my core.

Thank you for sharing your story with the world."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This book is an incredible story that is hard to put down.It is extremely difficult to read in parts,and having a 14 month old there were times when I wanted to tear it into little pieces to stop myself from continuing to read.It was so hard and terrifying to think someone you love so much could be hurt by abuse when they are just a baby and in turn hurt themselves so badly later on. The imagery and writing is superb and really takes hold of your brain and emotions.I cried pretty much the whole way through-from saddness but I also from happiness and the beauty of love so strong.I think any parent would feel deeply moved by this journey but it is a book that will touch anyone-fast paced,interesting and emotionally gripping.It is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"As someone who lived with an addict for many years, I really liked this book. It was helpful for me to read the daughter's entries next to her mother's. It gave one of the most thorough views into families struck by addiction that I have seen and also broke some of the stigma.I was somewhat turned off at the beginning of the book because I found the mother hard to relate to. However, as I read through the book, I saw that she was writing very honestly and I came to appreciate that very much. It enabled me to see her transformation in a way we often don't see. I think most people would have tried to cover parts of that up.The book was hard for me to put down. Here were a few of my favorite quotes:\\"Sometimes, we have to give birth to our children twice....Once your child becomes the \\"garbage\\" other parents are afraid of, you never look at any teen, or yourself, the same again. All you see is the child they once were.\\" ~Claire Fontaine\\"Nor did I grasp the capacity of love's absence to destroy, that my lack of love for myself made my own life unbearable. You take someone whose life experiences have taught them they're worthless, string them out on drugs, and you have one miserable person. How could I have given what I didn't have? It's hard to value another life when you view your own as dispensable, hard to understand how you can have so great an effect on someone else when you don't think you matter.\\" ~Mia FontaineThis is a beautiful story about the love between mother and daughter. I'd highly recommend it to anyone dealing with family addiction."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"Claire goes into crisis when her daughter, Mia, runs away to live on the street and continue her drug abuse away from the watchful eyes of her mother. As she processes her daughter's disappearance, Claire remembers the sexual abuse that Mia suffered as a young child by the hands of her biological father. She regrets not paying attention to the warning signs: self-mutilation, withdrawal, and her new friendship with a Wiccan. Claire hires handlers to find and kidnap Mia in order to place her into Morava Academy, a treatment facility in the Czech Republic. As Mia goes through treatment in Morava and Claire under goes the parent counseling program, they begin to change. Mia begins to deal with her issues and heal. Claire learns that their problems did not begin with Mia's behavior or her father. Claire and Mia rediscover the pure love and joy of their relationship. The honest reflections of Mia and Claire are fascinating. It's an addictive read that keeps you wanting more; to find the happy ending that seems just out of reach. Come Back accounts the life-change of a mother and daughter, but it may change the reader as well."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"A very beautifully written book....spellbinding. I ordered this book for both of my daughters."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"Claire and Mia Fontaine have done a masterful job of showing what happens inside a reprogramming center for out-of-control teens....mostly teens on drugs who have been \\"committed\\" to these facilities by their parents, who have reached the end of their rope, so to speak.Since this is a \\"memoir\\", I was somewhat skeptical of some of it.I think the book could have used some editing for length and I also found the plethora of details about the seminars attended by the parents and the sessions the daughter attended for two years to be just too many words. I got real tired of all the jargon and lingo, to be honest. It began to sound cultish. I also think that there was a lot of unneeded trivia in this book.One thing that I found to be unbelievable was that Claire \\"forgets\\" that a therapist told her that when Mia became a teenager, the memories and emotions of her abuse as a young child will begin to have an effect her. How could she possibly have forgotten such a warning?!?!?!But it was a compelling, horrifying inside look at what a family goes through when one of its members is a drug addict. Their desperation led them to do what they did, and I cannot judge them for that as many other reviewers have done."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"had a young friend who got shipped off to this place a while back, this book helped me understand where she was.

It was a life changing book for me. One I would recommend over and over."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"I stumbled across this book at a used booksale. Just reading the back cover captured my interest. This book is brutally honest and well-written. I like that both mother and daughter are given the opportunity to tell their story from a first person point of view. If this book were told from a third person point of view, I don't think it would have been nearly as affective.I could relate to the emotional struggles of both mother and daughter. Even though I am neither an addict or a mother, I could relate to the chaotic relationship these two share. But through it all, it is obvious these two, though very different in a lot of ways, love each other deeply.I also like the fact that while this book does talk about heavy subject such as drug addiction, anger, and incest, the bulk of this book is about recovery. I also like the fact that recovery also includes the mother. This book also makes it clear that drug addiction is really just a symptom of a much deeper problem. This book also helped me to identify struggles in my own life. This book has impacted me on so many levels. Ultimately, this is not a book about drug addiction, it is a book about recovery and hope.I would recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with addiction themselves or who has a loved one who is. This book does an excellent job of exposing what goes on in the mind of someone who is a drug addict.But I also heartily recommend this book to people like me, who have no history of addiction or drug use. This is just a great book. It is real and well written. I believe this book has something for everyone."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This book is spot-on. It's the updated version of the first edition of the book. It's the gritty, true story of what some families go through to help good kids who are in bad situations get their lives back on track, or even just to keep them alive. Come Back is particularly good because it tells the story from the view of both the mother (Claire), and the daughter (Mia). Some reviewers have indicated that the book is contrived; it is not. Our daughter went to a boarding school when she was 15, primarily due to drug and alcohol abuse. While no two kids have had the same experiences, I know kids who, as a group, have experienced each and every thing in this book. A few of the characters are composite characters, but the main characters are not (the book is about Mia and Claire, not about the hundreds of other people that were involved). Come back was of great comfort to many of the parents of girls at my daughter's school because we had gone through the bad experiences in the book, and we were going through the recovery. Many of us have read Come Back over and over."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This book is spot-on.

She has a substance abuse problem and it had been really difficult to communicate my perspective of how this issue was affecting the family. At the same time she said over and over to me--you don't understand. This book was really helpful to us and a realistic picture of what substance abuse is like for all family members. Although the facility where the daughter goes has come under fire since her stint there, I believe that the depiction of what such a facility is like is realistic, having sent my daughter to a residential program."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This book is OUT OF THIS WORLD! It is gripping. It is suspensdeul. It is a true story and is authored by the mother and daughter the story is about.What is unusual is how WELL the story is written. It reads like fiction. It could be easily turned into a screenplay and be hollywood blockbuster.It is a fascinating yet horrifying journey into abuse, anger, neglect, love, and hatred. A scared, hurting 15 year old girl turns to a life so distroted through the taste of drug abuse that she runs away from home.The story follows Mia (the runaway drug addict daughter) through her run away, rehab, escape and ultimate \\"lock up\\" in a Czech Republic instution.I couldn't put it down and recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"What courage it took for Claire & Mia to share the drama they endured.

You know when you read this page turner this is hard to believe but all true; all from the heart, and perhaps all a mother-daughter relationship at its best is really supposed to be - despite the hell Claire and Mia go through. They are never really alone in a frightening world. They never give up on each other. And they come out of it strong."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"This is not the story of an average upper middle class Californian teenager who thrives in high school and goes on to an Ivy League college--although it easily could be. Instead, a series of crises tear mother and daughter apart both physically and emotionally, leading to years of struggle and heartbreak. While Claire has the dominant voice, both authors write freely and frankly about their perceptions and experiences. The depth of their feeling for each other is never in doubt--but it is only in the final chapters that both women finally discover what they need for recovery and renewal."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"In a world that obsesses over teen-age addiction and which paints the Britneys, Lindsays, Amys and Olsens as glamorous beauty queens with tragic yet excusable addictions, it is both heart breaking and heart warming to read about an honest-to-goodness real girl who overcomes both a difficult childhood and substance abuse and obtains love and stability on her own terms. Mia is relatable; her writing is accessable to youngsters who are tired of preachy \\"don't do what I did\\" stories. Instead, she inspires \\"problem teens\\" to go through their own transformative journey, no matter how many years or how many continents the journey may take. The reader is left knowing that Mia will obtain great things, because Mia will now allow herself to."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"The story that Claire Fontaine and daughter, Mia, share in their unflinching memoir, Comeback: A Mother and Daughter's Journey through Hell and Back, is far more universal than the title suggests. Though the the particular conditions of their family-Mia's biological father's drug use, his abusive behavior toward both Mia and Claire, the difficulty of the divorce, and Mia's unexpected and rapid move toward self-abusive behavior-shapes the Fontaine's narrative, the story is hugely recognizable and relatable. In Claire and Mia's introspective, astute writing, both women and men will recognize compelling elements of their own familial relationships: the intimacy of the mother-child bond; the confusion of early adolescent sexuality; the complexity of adult life; and the terror of inter-familial rage. These are but some of the deeply human, challenging themes explored in their page-turning memoir, which ranges seemlessly from shocking, tragic, and brutally honest, to funny, witty, heart-warming, and profound. Throughout, this emotional multi-dimensionality remains incredibly well-balanced and, most importantly, moving. Readers will be deeply touched by the Fontaine's honest, fresh treatment of complex universal themes."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"Like another reader said \\"I loved this book\\".But I almost didn't...In the beginning I almost put it down. As a practicing pagan I see all kinds of misinformation about the pagan path out there and I was a bit disappointed to see the comment about the weird friend who was Wiccan. It made me wonder if this was going to be another moral finger wagging at those who choose a different spiritual path. But I kept going and I was so glad I did. The comment about the Wiccan friend has zero to do with the story in this book. It is unfortunate that the publishers reviewer put it in the very beginning of their review.This book had me laughing, crying, and most of all examining my own self in the mirror. Once I got going I could not put it down. I could not help but think of this as a modern retelling of the story of Persephone and Demeter. Clair, like Demeter is a mother who mourns for the loss of her daughter and refuses to give up until she is returned to her. In the process they both go through painful change. This is the true story of a mother and a daughter that will touch you deeply. It is an emotional roller coaster but well worth the ride. I will chalk this up as one of the best memoirs I have ever read."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"In California, well-meaning legislation passed in the early 1970's led to the situation in which Claire Fontaine had no legal right to force her daughter to stay at home. Running away from home in California is no longer a criminal act, and once your kid leaves, there's not much you can do to bring them home.It is this kind of well-meaning legislation that caused the author to take the most extreme measures possible in order to save the life of her child. This is an extremely interesting and very well-written book that I highly recommend for mothers struggling with teenage daughters."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"A problem that I've never, thank God, had to face. But I've known people whose children have gone off the deep end into drugs and self destructive behavior. Mia is very lucky that mommie was successful enough to put Mia into schools that would do her some good.The key to this book is two fold. First is the story of Mia in the 'tough love' schools that use a Marine Corp boot camp like environment to get the kid clean from drugs and build self-esteem. This the first I've read from the child's viewpoint and it make for very interesting reading. I'm still not sure how another child would have handled it, but it worked for Mia.Perhaps no less important was Claire's involvement in her own therapy to be able to understand what had happened and how to treat Mia when she returned.All in all, a delightful, if rugged book that ends in success and in teaching us all a valuable lesson."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"\\"Come Back\\" is an honest look at the devastation of drug abuse, and the powerful bond between a mother and daughter. The book tells the story of a drug addicted daughter and her mother who is struggling to hold on. The back and forth narrative is really insightful, and is brutally honest. It is raw and at times gut-wrenching, but it is the best portrayal of the complexities of familiar relationships involving an addict that I've ever read. The real strength of the book is showing the journey for both the mother and daughter. It should be reading for all mental health professionals and substance abuse specialists. Set aside a weekend to read it, because once you start, you will not want to put it down."},{"Title":"comeback - a mother and daughter's journey through hell and back","review":"Even if you had a prior knowledge of the book, which mine was minimal at best, there is no way that you could be prepared for the powerhouse that this book actually is. The most prepared person will get knocked off their rocker by the sheer and honest emotions found within these pages. Nestled between the covers lies the strength of love, determination, self exploration and personal growth told in such a way that it is sure to take your breath away.The writing.\`Exquisite' is the first word that comes to mind. Although, much too fancy of a word to cover the style and talent behind Mia and Claire's personal portrayal of their story, it's power is truly fitting. From the moment you begin reading, you can actually feel the emotions that Claire goes through. It's not difficult to place yourself in her shoes, even if you've never experienced the kind of intensity as the roller coaster ride that Mia and Claire go through.This is a smooth read, not something that requires you to have to concentrate in order to get through it. The words just sort of jump off the page and take over your mind and your emotions from the onset. Effortless and all encompassing, this is one book that goes by way too fast. As I read, I began to feel as though I knew these two women. I cried when they cried, I laughed when they laughed, I celebrated their triumphs and wallowed in the disappointments right along with them. I began to feel like Claire and Mia were sitting at my kitchen table with me, sharing a pot of fresh brewed coffee as they filled me in on the roller coaster ride that had taken them away from my immediate friendship for two long years. I wanted to hold Claire in my arms as she cried in the night full of fear for the well being of her daughter. I wanted to hold Mia in my arms as she ran scared and fast toward her seemingly inevitable demise.The story.I believe so intensely that everyone whom reads this book can walk away from it and be able to take something with them that I have purchased the book for several people I am close to in my life. It is such an inspirational story, a testament to the human spirit, that nobody on the planet should miss out on this book. The lessons learned by Mia and Claire are morals and lessons that each and every one of us could benefit from and find ways to incorporate within our own lives. Live not by the hand of fear. That is one thing that I walked away from this book coveting and determined to not only face up to, but to change within my own life. Claire and Mia show us, that even when we believe we've made the right decisions in life, that if those decisions were made out of fear, they could cause unimaginable harm in ways that our minds cannot begin to fathom.Heart wrenching and intense, this is a page turner of the best kind. I promise this is not a book that you will ever take lightly, or dislike. This is a story that will inspire you, and live within your heart for all of time. It touches places within your soul that you didn't even know were there. It gives hope to those whom feel hopeless in their own relationships with their mothers/daughters and brings to focus the true power of love. I highly suggest that if you haven't already, you go right now and purchase a copy of this book."},{"Title":"The Daring Game (Puffin story books)","review":"Elizabeth Chapman enters her new life in boarding school.

This volume also contains many rare photos. The final chapter provides a detailed biography and photo portrait of many of the surviving British soldiers involved with interesting descriptions of their later lives.Simply fascinating and likely to be the most satisfying account you will ever read of this amazing epic."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene (Book 1) (Bk. 1)","review":"This poem, based on ideas from Vergil's Aeneid and Italian poetical romances, was intended to be England's national epic. It has since, in the estimation of some, probably mainly that of scholars or other enthusiasts of English, become the pan-national epic of the entire English speaking world. In actual fact however, we can probably say that it has not garnered enough support for this aim, but it is a noble attempt and a great work of literature nonetheless, I think among the very best in the world, and I have read more than a few books!A few notes now on what it is about to give you an idea of what is inside: It weaves together the medieval Germanic dragon and monster fighting motifs, which are really elaborations of the old Sigurd the dragon slayer from Anglo-Saxon and Norse lays, also seen in the Old English poem Beowulf (which the Faerie Queene resembles in many ways, but surpasses it in length,) with Graeco-Roman mythology, British legend, and Neoplatonic-Christian mysticism. The poem is shockingly similar to (although of course much more elaborate and huger than) Beowulf, which Spencer had no way of knowing even existed. It is as fitting an epic for English speaking civilization as one could perhaps be devised, if not as has ever yet been written, as it marries the old Germanic Anglo-Saxon values of loyalty, courage and fighting prowess, and the old Germanic and British settings of great halls, dragons, giants, kings and heroes, with the Continental civilizing influences of Classical culture and scholarship, and with Christian ideals, references and morality. I don't understand why so many people who like myself love the grand old Norse, Greek, Latin, British, Irish, and Old English lays, looking for an imaginative and rich old heroic past, but miss this poem, which is written in modern English and therefore directly accessible to the modern reader without having to work through the medium of an interpreter translator. I think The Faerie Queene's enchanted adventures quite fit into the heroical fantasy mould, but I think we have to admit that Spencer's work is far greater, more elaborate and artistic than almost anything else out there. He was really going the \\"full nine yards\\" with this thing. There are multitudes of Grendel-like ogres and she-monsters and dragons and other unbefore-imagined beasts that are defeated, magical spells and weapons, fantasy lands, gold, holy men and women of vast spiritual power, long treks and quests, even cannon fire(!), basically all the stuff you see in the wildly popular role playing game story lines and the sword and sorcery genre of modern pulp fiction. If you have any kind of medievalist side to you, this book is a must read. (The Society for Creative Anachronisms crowd should read it and reread it! I'm surprised they don't have a guild of bards who memorize and perform Spencer's work.) The same if you're interested in the English speaking world's traditional culture and mindset on the eve of its spreading around the world. The same if you are looking for something to model your character on, since this was what Spencer wanted us to read his poem for - to form our characters - the values he promotes are still valued today. Of course, this medieval-renaissance culture is a bit set back in time for us today, but the lessons and the values are just as relevant now as ever. Can we ever stop fighting evil? Can we ever forget about loyalty? In addition to forming character, the book teaches plenty of vocabulary, grammar, alludes to history and expounds on philosophy. The book can become a very meaningful personal \\"self-help\\" or \\"guide to success in life\\" book, in this eminently popular genre, if you want it to be, as all great literature can be if read with this goal in mind. Spencer intended it to be so read in one letter he wrote about it, while in another letter he felt the reader should read it for pure enjoyment. However, the didactic nature of the work is clear in its intention even if this epic's pleasures overshadow any didactic qualities it may have while you read it. One caution though is the antiquated spelling. If someone were to come along and modernize all the spelling, s/he could make a lot of money. The old spelling isn't a big problem, since you learn very quickly to make sense of it, but it wouldn't be a hard labour for someone to redact the thing. I think the old spelling has been left because it shows Spencer's poetic brilliance better, as you can see the relations between rhymes, alliterations and rhythms better. But, I think the poem would garner a whole other group of readers if the spelling were modernized for them.Regarding the poetry, I have a few points to make also. The poem is most definitely intended to be read aloud. This does not mean that you must do so, but it is intended to be read as such. When you read it out loud you come to enjoy quite quickly the powerful pulsation of the iambs, topped often with alliteration in the Olde English mode that add punch to their impact and power to their passage. I have the temptation to label this feature \\"Teutonic\\" as it sounds very aggressive and masculine. The last words in each line rhyme with other lines in the stanza in a set way you can read about in the introduction or figure out from your reading. The first eight lines are in iambic pentameter, which is what about 75 percent of English poetry is in. The last line is in iambic hexameter, called \\"Alexandrine\\" which means one more iamb added onto it, making it a very distinctive cadence for the entire nine line stanza. The stanzas are also arranged on the page in a way pleasing to the eye that you will appreciate. Rhythm and Rhyme make this work a poem, and its regular organization adds a magic to it that I don't think the trendy modern free or blank verse can ever match. I am not criticizing these other forms, as they are great in their own ways, but clearly such an elaborate yet regular form as the Spencerian stanza will intrigue you and captivate you at once. The music of the verse gives me at least a feeling of some kind of aggressive pride which pulls you musically into this enchanted land which becomes all-engrossing and quite vividly real when you visit it through your reading.Regarding his influences: I have not read much of the Italian epics Orlando Furiosos and Jerusalem Libertata that he was trying to rival. I have read some of them, and the effect on him is clear. However, being a big fan and avid re-reader of Vergil and Chaucer, I see the hands of these two guiding Spencer at every step, yet \\"standing on their heads he sees farther\\" and his poem is both longer and more artistic, I think, than any single work of either of his two great predecessors. Having read Spencer for the first time before reading Chaucer, and then having read him again after Chaucer, the experience (of reading Spencer) is quite different. The allusions to Chaucer, like to Vergil, are both conscious and subconscious in Spencer, and I was quite shocked at how huge his debt to Chaucer actually is. Chaucer never wrote a huge epic like Spencer did, and as such Spencer was intentionally ploughing new ground in English. No one has really done anything like he did again in the English language. The fact that he was being almost entirely creative in his plots sets him out from many other long poem writers in English. To each his own of course. I have to add too that Spencer's age was one of the last when the English speaking world was truly one unified entity, albeit still quite small of course, yet with the seeds of greatness already starting to grow. With the establishment of the Empire it started being harder to write something definitive for the entire Anglosphere. This likely is a main reason why Spencer, Shakespeare, Chapman, Chaucer, Beowulf and the rest have retained their popularity so strongly into modern times all around the world. They sing of our common heritage. You can meet their characters around you no matter where you live. Speaking as a North American, all us English speakers are tied together in the Spencerian age; after that our peoples evolved in their different directions. The dedication at the start of this poem to Queene Elizabeth, Queene of Virginia (among other places) points this out quite strongly. I think this poem makes you proud to be an English speaker, and proud to be part of this great world civilization; it makes me feel this way at least! Feel the pride, buy it, read it!"},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene (Book 1) (Bk. 1)","review":"Spenser's the Faerie Queene is one of the first epics to be written in English, and probably the first to draw on such masters as Virgil and Homer. He purposely wrote in archaic English, so it is a bit difficult to understand (just imagine language that was old 400 years ago!), but taking the time to read it provides a very meaningful experience.The Faerie Queene was supposed to include 12 books, some of which were never completed. Each book was to star a Knight, who would embody some Christian virtue (for example, the Red-Crosse Knight is the hero of book 1--he represents holiness). Additionally, all the books were to feature King Arthur as a hero who was the epitome of a good Christian. The books are very allegorical, and most of the enemies and beasts the knights meet embody some vice or sin (such as the giant who represents Pride in book 1).The Faerie Queene is a classic medieval text, and is also a great epic poem. As many have commented, it does take a lot of work, but the reward is also very immense. For any fan of the epic format or student of classic English literature, the Faerie Queene is essential."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene (Book 1) (Bk. 1)","review":"This is a review of the Kindle edition, viewed on a PC.I believe that for a less than $3 book, the other two reviews were being unfair.

They weren't great, but they were color illustrations.At this point in the Book reader technology, you simply do not buy a book for high fidelity to its printed version. In many, many cases, lots of things are simply left out. For example, my printed copy of the Qu'ran has the Arabic and many comments.

There is not much by the editor to be read before we come face to face with Spenser himself, but the material that would normally go into an editorial introduction is there after all, only it's at the back instead. If we are daunted by the thought of an enormously long poem there is a temptation to procrastinate by plodding slowly through some scholarly introduction, only to find ourselves wearied by the introduction and hardly able to face the poem. Meaning no disrespect to the eminent writers of introductions, I have experienced nightmares at the thought of some Penguin/Oxford/Faber Book of Introductions, edited (with Introduction) by John Carey.We are not plunged totally unprepared into The Faerie Queene. There is a \`manifesto' by Spenser expounding his aims in writing the work (or what he claims those to be): there are various commendatory sonnets and other miscellaneous stanzas by various other parties; and there are a whole string of dedicatory sonnets addressed to an assortment of bigwigs by Spenser himself. It is easy to skip most of these, and then if we are lucky we may find ourselves engrossed in one of the most readable and entertaining poems in the English language. It is written in a slightly bogus antique idiom, a little like The Ancient Mariner two centuries later. The idea is to create an atmosphere, and the style is nowhere near as difficult to grasp as in Paradise Lost let alone genuine mediaeval English as in Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde. Indeed, try opening the book at random and you may find the kind of magic working on you that Tolkien can work, except that great verse casts a spell of its own that not even my favourite prose can hope to equal. It purports to be a moral allegory, but moral allegories are boring and this is enthralling. Spenser knows how to spin a fairytale thriller, and you can't tell me that that was not what he really enjoyed doing.The editor inserts for reference a table of dates and some suggestions for further reading before we have read anything, but I found the very brief \`Note on the Text' to be rather interesting. It seems that there are three early editions, from 1590, 1596 and 1609, and that this edition is based on the 1596 text, with additional material taken from the other two sources where it is absent from that text. I certainly support the decision to include all the material that belongs in a purportedly complete version of The Faerie Queene, and the editor's apology for his \`composite' text is courteous but quite unnecessary. However what I would have liked explained is why it has been decided to base our text here on the second of three early editions. Spenser died in 1599, so perhaps the 1596 text has been selected as incorporating his last thoughts and revisions. However this is no more than a guess on my own part.Spelling and orthography are not commonly considered exciting topics, but if you agree with me (and with the editor if I have understood him) that Spenser is concerned to create an atmosphere with his pseudo-antique diction, then the spelling is all part and parcel. The way it has been done seems to me just about right. Plain annoyances to a modern reader such as tildes representing the nasals m or n are banished, but u v and i are retained where modern standards require v u and j. I cannot possibly regret that s is printed in the modern manner and not as f, as the latter could lead to quaint orthography in such cases as \`Where the bee sucks there suck I'.At the end there is an appendix detailing textual corrections, and another providing a handy list of common olde wordes. There are also \`notes' on the verses explaining unfamiliar dictions and usages, but the most interesting items here are the longer \`notes', which in effect provide much of what one would normally find in an introduction. I said already that I was relieved not to find this kind of material at the beginning of the book, so let me add now that I am thoroughly pleased to find it located where I do find it. After all, we have bought this edition in part (I suppose) because the editor is the Professor of English at Princeton. Spenser has provided the enjoyment, now it's time for the lessons."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene (Book 1) (Bk. 1)","review":"This version of The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser contains copious explanatory endnotes, which are very useful in making sense of this vast epic poem.

It's quite good, with extensive marginal notes interspersed with the poem. One drawback is the small font size used--the notes and text of the poem are the same size. The text is actually a facsimile reproduction of the Smith 1909 Oxford edition, so it is not particularly sharp or clean. Some sections are a bit faint, and others are too dark.

(For that matter, the entire poem was issued in modern, that is, Victorian, spelling over a century ago by the Chandos Classics; the difference between Victorian and present-day British spelling is close to insignificant.) Still, Brooks-Davies and Everyman did a great service for beginning students by putting this more varied and up-to-date selection into print, and hopefully a complete modern-spelling edition will eventually follow. The one real and curious defect of this volume is that, while the purpose of a modern-spelling text is to help the beginner, Brooks-Davies' marginal glosses actually present an impediment to the beginner by giving TOO MUCH information, slowing his or her understanding of the text rather than speeding it up.This the official title of the Chandos Classics edition: \\"The Faery Queen.

The poem was written as an allegory intended to teach Christian morality. On the surface, it can be difficult to read due to the large number of archaic words and spellings used, although there are helpful notes in the back of the book. But the poem does reward those who stick with it, in the way of many beautifully described scenes, fantastic landscapes and characters, and a sharp sense of purpose in its moral themes. Twelve books were planned for the poem, each focusing on a different virtue, but only six (and a fragment of a seventh) were written. I've only read a little more than three of them so far, but I look forward to reading the rest."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene (Book 1) (Bk. 1)","review":"&quot;For the method of a poet historical is not such as of an historiographer; for an historiographer discourseth of affairs orderly as they were done, accounting as well the times as the actions; but a poet thrusteth into the midst even where it most concerneth him, and there recoursing to the things forepast, and divining of things to come, makes a pleasing analysis of it all&quot;Spenser wrote a letter to Walter Raleigh (above excerpted) to explain this strange cacophony of FQ, a mixture of ancient mythology, Renaissance Christian morality and enough obscure symbolism for an academic brigade; a tribute to country and queen. Knights from the court of the Faerie Queen conduct a search and destroy mission against evil in the form of a pack of minor villains pecking away at the heroes of the poem, but each one perpetually foiled. Such as Archimago, the witch Hectate, the philanderer Malbecco receive comeuppances in jousts, internecine squabbles or palace tours, with this type of constant action occupying canto after canto that at some point the content aspect becomes a bit wearisome. Amid this &quot;action&quot; are endless lists of virtues allegorized in each book, the reader being skewered to a Platonic ideal especially evident in females with such as the knight Britomart representing strenght and accomplishment in women, Una, the ultimate fantasy chick, and several others with such heights of description one does expect something mind blowing ahead, perhaps at last the perfect woman, to which in FQ Spenser comes close without cigar. The joust with the evil forces of nature seems unique to Spenser, who seizes the reader by the lapels with an in one's face style of optimism such that worst elements suffer defeat by contrast with more worthy opponents. There is little in FQ of the the weird, off the wall bastardizations of human nature being written almost at the same time by the playwright down the road. This world of Spenser's appears mostly black and white, and totally devoid of the perceptual uncertainty or moral relativity of a Lear or Hamlet, though one senses toward the end with introduction of &quot;mutability&quot; a weakening in the poet: &quot;Then since within this wide, great universe nothing does firm and permanent appear.&quot; It is faint criticism of genius to call FQ a shade below the top with its questionable, archaic content simply outweighed subsequently, but for the glaring and obvious truth that this is some of the greatest poetry that has been written by one of the best poets. FQ is saved by its lyrical verse, by the brilliance of its expression; by the talent of this tremendous intellect to place into rhyme over hundreds of pages such enormous complexity of expression. To call this accomplishment &quot;a pleasing analysis&quot; though as well said as the rest of this poem, is understatement. Shakespeare tends to stir with eerie omniscient intellect, and Spenser does the same, but in a tone and manner so sharply in contrast. FQ contains cleverness, insight, a piercing intelligence, but all rendered with such brushstrokes of eloquence as is simply unequaled. As happens too often, Spenser died before he finished, and one speculates had he lived what else might have been &quot;thrustest into the midst&quot;."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene (Book 1) (Bk. 1)","review":"I will be the first to admit that this is not a book for those that give up easily. At over a thousand pages of Elizabethan poetry, it took me almost two years to get through, and I am not a particularly slow reader. However, I don't want to completely scare away potential readers because it has also been one of the most rewarding books I have ever read. The story is always interesting and imaginative (and in such a long work that's saying something), most of the heroes and heroines are very sympathetic, and the imagery of poetry itself is breathtakingly beautiful. Though it was definitely a commitment to read, I have no regrets in taking the time to do so, and only hope that others will give it a try. Bravo, Edmund Spenser!"},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene (Book 1) (Bk. 1)","review":"The Faerie Queene, I suggest, is the pinnacle of literature in the English language before Shakespeare. Originally envisioned as a twelve book epic, written in language that was deliberately antiquated even for the period, I find it surprisingly modern in several ways. First, the characters are abstract exercises, deliberate embodiments of ideals and concepts. The term 'allegory' is now almost uniquely used to describe this Spenserian technique, and its adoption by later authors. Allegory is metaphor to the Nth degree. Spenser also invented his own, idiosyncratic stanza form and rhyme scheme, a nine line block which he uses throughout (and which is likewise known as the Spenserian stanza). Given these characteristics, The Faerie Queene may be most enjoyed by those who can appreciate its abstract craftsmanship. Nonetheless, there is something in it for every serious reader, as the subjects and plots are deeply archetypal--the saga of Book I's Redcrosse Knight is practically a case-study for one of the thousand faces of Joseph Campbell's hero. The language is rich, and its implications complex--for instance it is unclear what we are to conclude when Guyon, the supposed knight of temperance and moderation razes the Bowre of Blis after nearly succumbing to its charms. Above all, it can be deeply entertaining, moreso I feel than most of Shakespeare's histories, Falkner's Sound and the Fury, or just about anything written in the 18th century."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene (Book 1) (Bk. 1)","review":"The Faerie Queene is a classic of the English language and amust read for anyone who has ever felt a touch of solitude.Lurking beneath a seemingly Manichean story of knights,maidens and monsters is a narrative of immense sensitivity.Spenser was a brooding, fragile poet full of pain and sorrowbefore it became a cliche. The Middle English verse is a kickto read."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene (Book 1) (Bk. 1)","review":"The Faerie Queene of Spencer is perhaps the best known piece of English poetry before Shakespeare or Milton. Written in a language old even for its own time, Spencer had composed a national epic. The Faerie Queene was later eclipsed by 'Hamlet' and 'Paradise Lost' but is still an epic that has a lot to offer readers who are willing to come on its own terms.Spenser incorporated allegory into his poem, and understanding this is vital to reading the work. There are two kinds of allegory here: Political allegory, which I found easier to disregard; and Moral allegory, which appears to be the main focus of all the Faerie Queene. One of the nice things about allegory is that one can pierce various aspects of the narrartive for insight and illumination. Even the smallest detail can help the reader derive meaning. But there is a danger, of course, the reader can find a meaning where none was intended; or worse, interpret the passage exactly opposite of the writer's wishes. One should know the Christian and Puritan mindsets to understand this book, it will be very difficult to make heads or tales of Faerie Queene without it; Book III in particular.There also the story itself, which incorporates two classic English plot devices: the Arthurian tales, and the Fairy Land setting. Both mesh together extremely well, I think one could read this exclusivly to partake in the childhood dreams of dragon slaying and damzel rescuing.'The Faerie Queene' is the most difficult book I have ever read, due to the language. If one presses on with reading it, though, I think they will find that the Spencerian prose becomes almost like a second language to them; the Penguin edition includes a very helpful glossary in the back. I recomend this work to those who like medieval classics, though if you do you've probably already heard of it. If you haven't read anything from the period and would like to tackle this, I recomend reading 'The Canterbury Tales' first to familiarize yourself with the period and thought processes."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene (Book 1) (Bk. 1)","review":"It is a classic truism: until you get it in writing, you have nothing.

In the Romantic age, Spenser was placed besides these two other authors by the foremost English poets. But, authoritative critics like Mario Praz have had a rather dismissive attitude towards it, and you can feel that someone like Frank Kermode speaks of Spenser's greatness as if having to prove something.Now, I believe this book fails insomuch as it tries to be a great modern chivalresque epic like Tasso's or Ariosto's (from whose works a lot of the characters' names come). Probably, he didn't even understand the full magnitude of those works. In this, he is hampered by his medieval mind. Action, intended as a way of developing character and portraying embattled and sovereign human individualities who continuously create a world of their own making, is shallow.Success is in the static aspect, in the way Spenser manages to imbue &quot;tableaux&quot; referring to some eternal configuration of the existing with a strong power over the unconscious. It is a work which shines either by particular descriptions (their technique influenced Milton), or by the overall pattern that the adventures of the characters create. This pattern can be viewed as a gigantic description of a gigantic thing, as the descriptions in the more proper sense which are contained in it are of smaller things."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene (Book 1) (Bk. 1)","review":"I'm of two minds here: on the one hand, you've got to admire Spenser's skillz--after all, we're talkin' thousands of nine-line cantos, eight lines in iambic pentameter and one in iambic hexameter, with a strict AC BD rhyme scheme. That must've taken some doing.On the other hand...I can't say I've really enjoyed reading it particularly. Spenser himself admits that the only reason he even wrote the thing in story form was to appeal to a wider audience; I think he might've done better to stick to straight moral philosophy. The allegory really gets in the way of telling a good story, in my opinion.

The story was delightful and encouraged the imagination with just enough description to outline the picture, while leaving plenty of room for the audience to fill in the colors. Look for the vast amounts of symbolism throughout the poem. My favorite character of the play was Una. The princess who travels with the destined Saint George and remains faithful to both God and her love despite what harsh elements might come in her way. She was human in the sense that she was frightened, she cried, and she got herself in trouble, but she was an admirable character in her strengths, endurance and patience. Within her character, she encouraged a strong female role in a time when the potential of women had yet to be recognized. With Elizabeth as queen, the patriarchal dominance that was known through most of the world was startled. Edmund Spenser, however, knew the strength in his queen and admired it. Perhaps it his respect for Elizabeth that is carried through in his development of Una. As a whole, the &quot;Faerie Queen&quot; was simple enough for those who are not absorbed in classical literature. It had gory battles, risky sexual encounters, and a tender message of love and forgiveness. Most of all, it emphasized the mercy and grace that is found through the love of our God and the sacrafice of his son Jesus Christ. Another strong message that was conveyed through &quot;Faerie Queene&quot; was that of personal growth and taking the chance to discover what you have inside, not what you have always been. Red Cross has a destiny to fullfill before becoming Saint George, but until he realized that he could overcome temptations and evil and seize the elements of truth than his destiny would be kept further and further away from him. How many times in our own lives have we decided not to try for something that we know we wanted only because we were afraid to the take the chance? How many times have we kept ourselves further away from our own futures? All in all, the &quot;Faerie Queene&quot; was an excellent piece of epic poetry and I hope that others will find it as enjoyable and impacting as I have.Jin of Vanguard University of Southern California"},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene (Book 1) (Bk. 1)","review":"This book is phenomenal.

By Edmund Spenser. Edited by Thomas P. Roche, Jr with the assistance of C. Patrick O'Donnell, Jr. 1247 pp. Penguin English Poets, 1978 and Reprinted.Although everyone has heard of Edmund Spenser's amazing narrative poem, 'The Faerie Queene,' it's a pity that few seem to read it. To a superficial glance it may appear difficult, although the truth is that it's basically a fascinating story that even an intelligent child can follow with enjoyment and interest.It appears difficult only because of Spenser's deliberately antique English. He needed such an English because he was creating a whole new dimension of enchantment, a magical world, a land of mystery and adventure teeming with ogres and giants and witches, hardy knights both brave and villainous, dwarfs, magicians, dragons, and maidens in distress, wicked enchanters, gods, demons, forests, caves, and castles, amorous encounters, fierce battles, etc., etc.To evoke an atmosphere appropriate to such a magical world, a world seemingly distant in both time and place from ours, Spenser created his own special brand of English. Basically his language is standard Sixteenth Century English, but with antique spellings and a few medievalisms thrown in, along with a number of new words that Spenser coined himself. The opening lines of the poem are typical :&quot;A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plain, / Y cladd in mightie armes and siluer shielde, / Wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remain, / The cruell markes of many a bloudy fielde....&quot; (page 41).If, instead of reading with the eye, we read with the ear or aloud, the strange spellings resolve themselves into perfectly familiar words such as clad (clothed), mighty, arms, silver, shield, deep, cruel, marks, bloody, field. And &quot;Y cladd&quot; is just one of those Spenserian medievalisms that simply means &quot;clad&quot; or clothed (i.e., wearing).The only two words in this passage that might cause problems for the beginner are &quot;pricking&quot; and &quot;dints,&quot; and it doesn't take much imagination to realize that these must refer, respectively, to 'riding' (i.e., his horse) and 'dents.' But if you can't guess them, an explanation is provided in the useful list of Common Words at the back of the book.Once you've used that 2-page list for a little while, progress through Spenser's text becomes a snap. And learning a few hundred words is a small price to pay for entrance into one of the most luxuriant works ever produced by the Western imagination, and one that once entered you will often want to return to.The Penguin edition, although it contains the complete text of 'The Faerie Queene,' is significantly without an Introduction, presumably because the editors felt that we don't really need one. The book does, however, contain stanza-by-stanza Notes. These have been placed at the end where they can be referred to at need, and where they don't interfere with the flow of the story as we experience it.There have been many editions of 'The Faerie Queene.' Students who are studying the poem formally will want to have the fully annotated edition by A. C. Hamilton, a bulky edition with extensive and detailed notes, but in which the actual text of the poem is not so easy to read, being a rather poor and considerably reduced copy of the 3-volume Clarendon Press edition.The Penguin has always seemed to me to be the best available edition for the general reader. As is usual with Penguins, it has a clear and well-printed text, and the Notes are just about right, being neither skimpy nor excessive. Though fat, it's not too big to carry around, and you may just find yourself taking it along with you on your next trip.Spenser is one of England's very greatest writers. And he was writing, not for critics, but for you and me. Admittedly his language can be a bit tricky at first, and he certainly isn't to be rushed through like a modern novel. His is rather the sort of book that we wish would never end.His pace is leisurely and relaxed, a gentle flowing rhythmic motion, and that's how he wants us to read him. To get the hang of things, try listening to one of the many available recordings. And if you hit a strange-looking word, don't fret or panic. Try to hear the word in your mind, and guess at its meaning. That will often help, but if it doesn't, Roche's list or his brief and excellent notes should.So take Spenser slowly, and give his words a chance to work their magic. Let him gently conduct you through his enthralling universe, one that you will find both wholly strange and perfectly familar, since human beings and their multifarious doings are Spenser's real subject, and somewhere in one of his enchanted forests you may one day find yourself."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene (Book 1) (Bk. 1)","review":"This is a review of The Faerie Queene, Penguin Classics edition, edited by Thomas Roche (ISBN 0140422072).The Faerie Queene itself will not be to everyone's taste. It is probably easier than Milton, definitely harder than Malory, and parts of it are very accessible and parts of it are not very accessible at all. However, the language, which most will perceive as the primary barrier to Spenser's work, is not that difficult to get used to. Take Book I, Canto V, stanza 5, for example:At last forth comes that far renowmed Queene,With royall pomp and Princely maiestie;She is ybrought vnto a paled greene,And placed vnder stately canapee,The warlike feates of both those knights to see.On th'other side in all mens open vewDuessa placed is, and on a treeSans-foy his shield is hangd with bloudy hew:Both those the lawrell girlonds to the victor dew.In line one, \\"renowmed\\" just means \\"renowned,\\" and should be pronounced with three syllables: \\"re-nowm-ed,\\" not \\"renowm'd.\\" There is a difference.In line two, the knowledge that Spenser typically uses \\"i\\" for \\"j\\" and \\"u\\" for v\\" is all readers need to read \\"majesty\\" for \\"maiestie.\\" A passing acquaintance with Chaucer would help with line three, which features the Middle English prefix \\"y-\\" on \\"ybrought.\\"Line four: pronounce \\"placed\\" \\"plas-ed,\\" not \\"plazd\\"; and just remember \\"v\\" means \\"u\\" for \\"vnder.\\"Line five presents no problems.In line six, some readers might wonder why \\"the other\\" is contracted to \\"th'other.\\" Here, a basic knowledge of English prosody is necessary. If Spenser had said \\"On the other side in all men's open view,\\" he would have used eleven syllables, when his meter of choice, iambic pentameter, demands ten syllables. So he makes a contraction to stay within those ten syllables.In line eight, Spenser writes \\"hangd\\" for the same reason: to stay within the ten syllables of iambic pentameter. If he had said \\"hanged,\\" the sixteenth-century reader would have counted the syllables thus: \\"Sans-foy-his-shield-is-hang-ed-with-bloody-hue,\\" which is eleven. Bear in mind that words such as \\"shield\\" are one syllable (sheeld), words such as \\"beauteous\\" are two syllables (beautyus), and words such as \\"disobedience\\" are three syllables (dis-o-bed-yence) for the purposes of scanning verse.So much for Spenser's language. The content of the Faerie Queene might prove the greater barrier to the twenty-first century reader. If you don't like chivalry, knights, damsels in distress, hermits, and magicians, then you probably won't like the FQ. But if you are indeed blessed with a taste for \\"romance\\" in the old sense, then you should like Spenser. You might surprise yourself; a friend who doesn't read much old literature, and almost no poetry, read a few stanzas of the Faerie Queene and said she liked it. Granted, I don't know if she would have liked every bit of the entire thing. But in such a long poem, some parts will get boring. I loved Books I and II, didn't enjoy Book III as much, and then loved Books IV, V, and VI. Book V, with Artegall and his \\"Iron Man\\" who represents Justice, is quite good. And the Mutabilitie Cantos at the very end, as C.S. Lewis said, just might be \\"the finest thing in the whole work.\\" But beware: the storyline is very, very complex. I found myself scanning previous cantos to recapture the plot line, which I'd lost track of. Be prepared to lose track of what's going on, unless you have an excellent memory or are used to old literature and complex plots.Now for this particular edition. It's a very fat book (over 1,000 pages), and I wish it had been in two volumes (Penguin adopted that expedient in the Penguin Classics edition of Malory's Le Morte Darthur). Roche's text differs somewhat from A.C. Hamilton's standard edition of the Faerie Queene, but it's more than adequate for the non-scholarly reader. I found his notes extensive and very helpful. Spelling is barely modernized; Roche just changes the archaic long \\"s\\" to the modern one, leaving \\"v\\" for \\"u\\" (vnder) and \\"i\\" for \\"j\\" (maiestie) intact. Roche seems to be the best edition out there short of Hamilton, which costs about $55, and definitely the best for a first-timer. One recommendation: read Malory's Le Morte Darthur before the Faerie Queene. For one thing, if you don't like Malory, you probably won't like Spenser; and so reading Malory first could save you some time reading the FQ. If you do like Malory, then you probably will like Spenser; and reading Malory first accustoms you to knights and jousts and wizards and the typical machinery of Spenser. Also, knowing some Malory helps you catch some of Spenser's allusions to the Arthurian legend.I give five stars to the Faerie Queene itself because I happen to love it; not everyone will share my opinion. I give five stars to Roche's edition because it's the best out there short of Hamilton, which not everybody needs."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene (Book 1) (Bk. 1)","review":"EDMUND SPENSER : THE FAERIE QUEENE. Edited by A. C. Hamilton. 753 pp. Longman Annotated English Poets. London and New York : Longman, 1977 and Reissued.The Longman Annotated English Poets edition of 'The Faerie Queene' has been designed primarily for students and academics, but will appeal to anyone who is looking for an extensively annotated Spenser which gives maximum help with the language, historical allusions, symbolism, allegory, and much else besides. In other words, this is not so much a reader's edition of 'The Faerie Queene' as one for those engaged in an intensive and in-depth study.The pages are quarto sized (10 by 7.5 inches) and printed in double columns, with Spenser's text being given mainly in the left column, and the accompanying explanatory glosses and extensive and detailed notes given to the right. Hamilton's notes are, in every way, superb, and considerably enrich one's understanding of Spenser's subtle and highly allusive poem. The notes, however, are so extensive, that they can tend to interfere with one's enjoyment of the poem, as there is the constant temptation to glance to the right to read Hamilton's invariably interesting remarks.Unfortunately, presumably to reduce costs, Spenser's text was not reset, and what we have been given is a much-reduced and rather poor copy of the Oxford University Press edition of 'The Faerie Queene.' The result is a poorly printed text of the poem in a font as miniscule as that used for the sidenotes, and hence one that can be tiring to read. The text of the poem is preceded by Hamilton's informative General Introduction, and the book is rounded out with an extensive Selected Bibliography.Although less than desirable in visual terms, Hamilton's edition is superb in every other way, and definitely belongs on the bookshelves of all advanced students and Spenser enthusiasts. The general reader, however, would probably be far better off, certainly if new to Spenser, to start with the excellent Penguin English Poets edition, or even with the Norton Critical Edition of selections, details of which follow:THE FAERIE QUEENE. By Edmund Spenser. Edited by Thomas P. Roche, Jr with the assistance of C.

The Renaissance Version of the Faerie Queene is quite hard to read, and must be read over and over again before you can comprehend all the underlying themes and symbols. This edition, stated in modern English, makes the work so much more enjoyable and easy to understand. Not much is lost through this translation, and it has helped me greatly----especially for exams!"},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene (Book 1) (Bk. 1)","review":"The Faerie Queene is one of the great classics of Renaissance literature, and for very good reasons. Although it is difficult reading (and NO, contrary to another review here, it is NOT in OLD English! Look at the original version of Beowulf and you will see the difference), many of the tensions of the Renaissance, spiritually and philosophically, are masterfully renedered in these brilliant tales. Because its allegory is so rich, this book becomes even more enjoyable to reread, as connections between historical figures and literary history appear repeatedly. (I find something &quot;new&quot; each time I read it, it seems!) It is also a book about the role of the poet in society, and the manner in which Spenser uses allegory illustrates the complex relationship between the poet and his patron. In sum, while, as readers, we are always limited by our modern perspectives, I do think that reading Spenser is perhaps the best way to experience what it must have been like to be a Renaissance reader. Perhaps this is due to the didactic nature of Spenser's epic. In any event, it has forced me to explore more thoroughly the books and concepts to which Spenser refers repeatedly in The Faerie Queene. Furthermore, it has made my study of Shakespeare, Ariosto, Sidney, and other prominent Renaissance writers much more fruitful.But don't buy the trade paperback edition if you are serious about reading Spenser--buy the edition of The Faerie Queene that is edited by A.C. Hamilton. While it is more expensive, it is by far the best text available of Spenser's epic, and contains useful notes and introductions that will guide all students of Spenser to a greater understanding of the greatest epic poem of the Elizabethan Age."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene (Book 1) (Bk. 1)","review":"When the first line of Canto 1 reads \\"Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine\\", missing off the initial \\"A\\", I know something has gone wrong. So don't waste your money; the one good thing to say is that it's not the worst Faerie Queene out there."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene (Book 1) (Bk. 1)","review":"For those who are looking for an older take on series fantasy, look no further. The Faerie Queene is often praised for its beautiful use of language and for the fact that it was the first great epic written in the English language, but don't let that high and lofty praise scare you away! Someone who goes into it looking to be entertained won't be dissapointed, provided they're willing to work for it a little bit.At first, the archaic language can be a little difficult to understand, but I found that I very quickly adapted to it so that I was reading it nearly as quickly as I'd read a novel, and I wasn't having to look in the margins for the definitions of strange words. And then the story started to come alive! The Faerie Queene has it all -- knights, maidens in distress, maidens who kick butt (one of the hero knights, Britomart, is a woman and also a very capable warrior) evil wizards, dark temptresses, and monsters galore. Many villains recurr throughout the books, tormenting one knight and then another, so that when Duessa shows up for the upteenth time, you already know enough about her to be emotionally invested in seeing her defeated ;)I was surprised by how much character development the various characters showed, from Redcrosse's slow journey into spirituality to Artegall's gradual temperance of cold justice with mercy. Britomart's unrequited love for Artegall was genuinely moving.But what Spenser does best is description. He very quickly establishes scenes that are so clear and vivid that you'll be able to smell the air and see even the quality of the sunlight.All in all, I highly recommend this book. I was pretty sad when I got to the end, because I'm going to miss my nightly forays into Spenser's arcadian world. This is an extremely good book."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene (Book 1) (Bk. 1)","review":"I bought this book as a study guide to a course in Renaissance literature, and Spenser in particular. I have now found that it is incomplete! Canto II of Book II only has 11 verses out of 46! Moreover, Cantos 4, 5 and 6 of Book II are completely missing! It does say 'Selection' in the subtitle, I now realize, although it was not made clear in the original description. The volume is doing me little to no good for its intended purpose. I consider it a waste of time and a deception to leave out huge parts of a work you are purporting to present under its original title. I feel cheated. Why wasn't the title &quot;Bits and Pieces of The Faerie Queen&quot;??"},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene (Book 1) (Bk. 1)","review":"If you ignore the symbolism and focus on the surface elements, \\"The Faerie Queene,\\" a bulky mythological epic rendered in ornate baroque verse, almost seems like a sixteenth-century prototype of the campy swords-and-sorcery pulp of the past century. Thumbing through the pages invokes that particular aura of an ancient struggle against evil in a world of horrible monsters, brave warriors, clashing swords and spraying gore, shape-shifting wizards, fair ladies, and towering castles overlooking dreary fantasy landscapes. However, there must be more to it than just eye candy for Edmund Spenser to have been worthy of burial in Westminster Abbey; \\"The Faerie Queene,\\" like Virgil's Aeneid before it or Wagner's Ring cycle after, is a nationalistic and moralistic doctrine layered with religious and historical allusions that transcend its veneer of fabulous imagery.As explained in a letter to his peer Sir Walter Raleigh, Spenser's plan was to write twelve \\"books,\\" each containing twelve cantos and portraying a virtue from Aristotle's Ethics in the guise of a knight on a quest, the totality intended as a tribute to Queen Elizabeth, who in the epic is implied to be the Faerie Queene. Only six of the twelve books were completed: holiness, temperance, chastity, friendship, justice, and courtesy. The actions of the knights in their respective books are supposed to exemplify the specified virtues as proper behavior in the service of the Queene; conversely, vices such as envy, lust, and furor are represented as obstructors or monsters to be defeated by the knights. Stripped of its considerably gaudy window dressing, \\"The Faerie Queene\\" is a simple series of object lessons.The content is a strange, but not totally incongruous, amalgamation of legends from Greek and Egyptian mythology, the Crusades, Arthurian lore, Italian Renaissance poetry, and Spenser's own invention. As though they had emerged from a set of medieval \\"narrative\\" tapestries, the stories are dazzlingly intricate in plot and detail: The hero of the first book, the \\"Redcrosse Knight,\\" must rescue the parents of the princess Una (the Protestant Church) from a dragon (the Roman Catholic Church), aided by Arthur, here but a prince. The third book begins the story of Britomart, a lady who disguises herself as a knight in order to find Artegall, the knight of Justice in the fifth book, with whom she is enamored when she sees his image in a magic mirror. There are some interesting cross-references, such as the tale of King Lear and his three daughters mentioned in a history of England in the second book.Although English spelling was not conventionalized until dictionaries began to be compiled two centuries later, the poem's peculiar appearance is not representative of the typical writing of the late sixteenth century. The language, archaic even for Spenser's time, is designed to emulate Chaucer, then the standard English poet, in an attempt to conjure a medieval mood, a romanticized past. The misspellings are even intentionally inconsistent; for instance, \\"giant\\" is variably spelled Gyant or Geant or Gyaunt but never Giant. The idea, I think, is to signal to the reader that the poem should evoke the days when poems were more often spoken aloud than read, so what the words sound like is more important than what they look like; another clue to this is that Spenser is actually quite meticulous about the words he chooses to misspell.Glorification of a national heritage is a tall order, so who can blame the poet for his excesses? \\"The Faerie Queene,\\" a project distinguished by its sheer ambitiousness, is an intense reading experience that overwhelms its own flaws and difficulties."},{"Title":"The Faerie Queene (Book 1) (Bk. 1)","review":"This three CD set (ISBN: 962634377X, Naxos 2006) is not unabridged.

I also found it to be a helpful vocabulary book.Each \`day' introduces 10-20 words based on a specific theme or idea-sometimes, it is a group of words with similar roots (monologue, monogamy, etc.), sometimes it has words with opposite meanings, words are grouped by parts of speech.The chapters/days then spend a few pages reviewing those new words through various methods--the author's theory is that by forcing you to write down and select the words within a number of contexts, you will learn the words faster.Reviewers are correct that some words are used less often than they were in 1942, and one individual did not like the old practice of referring to generically to a doctor as \\"he\\" (by the way, all generic occupations/identifications were referred to as \\"he,\\" including negative connotations such as thief, prisoner, and used-car salesperson).This book is not a miracle--cure--don't toss out your high school GED just yet. Although you will learn a few scores of new words know how one goes about incorporating more, there is a long way to go.

Asceticism, at least in the realm of vocabulary, is a mortal sin that a true logophile should not hesitate to denounce.The organization of the book is worth heaping praises upon. Chapters, each of which should be finished in a day, are ordered thematically (eg Power Verbs and Foreign Words), that I personally found myself actually reading the book at whichever interesting chapter depending upon my particular inclination for that day. However, my advice should be taken with caution as the authors seemingly intended the book to be read in a particular order of progress. Well, tastes and aptitude may vary.The book begins with an initial assessment of vocabulary and general language skills already possessed. Subsequent chapters are also supplemented with exercises (which are accompanied by helpful hints themselves), and the book ends with a final assessment of success.At times the authors seem to be sermonizing on the values of the \\"American\\" language (as the authors call it), at times to be touting the importance of national linguistic pride, at times busily engaged in an exercise in Oprahesque you-can-do-it ad nauseam. As some reviewer(s) noted, the book has not been expurgated of the prejudices particularly prevalent at the time it was first written.Despite the flaws which all books are guilty of in some degree or another, Dr Wilfred Funk and Norman Lewis have shown the path towards a greater experience of this esoteric enteprise. A path that is delightfully fun, rewarding and entertaining; it is definitely worth every penny!"},{"Title":"30 days to a more powerful vocabulary","review":"My 7th grade English teacher used this book as a vocabulary builder when I was in school. I enjoyed the way the book was set up in categories, and, although it is not a &quot;modern&quot; self-help book with lots of learning tricks, its content and form were very usable.

The more I used it, the more I loved it. Now, I'm using it to teach vocabulary.Chapters are have brain-friendly titles. Definitions are worded clearly and simply.Visually, though, it needs updating. This book was first published before computerized typesetting and desperately needs visual modernization. If you're a confident reader, it's no big deal, but as a reluctant student of English, you might find the text-dense pages a bit mucky."},{"Title":"30 days to a more powerful vocabulary","review":"Of all of the resources I have used to improve my vocabulary for the GRE, 30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary is by far my favorite. The language is presented naturally and the exercises are expertly created. It is not a simple alphabetical list, but presents words in similar-use groups with varying exercises.My guess on wordcount is that there are about 500 higher-level words in Funk & Lewis's book. Some of them are not presented directly, but used in the chapter openings and closings, so expect to have a dictionary handy. You will also need a pen and paper - this is not a passive read. The authors state that you should expect to spend 15 minutes a day. Personally, I couldn't put it down and did two chapters a day for the first 15 chapters. After that, the content became significantly more challenging and I spent about 30 minutes a day, taking it one chapter a day.Although many useful words are presented in 30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary, its greatest asset is changing the way you think about words. Not only do you become more cognizant of specific words, but you learn how to analyze words and gain confidence in using new words. My spelling has improved significantly through this program as well. I will certainly revisit this book in another month and make sure I've integrated the words and techniques I've learned into my life.A quick note about the concerns of \\"misogynistic\\" material: you do yourself a disservice if you censor your own reading. This is a valuable resource. Truthfully as well, I think the authors aren't just anachronistic, but trying to dramatize the words, so that they'll stick better. (And I consider myself a fairly hard-core feminist!)I heartily agree with the reviewer who described this book as \\"a good start.\\" Certainly you won't get far if you read it and forget it, but it will guide and inspire you to make language study an integral facet of your life. I'm looking forward to reading more from these authors."},{"Title":"30 days to a more powerful vocabulary","review":"Despite advertising hype - 30 Days To -, no ONE book will double your vocabulary, but reading several vocabulary-building books can double your vocabulary. Different vocabulary-building books have different words and different explanations. If you don't learn a word from one book, you can learn it from another book.Any vocabulary-building book will have many words, a fourth to half the book, that you already understand. You can always skip or skim the easy-to-you words.Varied, incomplete word selection is another reason for using several books. Some books just take words used on past-standardized tests, neglecting other words. Other books, limit their words to words based on word roots, neglecting others. Often authors have thrown in personal favorite words, even if others rarely use the words. If you see a word in two or three books, it's generally a need-to-know word.The main weakness of 30 Days To A More Powerful Vocabulary, and no book is perfect, is the word selection. As one other reviwer noted: some of the definitions are dated. But the price is right and if you read several vocabulary-building books, you will not have a problem identifying the few dated words.Other Books: Cartoon/Mnemonic vocabulary books have their fans who like the mnemonic memory aids, which are useful before tests. But with only one word and one cartoon per page, these books may only have a few hundred words and are expensive on a per word learned basis.

It marks an attempt to reverse a long-prevailing view of a whole body of literature, the Sagas of the Icelanders. It is not easy reading; but it repays the effort it takes. It has been well received; there is even a Japanese translation of the book, along with Byock's later \\"Medieval Iceland.\\"I had been reading sagas in translation since the late 1960s, and on reading this book I had the distinct feeling that I had never quite understood them properly. Almost as if, say, I hadn't grasped the function of a jury in stylized accounts of trials, like \\"Perry Mason.\\" Or, more exactly, like missing the functions of lawyers. Byock is credited with a major breakthrough in making clear the essential role of the \\"advocate\\" in feud and resolution narratives.\\"Sagas of the Icelanders\\" is a category which is not identical to the larger group of Icelandic Sagas. They were all written in Old Icelandic / Old Norse, in a similar style, but the latter designation includes a wide range of topics, including the Kings of Norway, and a variety of heroes from the Migration Age, like Sigurd the Volsung, and Hrolf Kraki and the Skjoldung Dynasty of Denmark. (The Siegfried of the \\"Nibelungenlied\\" and Hrothulf the Scylding in \\"Beowulf,\\" respectively; Byock has, in fact, translated \\"The Saga of the Volsungs,\\" for the University of California Press and Penguin Classics, and \\"The Saga of King Hrolf Kraki,\\" for Penguin Classics.)When I was taking Icelandic Literature (in translation) at UCLA a decade before this book appeared, the reigning orthodoxy was to take the medieval sagas written in Iceland *about* Icelanders as primarily literary creations. They were fictions about events centuries before they were composed, to be enjoyed, certainly, but to be treated as sophisticated fictions. These works, written in a remarkably lean prose studded with poems of great complexity, give an immediate impression of gritty realism; farmers worry about hay supplies for the winter, large landowners maneuver to acquire more property, and minute details of legal procedure form turning points in lives.There is nothing like them in the rest of medieval European literature; whereas the Legendary sagas, and various obviously foreign materials (the *Riddara,* or chivalric, Sagas), are built up of stories of kings and warriors, or even knights on horseback (not a natural part of the Icelandic imagination). But from short works like \\"Hrafnkels Saga,\\" to the massive \\"Brennu-Njals Saga\\" (\\"The Story of Burnt Njal\\"), the Sagas of the Icelanders were to be approached as books of fiction, albeit fiction set in real landscapes, and with some historical personages in the cast of characters.This was a marked reaction to the one-time view of them as something more like nave reportage of actual events; and it acknowledged their sophistication as narratives, and the highly artistic nature of their seemingly artless prose. But it tended to block their use as evidence of Icelandic life in the Middle Ages; and to forestall attempts to interpret the sagas as self-representations of Icelandic experiences, aimed at ordinary people, instead of the product of elite literary culture, and reflecting foreign influences, albeit in a subtle manner. Never mind evidence that the expensive medieval manuscripts were regarded as treasures to be read aloud to ordinary, isolated, farming households, to entertain guests, or during the long winters. (Actually, the idea of a serialized reading of \\"Njal's Saga,\\" as a kind of radio soap opera, suggests that the periodic scandals and adventures were a good part of its original appeal.)Jesse Byock has taken a leading position in the rehabilitation of the sagas as historical evidence; not that he regards them as literally true -- although he has produced evidence for a startling level of accuracy in some overlooked or misunderstood details in some of them. Instead, he has tried to take them seriously as reflections of the stresses and social patterns of life on the island between the time of settlement (after 870 to around 930) and the late Middle Ages (before, say, the mid-fourteenth century, when some non-saga historical texts may have been redacted.\\"Feud in the Icelandic Saga\\" is an enormously impressive analysis of the recurring patterns of dispute, arbitration, and resolution or non-resolution, in the saga-literature. He does not take individual sagas as true-to-life accounts of specific events. Instead, he shows that the recurring patterns correspond to the expected stresses of life in a subsistence economy, unable to support a fully-developed state, and that the \\"purely literary\\" patterns are the sort of thing that medieval Icelanders would have recognized as both probable and instructive.Byock has returned to these issues many times since, in articles and books. \\"Medieval Iceland: Society, Sagas, and Power\\" (1988), also from the University of California Press, was more recently joined by \\"Viking Age Iceland\\" (2001), from Penguin. The two books return to some of the saga narratives analyzed in \\"Feud,\\" this time from broader perspectives that include the degradation of the Icelandic ecosystem in the centuries following the Settlement. (Unlike \\"Feud,\\" either could probably serve as an introduction to the saga literature; but \\"Viking Age Iceland\\" is probably by far the more approachable, and deals with issues, like the role of women, for which much evidence is from outside the saga literature.)\\"Feud,\\" however, still remains an impressive accomplishment. To my mind, it makes a convincing case for treating the saga-literature as \\"true\\" representations of medieval Iceland, albeit in a sociological, rather than a naively historical 'just-as-it-happened,\\" sense. And even for those who may want to reject the argument, the analyses of specific sagas are exceptionally clear and compelling -- at least to those of us who have puzzled over some of the stories."},{"Title":"Feud in the Icelandic Saga","review":"Feud in the Icelandic Sagastates in the introduction \\"It is impossible to understand the old Icelandic sagas without comprehending the function of feud in medieval Iceland.\\" Byock, the author, takes this premise and concentrates on feud in the family sagas and in the Sturlunga saga compilation and proceeds to show us how invasive his premise is in the context of Iceland's social, governmental and judicial structures.If you enjoy the Icelandic sagas as literature, you will find this academic study fascinating in how the Sagas have impacted the country's social foundations. You'll see how taking violence and channeling it into the sagas created a social structure which allowed a balance of power between families, warring factions, and the society as a whole.This is a book of literary criticism, but don't let the academic tone of it turn you off.

I had never forgotten it in all the years that have intervened.I am not exactly sure how things like this seem to happen, but recently I was struck with the idea of re-reading some of my \\"great books\\" from high school and early in my (now becoming long) life. Searching for this James Hilton masterpiece I discovered that it is celebrating it's 80th Birthday shortly, and also it's 50th anniversary with me! So, in honor of that \\"double\\" date, I promptly decided to immediately obtain another copy and re-read it. In my search here, I discovered this particular edition and decided upon it. It is reproduced from an original copy of the book, and also I note, in limited quantities of 250 copies at a printing.It is lovely to look at and to hold if you are like me, a hopeless old romantic! Reproduction of the original cover, and printed on ecru paper to have the look of an original, etc. The pages are, really, like looking at/reading an original edition. Beautifully produced and handsomely bound. Having been in the printing and publishing industry for my entire career, I truly appreciate efforts put in to reproduce grand old books, etc., for the pleasure of people today. It bespeaks the importance of certain items/pieces that this attention is placed thus to provide them for us in what today is pretty much a \\"throw-away-world\\" and gives us something more substantial to hold onto, or in our hands, as we read or re-read these works of importance to us.If you have never read this great book, I cannot recommend strongly enough that you do. It truly would be a shame should you not ever have had the pleasure of experiencing the words and message laid before one here in this book. If you have read it, you already know that which I speak of. However, have you ever tossed the idea about of a re-visit to Shangri-La as Conrad so desperately did?

I first read the book when I was a teen, so I remembered little about it. But, I have watched the film countless times, it being one of my favorites. And, as I completed the book this time, I discovered that experiencing both media at the same time that I had changed my view about books being turned into movies. By most generous comment about Hilton's book is to give him credit for something we may overlook. When my friends and I talk about reading books by Grishom or Baldacci (for example), we sometimes have trouble remembering one book from the other after time has passed. It's not that they're not wonderful books, but the authors today tend to write in one specific genre for most of their careers. But, like Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\", which you don't mistake for any other Dickens work, and which is unique in fiction, \\"Lost Horizon\\" is a book of Hilton's which you don't mistake for \\"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\\" or \\"Random Harvest\\"; or for that matter, its unique story isn't confused with any other author's work. Shangri La holds a unique status in fiction, and it belongs to Hilton for all time.And then you have the film version from Frank Capra in 1937. And here is where my thoughts have changed regarding to translating books into movies. We all know that sometimes it is done well, and sometimes it is a massacre. But I have begun to look at it as evolution in story telling. In my view, Capra changes, but actually improves upon Hilton's story telling. For example, in the Hilton book you get the impression that Conway is a COMPETENT, but MIDDLING person in the British diplomatic corps. So why would the head lama be so enthusiastic about him that he would kidnap an airplane full of people to bring him to Shangri La? Capra painted Conway as the marvel of the British diplomatic corps and explained that the head lama had read books by him and saw a likeness in thinking. That makes more sense in explaining why the kidnapping. Similarly, the book provides no love interest for Conway, while the film does...which gives Conway even more purpose in fighting the odds to return to Shangri La.That's why this is one of those situations in story telling where I suggest you read the book and watch the film...in that order. Both are true gems."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Hilton's Lost Horizon is often credited with being the origin of the Shangri-La myth, and indeed it is a compelling story. Written in the 1930s, the book is both a product of the turmoil and chaos created by the First World War and subsequent worldwide depression and anticipatory of the conflagration to come. Nestled in-between in both time and place is Shangri-La - an oasis of calm and \\"moderation\\" in a world of excess and fanaticism.Four people, the world weary Conway, his deputy Mallinson, a 1930s American Bernie Madoff named Barnard, and a missionary named Miss Brinklow, are kidnapped and flown high into the Himalayas. When their plane crashes they find themselves drawn into a secluded valley utopia where they find things aren't always what they seem.Hilton does a wonderful job describing the beauty of Tibet, and has a way of inspiring, through Conway's own recounting of his adventures, a sense of wanderlust. There were times when reading this that I found myself actually holding onto images of white-capped mountains and green florid valleys with incredible vividness and a growing desire to just be out of doors (this book would make excellent camping reading). There were moments of Western Eurocentrism, as to be expected of a 1930s novel that mainly centers on a British consul's adventures in areas of their far reaching empire, and occasionally the dismissive tone of the narrator toward native Tibetan society and culture were annoying. But, again, one has to remember the context of its construction, and at that, these attitudes become part of the story itself in it's theme of East vs. West. Many of the characters represent the dichotomies of those two cultures and Hilton consciously blends them to produce a utopian world in the valley in-between those two worlds. Shangri-La has running water and heated plumbing, combined with lonely solitude and contemplation reminiscent of a Buddhist monastery. It combines a feudal agricultural economy and authoritative political system, while simultaneously allowing for the absolute freedom of individuals living in the valley.Throughout, one gets a sense of a sad desire to avoid what Hilton can see on the Horizon: the Second World War - this is especially so once the lamas reveal what the purpose of Shangri-La actually is. Aside from all the social and cultural commentary the book provides, Lost Horizon is just a really fun mystery that reminds one of the old travel novels of the 19th and early 20th century, when there were still places to be explored and customs that seemed odd. It definitely was the perfect follow-up for Moloka'i and if anything has stoked my desire to read more good historical fiction.("},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Book was exactly like description! James Hilton is one of my all time favorite authors. Will purchase from this seller again. Great customer service!"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"\\"Lost Horizon\\" is widely considered to be one of (if not the) seminal science-fiction works. It speaks to the universal human desire to find utopia and live long enough to enjoy it. This is one of the rare books that I was semi-reading, reading a dozen or so pages a month, and became so involved when I reached the plot twist I immediately had to finish it.While I love the book, especially the massive twist in the middle, the ending leaves me wanting. Without giving away too much, while I like the open-ended quality, I found the plausibility of one of the main characters finding their ideal world and, with hardly a second thought, abandoning it almost on impulse rather remote. This left a sour taste in my mouth of what was otherwise an amazing book."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This novel was beautiful, almost more like a long poem than a novel because of its unhurried pace and evenness of plot. I enjoyed the part of the book when the four spent their time at Shangri-La the best....it was a very relaxing, yet mind-opening read. I only wish that Mr. Hilton had portrayed Conway's \\"new position\\" at the end of the novel, rather than having him exit in the manner he did.I don't want to spoil any of the outcome, but the ending was a bit brisk....I wanted to know more about the second chapter for Conway. Overall, though, an absolute must-read for any hard-core literature fan. It is easily devoured in one sitting...think of it as a 'deep tissue massage' for the mind - the depth and intricacy of the concepts hit you immediately, but the relaxation and peacefulness linger for a while."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Wars do strange things to those who fight them. The trenches of the First World War have left Conway, James Hilton's most memorable hero, feeling himself old long before his time. When he and three others being evacuated from the British consulate at Baskul find themselves kidnapped - flown to a Tibetan monastery, instead of to safety as they expected - he accepts the situation with an ease that infuriates his hero-worshipping young colleague, Mallinson. Conway takes easily to Shangri-La's life of isolated serenity. When he learns why he and his companions were brought to that remote and secret valley, he's not angry. Instead, he feels so oddly at home that only for love's sake will he leave....I first read \\"Lost Horizon\\" in Grade 8, and remembered it fondly enough to pick up a copy when it recently crossed my path again. I read everything else by James Hilton that I could find during the years between. Definitely, this book is a fine author's master work. Clear and beautiful prose, haunting themes, and - at the end - a twist that once you've read it seems inevitable.

Years later I re-read it, a little apprehensive that I would find it dated and contrived. It is neither. Lost Horizon is, quite simply, a triumph of the story-teller's art. A simple tale of idealistic faith in the human spirit, James Hilton's famous novel is crafted in unadorned, crystalline prose. It is, by turns, moving, mysterious, surprising and, ultimately, profoundly inspiring. Lost Horizon may not satisfy those too sophisticated to allow themselves to give in to its sentimental simplicity. But I highly recommend it to readers willing to suspend disbelief and to surrender to the wonder of a transporting fairy tale as they take a magical and unforgettable journey to the Valley of the Blue Moon. I am fifty-four years old now and Lost Horizon is still my favorite book."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Lost Horizon is the type of book which can change a person's life, or, at least give the reader some feeling of hope that things can be better and that, somewhere, there is a place where life is a continual joy and the people living there await the day when they can share the joy of life with a lost and dying world. In a way, the book is quite prophetic--the High Llama's dream of a world of continual war is a mirror of what would occur only a few years ahead. (And think about our own--a continual war against terror, lost jobs, and and a dying culture filled with violence and meaningless sex, and lies.) As one reads this novel, at least for me, I found myself wanting to try and find or, if possible, create a place that could be for me and my friends and family a Shangri-La. The book is not perfect, but its message is one necessary in our modern world and life. Pax."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Let me begin by saying I loved this book. I cannot say enough about how much I enjoyed reading it. The thing that is harder to nail down is why I loved this book. It has some of the typical elements I enjoy when reading a novel - engaging characters, a meaningful plot and an ending that leaves you with quite a bit to chew on. But I have read dozens if not hundreds of novels that fit that description and none of them seem to fit on the same plane as this book. I think the thing that struck me the most was how this book captured the sense that there is something wrong with this world, it does not function as it was intended to. The wars, the poverty, the pain, the suffering, all of them part of the everyday world that surrounds us (unless you live in a bubble and simply choose to ignore them), yet it always feels like there has to be a better way. This is expressed so clearly in the driving force behind establishing the monastery of Shangri-La, to preserve the great works of man, and man itself even, from man and the path of destruction he seems to be on. That way when the wars have finally wiped out all we have ever done (and maybe mankind along with it) there will be a preserve, untouched and intact, to begin anew. Ah the thought of beginning anew, without the flaws, without the problems. What person has not wished for that, yearned for it even? I think that is why this novel touched my soul. It so beautifully expressed how man longs for Heaven, though few would label it as such. The common longing is expressed here and Hilton's answer seems to be that of man's salvation brought about by man which is fascinating to compare and ultimately contrast this against my own views of who will bring salvation to man, ChristI loved this book."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I think the first thing that struck me was how timeless this story is, the search for a personal utopia, the subtle morality, the ideal of moderation. The quotes struck me as so appropriate for the modern age, even though the book was written in 1933. \\"laziness in doing stupid things is quite a virtue.\\" \\"Time enough for everything\\" and the ever popular \\"the meek shall inherit the world,\\" an old time biblical favorite. The book is charming and elegant, about a magical place for everyone."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"What a beautiful and wondrous book! I was completely captivated by the mysteries of Shangri-la. Our hero Conway's adventure was an awe-inspiring tale of a monastery hidden deep in a Tibetan mountain range, where the lamas lead extraordinary existences. Theirs are privileged lives steeped in wisdom and secrecy. Their isolation and longevity allows them a unique position in the world and very few outsiders are privy to their secrets. Hilton's use of the high lama's telepathy is certainly prophetic, considering the book was written prior to World War II.Lost Horizon was a great adventure story as well as a picture of an ideal society. Hilton's dream on utopia was brilliantly written and enchanting."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I first read LOST HORIZON many years ago, after I'd seen the film (which, frankly, rather ruins the tale for me, but not enough to destroy the pleasure in reading it). When on a trip to China, staying in the Xian Shangri-La Hotel and having run out of my own books, I picked up their copy (a very nice little hard-cover available for sale at the Horizon Club).It was a joy to be transported back in time... when the British Empire was slowly collapsing and world-weary consul, Conrad, is escaping a revolution with 3 others (an American, a missionary and a junior diplomat) when their plane is mysteriously hi-jacked. They find themselves crash-landing with a soon-deceased pilot somewhere in the Himalayas and are rescued by a party of Tibetans carrying an aged Chinese man. He leads them to Shangri-La--a lammasery beneath a high moutain, above a particularly lush, cultivated valley.Shangri-La has become a sort of archetype for hidden/lost utopian societies. The echoes of this book are discernible in many latter works. But here is the original (or one of the originals, since Shangri-La itself is naturally based on previous ideas). Hilton's work is spare, but still magical, depicting a time of turmoil, just before the death and destruction of the Second World War. Conrad, the hero who is not a hero, has lived through WWI and it has both taken something from him... and given him something--something that seems to culminate in his finding peace and wisdom and himself at Shangri-La. But can modern man truly find peace? Or will the world and its madness be a call that's too strong to ignore?Visit Shangri-La and see for yourself!"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I read this book because quite a few Lost fans believe the series is based on this book. I thought the book was a quick read and interesting. I could see the parallels with the series. I did get some insight but I also believe there are numerous references in the series to other story lines - like Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead. If you are a Lost fan I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This book is written so well. The author describes the people and the scenery wonderfully. I really enjoyed reading this book and getting involved with the story the author was telling. I started reading this book for several reasons. First, I read a list of the best Novels of all time and this was in the top ten. Second I read an interview in the magazine section of the Sunday, New York Times several months ago. The interviewer asked Donna E. Shalala (served as Secretary of Health and Human Services in Pres. Clinton's cabinet) what was her favorite book and she said James Hilton's Lost Horizon. I then decided I had to read it. I read the book with crib notes with me, so I wouldn't miss any symbolism, but you don't need the crib notes to understand the book. Get the book and read it, jump into the experience; Shangri-la is not far away."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This story is about a young man named Conway. Through past experiences and actions became a legend. He and three others have been kidnapped and brought to Buddhist monastery in the Tibetan Plateau. They are at first unwilling to stay at the valley of the blue moon, but they have no choice. Throughout the story Conway learns the history of the valley and it's high lama. The high lama has left Conway with an imperative choice. He bestowed upon Conway the future of Shangri-La, and Conway must choose between loyalty to the high lama or loyalty to his companion Mallison.This story is what originally began my interest in the oriental cultures, and also my interest in classic literature. It was entertaining to read because of the style in which it was writ. The tradition shown by the lamas, the moderation shown by them began the learning of these cultures that I have taken upon myself. Also how the high lama's explanation of Shangri-La was not vague nor was it in depth. The respect shown to the high lama by the people has also contributed to the code of behavior I now follow. I enjoyed this book because it was entertaining and educational."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I saw the film at a young age.

Loved every word of it &amp; would recommend this to anyone who loves exotic places."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This is an excellent novel by James Hilton.There is something sepcial about the way he writes and the way he describes his characters. His unique way of writing leaves you suspended and awed. At the conclusion you do not know what to believe. I think everyone should read it, it's an excellent book."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect upon first reading Lost Horizon. I thought that since it invovled a group of people stranded in some uncharted land, that it wouldn't be anything unique.However, I was pleasantly surprised. As the story unfolds, the passengers of the plane discover that their pilot is in fact not the one they had originally hired. As a result, they end up at some strange destination far from where they had planned.As the weeks pass, however, the main character secretly learns from one of the head monks that it is very unlikely a transport will actually come to the area anytime soon. Eventually the rest of the group learns of this, but only one of them really finds it bothersome. The rest have found the new land very comfortable and heaven-like. The character who wishes to leave for home in America actually falls in love with a young native woman who lives at the monastary (she appears to the be the only female in the area). In the end, they both manage to return to America, and the rest of the group remain, in love with their new home.Although Lost Horizon is not the same genre I am usually interested in, I must say that it was a very pleasing read. James Hilton describes the landscape beautifully as if you were actually there. He causes the reader to take a step back from the fast pace of contemporary life as he brings to life an environment of true serenity and happiness.I recommend Lost Horizon to those that appreciate intelligent writing as this novel is bursting with it. It should be required reading for all English and philosophy classes."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I am a chinese reader, I hope to know the life story, the booklist of Jemas.

He had been interested enough in the story to prepare a manuscript. Conway, Mallinson, and Barnard were in an airplane headed for Peshawar, but going in the wrong direction. They had left Baskul, Persia. In their company was a missionary, Miss Brinklow. Miss Brinklow used to belong to the LMS, London Missionary Society, but she disagreed about infant baptism. The plane landed. The pilot was unconscious and died that evening. Everyone but Conway was affected by the altitude and it was cold. Part of Conway, (his record at school had been brilliant), was always an onlooker.A robed figure emerged from the lamasery of Shangri-La. The name of the mountain was Karakul, twenty eight thousand feet high. Conway surmised they were in Tibet. He knew very little Tibetan. Chair-bearers transported the members of the party to shelter. The atmosphere of the lamasery was Chinese rather than specifically Tibetan. (Conway was to find out later that the religion practiced was a mixture of Buddhism and Christianity.) There were about fifty lamas present and others who had not completed their studies, including the guide, Chang. Some of the lamas were neither Chinese not Tibetan.Mallinson, only twenty four years old, wants the party's return journey to be arranged right away. Conway senses that their arrival had been expected by the inhabitants. The puzzle of their arrival at Shangri-La begins to fascinate Conway. It is deemed by the guide that it is unlikely anyone from the outside world would be visiting Shangri-La to carry supplies to the community sooner than two months hence. Miss Brinklow and the American, Barnard, do not consider staying at Shangri-La for two months a hardship. Conway is used to service in exotic places, but the situation for Mallinson is difficult.The lamasery has collections of books and art of China and Tibet. It is discovered that Barnard is traveling on a forged passport and is wanted by the authorities. Chang advises Conway excitedly that the High Lama has agreed to see Conway which is contrary to usual practice and is obviously a great honor. It seems that for thirty eight years there was a Christian mission in Lhasa.Conway learns the members of their party are supposed to stay forever. The place is known as the valley of the Blue Moon. The lamas are ageless. In the end Conway sees the High Lama on a number of occasions and learns he has been designated the successor. Barnard, having worked as a mining engineer, ascertains that the place is a gold mine. Mallinson and Conway are determined to leave and, thus, Conway becomes the subject of the traveler's tale compiled by Rutherford."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"There wasn't much of a plot in this book. Nothing exciting happens, and nothing is deffinate. There isn't much of an ending either.. the only reason i kept reading it was because i liked the size of the book.. heh"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"&quot;Lost Horizon&quot; is definitely not the best book I have ever read. It starts out with four men talking about different things when they come to the conclusion that they all know Hugh Conway, who was kidnapped along with three others. Their plane crashes in the mountains, and they are rescued and taken to a place called Shangri-La. Here they experience a lot of peace because Shangri-La is away from the ongoing war. Many things happen, and Conway along with one of the others decides to leave. This is the way the book ends, except for the Epilouge where Rutherford again talks about Conway and tries to figure out where he is. This book is definitely for those who like weird things. It was not the best book for my tastes."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I had to read this book for a book report and found it difficult to follow.

It's not hard to read, but it is terribly boring. I finally trudged through it. The last 2 chapters were the best, most interesting for me. It leaves the reader wondering what happens to the characters. It felt like a book I would have to read for school and write a report, or have a discussion about it.The other members of my club seemed to like it o.k., but I couldn't bring myself to stir up any happy feelings for it.

I invested a goodly fifty pages without noting the first scintilla of action or intrigue, although I did suffer through reference after reference to 1920s practices and customs at Oxford--couched in impenetrable Edwardian slang. I had absolutely no idea what was going on, other than that I was bored witless."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon and read this novel.

As much as he seems to want to live and let live, he is simply applying Western imperialistic thought in a Eastern setting... so really as much as he wants to escape imperialism, he takes over this imperialistic ruled society--- remember he sucedes a Belgian priest. Aside from this, the whole story is about avoiding conflict at almost any cost--- personally, without this conflict how does one know she is alive? Alas, I found the character of Hugh passionless on the whole and felt sorry for nothing drove him really.... except, and here's the irony, his determination and passion at the end is finally seen when he trecks back on a quest to find that Shrangri-la he left behind.

I am still moved by the subtle use of music to convey information, and as distressed as ever by the tensions between Eastern and Western thought. The ending was heartbreaking for a 12 year old girl...the suggestion that you really can not have it all, that decisions need to be made and sometimes compromises. In fact, I still find that heartbreaking.For a similarly intriguing adventure, try Islandia by Austing Tappen Wright.And, as an alternate take on Shangri-la, try the Arthur C. Clarke short story, &quot;The 10 Billion Names of God.&quot;"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"My goal was to re-read this classic book and be able to do it again at some future time. I certainly achieved that goal thanks to Amazon's availability."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This story is a must read, one of the classic fiction tales of an unfamiliar and enigmatic place."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Hilton's story of the struggle between the real world and utopia is sure give you a pleasing read. The story opens as four Westerners flee from Baskul to avoid a oncoming war. Soon they find themselves highjacked and deposited by the valley of the blue moon also known as Shangri la. The story line then follows the lead character (Conway) and the supporting characters as they struggle to understand the valley, their place in the world and ultimately they must decide to either stay in the valley or return the outside world. Obviously written for the pre-WWII generation Hilton brings to the front the philosophical ideas of peace and warnings of \\"man's upcoming struggle that will eventually destroy civilization\\".The story line is dated and one can, at times, question it's political correctness but it's a good, quick read for anyone interested in religion and spiritual matters. I saw the movie years ago and liked it. After reading the book I would have to say that I like the book more."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"How convenient that Shangri-la has so much gold that it can afford bringing in extravagant outside goods like the bathtubs from Ohio. Apart from that obvious weakness in the plot, though, this is still a pleasant book, and the reason Hilton gives us for Shangri-la's existence -- a refuge for civilization during the next war -- is a haunting one considering the book's being written so close to World War II, and then doubly haunting considering its eventual nullification by the atom bomb (whose effects could reach Shangri-la and destroy it along with the rest of the world). The novel is somewhat long on talk and short on action, and all but the main character are too one-dimensional (hence I must downgrade to a &quot;6&quot;), but you're still better off reading it than not. Certainly beats the heck out of &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot; and its like, both in content and delivery."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"A very diverse group of four people is attempting to leave war torn Afghanistan in 1933 when their plane is suddenly hijacked and taken to a remote Himalayan monastery . The carefully hidden monastery is an incredible Shangra-la, but some of them are unwilling to accept paradise, and a plot to escape is quickly collaborated. Escaping and trying to survive in an unknown land is a great adventure story by itself, and Milton's choice of characters shows a great understanding and disappointment for human kind as a whole. But some of the characters rise above this abyss and demonstrate a great optimism, and a chance for a tattered war torn world to survive. This book is an all time classic, and shows that the state of the world hasn't really changed in 75 years. The story of the hijacked plane is carefully hidden from the mainstream press, and the friends of the hostages are left to wonder what has happened to their friends.Dancing on the Edge of an Endangered Planet"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"The hullabaloo surrounding the book will lead one to believe that this is an epitome of all adventure/suspense stories. In reality, the book is nothing but a wanderings of a disturbed mind, disillusioned with life and suffering from abnormalities of mind - so common among soldiers after attending a bloody war. Those readers who praise the book sky-high must have some ulterior motive in mind; otherwise this is a shoddy piece of work and written obviously with a film script in mind rather than a book, which anyways what Hilton was, scriptwriter in Hollywood! His other tiny book Goodbye Mr. Chips is a better read and doesn't pretend to be something else or is it we who label a book. No wonder Lost Horizon is out of print and should remain so. I don't blame the writer as much as the so-called critics, readers and other writers for whom the world begins in Western Europe and ends in North America.

It is the story of a man in the early twentieth century looking for more to life than what he has. Oh, he's got the good pay, the prestige, the job, yet he is unfulfilled. he is not happy. He has a \\"full\\" life, but it a meaningless life to him. He doesn't feel like he's actually accomplished anything. So, he and three others are captured and taken to unknown territories. Mallinson is, I think, kind of our everyman character and to a slight degree Conway's conscience. He is also the one who cannot seem to find peace in Shangri-la, a place of idyllic peace and beauty. He needs the loudness of \\"modern life\\", whereas Conway seems to have found what he is looking for, ie, the simple life and a purpose for life. His life didn't seem to make sense before arriving, but it now seems to make perfect sense. Where Mallinson sees purgatory or hell, Conway sees heaven. So, in the end, why does he leave? I think he felt a certain responsibility to Mallinson. I think he figures if he can get Mallinson home safely he can go back. I do like the vague ending. You don't know for sure Conway got back. You don't know if the lamas had a \\"Plan B\\" to account for maybe Conway leaving. I think he made it back; of course I am a bit of a sucker for a happy ending. There is a definite eastern philosophy slant, which I am all right with, as I am into the subject. Maybe that's part of the reason I like it.One can have their own opinion as to how the story is told, but the story itself is a good one. It is relatively quick reading as well. If you need explosions three times a page, or lots of action, this isn't for you. Not that it's actionless, it just isn't necessarily typical \\"action/adventure.\\" It was a thoroughly enjoyable read for me though."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"There is nothing to be quick about except buying this book, reading it, selling the car, selling the house, selling the kids, and going to look for Shangri-la.

Not until I go back there."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This book is one of the best I have ever read. There is, between its pages, a world of solace and hope depicted as delicately and expertly as a haiku. The only unfortunate thing about it is that we cannot literally travel to Hilton's Shangri-La."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Lost Horizon is a very introspective book. Metaphors abound perhaps, but what I'm inclined to take from the book each time I read it are the questions asked. Questions of purpose and what it all means. It's very thought provoking without being tendentious.Stylistically, Hilton is economical, but very capably sets a mood that permeates the entire narrative whether in describing the landscape or the more subtle aspects of the different characters. For me, the mood is one of relaxed contemplation.In another context, it's a wonderful travel book. It takes the reader to a faraway place and implicitly invites him to make choices and contemplate weighty issues in this most unlikely of settings.Lost Horizon is not a literary masterpiece, but it's a good story and very clever in its presentation."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"A wonderful, suspenseful, beautiful book -- not afraid to be idealistic AND clear-eyed.

It is a mysterious and spiritual tale that will keep you reading until the end. However, I was disappointed that in the prologue, the basic ending was revealed.

However, in the lamastary of Shangri-la, issues arise as newcomers must determine whether to trust those who promise such a life and whether giving up what we have in the outside world is a fair tradeoff for the blissfull life at Shangri-la. On one level, &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; is escapist fantasy. On another level, it is highly thought provoking."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"The story of a group of people who survive an airplane crash in Tibet and find shelter at a mysterious monastery is extremely well known, but unlike most novels, Lost Horizon is less about its characters and their siutation--interesting though those elements may be--than it is about their thoughts and ideas. Written as it was on eve of World War II, these thoughts and ideas center upon developing a way of life that preserves, rather than destroys, that which is finest in both humanity and the world in general.The novel is elegantly and simply written and possesses tremendous atmosphere. Although enjoyable as a purely &quot;fun&quot; read, it is also thought provoking, and the thoughts it provokes linger long after the book is laid aside. I can not imagine any one not being moved by the book, both emotionally and intellectually, regardless of their background or interests. If such a person exists, I do not think I would care to meet them.Although James Hilton wrote a number of worthy novels, Lost Horizon is the novel for which he is best remembered, a great popular success when first published and a genuine masterpiece of 20th Century literature."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"When I was a teenager, I went to see the movie Lost Horizon seven times. During my 74 years, I read the book many times. After I retired, I made four trips to that part of the world, and spent many months each time searching for that wonderful Shangri-La dream. If you have never read Hilton's classic, and you are a person with an optimistic spiritual outlook, then The Lost Horizon is a must for you. If you read it and want to believe it, then you should visit Burma and the temples of the ancient city of Pagon, and then spend time in the three kingdoms of the Himalayas: Nepal, Ladakh and Bhutan, in that order. You will be moved to tell others, or write about your spiritual experience. I was so moved. May your days be filled with the magic of life. Sirrom"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"What struck me most about this book is how non-dated it was for having been written in 1933. First of all, the story starts in Afghanistan during an airlift to evacuate foreign nationals during an anti-western revolution. Next, the main characters are essentially skyjacked to an unknown destination against their will for unknown purposes. As for the characters, they seem very familiar and contemporary also: a world-weary and burned-out government bureaucrat, a gung-ho and impatient young military officer, a business man that has stolen over 100 million dollars from investors through stock fraud, and a fundamentalist Christian missionary that believes in one \\"true\\" religion and holds all others in contempt. There is also the conviction among several of these characters that globally \\"the whole game's going to pieces.\\"However, there is also something hauntingly timeless about this story. It occurs to me that the hidden civilization of Shangri-La is based on the mythical kingdom of Shambhala, where immortal masters live that look after the evolution and welfare of mankind. The great mountain of Karacul that looms over the valley also seems symbolic of Mt. Meru- the axis of the cosmos- and where the gods are reputed to dwell. It is certainly no coincidence that most of the people that find Shangri-La are the world weary- and the journey comes close to killing them. That would seem to be a metaphor for spiritual enlightenment. For this is what the lucky and the worthy find in Shangri-La, all the time in the world, or rather out of the world, for contemplation, preservation of all the worthy attainments of the human race, and the pursuit of wisdom. Sounds pretty close to heaven to me....An interesting side note is the fact that _Lost Horizon_ was the first paperback title ever published by Pocket Books in 1939. This particular edition bears the same classic cover art as the original."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"When I read this book, I was transformed! I could actually breath the fresh, cold, Himalayan air that Conway and his entourage and the people of Shangri-La breathed. The language the novel is written in is beautiful and picturesque.When Conway and his companions flee the warring land they come from, (in a way) they find themselves hijacked, whisked away to paradise: Shangri-La, a place where the air is clean and the living is natural and spiritual and, &quot;moderate.&quot; Where people live naturally long lives, hundreds of years, in peace, in love, at one with nature. Hilton's book wisely illustrates that some can never be happy in paradise, they must go on and on searching, but too incredulous to ever actually find anything. In Shangri-La the people, the good, natural people await the destruction of the &quot;outside world,&quot; which will surely occur at it's own hand sooner or later as long as people rule themselves with war, lack of moderation, hatred, and a lack of regard for the spiritual nature of humanity. Then the people of Shangri-La will spread the paradise to the far reaches of earth. No doubt, James Hilton has read not only the Bible, but many other spiritual books, because I find myself thinking of Buddism, Judaism, Christianity (as opposed to Christendom), Hinduism, and other Eastern religions and forms of spirituality and well as Western religion and forms of spirituality. What an inspiring view.The &quot;outside&quot; world will eventually destroy itself if humanity continues on the road of &quot;unintelligent leadership,&quot; war, hatred, discrimination, excess, selfishness, lack of moderation, lack of respect and care for nature, lack of conservation, lack of respect for self, and lack of respect and care for other human beings and all our fellow animals.

The story is about four individuals' unplanned trip to the mysterious Shangri-La, located in an isolated location in Tibet. Shangri-La is a place where people live stress free and in moderation. This novel, written in 1933, is highly readible and moves quickly. This wistful tale poses many questions such as &quot;is it better to live stress free with time on our hands or to live in the modern world with it's material opportunities?&quot; Another question is &quot;do we believe things based on trust and hope or solely based upon the credible evidence?&quot; A third question might be, &quot;is moderation in a happy, stress free situation better than a world where we feel great passions but also endure periods of unhappiness?&quot; This wonderful tale is a great antidote to the stress of the modern world."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"When we were kids, our grandparents used to take us to Radio City Music Hall for the movie and Christmas Pageant every year. The year I was 12, the movie was a remake of Lost Horizon--my most graphic memory from that night is my horror when the woman suddenly aged after leaving Shangri-La. As it turns out, that version of the movie is pretty dreadful, while Frank Capra's 1937 original is widely considered to be a classic. At any rate, I liked the film enough to read the book and also Hilton's other classic, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, and I loved them both. Recently, our library got a restored edition of the Capra film and we enjoyed it thoroughly. So I went back &amp; reread the books.I assume most folks know at least the rough outlines of the stories. In Lost Horizon, Hugh Conway, a British diplomat, is skyjacked and he &amp; his traveling companions end up in the Himalayas. Eventually they are lead to the hidden Valley of the Blue Moon and the city of Shangri-La, where folks do not age and the powers that be are collecting all of the world's knowledge and greatest artworks, so that it will be safe from the turbulent political storms of the outside world. Eventually, the high lama reveals to the diplomat that he has been chosen to take over leadership of Shangri-La and after an abortive attempt to leave (at the insistence of one of his fellow travelers), Conway returns to assume his destined place in Shangri-La.Good-bye, Mr. Chips, on the other hand, is about an eccentric but lovable British schoolmaster, Arthur Chipping (Mr. Chips). Seemingly destined to be a bachelor for life, he meets and marries a young woman who loosens him up quite a bit, before dying in childbirth. Chips is left alone, except that is for the succeeding generations of boys who pass through Brookfield School. After decades at the school, he retires, telling the assembled alumni, &quot;I have thousands of faces in my mind. ... I remember you as you are. That's the point. In my mind you never grow old at all&quot;, only to be called back during WWI, at which point he becomes acting headmaster. One of his duties is to read the list of the school's war dead; for everyone else they are just names, but for Chips, each name has a face attached. After the War he reretires, after 42 years teaching Roman History and Latin at Brookfield.On the surface, these two stories couldn't be more different, but reading them now I realize how similar they actually are. Shangri-La is an oasis of civilzation in a world that was after all between two World Wars. It is a place where the great achievements of our culture will be preserved, even if war consumes the rest of the World, which for much of this Century seemed like a possibility. Mr. Chips, meanwhile, is the living embodiment of institutional memory. The classes of boys, the teachers and headmasters, even the subjects and teaching methods, come and go, but Chips has remained throughout. He &quot;still had those ideas of dignity and generosity that a frantic world was forgetting.&quot; He embodies the pre-War world and its values. In his book Mr. Bligh's Bad Language, Greg Dening says that: &quot;Institutions require memory. A memory creates precedent and order.&quot; In the very midst of an epoch that was witnessing an unfettered attack on all of the West's institutions and values, Hilton created Shangri-La and Mr. Chips; both represent the conservative ideal--providing a bridge of memory to all that is beautiful and good and decent in our past, lest, in our zeal to create a perfect world, we forget the qualities and accomplishments which bequeathed us the pretty good world in which we live.These books are unabashedly sentimental and I'm sure some would even find them mawkish. But I love them and I appreciate the subtley non-political way in which they make the most important of political points: even as we move forward we must always preserve those things and ideas of value in our past.Mr. Chips GRADE: A+Lost Horizon GRADE: A"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"The Lost Horizon, by James Hilton, is possibly the best book that I have read in the past year. Published in 1933, it remains relevent and provocative to this day.The Lost Horizon, much like Catch-22, is part of an elite group of books whose name or central characters have become a permanent part of the English vocabulary. In this book, this was done with Shangri-La, the land high in the mountains of Tibet where a group of worldly men and women stumble upon a valley of mystery and matchless beauty. A quick search on dictionary.com reveals that it means1. An imaginary remote paradise on earth; utopia.2. A distant and secluded hideaway, usually of great beauty and peacefulness.While the term Shangri-La is famous, the book is not nearly as wide-known or wide-read in recent years. Countless books by countless authors depicting utopia have been published, but only a couple has grabbed the attention of and lingered in the imagination of the public long after its initial publish. So what is special about Shangri-La, the valley of the Blue Moon? Read to find out.I could not put this book down. I had an mid-term exam the next day, but I stayed up to read the book past midnight. The basic plot of the book can be found by a simple glimpse of the editorial write-up on this site. The actions are fast-paced, the characters intriguing in their peculiarities. Yet this book has a philosophical edge that distinguishes it from a mere thriller. The true center of the book is ideas and thoughts rather than actions. Much thinking is done by the characters, trapped in the monastery of Shangri-La by the mountains and the snow. When Mallinson, the hot-blooded young captain who is desperate to get out of Shangri-La and return to Britain, snaps 'Well, if you happen to like prison,' to Barnard who was observing the beauty of the landscape, Barnard remarks that 'My goodness, if you think of all the folks in the world who'd give all they've got to be out of the racket and in a place like this, only they can't get out! Are we in the prison or are they?'In Shangri-La, the appreciation of beauty and the pursuit of wisdom is valued above all else. Rejecting the virtues of hard work and ambition, they adopted a philosophy of moderation in all things, 'avoiding excess of all kinds - even excess of virtue itself.' The author, Hilton, was not merely creating entertainment (although this he does) in this book. He was concerned about the future of England and all mannkind. Written after the aftermass of the destruction of the WW1, and the whole of western world being driven to a state of pessimism and despair by the worldwide economic condition, Hilton was concerned with another dark cloud that gathered on the horizon, namely the first signs of WW2. The lamesery of Shangri-La was imagined to be a living, breathing time capsule designed to salvage a gentle, civilized way of life from the destruction Hilton sensed had been unleashed by the Great War. Above all Hilton hated wars, which had the potential to 'destroy the fragile beauty and learning, accumulated over centuries of humanity, in the matter of a second.' With the invention of the atomic bomb after his time, this could now literaly come true. Out of the barbarism of the war rose Shangri-La, even if only in the imagination. In an age where the Western and the non-Western world alike engage in meaningless wars and acts of terror, this book is more relevant than ever in this century than ever before.Buy this book and read this book. The 7 bucks or so that you pay for it is more than worth the price of admission into Shangri-La."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"In the depths of the worldwide economic depression as the war drumbeats began in Germany, James Hilton wrote a quirky, imaginative book about the potential to escape the harsh reality. In so doing, he caused each reader since then to wonder what the right balance of tranquility and challenge really is. Like the best books about possible utopias, Lost Horizon leaves much to the reader's imagination. Undoubtedly, you will conjure up solutions to the riddles left open by the author that will be especially pleasing to you.Although the book is clearly set in the 30's with a British perspective, many of the themes struck me as universal. As the book opens, there's an intriguing prologue that sets just the right tone for the story. You are to read a manuscript about the experiences of one Hugh &quot;Glory&quot; Conway, H.M. consul. The manuscript opens with airplane hijacking that seemed all too realistic. Quickly, the hijacking turns into a surprising adventure as the passengers unexpectedly arrive in a little known part of Tibet and are escorted to Shangri-La, a lamasery sitting atop a hidden valley of peace and tranquility. While there, they await an opportunity to arrange passage with the bearers who are bringing a shipment that is expected in 60 days. Conway, however, learns the secrets of Shangri-La and finds himself faced with an extraordinary set of choices.To me, Shangri-La is a metaphor for the mental tranquility that many spiritual practices can bring. For anyone who has enjoyed these practices, you will know that it can be tempting to withdraw totally into them. To do so can be delicious, especially for the frazzled soul. At the same time, we are made of flesh, blood and boil with emotions that seek their venting through action. How can the two instincts be reconciled? You are left to come to your own conclusions, and that's one of the great beauties of this fine book.The book has several weaknesses that will bother most readers. Except for Conway, the character development is minimal. The book is too conveniently filled with people in Tibet who speak perfect English. Morality is held a little bit too much in suspense for the book to be as spiritual as it had the potential to be. There's a heavy overlay of British Empire perspective that will seem remote to current readers as well.The ideal reader for this book is someone who enjoyed Butler's Erewhon or H.G. Wells's The Time Machine.I was left thinking that we each need our own personal Shangri-La today more than ever. May you find a way to carry it with you!"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Since Heinrich Harrer's &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; (based on author's true story) and &quot;Return to Tibet&quot;, I had caught myself in a reading spree on everything related to Tibet, whether fiction or non-fiction. Tehn I came across James Hilton's &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;. I had to admit that the book caught my attention with an engaging plot that four people brought against their will to mysterious Shangri-La, set in the hidden mountains of the Blue Moon, a place where nobody ages. The mysterious and suspending plot is what makes this Hawthornden Prize-winning novel catchy and was made into motion pictures several times.Despite the splendidly written text, the storyline itself was not developed very extensively.

Adapted here in film, it is a wonderful vehicle for beautiful images of Jane Wyatt, and Ronald Colman. Filmed against an early version of architectural and landscape modernism, it also has the earmark grand processionals with torch lighting seen only in movies by De Mille and the remarkable conclusion of Disney's Fantasia. The setting of Shangri-La, not in the all too familiar computer reconstruction of today, but in the grand style of bygone stage sets, reminds us of early influences of modernist architecture. The Cranbrook Academy styles of early architects and designers, the graphic lines of Mies van der Rohe, and the ornamentalism of Edward Durrell Stone, combined with interior design including arts of ancient Eastern, Asian cultures make for graphically beautiful mise en scene of the inaccessible and remote dream of Shangri-La.An ideal society rich in inner spiritual growth rather than dogmatic religion and government, it is self-sustaining, save only for supplies from the outside. Smitten with the atmosphere of luxurious idealism where all have a share of beauty, destitute survivors of a plane crash in the mountains of Tibet come to it's mysterious tiny entrance in one of the most wildly remote parts of the world only to find out who they really are. The revelations in this tiny pocket of beauty reminds of all the escapism with which we might all be longing for today amidst a world of ever increasing danger and barbaric greed. The conclusion is, of course, a perfect one which procures the 'hero' his place in life, as the chief Dali Lama.A 'must have' for any Hilton fan, dreamer of his own Shangri-La, or escapist from the current unstylish visions of today's Hollywood hard edged filmography. Don't look for any brutality, in-your-face sexuality, gore, vulgar language, inuendo; you will find only adventure, some action in the brutal arrival and departure scenes all done in Capra style that would become mature years later. It is heavy in matters of style filmed with pomp and circumstance, relieved by characters who have at last found their way in life. It's simply a gorgeous Classic Black and White.Ray W.

The unofficial leader of the four is Conway, a British embassy relations-sort of man. Rather than being outraged, Conway is content in the serene and spiritual surroundings.*** None of the female characters ever develop beyond a paragraph or two, and the scope of the plot only involves arriving at and possibly leaving Shangri-La.*** The prologue and epilogue to the story, however, are very well done and extend the mystery of Shangri-La. Does this place truly exist? Are people able to prolong their lives in spiritual and intellectual enlightenment? Was Conway just spaced out on herbal drugs or perhaps suckered by cult fanatics?*** The book has no final answers. Its main goal is to detach people from the modern sense of time and the often unhappy pursuits we impose on ourselves and each other.

Perhaps it's because of my own expectations and the multitude of 4 & 5 star ratings here or the british reference writing or the somewhat choppy style; perhaps it's that the morals it teaches have been exhaustedly dissected with parallel novels at the time and since this book was written. I suppose it's all of the above. The story is good, the ending is good, even the sparse development of the characters is good, albeit I was not able to wrap myself around anyone's humanity except partially the main character's.It's Marxist \\"ends justifies the means\\" message is striking but never dealt with; a huge moral hole. But that's also the reality of the Marxist road map. This cultural utopia denies man's drive to do better with his position and his material betterment. An inner drive in all of us that should never be ignored or quelled. The parallel lesson that Shangri-la is not so much a place as a growth within oneself makes for some good thought provoking cud. The addictive draw of a utopian society is a political demon we face everyday. But hopefully, eventually, we experience our own confrontations that draw us back to the reality of our lives with a lesson to try to do better.Anyway, it's good.

This book is so good--That I want to keep it for myself and not share it with anyone--As if it was written just for me. \\"Lost Horizon\\" is a mainstream novel and a masterpiece making use of a succinct yet uncomplicated writing style. Recently I had a memory of Frank Capra's film version of this novel--That I first saw over 40 years ago--And I decided to watch it again. I was so impressed and moved by the picture that I decided to read the novel. The film captures the essence of the novel; although the on-screen characters were significantly changed by Capra--Presumably to pull at the heart strings more effectively. Yet despite the characters, and their relationships to each other, having been modified for the movie version of \\"Lost Horizon\\"--The film and its definitive message still end up resembling the book quite closely. This novel--That Amazon categorizes as \\"metaphysical\\"--Will melt any cynic's heart. The idea of living peacefully, serenely and stress-free may be compelling in theory to many Westerners--But their fascination would not be enough for them to give up their striving, competing, overworking and generally not enjoying life to the fullest. In Buddhism all suffering is created in the mind, and so the lamas of Shangri-La use their practice of clairvoyant meditation to keep it at bay. Yet ultimately what guides Shangri-La is the principle of moderation, where one avoids being \\"too virtuous\\" as well. Reading \\"Lost Horizon\\" I could not help but be reminded of Herman Hesse's \\"The Glass Bead Game\\"--Another masterpiece which also deals with the themes of a Utopia influenced, and intertwined with, aspects of Eastern philosophy / religion--In particular the practice of meditation. In closing--The idea of a \\"world apart\\"--Where mankind is encouraged to be the \\"highest possible version\\" of itself--Is a timeless notion that will always be seductive.Stephen C.

When they crash land on a high plateau and are almost instantly met by a caravan of porters carrying a monk, they realize that their kidnapping was not by chance or a random incident.They are taken to the mysterious Shangri La, a monastery that sits above a bustling town nestled secretly in a valley. The monastery is complete with a library, music room, and all sorts of modern comforts. The guests inquire about returning to civilization, but their hosts, the monks, are extremely vague regarding the details of how they might do so. Soon the four guest begin to suspect that something sinister is lurking in the background of this utopia.The main character, Conway, takes a liking to Shangri La, and is eventually invited to meet with the Head Lama. Conway is told the history of Shangri La, and learns the secret that has been covered since their arrival: the monks of Shangri La practice a combination of meditation and narcotics that enables them to achieve extreme longevity. Some of the monastery's monks are over two hundred years old. The novel moves toward a climax in which one of the guests tries to escape, just after Conway witnesses the Head Lama die and is asked to succeed him.This story is full of twists and turns, though for a large portion of the text nothing really happens. The author uses a very subtle tool to introduce the story, and it pays off in the epilogue, when the reader is left wondering whether or not Lost Horizon is a true story. The mix of Buddhist and Christian teaching is interesting, making the philosophic dialogues between Conway and the Head Lama intriguing.

The book and the film are very similar, so my love for the film has transferred to the original work. Lost Horizon is the story of four people, an American, a young British soldier, a middle-aged British man, and a female missionary, who have the misfortune of being kidnapped on an airplane. They are crashed near a mysterious and dismal mountain somewhere in Tibet, and all seems to be lost to them, including their pilot who dies in the crash. However, they are rescued by a group of men who live in a strange valley nearby. They call their oasis Shangri-La.The middle-aged British man is named Conway; he has the best grasp of the goals of Shangri-La of any of the people in his group. Instead of fidgeting when he is told he and his friends will never leave the villiage, he embraces his new home where everything is done in moderation. He marvels over the expensive library of treasures and begins to love a tiny Chinese girl with a fondness for music. He has the good fortune to meet the High Lama of the monastary there and to be told the secrets of Shangri-La.Conway's sentiments narrate the story, and his calm personality resonates with the reader and makes the sometimes outlandish beliefs of Shangri-La become vivid and desirable.This is a magical book with the same feeling of hope and inspiration that is present in Frank Capra's films. Although it was written in the early 30s, the sentiments are applicable in today's world. Thus, it is a timeless classic that every person should have the good fortune of stumbling upon.

I know not if you're one of those people but if you're, I must say, I beg to differ. Thi s book is not just about the Shangri La. Its about the various twists and turns life has to offer and the various dilemmas every human being has to face throughout one's life. In thatrespect this novel is \\"enlightening\\" if that is the correct word for it. A must reda for everyone who wonders what meaning life has or what importance life means to him.This nopvel has made me see life from a different perspective and that's something books are supposed to do!"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Yes, I am guilty of having purchased and read this wonder-filled book several times. I would no sooner give it away to a friend, than a year or so later, a 'thirst' for it would develop, and I'd have to purchase it anew for a re-read.Why?Initially, it was because I was looking for such a place (as Shangri-La) on planet earth. But after the passage of a few years, I gave up on my search, thinking that this personal wish was simply an impossible dream. Luckily, deep inside me, that wish failed to go away. My heart knew that 'if you want something badly enough, you will attract it.'The author, James Hilton, may have had knowledge about such a place (besides what was merely in his artistic imagination).Did Hilton find his Shangri-La? Apparently not, but that should not prevent others from finding it. James Hilton could have been serving as an 'instrument' through which others would be led to their own Nirvana.Shangri-La was a place where people were truly free, living under a loving benevolence, able to pursue their interests - interests that tended to become more and more noble over time. These seekers (finders) were also fortunate to live to an extraordinarily advanced age - 'living forever.' Shangri-La was a place removed from the rest of the world (and from today's world as we know it).But what about today? Does Shangri-La still exist? In France? Yes. In Italy? Yes. In Russia? Yes. In the U.K.? Yes. South of the Border? Yes. In Canada and Australia? Yes. In the U.S.? Yes. Everywhere? Yes. Then how many Shangri-Las are there? There is only One Shangri-La.Is Shangri-La Buddhist? Christian? Islamic? Jewish? Zen-ish? Sufi-ish? Yes. As in James Hilton's book, residents of Shangri-La have many backgrounds and come from several nations.Can anyone find this exalted place? Not 'anyone', but 'someone' can. Perhaps one in a million may find it - yes, even today. If You seek it, don't abandon your quest. Keep seeking and you will be attracted to it . . . and you will live forever - truly.\\"Lost Horizon\\" (the original 1933 novel by James Hilton) is a 'must-read.'James Kowalick"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I read this book as part of a utopian literature unit in my AP English class. From a political standpoint, this book sparks questions about a utopian society, then answers them with simple, intelligent examples. The emotions that Hilton illustrates are somewhat vague, but he manages to convey a sense of hidden love, peace, and happiness during Conway's stay at Shangri-La. I found myself captivated by the utopian lifestyle, and amazed at the beauty of a seemingly &quot;perfect&quot; community. I give this book four of five stars, however, because I felt it was just a little shallow and would benefit from more details- still an excellent read."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Hilton's novel still has the power to take you away to a land frozen in time.

Hilton's grasp of imagery and diction really make this novel a fun one to read. Since reading this book, I read Shangri-La, a sequel to Lost Horizon by Eleanor Cooney. I must admit that I did not like that one at all-- and felt that Hilton's story was desecrated. In any case, I advise anyone with patience (the beginning of the book is not a cathcer) to read this book.

It enthralled me from the start, and has never let me go. The aspect of the book I like most is the elegant use of language. The descriptions are vivid but not overdone; the book washes over you with serenity, much as Shangri-la does over Conway. The only quibble I have is that the American character, Barnard, talks like a British version of an American, and so is unconvincing to this Idahoan. (Yet how many times have we Americans done the same thing to British sensibilities?) In summary, I have read the book a dozen times over the years, coming back to it like an old friend, and will probably read it a dozen times more."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This story is excellent and very intresting some parts, although there is a vague description of the lamas monastery . the beginng of the book is very compelling but towards the middle the speed of the book decreases greatly. the characters have very intresting mind sets. as the secrets of shangri-la reveal the book becomes very fun to read. i would definately reccomend you read this."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This book impressed me i am only 15yrs old and this is a great classic.

(Shangri La) While exploring the fascinating world of Shangri La through the eyes of the 4 kidnapped characters we are drawn to this world of beauty and peace. Is living forever on the earth, boring and unfulfilling as some would have us believe, or does it grant us a beginning to unlock the secrets of life, its meaning, and why we are here?While Christendom preaches heaven, this gem of a book examines the bibles teaching of the possibility of living forever on the earth under Paradisaic conditions and what that would mean for mankind. It also illustrates the ill effect of Nationalism, War and Greed upon our society and where these values are taking the majority of mankind. In a fascinating tale, this brilliant work of fiction allows us to think outside the box and explore another world, a world far better than our own."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Note: I made some Mormon reader angry over my reviews of books written by Mormons out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.Your \\"helpful\\" votes are appreciated.

The hero falls in love with one of the women.I don't want to tell too much, but I do highly recommend this classic adventure first published in 1933. It has all the ambiance of that era, and as one Amazon reviewer said, it is the perfect book to curl up with on a slow day."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This 1939 story is a classic and created the legend of Shangri-La. But in the years since, the book has grown a bit outdated and upon second reading it's not quite the five-star novella that one recalls.I loved this book when young and hadn't read it in at least 25 years--when I recently picked it up again I was surprised by many things I hadn't noticed before. The author has not just created an ideal world where time slows down, but has also created a place where there is no right or wrong, Christianity (and Catholicism) are changed to the point where they become meaningless, and war is always just beyond the horizon. There are also references to everything being done in moderation in this perfect world, including vices such as doing drugs and having sex with strangers. It isn't quite the spiritually uplifting message that some claim it is.All these years later the message of the book now seems odd--it paints an almost perfect world where everyone gets along by allowing some people to get away with doing what is now considered wrong. It says that the way to live longer is to give up all your passions and become passionless. That seems the opposite of conclusions from studies about people who age successfully today.Having seen the 1970s movie more recently than I had last read the book, I was surprised how different the film story was. In some ways I like some of the movie's changes better. In comparison, the book doesn't flow as well (using an opening and closing narration), but that was Hilton's style to intentionally make the narrative rather choppy and even understated. He did it in Goodbye Mr. Chips and it happens again here.Today his writing style seems dated and it takes awhile to get fully into this book. He is still a great author who raised fascinating issues in this book, especially as they apply to what was happening just before World War II. If you give it time the last half speeds by to a very intriguing conclusion."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"My interest in reading Lost Horizon came from having seen the Frank Capra film several times. I was aware that the produces of the film had tried to remain as close to the book as possible but I found the differences between the book and the film to be refreshing.Lost Horizon is a riveting book that is difficult to put down. One might classify the book as part adventure, part philosophy in the blending of the exotic location and Christian and Buddhist beliefs. It is needless to say that the book is well written; the chapter I found of highest interest is Robert Conway's conversation with the High Lama. The writing of that chapter was so very natural and the discussion of such interest it was like being an observer of the scene, and was a chapter I did not want to break.The characters of the four kidnapped people, Mallinson, Miss Brinklow, Barnard and Conway are subtly drawn and their different reactions to Shangri-La are interesting. Miss Brinklow wants to create a Christian mission, Barnard is eluding the law and happy to have found a safe haven and Mallinson cannot be reconciled with the peaceful paradise of the lamasery; but it is Conway, of course, who has center stage. The character of Conway, a world-weary man who discovers that Shangri-La as a place of destiny, must reflect much from the personality of James Hilton. Conway is very complex; a person who has wisdom beyond his years but is not, as he confesses, a hero and is partly a coward. Indeed, Conway's firm decision to remain at Shangri-La is successfully changed by Mallinson. The conversation between the High Lama and Conway expresses many ideas that applied to Hilton's time and also to the present day. The description by the High Lama of the \\"coming storm\\" struck me as appropriate for today. In Hilton's time there was the threat of war on a vast scale as Japan had its eye on occupying large parts of China and the rise of Fascism. Today, it is world terrorism and leaders that want to take us into war without having a clue to the consequences.In short, this is a marvelous tale that is fantastic to read; a book that one can re-read with great pleasure."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"LOST HORIZON was written just as the shadows of the conflict that was to become World War II were beginning to darken the world. Not for nothing is the \\"narrator's\\" note to the reader dated 1933; that was the year of Hitler's ascension to power. The story begins in Berlin. It's evident that James Hilton wrote LOST HORIZON as an elegy to a world that had vanished forever at Ypres and the Somme. His protagonist, Conway, is a survivor of the European slaughter of 1914-1918, who has been rendered dispassionate by his experience in war, much like Somerset Maugham's Larry Darrell inThe Razor's Edge, in many respects a similar work.No doubt Hilton recognized that whatever shards were left of the Century of Human Progress were going to be ground to dust motes in the coming cataclysm. LOST HORIZON is Hilton's prayer that something of worth survives the coming Dark Age. Since LOST HORIZON was written, violence has been the coin of the human realm, and our technology has outpaced our thought and enslaved us. Time has accelerated beyond our ability to tolerate it. Many human beings have suffered and are suffering from their perceived inability to slow everyday life to a manageable speed. Domestic Violence, street violence, bullying, substance abuse, rudeness, anger, and many other social and personal problems have been the result. The pacing of LOST HORIZON is, by comparison, as languid as a river of honey. Anyone who comes here expecting an Action/Adventure yarn is going to be bitterly disappointed. However, for those of us, like Conway, who are preservationists, a visit to the Valley of the Blue Moon is a delight.There are a few flaws in Hilton's tale, mostly surrounding his less than thorough grasp of both Chinese culture and Tibetan culture, and the differences between them. He hardly addresses Buddhism. Though typical for their era, they occasionally cause Hilton to fall into the patronizing tone of the imperialist era. His Orientals are all stereotypically inscrutable. His main protagonists (even the Lamas) are Westerners. There's a decidedly European feel to Shangri-La, and there's actually very little of the \\"East\\" in LOST HORIZON. Even the philosophy of \\"moderation,\\" attractive as it is, is an imperfect interpretation of the Buddhist Middle Way. At the same time, these \\"flaws\\" help to make this story more accessible to its intended European-based audience, most of whom (reasonably or unreasonably) probably can't find Tibet on a map nowadays.Conway's story begins in Afghanistan. He is a British Consul serving in that country, along with his young assistant, Mallinson. Tribal violence has broken out, and the two emissaries are being forced to flee back to British India, in the company of two chance companions, Miss Brinklow, a Missionary, and a Mr. Barnard, from America.They are not long aloft when they realize that their flight has been hijacked by a pilot whose apparent design is to fly them across the Kunlun Shan Range and into Tibet. The plane crash lands, causing the pilot's death. Weather conditions are hideous; a fierce blizzard has caused a whiteout along with subzero temperatures and stocks of food and water are nonexistent. Each one of the four survivors addresses what seems to be imminent death differently. Conway is unperturbed and accepting. Barnard evidences a dry humor. Miss Brinklow reaches for her Bible. Mallinson is full of plans to trek back to India in the teeth of the storm.Rescue comes on the first clear day in the form of a line of porters headed by a man in a sedan chair, a Mr. Chang, who invites the four to the remote lamasery of Shangri-La in order to rest and recuperate. Although Mallinson agrees to visit Shangri-La merely to collect supplies and hire porters so that they can set out for India the next day, he is overruled by Conway, Barnard and Brinklow, each of whom recognizes the need to marshal themselves.The lamasery is in a virtually impregnable valley called Blue Moon, and it is a surprise, being equipped with all forms of modern conveniences like hot water plumbing and steam heat. Chang, who has become a kind of Social Director for the four, explains that Shangri-La is a monastery whose belief system centers around the idea of moderation. Thus, modern conveniences are melded appropriately with traditional practices. Beyond that, Chang does not put himself out to answer questions.Each of the four settles down to wait, with varying degrees of patience. Miss Brinklow convinces herself that she must save the \\"heathens\\" living in the Valley from themselves; min her eyes, \\"moderation\\" is sin and their obvious happiness is inexplicable and most unacceptable. Barnard, for his part, admits that he is a Bernie Madoff-type character on the lam from the authorities after contributing mightily to the Great Depression. However, he reasons that his discoveries of precious metals in the Valley will redeem him in the eyes of the world.Conway, for his part, falls in love with Shangri-La. He is quickly introduced to the High Lama, who reveals himself to be a former Capuchin Priest, Father Perrault, who was born in 1689. Perrault explains to Conway, in a long centerpiece to the book, that he first came to Shangri-La by chance. As with Miss Brinklow, he was seized with conversionary fervor, but as time has passed, he has come to see Shangri-La as a refuge and repository for world culture, a place that will be overlooked in the coming World War, which, he prophesies, will be infinitely more destructive than Conway's war, and will end in an unprecedented conflagration that will devour everything. His own incredible longevity he attributes to the air of the Valley, which seems to confer great vitality. Here, he assures Conway, a man will have time to explore even the deepest mysteries of the most seemingly improbable knowledge. Several of the monks he introduces to Conway are studying obscure subjects and dedicating their lives to minutae. One man is Chopin's student, perfecting his teacher's unfinished musical pieces.Mallinson merely wants to leave. He mocks Conway's belief in the High Lama. He hates everything about Shangri-La, and is shrill in his denunciations of the \\"Chinks\\" and old men who \\"wait like crouching spiders\\" in the place, working toward some unknowable, undoubtedly horrible, end. \\"I wish I had a plane,\\" he tells Conway angrily. \\"I'd bomb this place into bits.\\" All he wants to do, in his youth, is return to the British cantonments for tea dances and flivver races. Quite unexpectedly his is the voice of reason to whom Conway listens, and they depart Shangri-La as the story ends.There is so much here. Conway, dispassionate, nevertheless falls under the spell of the mysterious Valley of the Blue Moon, while the seemingly more credulous and superficial but passionate Mallinson reflects the thinking of a modern skeptic. Where Conway has always doubted the outside world and yet accepts the magic of Shangri-La, Mallinson believes wholeheartedly in the modern world and sees no magic in the lamasery. And although Conway accompanies Mallinson out, as the narrator finishes his tale, it is obvious that Conway is attempting to return to Shangri-La.Whether Mallinson or Conway is the hero all depends on the reader's outlook. Shangri-La promises freedom, but is the old Lama telling the truth? Are we called upon to act? Are we called upon to reflect? Is reflection action, and action reflection? Given conditions in the modern world, is a retreat to a genteel, timeless place an act of surrender or an act of bravery? When and where are we prisoners in our own lives? Or are we always free?"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"James Hilton's Lost Horizon, first published in 1933, is the enchanting, though cerebral, short novel that gave birth to the utopia of Shangri-La, a paradise set in a Christian-Buddhist monastery and largely self-sufficient village in the isolated high mountains of Tibet. Told as a captivating story within a story, the drama revolves around a cluster of enticing mysteries: Why are protagonist Hugh Conway and the other foreigners being flown by a seemingly mad pilot high above the remote Kuen-Lun mountains of China? Is Conway's story of his two-month stay in Shangri-La believable?; Does this almost timeless utopia, where people live in equanimity and age ever so slowly, actually exist?; Does Conway find his way back to Shangri-La to take charge following the death of the 250-year-old High Lama?The basic storyline, including Conway's love for a youthful Tibetan girl he meets in Shangri-La, is provocative enough to have served more than once as material for an entertaining Hollywood movie, but, in my opinion, the greater value of the work lies in the author's articulation of an emotionally appealing and intellectually intriguing life-philosophy. Conway is a British consul whose mild personality and muted career ambition lead to his assignments in far-away places outside the mainstream of power and politics. As such, he is the perfect newcomer to Shangri-La, where people are moderately hard-working and honest, where different ethical systems and religions are condoned as being \\"moderately true,\\" and, above all, where the lamas who run Shangri-La \\"are only moderately certain\\" of their own beliefs! After entering Shangri-La, often more by chance than choice, lamas-in-training find that their youthful desires gradually recede, to be replaced by a deeper wisdom. Over many decades of living in Shangri-La, significant events from their past lives come into sharper focus to serve as reference points for refined scholarly pursuits and purposeful contemplation about the future.As voiced through the High Lama's prognostication of a storm that \\"will rage till every flower of culture is trampled, and all human beings are leveled in a vast chaos,\\" Hilton warned in the 1930s, the decade leading up to World War II and the development of nuclear weapons, about the destructive path our conflict-prone society was on. Along with his warning, however, Hilton optimistically professes faith in \\"a new world stirring in the ruins,\\" with Shangri-La \\"preserved as by miracle for a new Renaissance.\\" Assuming this forecast to be moderately true, let's hope that Conway really has returned to Shangri-La, even though the rest of us may never get there!"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"What do you get when you mix a Brit with a Texas Oilman, a London Society female missionary and an Oxfordian highbrow who specializes in whining and negative thinking. Place them in the 1930s, shake well in a stolen aircraft, fly them to an unknown part of the world somewhere in the Himalayan/Tibetian and run them out of fuel.What you get is a bloody good adventure that is written a bit like a Kipling tale. The story begins in India and takes you to Shangri-La, located in the valley of the \`Blue Moon', a place of moderate perfection. For in Shangri-La the cardinal rule is &quot;moderation&quot;- the key to extended life. In this microcosm of moderate perfection you will find a world where aging is retarded significantly and life exists to appreciate the aesthetic.Though the book was published in 1931, the &quot;First Paperback Ever Published,&quot; it has an ageless \`Celestine Prophecy' style. Of course it was not the first \`Spiritual Adventure' story written but it was the first to incorporate first world technology (aviation) with spiritual wisdom. Not a romping, gut tingling, adventure tale, it does drag at times, but the ending has a nice twist and there are some adages that bring the read to a pensive pause. &quot;People make mistakes in life bybelieving too much, but they have a damned dull time if they believe too little.&quot; Recommended"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Although Hilton wrote a number of well-received novels, such as Goodbye, Mr. Chips, his bittersweet classic about a mysterious Eden high in the Himalayas is probably the work for which he is best remembered.The story still has the power to captivate, and its appeal led director Frank Capra to make the classic movie about the book. The film was an interesting departure from Capra's normally upbeat tales of American life. Perhaps in a way, it isn't so different from his \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and \\"It Happened One Night\\" in that it shows Capra's belief that people are fundamentally good and that even the not so good ones, if given the chance (such as in landing in a paradise like Shangri-La), will reform and choose to lead better lives.In that sense, in \\"Lost Horizon\\" Capra gives us a parable not only of Paradise Lost and Regained (as when the Ronald Colman character is tricked into leaving but ultimately returns), but a vision of how people would act if they could indeed create or find the perfect society.When the panicked and exhausted group of travellers, who have narrowly escaped death twice, first in their escape from the inflamed Baskur and then in the plane crash, arrive in the city, their only concern is to escape and get back to \\"civilization.\\" But slowly, even the most sceptical and cynical of them (except for Colman's brother), eventually come to appreciate their newly found Eden, and we see how they themselves begin to change and are ultimately transformed now that they've left the harrowing environments of the imperfect, unjust, dangerous, and ultimately savage and cruel societies of the outside world behind.Thomas Mitchell, the shrewd businessman, who may have defrauded people of millions of dollars of his company's stock, at first only sees an opportunity to make a killing selling Shangri-La's gold to the outside world. Soon he's completely forgotten about his opportunistic business schemes and can only think about his project of building modern plumbing and bringing other modern conveniences to the people of Shangri-La.Edward Everett Horton, the older, aloof archaeologist, and the young and bitter tubercular woman, are at first suspicious and convinced they've been shanghaied and brought to Shangri-La for sinister reasons. But under the healing and rejuvenating effects of Shangri-La's life-extending ambience, Horton stops aging and the young woman's terminal illness is healed. Now, both mentally and physically invigorated (as well as being very different people from when they first arrived), they realize they've truly found Paradise and no longer want to leave.For Colman, the energetic Foreign Secretary, who has spent his entire career roaming the Far East, Shangri-La is like deja-vu itself, and he realizes he's been searching for it his entire life. Unlike the others, he needs no convincing. The only misfit is Colman's younger brother, who is never able to accept the place, and finally decides to leave.Lost Horizon is a fascinating cinematic vision of Paradise Found, and I wonder, how many of us would choose to leave our present lives to dwell there?I would."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This timeless and visionary novel, while inflicted with some British chauvinism that was common at the time, deserves to be called a classic. Here we have the story of four Westerners who in the 1930s are kidnapped by plane and crash-landed in an uncharted Tibetan valley. They are welcomed into a life of ease and luxury at a suspicious lamasery, Shangri-La, where the monks speak English and enjoy Western books and modern technologies. It turns out that the four abductees were recruited to add to the population of the local village and can never leave, while the lead character Conway is ordained to become the new High Lama. It turns out that this apparent Utopia may not be so fulfilling after all, and that is the key message of the novel. Hilton gives us the struggles of a man who has been damaged by the horrors of war and the modern rat race, and just wants to find a place to get away from it all. But even a place as peaceful as Shangri-La is not so wonderful under the surface. Maybe Utopia is truly impossible to find in our world, both geographically and spiritually.This novel does have a few problems in characterizations and politics. Other than Conway the characters are shallow and one-sided. The one female among the Westerners, Miss Brinklow, is very narrow and nearly invisible, while the non-Westerners are mostly anonymous. Most importantly, the book comes close to sinking under what could either be called a lack of political correctness or immense British snobbery from Hilton's writing tradition. The High Lama is a European and actually states that \\"Europeans of the Nordic and Latin races\\" are the best candidates for enlightenment, while the Tibetans and Chinese in the story are presented as servants or bureaucrats. This is a condescending and unfortunate slight to Buddhism and the traditions of Tibet. Luckily, higher philosophical insights make this novel much bigger than the sum of its parts.

I didn't think I would enjoy any of the other books on the list: The Red Badge of Courage, The Old Man And The Sea, A Tale Of Two Cities. That was literature, and I learned that literature meant alot of beautiful passages, finely crafted human emotions but all terribly and painfully boring. Lost Horizon was going to be another preachy epic, about the human condition.I was wrong.Turned out I consumed the novel in two afternoons with my 16-year old adolescent mind. I was lost in a world, where a woman stayed beautiful for ninety years, a land protected as secret from society, an eden.Bangkok is attacked and four passangers find themselves on a plane, being evacuated from the burning city. Barnar - a mysterious american with oil fields in north, Miss Brinklow - a dellusioned missionary who thinks she can convert anyone to christianity, Mallinson a british youth and Conway the adored hero of the novel.They find themselves abducted into paradise, where no one grows old, where wars can't find their way over high peaks, where the vanity of the world stops, and art masterpieces and books are hid away from a 'dying world'.The only way back to the rest of the world is to wait for porters that come into Shangri-La and trade goods. The problem is the porters have no regule schedule, they may show up next month or next year. Mallinson the youth, misses his girlfriend left back in london and his family. He's anxious to get back and watches the other comrades daze into a fatefull sleep, earning to stay in Sri-Lanking, the perfect paradise.Conway is 38. He's tired after the war, with no real purpose in life. He thinks about settling down and Sri-Lanka is the perfect place.Barnar has other reasons to stay. A bit sinister, but who can blame him to leave paradise? It's his perfect escape from his crimes and the punishment that awaits him on the outside.Miss Brinklow views the settlement as a perfect mission ground where she can convert the 'non-believers' to christianity.The day of escape comes and Mallinson finds he's the only one trying to leave.I've read the Lost Horizon this week.

It will keep you on the edge of your seat and your adrenaline pumping! I enjoyed this more than 1984, Brave New world and Fahrenheit 451. The main character is so profoundly deep and interesting that you will never lose interest. His flaws help the reader to identify with this character. Great action packed story with an immensely powerful message that will leave you thinking about this book for a very long time."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I love to read and always have a book around -- but \\"This Perfect Day\\" is different. Why? Out of the probably thousands of books I've read (I'm 50something), this is my FAVORITE BOOK OF ALL TIME. In fact, when I was cleaning out my book collection a few years back, this was one of the few books I knew I had to keep! A friend in high school gave it to me; she loved \\"Rosemary's Baby,\\" too, so perhaps that's why she picked it up. The plot, the characters, the imagery, EVERYTHING, are so perfectly imagined. And I'm picky: I'm a working journalist. I have my tattered paperback copy and every five years or so, get it out to read again. It usually takes me only a day to read because I simply cannot put it down. Some director and/or producer out there needs to make this into a theatrical film! With today's digital technology, it could definitely be done! James Cameron, are you listening? :) Anyway, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and as one reviewer said, this book should be mandatory reading for high school kids, as it deals w/ issues of power, mortality, doing the right thing, determining one's course in life, honesty, and lots more."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I first read this book back in the 70s when I was still in high school. It\`s rare that I would consider a book really terrifing,but this one fits the bill. It gave me nightmares back then and still made my skin crawl when I reread it recently.The story is about a not so distant future \\"utopia\\" where society is (supposedly) run by a computer. The entire population is keptdrugged into placid stupity so they are easy to control, little more than biological robots. A bigger horror than any other typeof authoritarian government, mind control.What makes this a true modern horror story? Well, in this day and age it\`s difficult to believe in such things as ghosts, vampires,and the like. Good stories, but 100% fictional and completely unreal. But this story is possible. It could actually happen. Andit\`s a future that we seem to be edging ever closer toward. And it\`s not at all difficult to believe that this is exactly whatthe governments of the world would do to their people if they could. And the day that they will be able to do something of thisnature just may not be that far away."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"This Perefct Day is still a 'sleeper' novel; after all these years. A futuristic story that should have been made into a movie, years ago. What a statement about mechanized, drug induced, utopian society; and even relevant today! I have read this book several times, but had to refresh my memory of the details. The character Chip, goes through such a dramatic change...from a young child fed the propaganda of his parents and govt; juxtaposed with his grandfather's wisdom and sly interjection of doubt into Chip's thinking process; to a raging maniac soldier, battling to destroy the UNIComp computer system that has enslaved his society. Chip becomes the \\"Rebel\\" that his grandfather wanted to be, but never was...There's also a not-so-common view of sexual tension vs. mechanical sexual relief that gets a bit comical, in some ways. This is a brilliant book and a must read for everyone who liked Orwell's \\"1984\\", Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" and even \\"Animal Farm\\". The book is a collector's item.If you can get a copy; read it at least 3 times in a year.

That's a real shame, because this is among Levin's best, if not his outright best. Levin paints a vivid picture of the logical end of the therapeutic state, a bland dystopia in which conformity is pharmaceutically enforced. In a sense, this novel is a precursor to \\"The Matrix,\\" a memorable and cranky uncle to it, if you will. This is great science fiction, from an author who doesn't usually work in that genre and is therefore not too bound by its conventions. This novel is back in print now, so buy it fast while it's available!"},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"This is my favorite Ira Levin novel, The story is both interesting and well developed. Unlike alot of futuristic novels, this one is light and user friendly, (not too much made up dialogue to confuse you.) The theme is the same as in all Levin novels, to pit the little guy against the big organization. The Character's were very 3-D, I highly recommend this one.

I've read it a number of times now, and it's still enjoyable from start to finish. The world of UniComp and the Family is an interesting one that's been well fleshed-out by the author.

A little slow in some places, but overall, a good story."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"Originally published in 1970, this is a classic adult dystopian novel that portrays a frightening future in which a pseudo-government medicates its citizens and regulates all behavior, creating a hive like community. Everyone is equal and its adherents chant: \\"Christ, Marx, Wood and Wei led us to this perfect day\\".About: &#8220;Chip&#8221; (Li is his real name and one of four names for every man given by the society) is a member of a &#8220;perfect&#8221; society where the members are semi-sexless, have no discernable race and exist through genetic modification. They live a day-to-day drone like existence where men do not have to shave, women have no breasts, they all wear identical coveralls, eat cakes and drink coke for every meal, and everyone gets along.When Chip decides what he really wishes to do with his life and expresses it out loud as a youngster, his desires are superficially quelled as unacceptable and is told he is to have the career chosen for him by the government for the good of the whole. Then one day his internally conflicted self meets up with a group of members who have figured out how to avoid taking their weekly scheduled meds. When Chip joins them temporarily, he finds he has never felt more alive and decides he wants to live this way everyday.This is just a glimpse of what happens to Chip, because things become decidedly more involved as the story continues.Thoughts: I enjoyed this classic novel &#8211; even though it did not completely absorb my interest for the entire novel since I did a fair amount of skimming; a key sign that the novel was not going to be a big favorite. It felt like the first part of story, detailing Chip&#8217;s life in this medically created &#8220;utopian&#8221; society, went on a bit longer than needed for me. It did pick up in the second part of the novel and I do think that the story line is an intriguing one, and supports the fact that the book is often considered a corner-stone classic for the genre and included with the likes of 1984 and Clockwork Orange.It also stimulated several questions &#8211; because as in all dystopian, this society is not as idyllic as it appears. I found I started asking myself: Who or what is leading and monitoring this society? What is their reason behind creating this pseudo-utopia? And are these leaders as altruistic as it first appears?Recommended to anyone who enjoys social science fiction where a society has gone askew or indeed to anyone who plans to write one. So if you&#8217;re interested in a read that may be a bit chewy, or you would like the answer to the above questions, this will be a great story for you. For those not interested in reading the book, but who have a curiosity about the plot there is a complete summary (with spoilers) at its Wikipedia page. [...]So I give This Perfect Day a 3 stars. I would have considered it torture as a teenager forced to read it in a high school literature class, like when I read 1984, but as an adult it was quite a decent read with a complex and surprising plot."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"This is such a timely story. Can't believe it was written years ago. As with all Ira Levin's stories, it is sure to surprise and entertain. But this one gives you chills with the prospect of government controlled healthcare in our lives. Don't understand why that could be bad? Read this book !!"},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I purchased this book so that my daughter and her son might read it. I had read this book decades ago and when I heard of the controversy surrounding the implantation of micro chips in newborns to \\"protect\\" them from abduction I remembered the wristbands worn by people in the book that identified them and their whereabouts. Interesting to think that we may shortly be in similar circumstances!"},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"Though this novel is short and terse, and it reads like a screenplay, it's one of Ira Levin's overlooked treasures. It's an excellent science fiction novel and really should be, I think, made into a film.The plot is fairly simple, though there are plenty of great surprises, and I wouldn't DREAM of putting in any spoilers. The world political situation, in this novel, has been finally stabilized (unified) and via the help of computers, genetic engineering, chemical treatments and indoctrination, humans are now \\"humble, helpful and good.\\" They worship a tetrad of luminaries; Jesus, Karl Marx, Robert Wood and Li-chun Wei. The last two were instrumental in creating the treaties and chemical treatments and philosophy, with adaptations from the first two to make a perfect society. Every single person's movements are voluntarily tracked by scanners that link to \\"Uni\\" or \\"UniComp\\"--the universal computer that permits births, marriages, designs cities, chooses careers and permits even the smallest choice of a toy or a phone call to a friend. Group custom polices the behavior of each individual; those who violate custom or look troubled or \\"sick\\" are gently \\"helped\\" by their brethren.Chip, the protagonist, is somewhat a misfit; for one thing, one of his eyes is not the standardized brown but is green, like his great-grandfather's, and he feels a bit out of place. Is it because he is teased by the other, more uniform \\"tan, slim and slant-eyed\\" children as the members of the \\"Family\\" are described, or is it something deep in his psyche that makes him question the entire uniformity of the world?Chip's questioning leads him to some astonishing discoveries, and then some. And the end is surprising in itself, but perhaps not, if you realize that one of Chip's best traits is that he is true to himself, always. And will make great sacrifices to stay true.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"In the future that Ira Levin envisions, the world has been unified, lasting peace has been achieved, and poverty has been erased. Guns and prisons exist only as museum exhibits. Of course, this comes with a cost. \\"Members\\" of this worldwide family wear bracelets that are connected to UniComp, the computer that controls their lives. By touching their bracelets to every scanner they pass, UniComp always knows where they are. It decides whether and whom they will wed, what they will name their kids, where they live and work, and when they will have sex (Saturday nights for ten minutes). Genetic manipulation assures that, with each passing generation, members grow to look more and more alike, assuring ultimate conformity.A kid (nicknamed Chip by a grandfather who still believes in individuality) is concerned about his grandfather's desire to exercise free will -- a sure sign of sickness that needs to be treated. His grandfather encourages Chip to want something ... anything. Despite his grandfather's transfer to a place far away, Chip still thinks about the concept of choice and wonders what it would be like to choose his own career, although his mild desire to do so vanishes after the monthly \\"treatment\\" that each member receives. Of course, once he reaches age 14 and UniComp assigns him a sex partner, it's difficult for Chip to think about anything else. The novel follows Chip into early adulthood, when he comes to understand his grandfather's wisdom.Dystopian ideas, echoes of1984andBrave New World, abound in This Perfect Day. Via UniComp, the government controls the media. Tranquilizers assure that the population remains docile while other drugs suppress the sex drive. Aggression and passion are diseases. When someone fails to conform or even expresses a nonconforming thought, members who notice will snitch in the belief that they are helping the nonconformist achieve better health. Any hint of individuality is considered selfish -- after all, if there are too many artists and not enough plumbers, all of society suffers. Death as the age of 62 is regarded as natural; it never occurs to members that a longer lifespan is possible.The plot differs from 1984 and other dystopian tomes, however, in its focus on Chip's effort to unravel the past, a task that requires him to translate books published in French and Italian before Unification imposed a common language -- before UniComp took control of the literary world. His work leads to a more familiar theme: the search for others who value freedom over conformity, for a place in the world that remains untouched by Unification. Ironically, when Chip finds such a place, he learns that oppression takes many forms, that freedom may be an illusion, just another instrument of control.As the story evolves, it takes the guise of an action-adventure story before it twists and, toward the end, returns to its philosophical roots. It reminds us that in any conformist society, there are two kinds of nonconformists: those who rebel against the system and those are privileged to control it. It also reminds us how easy it is to be seduced and co-opted by power and the relative luxury it brings.Some aspects of This Perfect Day are amusing but ring true. Rebellious members are particularly motivated to free others from tranquilizing drugs so that they can enjoy more frequent and better sex. Even after being freed from the drugs, members are discomforted by the possibility of violence and chaos inherent in free will. There are advantages to being comfortably numb, to living a decision-free life. Freedom has its costs, including anxiety and stress. Many will inevitably prefer the drugs.This Perfect Day is a product of its time. It takes an obvious shot at Marxism, an ideology that seemed more threatening in 1970 than it does today. The concept of \\"from each according to his ability, to each according to his need\\" is carried to an extreme, with the government (via UniComp) deciding what each person needs and what each should give. Although the notion of a single computer in a single location controlling everything that UniComp controls probably seemed more realistic in 1970 than it does today, the story stands up well. It continues to be a relevant celebration of individualism and free thought. Its significance aside, This Perfect Day tells a good story. If I could, I would give This Perfect Day 4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"Let me start off by saying that I am a HUGE dystopian genre fan. I am constantly searching for my titles that fall under this category and I know once I read the reviews for \\"This Perfect Day\\" that it was right up my alley. Of all the dystopians I've read this is among my top 5 simply because it doesn't over complicate the issues presented to the protagonist. Also, there is a good parallel in the novel (can't say here because I don't want to spoil it) that many dystopians don't make. Read this book it is terrific and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I actually read this book around the time it originally came out. I would have been around junior high age and I still remember it to this day. Maybe it was because I'd never imagined anything quite like the society portrayed in the book, or just because of my age at the time, but TO THIS DAY I am often reminded of it. To be fair, I can't say I actually remember the storyline or even the specific characters (other than Uni), but I DO remember how it made me feel. It was CHILLING. I didn't sleep well for days after reading it. Frankly, it disturbed me a great deal for some reason and left me feeling that the future was hopeless. (Bear in mind, at this time, mainframe computers had just taken off and society was told computers would do away with jobs, all use of paper, etc. At the same time, we were in the Vietnam War and there were nightly images of riots and beatings on TV, along with stories of thousands of soldiers being killed. We were also told we would have to change everything over to the metric system. Things felt very uncertain, particularly to a child of that age.) I thought about the book often after that. Still do. I'll never forget how the book made me feel. I'd like to read it again now as an adult, but frankly I hesistate. I already see many of the things in it coming true on a daily basis. Unfortunately, the youth of today take this invasion of our privacy and loss of our rights as the norm. But for those of us who remember when that wasn't the way things were, this book is a chilling reminder of where our world is headed.I would be careful of reading this book until one is at least in their late teens. I think it is just too disturbing for children in their earlier formative years."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"\\"This Perfect Day\\" is a novel about a future in which everyone is expected and required to exercise perfect conformity and political correctness. Because human beings are by nature ornery, the Government enforces this conformity with drug treatments to make people docile and mild-tempered. The impressive thing about this novel is that it works -- it creates a convincing world where \\"losing is the same as winning\\" and where all of one's life decisions, i.e. what profession to pursue, who to marry, etc. are decided for each citizen by the Government.There is more to it than that. As is usually the case in dystopian novels of this genre, this is a story of one couple's rebellion against the system. More would be telling but this is an interesting speculation about the end result of political correctness and the conformity of thought that our intellectual betters would like to impose on every person. Amazingly, Levin wrote this novel to make this point before the term \\"politically correct\\" was ever coined.

The first time I read it, I was amazed. A massive computer running the world! The word \\"kill\\" being treated like we treat the word \\"[expletive]\\"! People having \\"namebers\\" instead of names! It made me think that there are things going on in the background of life that we have no idea about.Plus it was a great read; couldn't put it down.Now, after rereading it forty-two years later:It was a quick read, written in a very simple style. The technology is so obviously outdated now it's laughable. That being said, it still brings up the same issues it did back then.

I was engaged at almost every point of the story, always wondering and attempting to predict what would happen next. I think that the author worked out the plot very well - there were tons of twists and turns that were unexpected but delightful; it is rare that I read a book where I cannot guess the outcomes of the conflicts involved, but this is one in which the author does a wonderful job of surprising the reader with unexpected outcomes.Unfortunately, I had to give this book 4 out of 5 stars because of the main characters. They begin as admirable, aspirational, heroic, and intelligent. Throughout the book, however, it becomes clear that the main characters seriously lack integrity. There are many instances where the characters do things that are either very out of character or seriously lacking in moral integrity. This is a major flaw, in my view; a book such as this one requires characters who inspire the reader and who become better as the story progresses. In this book, the opposite is quite often the case.This book is most certainly worth the read because of its intriguing and enjoyable plot. I also think that the author's construction of the ironic childrens' rhyme and the clever book title are skillful additions to the story. However, be prepared to be confused, and at times, appalled, with the main characters' actions; this is especially saddening, because each of them had the potential to be entirely heroic.[...]"},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"A very good mixture between A. Huxley's Brave New World (the technology), 1984 (the politics) and fiction. Maybe some things are a bit unrealistic. Although, I love it!!"},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I admit it- I bought this book because I liked the cover art, and man is it great! It reminded me of the film Equilibrium, except it was written about 30 years prior. Everybody thinks or Rosemary's Baby & The Stepford Wives when they think of Levin, but This Perfect Day is his true masterpiece. Why isn't this a movie? The end where the old man's head is on the young athletic body would be so cool to see on the big screen. And many parts are very sexy. Like the organized orgies. And the women who go off the drug getting enhanced sexual desires (among other things), is really something. Just writing this makes me want to read it again..."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"Good \\"page turner\\" and entertaining.I however think that this book is a bit overrated. The plot is quite predictable and the writing not that good.What however bothered me the most is, whithout spoiling anything, the banalization of rape, sex with underage girls, omnipresent tobacco use, etc. Some would say that's because this book was written 40 years ago but I don't think that pedophilia and rape were useful in this story. Some would argue that the author wanted to show human weakness... However, the main character seemed to condone these acts and even did it himself... Those were only very small parts of the book (a few lines, really) but they left me a sour taste..."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"This was just the perfect book to let your imagination go wild with"},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"The resemblance to Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot; is so marked here that one can't help feeling just a little disappointed with Levin, who is far too good a writer to have produced something so derivative.Not that the book is badly written or fails to entertain; Levin is much too good at what he does for that to happen. It's just that this is old territory, and Levin (uncharacteristically) does not really bring anything new to the subject matter.&quot;This Perfect Day&quot; is a good read; all of Levin's work is good reading. But if you read Orwell's &quot;Nineteen Eighty Four,&quot; Huxley's &quot;Brave New World,&quot; and Zamiatin's &quot;We,&quot; you might be surprised, for Levin appears to have lifted ideas from all of these novels. I suppose the genre itself is somewhat narrow, but Levin's other work is much more original than this one."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I just completed This Perfect Day and I will admit that it was a &quot;page turner&quot; and &quot;hard to put down.&quot; I would wholy recomend this book to night time security gaurds who are tired of watching Three Company re-runs. However, TPD is not a 5 star book. The quality of the writing in mediocre and the plot is recycled. This book reminded me a great deal of John Christopher's &quot;Tripod&quot; series, just that Levin is bold enough to use foul language and include a rape scene in his book. Also similar is Peter Dickinson's &quot;The Changes&quot; series. TPD does not offer any new insights into the human conscience, only reminded us of our flaws."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"Unlike seemingly all the amazon.com reviewers I found 'This Perfect Day' to be a disappointment, especially coming from the typically wonderful Ira Levin (..I've read most of his novels). Perhaps it is because it deviates so much from his main literary themes (mystery/gothic stories) and delves into science fiction,.. and I am not especially fond of science fiction? But no, I think it's because the storyline has been told before by others, and in a more accomplished fashion.In 'This Perfect Day' we have planet Earth a few hundred years in the future. Computerization and bio-engineering has really gone amuck, with humans acting and looking like androids (..I can see where Levin has taken this idea further with his 'The Stepford Wives', a much better book). However not everyone is happy with this situation, with one person (the central character) looking to change things to the bad old days when people did as they wanted, not as they are programmed.Again, despite some interesting moments I found 'This Perfect Day' to be relatively weak science fiction material. I am surprised the other amazon.com reviewers, including Levin fans like myself, found it wonderful. I think it is deservedly out of print, and not likely to be reprinted soon."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"If my title caught your eye, then this book is for you. If you wonder why the News and Politics today seems ridiculous. This book is for you."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"Ira Levin wrote some books that got turned into popular movies, I know. I don't think this book ever hit the pop stream, maybe because it is 'science fiction', a genre I don't usually read because I cannot relate to character zooming around in space capsules or hunkering around the blasted remains of cities.This one, however, starts with a childhood game, and before you know it, you are hooked and sinking fast into the clutches of the characters. I don't want to spoil anything, so all I'll really say about the plot is this: what if everyone had a computer that remembered all your personal numbers and facts, kept all your records for you -- personal, medical and financial -- as well as calculated decisions for you? We are halfway there, with all the Information Age advances? What if there was no more starvation, war, sickness or poverty in the world, no envy or greed o cause such things, thanks to this kind of computerization, would that not be wonderful? As the characters would say, wouldn't that be 'top speed'? You bet.Read the book, it is diamonds. Forgive him for things like Rosemary's Baby, and read the book."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"Throughout the book, one thing I found hard to believe was that a future Orwellian society wouldn't have spy-cameras all over the place. Also listening devices (bugs). This detracted from the overall premise somewhat, as did the TV-movie style climax, but I still found the novel an easy and entertaining read. Recommended primarily for its human freedom angle."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"For those who have never read this story, it was published in 1970. While a lot of our technology has surpassed the technology in the book, it is nothing that diminshes the story.The story is set in a dystopian world, which is totally controlled by a computer called Unicomp. Everyone has been made to look the same and think the same. There is zero free will. The people are almost sexless and are bombarded on a regular basis with mind controlling drugs, which they eagerly line up to receive. Religion and war are things of the past.At an early age, Chip is introduced to some alternative thinking by his Grandpa Jan. Every now and then, Chip wakes up from his drug induced mind control. He soon meets other like minded individuals. This story is about Chip, and his journey to learning the real truth behind Unicomp.It is an exciting journey filled with many dark, hidden secrets."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I read this book a number of times as a teenager, and really enjoyed it. I was so happy to find it in Kindle format and read it again many years later. It's an interesting take on a potential future, with a seemingly utopian society (no disease, hunger, discomfort, or conflict) that still has its problems. Ira Levin's \\"The Stepford Wives\\" is probably his most well-known work, but I think \\"This Perfect Day\\" is the best of his books."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"Christ, Marx, Wood and WeiLed us to this perfect day.Marx, Wei, Wood and Christ,All but Wei were sacrificed.Wood, Wei, Christ and Marx,Gave us lovely schools and parks.Wei, Christ, Marx and Wood,Made us humble, made us good.This amazing book starts off with this eerie chant, which is taught to very young children in school. The story is set in a seemingly perfect global society whose genesis is fuzzy. The story is a strong character-driven one, a glimpse into the future of what could be if the government could \\"create\\" Utopia. Uniformity is the defining feature; there is only one language and all ethnic groups have been eugenically merged into one race called \\"The Family\\"The world is run by a super computer called UniComp, or Uni. Uni is a metaphor for God (or a god-like being) and controls everything, perfectly. Uni is the one who knows you best. Uni knows what job you will be good at, if you'll be married, if you'll have children, how long you will live, where you will live, what you'll eat, drink, do, think. Uni takes care of everyone and everything. Since Uni is father, the members are all brothers and sisters and refer to one another in that way. No decision is left up to you, no worries, no concerns. And if you do question anything, you'll soon forget your concern as you will be given an extra \\"treatment\\" (some sort of transdermal injection that is a mix of tranquilizers, birth control, hormones, etc) and you will become satisfied and compliant immediately. Every member on the planet is controlled by a combination of \\"treatments\\", advisors, self-reporting or reporting of other members and a silver bracelet every member must wear and scan periodically throughout the day, so that Uni knows where you are at all times. You eat at scheduled times (and the only thing you eat are totalcakes and cokes). You sleep when you're told to, watch TV when you're told to - in short, not a second of your day is left up to you. If you display deviant behavior, like going for a walk, someone will report you, not out of malice, but concern and you will be drugged back into compliance.Except ..... there are some members who are immune to the \\"treatments\\". Their minds are not deadened. These people are called \\"The Incurables\\" and are a source of mystery and fear by members. They live somewhere \\"over there\\" and are thought to be miserable creatures, animals almost. It is told that they murder, steal, get sick, die, starve, etc. They are portrayed in such a horrible way so that no-one will become too curious about them or their lifestyle (I feel a little North Korea vs The Rest of The World here). But sometimes, these incurables live among The Family and slowly plot against Uni as is evidenced by the \\"Fight Uni\\" graffiti found sprinkled throughout the public places.I found this book incredibly fascinating. I know a few people to whom the idea of the government taking care of EVERYTHING sounds wonderful. No worries! No need for money because everything is given to you! No issue of having to make a decision or choose, it's already been done! While that may sound nice, most haven't thought of the consequences of such a world. Everything must be balanced, where there is good, there must be bad, otherwise the good loses its meaning. When all decisions are made for someone, without their input, that someone has lost all freedom. Freedom to think, choose, plan. And in the case of Uni and The Family, you have no choice at all. When/where you'll sleep, when/where you'll play, when/what you'll eat, when you'll watch TV, when and if you will be allowed take part in any creative activities (art, music, writing, photography, etc), when you'll have sex (once a week according to Uni). If you're permitted to have children, you'll only be able to choose on of four names for a girl (Anna, Mary, Peace and Yin) or from four boys names (Bob, Jesus, Karl or Li). Instead of a surname, members are distinguished by a \\"nameber\\", a neologism from \\"name\\" and \\"number\\".This book left me feeling a bit unnerved but well entertained. This Perfect Day will definitely be one of those books I'd recommend to anyone who enjoys sci-fi, techno-thrillers, adventure, post-apocalyptic words and suspense. Don't let the sci-fi definition scare you off, this is not about aliens and intergalactic wars. The characters are people living in a future society, an alternative history that would result from a combination of Marxism and a single World Government and serves as a warning to anyone who would push for this type of society. While promoting equality, plenty for all, peace and well-being, all socialistic/communistic societies have a nearly invisible, sometimes secret group who practice meritocracy. This secret group enjoys luxuries far beyond what most of the common people could ever imagine. In This Perfect Day, that group is called the programmers and you'll have to read the book to find out where they fit in!This Perfect Day is a heroic science fiction novel of a technocratic false-utopia. Written by author Ira Levin and published by Open Road Media partnered with Pegasus Books."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I stumbled upon this cult classic by accident and ended up loving every minute of it. Levin's writing flows and creates a story unlike any other. A scary yet eerily realistic distopian society that one could actually see occuring in the not so distant future. I liked this book so much better than Brave New World, although that is a good read as well, this story flows fluidly and moves along at a faster pace. No boring parts in this book.Well worth the time it takes to read. Great reads like this make me thankful that Amazon actually prices Ebooks within reason and for much less than the print price."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"A perfect day it was when this book turned up. I have been hanging on to an old, tattered copy for years, having read it over and over again. My wife suggested I bite the bullet and replace it, so I did.

They are quick, easy reading, totally absorbing. This one stars \\"Chip\\" as in \\"Chip off the old block,\\" which is the hope of his grandfather, part of the dying breed who helped create Uni, the powerful computer that runs the world and keeps everyone drugged just enough not to complain about the fact that lives are in its hands. The evils of this futuristic society are debated among those who manage to escape its grasp, and Levin does a good job of making these renegades believable. The pros and cons of such a world are contrasted with the known evils of our current systems, the trade offs are made starkly clear. But mainly it is just an enjoyable story. It has adventure, danger, and the fascination of entering an entirely new world. The characters are somewhat underdeveloped,but then with all the drugs and genetic manipulation that they endured to make them uniform, it's no wonder they had no depth!Next I'm going to read \\"Brave New World\\" and further explore the genre."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I have read this book in my highschool years a good 25years back.. And I still have the copy from the library :) I looked for a fresh copy for years..and now I have it! This book to me is simply amazing. In the time I read it, communism was still out there. It was extremely relevant and it helped me form my opinion of perfectionism... I have read a few more books since then..few if any have made such an impression on me as this one. The characters are not as well known these days anymore, and the political system has lost its larger following. (Who truly believes China is run following communistic principles..?)Read this and be blown away. The story in the book ends way too soon, but continues in the mind."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"Not really a spoiler alert since it adds literally nothing to the story...I've been annoyed by this book since I finished it. It was an excellent book. It was very interesting and quite good. I'm seriously annoyed by ONE page of this book, where one of the main characters gets raped. It seriously annoys me that it was written like a consensual sex scene and then she ends up married and having kids with the guy. SERIOUSLY? I get that this was written some time ago when it was looked at differently (so I'm told, I wasn't there) but this is one of those circumstances where you go back and edit it out. I know many, MANY people won't agree with altering the book, but this is a case where it adds literally nothing to the story line, character development, or really anything at all. Quite frankly, I don't see that part even making sense and I had a lot of trouble reconciling the rest of the book having read that page. I just kept thinking, \\"Why would she do that, he RAPED her?!\\" the whole time. The only response I can even think of is (gagging as I write this) maybe I'm supposed to think \\"She must have secretly wanted it\\" or some crap.This book would have stood on it's own without that one page. I wasn't even sure how to rate this book. It was good but that one page completely ruined it for me. I would not recommend this book to anyone else honestly because I'd be embarrassed to do so. I don't get offended by much, but that was just unsettling to me in so many ways.Maybe I missed some key part where that page was just a dream (nightmare) or she ended up getting delicious revenge in the end."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"No need to ponder. Buy this book, read this book and recirculate it. Out of print indeed, how can that be possible. I first read this book thirty years ago and found it fascinating, read it again and realized it was great and recently read it again. You just can't get enough of a good thing. Ira Levin rates with Huxley, Orwell and Skinner."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"Wow!!! I just finished reading this book 10 minutes ago and my mind is still reeling. I've read other Levin books, but none have been as prophetic or well-written as This Perfect Day.There are many books out there that fortell the terrors that might occur should our society turn peace-loving and brotherly, but none of them are as thorough. If anyone has ever read The Giver and been troubled by the lack of an ending, all you have to do is read this book. It is a more thorough look in to the consequences of blindly following a leader, and is a guidebook for anyone that tries to think independantly.I strongly urge anyone that doesn't need a good-night's sleep tonight to read this book. It is suspenseful and there is no way you could put it down without finishing it. It beats out all the futuristic thrillers that have ever been around, and the scary thing is that this book was first published in the mid-seventies, long before genitic engeneering had been on everyone's mind."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I've recently been rereading all of Levin's books. This Perfect Day is the one Ira Levin book I hadn't read, so what a treat to be able to discover yet another wonderful book from this master. As usual, a great plot, terrific characters, excellent dialogue all Levin trademarks. Written in 1970, the book is amazingly forward thinking, and effectively predicts laptop computers, Prozac and bar codes"},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books! I read it when I was rather young (a teenager?) and have re-read portions of it many times since.The book particularly grabbed me because my mother was always very over-protective and always made me tell her where I was at every minute of the day. Uni, the computer in the book that made you scan where you were at all times, reminded me of her. I related to Chip's discomfort when he first deliberately passed a scanner without touching it. &quot;Uni doesn't know where I am!&quot; he thought. I too, at that time, felt discomfort when I didn't &quot;touch the scanner&quot; (i.e., call my mom). :)The book had many wonderful touches and insights. I have never forgotten it. It really should have been made into a movie. Fight Uni!"},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I loved this story. The square peg in a round hole world suits me as well, and it was the beginning for Chip too, via his grandfather Jan (imagine: more than four names for boys). I fell in love with Lilac and her physical beauty as well as her determination and adaptibility. Why, oh, why was this never developed into a film!?? I wanted to direct it, or at least play the part of Chip. Hmmmm. Any takers? I'm serious!"},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"A fantastic tale of the horrors of a future society that abdicates freedom in exchange for efficiency. As with The Boys From Brazil, Levin's &quot;This Perfect Day&quot; would seem prophetic if written today, and is astounding considering it predates 1970. Before picking this up, I had no idea Levin had written any science fiction, and was pleased to find this book as thought-provoking and thrilling as his others. The writing was tight, the characters realistic (even for the future), the tone modern, and there were twists throughout. It also ends on a happier note than do many of Levin's other works.Incidentally, &quot;This Perfect Day&quot; reminded me a little of (Heinlein's) Stranger In A Strange Land in terms of its sexually cavalier mores (it is surprisingly passionate), and- as with Stranger's &quot;grok&quot;- in the way some of its catch phrases should be (are (?)) a part of the science fiction vernacular (&quot;Fight Uni&quot;; &quot;Christ, Marx, Wood, and Wei&quot;)."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I first read this book in university as part of a course on anti-utopian novels which included the other oft-mentioned books of that genre (Brave New World, 1984) as well as some lesser known novels (Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano). This was the one that struck me as the most well-rounded theme and most entertaininingly written.Unlike the other novels which merely portrayed the oppressiveness and corruption of a political and social system based on communism or socialism, \\"This Perfect Day\\" clearly contrasts the pros and cons of a \\"free\\" society to those of a carefully-controlled \\"utopia\\". At the end, the reader isn't necessarily sure that the people of that world will be better off without Uni (the computer that regulates their lives) than they were with it.This is a thought-provoking novel with a hero who the reader identifies and sympathizes with. As another reviewer has mentioned, it has particular resonance in post 9/11 America where people are readily surrendering freedom to the government for perceived security and comfort. Unfortunately, it is likely that the clear message that 'communism is bad' will overwhelm the more subtle message that allowing any governing body to make certain types of choices for you in the name of security (be it protection from harm or simply feeling secure about food being on the table at each meal) is not necessarily a good idea."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"This book is a perfect example of a governmentally controlled, utopia gone bad. &quot; This Perfect Day.&quot; Find it and read it and if you can, pass it on to young people. &quot;This Perfect Day&quot; may help others to think for themselves. We need this book now more then ever. Politically correct thinking, loss of personal freedom through fear of terrorism, wanting the government to take better care of us. All of these trends are on the rise and lead to totalitarian life.Ira Levin though writting &quot; This Perfect Day&quot; in 1969 was telling us and warning us about a world that is a possibility in the not so far away future. We are on the internet! Can the imagined Uni be so far behind?It is a crying shame that this book is out of print. It shouldn't be!"},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"Ira Levin, please write more books like this one! I was deeply affected the first time I read it and am every time I reread it - I will be rereading it for the rest of my life. This book takes place in a futuristic society that I found compelling - \\"fight\\" and \\"hate\\" are bad words, because the whole earth is at peace - no wars, no hunger, no big decisions, no illness, no pollution, no lonliness... everyone is your friend, sounds ideal, I wouldn't mind living like that for awhile!The story reads so easily. I loved reading all about the world the main character, Chip, lives in. Everyone's career is chosen for him by the computer running the world, Unicomp (Uni for short). Everyone must report to an advisor on a regular basis, who makes sure everything is alright. Everyone has a \\"nameber\\", a name with a number. Chip's is Li with a bunch of numbers. There are only 4 male names, Li, Jesus, Karl and Bob. Only 4 names for females too - Anna, Peace, Mary and Yin. Everyone wears a bracelet with their nameber and must scan at scanners wherever they go. Everyone must report for chemical treatments once a month.Chip's world is far from perfect, though. It is \\"sick\\" to like one member (everyone is a member of The Family) more than another, to think about what work you would like to do, to draw pictures of people without bracelets, and doing such things and more will cause a member to be tracked down and recieve a stronger treatment.Chip becomes aware that his world isn't that perfect and that he has lost a lot of freedom. The plot thickens as he recieves secret notes from other \\"sick\\" members who invite him to meet him secretly in the night.I won't say more except the story and characters are very gripping, all the way to the end... do yourself a favor and read this book, it is a masterpiece.One final note, why isn't this book in print?

From \\"Uni\\" the ubiquitous master computer governing all, to the severe restrictions on proper names, to the control of food (totalcakes and cokes, anyone?) to the utter trivialization of sexuality (just the opposite from Orwell's \\"1984\\") Levin's work is simply masterful.No spoilers -- but I really enjoyed the ending!Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I don't understand why I was so unaware of this book all these years.

The only thing he left out is all the spying video cameras there are now in the US, and especially, Great Britain. But that could have made the story difficult to tell as the principle characters do a lot of sneaking around for midnight meetings for the sake of plotting the underminement of the PTB (The Powers That Be).

I first read the book when I was very young, and was captivated by it. I really couldn't put it down, reading the book in a day (through all my classes no less). It encourages the reader to question some of the more perverse byproducts of society. I think it also encourages independent thought, and ethical decision making. Ira Levin, is very forward thinking in regards to technology and socialist development in society, as demonstrated in the novel. Some of the technology mentioned in the novel has yet come to pass, but we are now in an era where we can wrap our minds around it. I believe the reason why the book is not in print is because it encourages the reader to question certain aspects of authority, and is rooted in activism.

The story involves a society based on the principles of Karl Marx, Jesus Christ, and two invented social philosophers (Bob Wood and Wei Li Chun). In Levin's \\"perfect\\" world, there is only one language, only eight accepted names (4 for males and 4 for females), and all people (called \\"members\\") have been eugenically blended into a homogenous quasi-Asian \\"Family.\\" Members are administered monthly \\"treatments\\" (injections of vitamins, supplements, drugs, and tranquilizers) that keep them healthy, docile, and easily controllable (all strong emotions, violent tendencies, sexual passion, and radical thinking are suppressed medically). Everything is supposedly controlled by a massive super-computer called \\"Uni,\\" which has everyone's best interests at heart. Levin's story is about Chip, a young man who begins to question the validity of the society in which he lives - Chip becomes a hero who struggles mightily against his upbringing and works to destroy Uni and allow humanity to be human once again.The book is interesting, and it's a quick and compelling read. There's a lot that will remind you of \`Brave New World,' including the role of sex and drugs as ways to control the masses, reliance on socialist philosophy to justify a totalitarian government, and even Chip's renegade character, who seems very much like Huxley's \`Savage.' Both novels end with their heroes engaged in extended philosophical conversations with the leaders of their respective societies. And both are really proclaiming \\"the right to be unhappy,\\" as Huxley's \`Savage' puts it (in Levin's novel, it's one of a small group of rebels who says she wants \\"the happiness of sadness, or maybe the sadness of happiness\\"). The problem is, Huxley's philosophical debate is challenging and difficult to categorize - he's asking us to consider what role \\"happiness\\" really should play in human existence. Is it worth the sacrifice of art and true feeling and the pain of experience . . .just to be \\"happy\\"? Levin's novel asks that same question, but much more simply - and while Huxley will make you think, Levin makes it all too easy to know the bad guys from the good guys.\`This Perfect Day' is worth reading. If you like it, read \`Brave New World,' too . . . and \`Logan's Run,' and \`The Giver.' And try Ursula K. LeGuinn's story, \\"The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas\\" - it will make you think, too."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"Chip is being raised in a society that for the most part is organized and has its resources adjusted by computer.

Anything you want to find, try amazon.com first."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"This book is on or even above par with George Orwell's 1984.With detail,the story unfolds gently and is truly creatine.Ira Levin's ideas about technological abuse are disturbing."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"A young person reading this novel in the 70s was horrified at the Orwellian snooping. A young person reading it today would wonder what the fuss is about. He has become one of the citizens in the novel who blindly acquiece to a Big Brother government in the name of a phony promise of protection from terrorism."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"While overshadowed by more popular dystopia novels like 1984 and Brave New World, I think this book is the most powerful of its genre. As the novel begins, the entire human race has been unified. To continue this peaceful state of affairs (the word \`fight \` at this time is a filthy obscenity, while the other \`f' word is perfectly acceptable), all people (members as they are called) wear bracelets which are held to scanners to gain access to all places and most activities. These scanners are read by Uni-comp, the huge computer that constantly monitors all activities of all members. Once a month, each member is given a treatment, an injection that prevents diseases and also tranquilizes the member to a state of semi-mindless conformity. That our hero, Chip (actually his nickname - at this time there are only eight names, four for males, four for females) frees himself from his bracelet and mind numbing treatments and plans to destroy Uni is perhaps predictable. What he finds when he gets there is certainly not; that is when the real fun begins. A great book! Levin does a marvelous job describing the antiseptic world that Uni runs, the filthy but free island Chip escapes to, and the final setting that is too cool to even mention."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"This Perfect Day is indeed the most &quot;perfect&quot;insight of computer vs man that has been written.I would like to know just how Mr Levin could come up with such clairvoyance.Jules Verne,George Orwell,Nostrodamos,all take a backseat to the master of soothsaying,IRA LEVIN!! A must read. FIGHT UNI!!!!!"},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"More than any of the other dystopic classics - 1984, BNW - this novel continues to color the way I look at the world. Although written with very simple language, Levin really captures the spirit of the philosophy &quot;the unexamined life is not worth living.&quot; This book can really make you question the values of everything comfortable, mainstream. It will make you a rebel! FIGHT UNI!"},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I could go on and on about this book. It ranks as one of my all time favorites. I reccommend it to anyone and everyone. Everyday as I put my ID badge into the scanner at work and wait for it to blink green or red, I think about this book. Everytime I plug mylaptop into the internet, I think about this book. Everytime a surly clerk demands my Social Security number &quot;Because it is easier for the computer&quot;, I think about this book."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"This is one of the finest pieces of social fiction I have ever read. It goes to the blackest heart of all mankind and displays our greed and avarice for all to see. It also shows the all-consuming fire we have allowed the &quot;marketers&quot; to fuel within us that we should be young and beautiful, as well as rich and smart!However, it gives us hope that there are those among us who are not consumed by these things. It shows bravery and the love of the human heart in its quest to simply BE.Success is in the eye of the beholder. To me, it is a farm with animals around me. To the hero of this book, it is simply choices -- simple choices.A MUST READ for those who are disgusted with the &quot;beautiful people&quot; of our age. They fear aging and death. But most of all, they fear their own frailties. We must embrace life and all its aspects. This is the guidebook."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I read this book way back in high school. In the past 5 years I have had such a case of deja-vu with the advent of bar codes, &quot;Saver Club&quot; cards, internet, database management, etc. This book is almost (frighteningly) prophetic in its portrayal of a society where all movement is tracked by scanners that read the ID of individuals who pass their coded bracelets in front of it. (Ever wonder about your &quot;Rewards&quot; card. It's bar-coded with your ID to track the time, location, and specifics of your purchases....) The carefully regulated health-care that predetermines fertility, birth, and death does not seem out of reach of the larger HMO's. I think the time is ripe for a re-print of this book. If the price is not too dear, I would love to have a copy to read again. In high school, I remember a lot of folks couldn't get past the language and depiction of sex. But I believe the author was trying to point out the exploitation of the sex drive is the perfect distraction for a society that has surrendered all control."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I found this book in a bargain store for 25 cents. When I saw it I knew it was for me. Since then I have read it 3 times and cherish it even more. This book is a must for anybody who reads utopian books. This Perfect Day, ranks at the top with Brave New World, We, and 1984."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"This perfect day may well be Ira Levin's most prophetic work. Only Nostradaemus has predicted more of the technology that now weaves itself into our daily existence.Moving from laptop computers to genetic engineering Mr.Levin paints a picture of technology run amok and intent on the complete removal of individuality.&quot;Chips&quot; determination to push his unconventional values beyond the limits of his known world are an adventure through the realm of self realization, and the consequence of failing to comply with the status quo. Thank goodness we have hero's like &quot;chip&quot; who's only goal is to be himself, perhaps life's hardest battle.The struggles are classic, the characters are everyman.There are few books that have the ability to really change the way people think ,this is one book that will."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"Ira Levins does not disappoint. Every book that I have read that he has written has been wonderful and suspenseful to the very last page. This book is no different.THIS PERFECT DAY is the story of a society that is controlled by a computer called Uni. People receive treatments on a regular basis to keep them docile. There is no crime, no disease, no want. Uni decides who people will marry and what their occupation will be. The only downside to the existence created by Uni is that people all die at age 62 and you can choose nothing for yourself.So, what happens if you begin to question this modified existence?Chip finds a group of people who, like himself, have decided to think for themselves. Their ultimate goal is escape the holds of Uni and maybe oneday destroy it. Utopia is not so blissful after all.As with most utopian novels, this one does not sing the praises of a utopian society. Instead, it exposes its flaws. The book is predictable but, nevertheless, ejoyable."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I started reading 'This Perfect Day' when I was 12 years old. I haven't stopped reading it yet! To think that Ira Levin could have such insights into the future in the 1960's! SOMEONE PLEASE MAKE THIS BOOK INTO A MOVIE BEFORE I AM FORCED TO DO IT MYSELF! I swear, I've read this book so many times I could probably quote any scene verbatim! I consider this book to be THE masterpiece of Ira Levin's body of work. Absolutely thrilling. This could be the best action-thriller of the century."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"This perfect day, even the title resonates, oscillating between satire and dogma, literal and rhetoric, this novel is to me Ira Levin's best work. A future perverted on so many levels and yet only a hair removed from our own reality, the seeds of our current rigid society are painted in these words. The prison of our own existences is reflected and revealed in this novel.This novel may shake you from your consumer addled stupor and question the path of your existence, at least if you read it right. It is very subversive, but with a subtlety and charm that seduces you before you even notice your naked.The world undone, unspun, sliced to the raw dimensions of greed and power worn in different degrees by all and laid bare before you through a well thought out dramatic arc that holds you engaged until the last page falls from your clutching hands.The echos between this fictional world and the path we walk daily are merely a matter of degree and subtlety, of dogma and propaganda. Step through the mirror and forget which side was your world, and which was not."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I'm a big fan of dystopian science fiction, but I'd never heard of this before stumbling across it on Amazon. It turns out to be one of the best books in this genre, in my opinion. It is deeply believable, populated with characters you can care about, and extremely thought-provoking. I didn't want the end of the book to come."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"No point in recapping what everyone else has said other than this is at the top of my favorites list (along with Friday, Down to a Sunless Sea and Alas Babylon). I was thrilled to see that this is now back in print although I wish it was a large format paperback. Being back in print gives me hope that a movie will be forthcoming. With the technology today, a society of look alike members should be fairly simple to accomplish. However, perhaps this is too controversial for Hollywood as it ultimately against socialism (albeit a far extreme socialist society).

I first read this book in the seventies and loved it then, holding onto my copy for many years. Unfortunately I've moved several times and lost it--so I'm replacing it even though the cover is different now.I loved the characters and the premise, which even after all these years makes you take a double-take at our current society and think about what we could become--scary, indeed! A great read then, and now."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"This book is very reminiscient of books like 1984 and Brave New World, and was written after both of them.

Then I heard this chant in my mind which somehow triggered This Perfect Day!"},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"Being a fan of &quot;The Prisoner&quot; TV series of the early 70's I see a common philosophy here. When first written I am sure this story was a novelty to most, and the premise far-fetched. Re-reading this story now is a chilling experience. Much of the technology Levin described is plausable especially today, but that is only &quot;window dressing&quot; for the real story, and the message is more relevant today than when Levin wrote it. Chip, is a hero for all of us. The only reason I rated this a &quot;9&quot; and not a &quot;10&quot; is I wish the book were 100 pages longer to better develop the depth and flavor of this future world."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"This Perfect Day was introduced to me 6 years ago by a friend of a friend. He knew I was a fan of 1984 and Brave New World and thought this would interest me. The only copy I could find was in my school's library, and I hate to admit that I lied and said I lost it just so I could keep it. This story fascinated me because it seemed to be more realistic than either Huxley's or Orwell's vision of the future. It was a kind of happy medium between utter tyranny and total hedonism. The genetic engineering, selective breeding,the inter-changability of members, and especially the reduction of one's identity to a nameber, all seem within reach of today's society. I think it was the concept of the nameber which really stuck. It reminded me of college where you were only known bu your social security number. The novel is well-written, flows easily, and makes the idea of everything in the world being controlled by a giant computer completely feasible. I devoured it the first time I read it, and continue to do so every time I pick it up."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"... this book shows the logical result after the &quot;we know what's good for you&quot; crowd gets control.

It's one of my favorite futuristic books and I know everyone will love it."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"Ira Levin is my favorite writer, and this is definitely his best book. What begins as a science fiction novel about a futuristic society soon becomes an intriguing story of one man's quest for individuality and free choice in a society dominated by computers. Indeed, the protagonist is almost predestined to be the saviour of this society, since he was born with different-colored eyes, a feature which makes him stand out from the very beginning. Ira Levin is so skillful a writer that the reader can really empathize with the protagonist and understand his actions, even though we are, thank God, still far from living in his kind of future hell"},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"Well written book that stayed with me after I was through reading A classic that I will probably read again in the future."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"First of all, I bought this when it was on sale for $.99, so...I can't believe they're charging almost $10 for the kindle version. It's too bad because this is a really good book and I think more people would read it and enjoy it if it was priced lower.Anyway, this book did an excellent job with creating a character arc...one who goes through changes - logical changes, unless like some books - and as the book builds to it's conclusion, you are constantly left wondering if Chip will realize that the world is better off as it is, or will he wake up and try to change things?I read this book in a couple of days. It kept my attention completely and I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"This is an interesting read. It's set in a future dystrophic world. Everything is controlled by UniComp, a world computer who knows all. Chip, the main character, is not quite the same as his peers. He doesn't quite follow the Family and *gasp* questions UniComp. Chip has an interesting journey and makes for a good read."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I read an article that mentioned this book and bought the Kindle edition on a whim. I don't regret that decision at all. This book was a very good, quick, entertaining read."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"This underrated cult classic tells us of a future where there is no \\"selfishness, aggressiveness, or greed\\" Each is given what he needs, each gives all he can. And all this is enforced by monthly injections or \\"treatments\\", and administered by a worldwide computer called Uni.Our hero, Chip, is born into this culture. But in childhood, he is influenced by his strange (by their standards) grandfather, who dies at at about the same age that everyone seems to, and as an adult, comes under the influence of a group of mild rebels. But Chip seeks more. And exactly why does a map in a historical museum show islands not shown on current world maps?A fine book, which grapples with the questions of life, liberty, and self-will, and leaves you to find your own answer at the end. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"At age 58 I cannot remember when I first read this book. It's not that I am losing my mind, but it was that long ago. I have haunted used book stores, flea markets and online, and have bought several hard backs and soft backs so that I am not without a copy of this book (Does this ring of the movie \\"Conspiracy Theory and the Catcher in the Rye\\"). I also shared this book with my daughter who is not as much a reader as I am and she loved it too. I cannot understand why this book has not been brought back into print, used as mandatory reading in school and also perhaps made into a movie. Ira Levin has had other books made into movies. I am not going review the story but is there anyone out there who wants it not to end when it does? I have read this book once a year for years and like a small child, keep thinking something will click and I will see whether life on the Island will improve once Chip returns...how will the untreated survive... Also I think that Chip and others due to small differences than the norm are more liable to rebel and this is what the powers that be (Programers, is that what they call themselves...hmmm) were watching for.As a child I was a science fiction freak and I still love it if I can find a good futuristic society book such as \\"Beggers In Spain\\" and now I am a Stephen King/horror/mystery freak. But what can I say, ask me what my favorite book is and it will always be, THIS PERFECT DAY!!!"},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"How can this book possibly be out of print?For anyone who hasn't read it yet: it belongs alongside _A Clockwork Orange_ among the great literary portrayals of individualism-vs.-collectivism. (I've never been much of a fan of either _1984_ or _Brave New World_, which are usually listed as the top two. And Ayn Rand's annoying novella _Anthem_ is just . . . well, annoying.)It is the tale of a lad named Chip, in a future world in which the great socialist dream has finally been realized. Preferring one person to another is a sign of social maladjustment. &quot;Fight&quot; is a dirty word; &quot;f**k&quot; is just the usual term for an activity no more important than sleeping or urination. Everyone is told what to do by &quot;Uni,&quot; the great computer that organizes society and keeps track of everyone's location via electronic bracelet. (And one of the dirtiest, most maladjusted and antisocial expressions anyone can utter is &quot;Fight Uni.&quot;)There is, in short, no more &quot;juice&quot;: all the oranges are clockwork now. Until . . . ah, but that would spoil things, wouldn't it?So ATLAS SHRUGGED is still chugging along on the best-seller lists, turning unwitting victims into narcissistic misunderstood geniuses -- but this brilliant novel is out of print. What's wrong with this picture?I'm sure glad I still have my old hardcover copy."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I have a trio of excellent dystopian books which can never stay on my bookshelf very long. They are the eugenic dystopia of /Brave New World/, the psychological dystopia of /1984/, and the technological dystopia of /This Perfect Day/.Why, I wonder, is the final one of these out-of-print and forgotten, unlike its two companions? It can't be the sex scenes, because all three books have them. It can't be the writing style, because /This Perfect Day/ is at least on par with /Brave New World/ (although nowhere near Orwell's perfection). It must simply be the fact that the idea had already been done twice before, which is a shame.Ira Levin puts a great new spin on the already defined genre; exactly three times I thought the book was finished, only to turn the page and find that the adventure continues on. Unlike the brutal justice of the other two, /This Perfect Day/ comes up with a logical, humane, and easier solution to discard the aberrant members of its society.This book deserves more publicity, and one day it might get it. Buy it now while it's still cheap."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"From the first time I read this book in 1974 as an 8th grader, this Utopian type society seemed so far away & unrealistic. Now at 45, I fear it is getting closer. Members getting \\"treatments\\"? Think Prozac. People that are compliant, pleasant & \\"speak no evil\\"? Think political correctness gone mad. Smoking forbidden? Even closer. Reproduction being controlled with no choice? Sounds like George W. at work here. Hmm... how will the world be when I am 75?This book should be required reading for High School Literature classes across the country, to open up discussions of personal rights, creativity, freedom & socialism. Think of the ways Levin's masterpiece could be applied to show kids just what \\"sheep\\" they are becoming!I find as I get older & read this book over again, there are more important lessons about individuality, following the crowd & what we expect from ourselves & others as a society. What kind of world stifles creativity & self-expression for the sake of \\"harmony\\"?

People get \\"treatments\\" regularly (injected medications) designed to even their moods and make them conform to societal norms.In a world where we drug our kids for \\"ADHD\\" and political correctness and sameness are celebrated, this story remains very prophetic indeed. Levin doesn't make a single misstep here. It's utterly terrifying, because this is the way the world is headed. If you can find the book, please get it and read it.P.S. at least one review claims the book is about \\"the great socialist dream\\" or a socialist society. In my opinion this is unfair, as the society portrayed in this story is far to the left of socialism -- really, it's communism/marxism being portrayed here."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I first read &quot;Logan's Run&quot; when I was 14, and I loved it; I first read &quot;This Perfect Day&quot; when I was 34, and I adored it. The two are often compared, probably because they were both seen as symptomatic of their time (the late 1960s), but whereas Logan was always destined to outrun his persuers, it was never clear until the very last page of TPD whether Chip would succeed or not. The suspense is impeccable, as is the reasoning (particularly the image of the leaf on the rock...); buy this book now!

If it wasn't, then there would be something really wrong going on here. For fans of negative utopia novels such as Orwell's 1984 and Burgess's A Clockwork Orange, This Perfect Day is not to be missed as it compares favorably to both works (it exceeds them, in my humble opinion). Although Rosemary's Baby, The Stepford Wives, The Boys from Brazil and, I think, even Needle were made into movies, this is Levin's most brilliant novel and one of the most perfectly crafted stories ever written. Some of the other reviewers have said the book should be made into a movie; I disagree. This is a story about subtle ideas and the action is somewhat sedate. I doubt it would be popular with the proletariat. Not all great stories translate to the screen.Having said that, this book is fiction entertainment at its best. The story is compelling without being preachy and deep without being boring. Though published in 1970, it still accurately holds a mirror to the society we are today and juxtaposes it against Levin's future society of the supercomputer. Find out how Chip Green-Eye finds his destiny in a world where computerization + chemotherapy = no change.

Maybe it is just my morals but I'm pissed that the hero of this book is basically a pig. There is an instance of rape in this book which I understand won't bother some people, but others it might. So heads up.Also, if you're one of those people that finds flaws in storylines (&#34;this could never happen because of this&#34;) then this book will drive you insane.I love dystopian novels but this was not one of them. Maybe it gets five stars because of the sex. But for me it takes more than sex and a bunch of disjointed ideas to impress me."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I bought and read this novel when it was first published in 1970, and held onto my copy for four decades figuring that someday I'd read it again. I just did, and it holds up very well. The society Levin describes remains plausible and frightening, and a lot closer than it did when he first imagined it. Yes, the worldwide personal tracking system he describes seems a bit primitive now, but the overall \\"feel\\" of the \\"unified\\" society he depicts rings true. The newly-passed Obama-Pelosi \\"healthcare\\" plan could eventually lead to the compulsory medical treatments every citizen must submit to, and the omnipresent scanners and cameras are already becoming ubiquitous. Levin was a gifted and imaginative writer, and this novel ranks up there with the works of Aldous Huxley and Philip K. Dick. I'm glad it's being reissued later this year; it's a timeless work that every generation should have the opportunity to enjoy."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I don't remember how I came to own this book, maybe through a bookclub, but I read it years ago.

( I have read \\"1984\\" \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" etc) I have somehow lost my copy and am sorry that I didn't hold onto it.

And the ending... the ending is spot-on.And then I read Vision of the Anointed by Thomas Sowell, and wow! What a month for philosophy."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"This book has been in my thoughts for years. The fist time I read it, I was 13 years old and enjoyed the story immensly, but the phophetic way that Levin has wriitten the story was lost on me until just lately. Seeing the way society tracks us through bar coding and &quot;Club&quot; cards has reminded me of Chips fight for individualism in a world of sameness. I had found a copy in the eighties, but lost it again, much to my dismay. If you are lucky enough to find this title, read it well, and learn. The future is not far away."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I'll admit right up front that I'm not a fan of dystopian fiction. However, I am a fan of Ira Levin (both his novels and his plays). \\"This Perfect Day\\" was published in 1970 - after his play \\"Dr Cook's Garden\\" (1967) and before his novels \\"The Stepford Wives\\" (1972) and \\"The Boys from Brazil\\" (1978). I site these three works because they too deal with issues of creating the \\"perfect\\" society through euthanasia, genetic engineering or cloning.Set far in the future the entire world is under the control of Uni - a computer programed with a mix of philosophical dogma based on Christianity and Marxism among others. Everyone is drugged with a lithium cocktail to ensure domestic harmony. No one ever gets too angry, horny or overjoyed, and everyone is equal. Docility is the objective. A society where no one lives past the age of sixty-two (the optimum age to die); everyone eats and drinks the same things, look basically the same (everyone's complexion is the same and all are approximately the same height and weight) and has passionless sex once a week (hetero only). All needs are provided - shelter, food, and healthcare. All members of the family are classified to determine their vocation, and a pre-determined few are allowed to have children.Anyone with a reasonable degree of intelligence will be able to guess where this story is headed. Yes, rebellion. Our hero \\"Chip\\" would rather think for himself, express himself...feel more. I'm not going to reveal more.Of the four works mentioned above, \\"This Perfect Day\\" is my least favourite. It lacks the tight construction of the aforementioned works. The author falls into the narrative trap of needless reiteration; belabouring his points to the brink of tedium. I say brink because just when you're ready to hurl the book across the room, its forward momentum kicks in again. Now, that sounds harsh...though I didn't love the book, I did find the story interesting and thought provoking. So, is it worth reading? Certainly; especially to those who don't mind protracted narratives, the redundant expression of ideas or who simply fancy dystopian stories."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"UNBELIEVABLE...that he never wrote a sequel. Was he afraid that he couldn't match himself? Without a doubt the best work he's ever done. WHY HAS IT NEVER BEEN MADE INTO A MOVIE??? Not to mention it is out of print. I was forced to pay [a lot] for a paperback, and would pay twice for a good hard cover."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"A very enjoyable read about a dystopian society controlled by a lovely supercomputer called UNI. The books centers around the protagonist named Chip, who's an average Joe living as a member of the 'Family'. Each individual receives weekly/monthly injections by a computer in order to keep them thinking the way they should. At any time a member acts 'sick' they receive a shot that puts them back in line.Although I'm not a sci-fi reader, I do enjoy an occasional dystopian novel such as 1984, Brave New World, Oryx & Crake. This had fit into the category, however I wasn't quite sure if it would go down easily as would a non-sci book go. Well I am very happy that i did give this wonderful book a try.This Perfect Day gives you an idea of what a future society might look like, as controlled by a centralized entity in order to keep an eye/control the population. All individuals are treated very similarly and act as if they are brothers and sisters. The computer allows no individual decisions to be made, but rather makes the decisions regarding everything. Everyone always has a smile on their face, and only does the 'right' thing.I think this books poses a lot of moral questions, as to what is wrong and what is right, how should people live. Do we live in a society that has a positive outlook on life, or not? I believe the book will be able to give a reader a better understanding of societies in general. It will stay in your mind, long after you've finished it.Highly Recommended!!!"},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I first read This Perfect Day sometime around my Junior High School years. I've read it a few times since then, and just had to pick it up at least once more. This book is a classic - check that - this book is THE CLASSIC of this genre.Imagine a world where society is drugged into compliance, manners, and unity. In fact, everyone is genetically engineered and a computer controls who has children, what job you have, where you live, and even when you die. Imagine not being able to imagine freedom, choices, or liberty. Enter the main character, Chip, who as a child, is exposed to \\"strange ideas\\" from his grandfather that don't tow the line of \\"the family.\\" This is Chip's journey through a perfectly controlled society and his struggle against having to fit conform.A powerful book, well before its time. We have the technological capabilities today to repress the masses like Levin writes. It's a chilling look into what could be.Pick it up, read it, and then expect to read it again. It's that good."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"This Perfect Day. Thank you thank you thank you Kindle for adding this book to your vast library. I requested it some time ago.I read this book at least 30 years ago and read it over and over. I have the hard cover version and keep it protected. I think there was a movie some years ago about this story, but can't remember much about it.It's a very interesting story that makes you think about our future and the future of man kind. It seems like we are headed in that direction.

The story soon shifts into other topics (no spoilers here) and there's plenty material here that is original and and compelling. It gets five stars because the end was quite a surprise. Levin doesnt want to offer any _simple_ story about the future of human society and he manages to ask many of the right questions without offering any pat answers. Great storytelling."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I still have my copy from 1972 or so...even though I have lent it out often over the years.This is a first rate read even now...maybe more so.Looking for a good one amongst the waaay too many series types on kindle?Here it is..."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"Years ago I had this book on tape (cassette tape... that should date me a bit LOL) and I listened to it so many times I wore it out.

(Or maybe just coincidence.)Lois Lowry's pseudo-utopia in \\"The Giver\\" also bears a lot of similarity to this book. Again, maybe coincidence -- the idea of a world where all sensation and passion is muted springing from our fear of such a thing."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I join the other reviewers of This Perfect Day who plead that it be brought back in print. I just re-read it. It is, on this second reading, as suspensful and as insightful as I remembered from when I first read it in 1978. Chip's struggle to rescue his humanity from the noxious grip of the state is inspiring (and quite entertaining!).This Perfect Day should be made into a movie."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"But, it was definitely food for thought as to what a futuristic society could be like.

He searches for lost clues to find other people within the society who share similar suspicions about the government and who believe there is a better life elsewhere. This search for freedom takes the reader on an exciting journey of twists and unexpected turns culminating in a spectacular conclusion. I first read this book back in the '70s ... it was a favourite then and after searching for and buying it on Amazon some 35 years later I still found it a great read. The scary part is how society has evolved to the point where some of the (societal control) aspects in the book are either in place or quite conceivable now.

The book should be required reading for all first year college students & we can hope that they will give it some serious thought as well as enjoy it as much as its' faithful readers do. I used to think that it would happen in my lifetime but probably not & I am so glad that it isn't our way of life quite yet. I have always been afraid that we would not end up in a Utopian lala land that is as mindless & pleasant as the book portrays. There is a wonderful kindness to all the calm, peaceful days in their lives."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"I first read \\"This Perfect Day\\" back in the 70's, and agree it is a memorable contribution to dystopian sci-fi fiction. Yet, oddly, when the subject of science fiction books and science fiction authors comes up, the name of Ira Levin is rarely mentioned. Why this is so has always puzzled me, since a number of Levin's novels were indeed science fiction, including \\"This Perfect Day\\", \\"The Boys From Brazil\\", \\"The Stepford Wives\\", and others. Today, Michael Crichton fills Levin's former role as the \\"science fiction writer who isn't considered a science fiction writer\\".Getting back to \\"This Perfect Day\\", it certainly does compare favorably to other dystopian novels of the past, such as Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\", Orwell's \\"1984\\", and Burgess' \\"A Clockwork Orange\\". In addition, I would like to add a new dystopian novel to that short list called \\"Hold Back This Day\\", by Ward Kendall. After reading Mr. Kendall's book, it was clear he had been influenced by Levin's book (note the similar titles) and by Huxley's work (main character in HBTD is named \\"Huxton\\") and by Orwell's dark vision too (a ruthless police state also rules in HBTD) However, a unique element in Kendall's book is that it deals with something that no other science fiction novel has ever dealt with before--the threat of white racial extinction in a brutal, multiculturalized-controlled world of the future. Reading Kendall's book brought back fond memories of \\"This Perfect Day\\" for me, even though the two books share only a few superficial similarities. Both I highly recommend."},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","review":"Ira Levin - please put this book back in print. We need it now more than ever. Thanks.

I really enjoyed Casterton's tone, and her exploration of poetry was fun, but it was not exactly the best practical guide for a beginning creative writing course. First of all, as a writer, I delve into all four main genres, for I am a novelist, a playwright, a poet, and I spend a great deal of time writing creative fiction as well. Casterton's examinations of various facets of writing can help an established writer with each elements somewhat, but the chapters are so brief and sometimes so enigmatic that I am unsure what the writer is supposed to gain from the chapter. Perhaps it is just that her style is unlike mine, but some examples of \\"humor\\" or \\"good dialogue\\" made me wonder. They seemed neither humorous nor good, and I believe my students probably wondered about them as well.In general, I think the book is fine, but I would not suggest using it for a writing course. The poetry writing assignments (and examples) are not exactly stimulating, and the organization and development of the chapters really do not lend themselves to a classroom environment.

Therapeutic Touch is based on several principles, two of which are &quot;illness is an imbalance in an individual's energy field&quot; and &quot;human beings have natural abilities to transform and transcend their conditions of living.&quot;Therapeutic Touch was developed and refined by Dr. Dolores Krieger and Dora Kunz, based on their studies of ancient healing practices. They've since taught the procedure to thousands of health care practitioners and laypersons.Dr. Krieger's book, Accepting Your Power to Heal: The Personal Practice of Therapeutic Touch, teaches readers how help themselves and their loved ones with Therapeutic Touch. The process involves &quot;centering&quot; yourself, then becoming sensitive to the energy fields all living beings have.Therapeutic Touch can be used to help people relax, to reduce pain, and accelerate healing. Dr. Krieger provides numerous examples of benefits, including relief from the pain of cancer, headaches, burns, and fractured bones. Therapeutic Touch is also helpful to pregnant women and people suffering from chronic conditions like asthma. Some people have also used it to help their pets, while others have used it in their gardens.Accepting Your Power to Heal has been on the book stands for several years.

Jonses's follow-up to his Pulitzer Prize winning debut novel \\"The Known World\\" (2003) is most assuredly one of them. Once again he uses short story formats to illuminate and make memorable his characters, ordinary people, really, but to the reader they are unforgettable. This author's evocation of black life in America is incomparable.The 14 stories that comprise \\"All Aunt Hagar's Children\\" are set in Washington, the city where Jones was raised and now lives. He opens with \\"In The Blink of God's Eye,\\" the story of Ruth and Aubrey, a young couple in their late teens and recently married. Ruth does not always rest well in \\"godforsaken Washington\\" while Aubrey \\"always slept the sleep of a man not long out of boyhood.\\" One night when Ruth was wakeful she went out in back where she found a baby tied in a bundle hanging from a tree limb. Thus, she thought Washington was \\"a city where they hung babies in night trees.\\"As is his wont Jones treats readers to the earlier lives of his characters, rendering them all the more accessible and sympathetic. This is especially true in \\"Resurrecting Methuselah\\" in which we meet Anita Channing who sits by the bedside of Bethany, her ill daughter. She sits in a wooden chair built a century and a half ago by a former slave. Anita's husband, Percival, is serving in Okinawa, where he spends much time with a prostitute, Sara Lee. When Percival discovers he has breast cancer he calls Anita and asks her to come to him. She reaches Honolulu, a stopover in her flight, where she has an opportunity to look back on her childhood and wonder what the future holds for herself and her child.\\"All Aunt Hagar's Children\\" concludes with \\"Tapestry,\\" another story of a young couple, Anne and George, marrying and leaving their rural roots behind. George is a porter on a train, the train that carries them to Washington. As the train slows close to its destination Anne whispers, Mama, Papa, \\"I'm a long way from home.\\"For this reader that was the gist of all of these marvelous stories, people seeking a better life a long way from home.Jones is such an incredibly gifted writer, his prose is succinct, true, impeccably crafted. Reading his work is not only a pleasure but a privilege as well.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"All Aunt Hagar's Children","review":"Reviewed by Joanna Pearson for Small Spiral NotebookSince the 2003 publication of his novel The Known World, Edward P. Jones has picked up the occasional award--a MacArthur here, a Pulitzer there--but had there been any doubt about his place in the pantheon, his new book of short stories, All Aunt Hagar's Children, secures it. Taken as a whole, Jones's works (including his 2004 short-story collection Lost in the City) do for 20th-century Washington, D.C., what Joyce's Dubliners did for Dublin: create that city within our literary imaginations.This is not the Washington of bright-faced interns brandishing fresh degrees. Jones's city is a place where African-Americans newly arrived from the rural South grapple with their first experience of urban life in the early 1900's and then continue to make lives for themselves into the mid-twentieth century. Although Jones depicts this time, when certain parts of rural community life still remained intact, with great nostalgia, his characters all struggle within the vast new loneliness of urban life. In the book's the first story, \\"In the Blink of God's Eye,\\" two newlyweds move to Washington from Virginia:[Aubrey] smiled when he said Ruth's name, and he smiled when he told people he was going to live in Washington, D.C. Ruth had no feeling for Washington. She had generations of family in Virginia, but she was a married woman and had pledged to cling to her husband. And God had the baby in the tree and the story of the wolves in the roads waiting for her.Ruth's fear that wolves roam the D.C. streets seems symptomatic of her new loneliness and vulnerability as a result of her sudden distance from the Virginia family that used to surround her. The baby is a foundling Ruth insists on bringing home, even though the baby's presence threatens her husband, who fears this impenetrable closeness between the woman he married and a child who is not his own. As Ruth's love for this orphaned baby grows and her feelings for her husband weaken, it becomes clear that in this new city, family will come to be defined not as the people you're supposed to love but as the people you actually do love--a change that will affect both Aubrey and Ruth's lives permanently.This story, set as it is in 1901, seems to forecast the new but delicate sort of family life that will evolve as the twentieth century unfolds--the family life of the Washington neighborhood, still steeped in a collective Southernness--that Jones explores in the stories that follow. This is a Washington of old women whom all the neighborhood children call Grandma, and festive Saturdays on H Street; a place where everyone has an aunt in Alabama and Mississippi, and the devil could swim right across the Anacostia River. Even this new urban family, however, will not be completely viable.In the story \\"A Rich Man,\\" Horace, the seventy-something charmer and flirt of a senior citizens' residence, takes up with a bunch of twenty-something partiers. Horace thinks that his new life is exactly what he's always wanted, until his new friends end up stealing from under his nose and he finds himself in unexpected trouble. Sometimes, Jones suggests, you don't really want what you've hoped for. Or, as in the story \\"Root Worker,\\" maybe you yourself have perpetuated the trouble of those you seek to help. In this story a young doctor must accompany her ailing mother when the elderly woman seeks treatment from a traditional healer in rural North Carolina. For Glynnis, the doctor, this collision is uncomfortable, but the trip ultimately gives her insight into both herself and her family, as well as a belief of sorts in the bad voodoo of her own making.The sectarianism of Washington lurking in the periphery of these stories is writ in black and white. But the divisions extend further than simple race, and Jones doesn't shy away from exploring the classism that emerges with the African-American neighborhoods. These families in Washington have new aspirations for advancing in class and acquiring wealth, and some families have the access to higher education to make good. The story \\"Bad Neighbors\\" illustrates this beautifully. Sharon grows up to marry the groomed, Howard-educated good neighbor boy. Meanwhile, Derek and his family, the \\"bad neighbors\\" with their run-down cars and ragged-looking children, serve as a reminder of the image that the rest of the community is trying to escape. They are kicked out of their house by their neighbors. Even so, it is Derek who demonstrates the grace, loyalty, and good timing to help Sharon when she needs it years later.These stories amount to clean, aching storytelling from a master. Many reviewers have referred to Jones's God-like perspective, from which he reveals, often within the same sentence, hints about a character's past, present, and future--he'll often throw chronology aside and hint at how the distant future will relate to a particular character, like the narrative voiceover in a history documentary. Perhaps in lesser hands, this stance would seem overwhelming or even grandiose, but here it only adds to an overall feeling of historical truth and great scope. There is great sadness, loneliness, and love here. Perhaps as good an example as any is the book's dedication:To my sisterEunice Ann Mary Jones-Washingtonandto the multitudes who came up out of the Southfor something better, something different, and, again,to the memory of my mother,Jeanette S. M. Jones,who came as well and found far lessthan even the little she dared hope forThat, if for no other reason, is why we will read Edward P. Jones's work: for that heartbreaking hope, both its presence and absence, and how all that's hoped for ultimately breaks the heart."},{"Title":"All Aunt Hagar's Children","review":"In his second book of short stories, Edward P. Jones does a wonderful job of chronicling the African-American experience in All Aunt Hagar' Children. Just as Lost in the City did, Jones brings to life a city that is hardly ever written about, Washington, D.C., and uses fourteen tales to describe circumstances that include life inside of homes full of love, and those without and those that are wealthy and those that are struggling.Jones' depictions are as real as it gets, thoroughly describing life for Blacks fleeing an angry South to a new beginning in their first experience of living an \\"urban\\" American life from the early 1900's all the way to the mid-twentieth century and the loneliness it may sometimes bring. For example, \\"In the Blink of God's Eye\\" is about a newlywed couple that moves from Virginia to Washington, D.C. From the way Jones writes, the reader would assume that the couple traveled all the way to Washington State, because that is just how much home was missed for the young bride and how far away it seemed to her. In the title story, \\"All Aunt Hagar's Children\\", a hopeless young man aspires to go to Alaska to hunt for gold but in the meantime, spends his days helping a neighbor solve the mystery of how her son was murdered while also dodging an ex-girlfriend that he perceives to be angry.Overall, this reader really enjoyed Jones' ability to tell a story but at times, wanted it to be longer and did not feel that the short story version could give these stories justice. At other times, the story was just long enough to get to know the characters and get a meaning out of the story that could resonate. Avid readers of Edward P. Jones will definitely want to add this collection to their libraries and will pick their favorites within All Aunt Hagar's Children.Reviewed by Lena WillisAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"All Aunt Hagar's Children","review":"This collection of stories really has depth and insight. Edward P. Jones writes about the black community in Washington D.C. with great compassion and understanding. There is considerable heartbreak here, but it is presented with such sensitivity and authenticity that it is hard to put down. Jones needs to get some more awards with this one. It is beautifully crafted literary work that deals with the real world."},{"Title":"All Aunt Hagar's Children","review":"I have read and agree with the other reviews posted thus far and see no need to outline the individual stories (as was well done below). I have a few comments. AN interesting comparison between this collection and Peter Taylor's \\"The Widows of Thornton\\" is worth exploring. The latter work, also by a Pulitzer Prize winner of a previous generation (Taylor was a professor at UVA), also deals with family issues that developed as the new South was being created. The widows were the women, left behind by their men of business who ventured forth into the new economy, who wrestled with preserving the values, traditions and social structure of the post-cival war south in the face of a rapidly changing modern world. Like the current work, Taylor's characters often find refuge in the dying home of Thorton TN. Taylor addresses race and socioeconomic issues, but from a white experience. Taylor's prose is very subtle and challenging, like the present work. Relationships change subtly overtime as lives unfold before us in ways that the characters could not forsee.Jones, in addition to dealing with the generations spanning the old home (the deep south) and the new home (Washington, DC), addresses the additional issue of displacement, broken families, crime, drugs, adultery and alienation of an entire race made worse by physical displacement during the great migration. Like Taylor's Tennesee families, Jone's families face new challenges and experience great divides between generations. Whereas Taylor's world is white and well to do, Jones' world is mixed and often delves into the beginings and origins of the underworld that grew in the ghettos of this city that offered hope and bitter dissapointment.Unlike Richard Wright, Jones does not deal mainly in anger. Like Wright, Jones explores alienation in its many forms. The reader is left with little hope for the future as the great strength is rooted in the past and in the south. Many of the stories don't end, per se, but just stop and the characters are left to face an uncertain future. As all good writers, Jones draws the reader in and by identifying with the characters in the stories you experience at a deeper level and beyond words what the author intends to convey.I found many of the stories very dense in that you best not blink or let your mind wander for you can become lost very easily. This is not a simple work of prose. I read and reread many of the stories and was fatigued at times. However, it was a rich and rewarding experience of having been, in some way, part of Jones' world, feeling the complex emotions and living these lives. I must come back to this book some day.Read slowly, and enjoy"},{"Title":"All Aunt Hagar's Children","review":"According to Hebrew legend (see chapters 16 and 21 of Genesis, the first book of the Torah), Sarah was the wife of Abram, and Hagar was the servant of Sarah. It was a Middle Eastern custom in those times that a wife could give her slave to her husband and the child thus conceived would be counted as the child of the wife. The child born to Hagar and Abraham was given the name Ishmael.In Edward P. Jones's new collection of 14 short stories, \\"all Aunt Hagar's children\\" refers to the descendants of slaves, or, in the context of the present work, to African Americans, most of whom live in or near Washington, D.C., who try to \\"put more and more distance between themselves and the legacy of slavery.\\"Jones, an African American, has impressive credentials as a writer. He won the Pulitzer Prize for The Known World: A Novel (2003) and his earlier book of short stories, Lost in the City (1992) was short-listed for the National Book Award.In spite of the foul language (\\"trash talk\\") used by many of Jones's characters (anything less would be inauthentic), the author writes with graciousness and a \\"great-souled\\" felicity. He describes people struggling to make something of their lives, to make the best of the human condition.Life isn't easy for descendants of slaves living in \\"the white man's world.\\" Jones's characters are torn between hope and despair, love and lust, faith and unbelief. They battle the demons of drugs and alcohol. Many of them are obsessed with religion or sex, or both. According to Jones, the mumbo-jumbo of religion revolves madly around sexual questions.Viewed through Jones's spectacles, the deity doesn't fare well in this world of \\"Aunt Hagar's Children.\\" In the title story we read: \\"I sat on my bed in the upstairs back room and drank the last of some whiskey a friend had given me, listening to WOOK all the while. On Sundays WOOK was full of religious [expletive deleted], and it always depressed the [expletive deleted] out of me. But I didn't change the station.\\"Again, from \\"Tapestry,\\" one of the best stories in the collection: \\"God, people said, did more mysterious things in Mississippi than he did anywhere else on Earth. . . . Lucas's grandfather, who had been lynched, [was] just the opening act of the entertainment for an Independence Day celebration, just before the white people's picnic and five hours before the fireworks. . . . Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. And God would lick the tip of His forefinger and turn the page.\\"All is not gloom and doom. Although some of \\"the good people\\" turn out to be less moral than they appear, some of \\"the bad people\\" (see the short story, \\"Bad Neighbors\\") turn out to have more compassion than we first believe.Throughout these 14 stories, one is impressed with what might be called a ripple effect: how the words and actions of one character can profoundly affect the lives of others--for weal or woe.The stories are tantalizing, leaving us, like short stories are often wont to do, wanting more--wondering what happens next. But more would be less; to \\"tell all\\" would compromise the emotional impact of the tales. All Aunt Hagar's Children will add to Jones's reputation as a consummate artist.Mr. Jones has taught fiction writing as a range of universities, including Princeton. He lives in Washington, D.C."},{"Title":"All Aunt Hagar's Children","review":"There is no one else like Edward Jones writing today. Imagine someone writing with the elegiac tone and richness of language of Doctorow mixed with deep emotion and you get Mr. Jones. In these stories, the lives of ordinary citizens of Washington DC come to life in a way that gives testimony to the creative spirit. In a literary world crowded with the talented and clever but short of heart, Mr. Jones is the real deal, someone who writes with intelligence for readers who love to read serious fiction and care about the human condition. If you are passionate about serious writing, you'll read these stories again and again. They are that good."},{"Title":"All Aunt Hagar's Children","review":"The best writers--or at least the most memorable--are the ones who can break the rules of writing and somehow still tell a great story or convince us of something. Jones often changes points of view, shifts time, and fills his stories with a variety of characters. He seems to lack the ability to write a one-dimensional, uninteresting character. Even the one or two stories in the collection that I didn't particularly like left me wanting to read more. And I felt as I read the stories that each was so well wrought and imagined that Jones could easily turn them each into novels.Some readers thought that there were too many characters in Jones' novel _The Known World_, which made it a difficult read. But I found little difficulty reading it. In the short story, however, with its limited space, I think that the large number of characters placed in one story give them little breathing room and make the reading a bit challenging. Sometimes Jones falters, but when he gets the story off the ground right, he soars so high that he can be placed among the best short fiction writers today in the English language.One story, \\"The Devil Swims Across Anacostia River\\", despite its provocative title and some amazing passages, I found a little odd and below the quality of the other stories.Stories such as \\"Old Boys, Old Girls\\", \\"A Rich Man\\", and \\"Adam Robinson\\" are truly short masterpieces. I originally read them in the New Yorker. But however many times I read the stories, they continue to amaze me with their elegance.Some characters in this book first appeared in _Lost in the City_, Jones' first collection of short stories. Though some stories in _All Aunt Hagar's Children_ approach perfection, _Lost in the City_ was a far more even work, perhaps because of its consistency of style and genre. _All Aunt Hagar's Children_ contains several stories, such as \\"The Root Worker\\" and \\"A Poor Guatemalan Dreams of a Downtown in Peru\\" (a very Gabriel Garcia Marquez-esque title), that have magical realist elements.After reading all fourteen stories in this book, I felt a pang of grief, as if I had a finished a good conversation with a friend I knew I would never see again.Read this book. It's simply amazing."},{"Title":"All Aunt Hagar's Children","review":"In All Aunt Hagar's Children, Edward Jones once again showers us with prose that is both concise and metaphoric. He is truly one of the great writers of our new century. His stories capture the intricacies of living in our complex and strife-torn world with true humanity and humility. For me, his strongest metaphor comes from the last story - the metaphor of a tapestry. It takes many years to create and is full of innumerable details, yet it produces a work that last for many years and enlightens many other lives. What a wonderful image and a challenge for us to live into. In All Aunt Hagar's Children, Jones has surely presented us with a tapestry that will live for years and enlighten lives."},{"Title":"All Aunt Hagar's Children","review":"I usually do not read short stories, I just love novels, however, because it was by the author of \\"The Known World\\" I had to read this. Edward P.

Riveting."},{"Title":"All Aunt Hagar's Children","review":"Some things are well worth waiting for and Edward P. Jonses's follow-up to his Pulitzer Prize winning debut novel \\"The Known World\\" (2003) is most assuredly one of them. Once again he uses short story formats to illuminate and make memorable his characters, ordinary people, really, but to the listener they are unforgettable. This author's evocation of black life in America is incomparable.Another stellar offering is the reading by voice performer Peter Francis James. He brings both strength and sympathetic understanding to the author's words. James has a host of television appearances to his credit, as well as Broadway and film roles. His delivery is unhesitating, distinct, and highly listenable.The 14 stories that comprise \\"All Aunt Hagar's Children\\" are set in in Washington, the city where the author was raised and now lives. He opens with \\"In The Blink of God's Eye,\\" the story of Ruth and Aubrey, a young couple in their late teens and recently married. Ruth does not always rest well in \\"godforsaken Washington\\" while Aubrey \\"always slept the sleep of a man not long out of boyhood.\\" One night when Ruth was wakeful she went out in back where she found a baby tied in a bundle hanging from a tree limb. Thus, she thought Washington was \\"a city where they hung babies in night trees.\\"As is his wont Jones treats readers to the earlier lives of his characters, rendering them all the more accessible and sympathetic. This is especially true in \\"Resurrecting Methuselah\\" in which we meet Anita Channing who sits by the bedside of Bethany, her ill daughter. She sits in a wooden chair built a century and a half ago by a former slave. Anita's husband, Percival, is serving in Okinawa, where he spends much time with a prostitute, Sara Lee. When Percival discovers he has breast cancer he calls Anita and asks her to come to him. She reaches Honolulu, a stopover in her flight, where she has an opportunity to look back on her childhood and wonder what the future holds for herself and her child.\\"All Aunt Hagar's Children\\" concludes with \\"Tapestry,\\" another story of a young couple, Anne and George, marrying and leaving their rural roots behind. George is a porter on a train, the train that carries them to Washington. As the train slows close to its destination Anne whispers, Mama, Papa, \\"I'm a long way from home.\\"For this listener that was the gist of all of these marvelous stories, people seeking a better life a long way from home.Jones is such an incredibly gifted writer, his prose is succinct, true, impeccably crafted. Listening to his work is not only a pleasure but a privilege as well.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"All Aunt Hagar's Children","review":"The stories in this collection have more in common with the novel, 'The Known World', than with the other collection of Edward P Jones short stories, 'Lost in the City', in that they tend to drift and ramble in time, the past frequently cutting across narration of the present. This is a part of the Jones art which presents an extra challenge to the reader. Nevertheless, nothing in this collection detracts from my opinion of Edward P Jones as a wonderful writer who paints a disturbing picture of the cyclical brutality of life. The stories in 'All Aunt Hagar's Children' have not made as deep an impression on me as those of 'Lost in the City', but I am glad they are in my library.As for the production quality of the hardcover book, it is as cheap and nasty as any book I have handled. The pages, whose texture reminds me of blotting paper, seem to have been cut (torn?) by pre school children during a let's-play-with-blunt-scissors session just after morning nap. The front cover was dented and the first few pages crinkled - perhaps damaged in transit, but quite consistent with the substandard production quality. Not a book I would be proud to hand on to my children, (unless they be short of cleaning material). I must add, in fairness, that this is my first disappointment with any product ordered through Amazon."},{"Title":"All Aunt Hagar's Children","review":"All Aunt Hagar's Childrenis a collection of short stories by Washington D.C. native Edward P. Jones, it is his third book and the first since winning the Pulitzer Prize forThe Known World(2003). The stories are about black Americans in Washington D.C. during the 20th century. Each story revolves around family, society and self, detailing experiences emblematic of southern blacks who migrated to northern cities from rural roots: some found salvation and others a living hell. In all the stories there are transformative turning points in peoples lives. As Jones shows, they are often not conscious of what happened - life-altering events can happen in the course of the banal every-day, setting in motion life patterns that can be hard to break when it's forgotten or not noticed how it started. In some cases the patterns are passed down unconsciously generation to generation - like the devil, cycles of violence, poverty, addiction, sickness and ignorance stalk many of the characters for seemingly mysterious reasons, bordering on the mystic in some stories.The stories are beautifully original, Jones employs authentic southern expressions creating a time capsule reverberating with fading folkways. Like the characters he writes about, Jones grew up poor in Washington. He had a strong mother - whom he dedicates the book too - and it contains many of her colloquial sayings. This is not a book to be read quickly, like the pace of southern culture, each sentence demands respect for plot structure, character development and the unique southern way of putting words together. I read this hoping to learn more about the black culture of Washington (and Baltimore up the road) and was not disappointed, but what an extra treat to have a world-class writer with a deep sense of humanity, empathy (and sometimes sly humor) show the way."},{"Title":"All Aunt Hagar's Children","review":"I found this book to be a compelling read, offering a tender , sometimes off-beat collection of short stories. Featuring African-American characters, Most of the stories are set in Washington D.C. Themes of Catholiscism,family roots and history,man and woman relationships,racism, and other topics are dealt with thoughtfully and patiently, often told from a woman's or child's perspective."},{"Title":"All Aunt Hagar's Children","review":"Anyone who has read Edward P. Jones' Pulitzer-Prize winner, The Known World, knows that he's a great novelist. Readers of All Aunt Hagar's Children, a collection of fourteen Washington D.C.-related stories, will learn that he's equally gifted at the short story genre. In addition to their geographical connection, these often R-rated (primarily for language) stories generally share a sense of realism, and often, hope (additionally, religious references are overwhelmingly Catholic). The best thing about them is not, however, how they are similar, but instead, how they are different, achieved through Jones' skilled use of varied characters and subjects and a time period of approximately a century. Although two stories, The Devil Swims Across the Anacostia River, about a woman's encounter with the devil in a Safeway store, and Blindsided, which recounts a woman's experiences after suddenly and inexplicably losing her sight, are unconventional, the dozen others are incredibly credible. The cast of well-developed and diverse characters includes, a precocious Catholic-school-attending five-year-old girl; an unfaithful, unwell, military-sergeant-husband; a reluctant-detective Korean War veteran; a dual-doctorate miracle-prone woman; a voodoo-skeptical medical doctor daughter; a pretty, well-dressed domestic-abuse-victim girlfriend; an unfortunate, philandering widower; and a newly-married Washington-bound reluctant wife. This is a good choice for connoisseurs of the short story genre. Fans of All Aunt Hagar's Children will probably also enjoy Runaway by Alice Munro and Interpreter of Maladies by Jhumpa Lahiri. More daring readers should try Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman by Haruki Murakami, and for those who always choose vanilla, Blackbird House by Alice Hoffman is an everyman-friendly, interestingly-connected collection."},{"Title":"All Aunt Hagar's Children","review":"I must confess that I have only finished two of the short stories thus far but from the moment I read the dedication I suspected that I would not be dissapointed and have so far not. I adored \\"The Known World\\" and find myself being at once drawn in and recoiling with Jones's writing: the subject matter is often heartbreaking yet he writes with such confidence, beauty and clarity that I can't help but hunger for the next page. I don't know that this book is for everyone (it isn't Tom Clancy or Stephen King if that is what you are looking for), but if you enjoyed \\"The Known World\\" or the writings of Toni Morrison, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"All Aunt Hagar's Children","review":"One of today's most compelling author weaves stories about how lives change due to tragedy.\\""},{"Title":"All Aunt Hagar's Children","review":"I read his first novel the Known World and was very impressed. So I sought out this follow-up. It is very rare that I come across a writer who clearly and deftly captures the challenge of urban city folk. The setting for his stories were DC, but it could have easily been NYC, LA, Boston, Chicago, etc. The story is the same all over. His various stories capture the everyday life of people in the city. Well written prose that brought back some good memories as well as some I'd rather not remember. Highly recommended.Rindge Leaphart"},{"Title":"All Aunt Hagar's Children","review":"It is 1901. Aubrey and Ruth Patterson are a newly married couple living in Washington D.C. Ruth cuts a baby down from a tree, much to her astonishment. She names the baby Miles. 'Spanish in the Morning' gives a picture of a girl shopping at Garfinckel's Department Store with her boyfriend walking behind her pretending to be her chauffeur. It is a world where a quarter buys an hour of television, ''Common Law' and where a root doctor is able to cure a mentally ill woman, 'Root Worker'.Modern society and traditional society intersect among the African American inhabitants of Washington D.C. in the early and mid twentieth century. The stories cover a time when K Street was not a synonym for lobbyists. It is a wonderful world of courtesy and connectedness flourishing and a fearsome world of undecipherable signs. The author often features children with their unblemished and naive points of view.Many of the themes in the stories in this collection are of a spiritual nature. The characters are believers, worshippers. They have a special relationship with the natural world. Readers in search of social history could be informed by the rich gallery of persons and circumstances here. The stories satisfy both singularly and en masse.Literary values are not sacrificed to the necessity to tell a good story. An example of a good incident is a man understanding he will not go to Africa again and he will not travel to see the rest of the world because he and his wife are raising two grandchildren. The lure of Washington D.C. was and is federal jobs. Jones plays with the bureaucratize inherent to living at the center in some of the stories--a blind entity with no feeble-mindedness and habitable space in 'Blind-sided'. Taken together, the entries form a spacious and comprehensive snapshot of the community."},{"Title":"All Aunt Hagar's Children","review":"In his highly-acclaimed volume of 14 stories, \\"All Aunt Hagar's Children\\", Edward P. Jones draws portraits of African Americans who have migrated from the South to Washington D.C. The stories are set from around the beginning of the 20th Century to the present day. The stories describe many types of people from young children to old men and women and from the poor and illiterate to the highly educated. They speak of loneliness and change, of the frustration, sexual and otherwise, that results from moving to a new urban place, of criminality and drugs, and of education. The stories are short but deeply textured, as in tapestries(the title of the final story). Characters, histories and sub-themes are realized in brief spaces.The writing style in these stories is a major factor in their success. All but two of the stories are told in the third person by an all-knowing narrator. (The exceptions are \\"Spanish in the Morning\\" told in the voice of a precocious young girl and the title story \\"All Aunt Hagar's Children told in the voice of a young Korean War veteran who hopes to move to Alaska in search of fortune and women.) The writing is full of Biblical allusions. Hagar, of course, was the concubine of the patriarch Abraham who was sent into the desert after she mocked the childlesness of Sarah who then became jealous of her. God spared Hagar and her childen. The figure of Hagar is used her for the outsider and the outcast -- symbolizing the lives of the African American characters of the stories. The language of the stories in its richness, difficulty, and frequent elliptical character, particularly in its repetition and in its use of names, also owes a great deal to the Old Testament. There is also much in the stories that reminds me of the African American preacher of Jame's Weldon Johnson's poem \\"God's Trombones\\". The rich, narrative voice of the stories is complemented by the contrasting voice of many of the characters with its slang, dialect, and frequent use of obscenity.The stories develop character and place. Jones shows the reader a Washington D.C separate from the world of national politics familiar to most Americans. I have lived in Washington D.C. for many years. Jones's depictions of neighborhoods, streets, landmarks, stores, and people had a deep sense of familiarity. They also helped me see the familiar aspects of my city in a new way. The characters are true and believable in their many responses to living in Washington.The stories I especially enjoyed included the first story \\"In the Blink of God's Eye\\" and the final story \\"Tapestries\\". Both these stories are set both in the rural South and in Washington, D.C., the former at the turn of the 20th Century and the latter in the 1930s. They both show the difficulties young married couples encounter with the change of place.The story \\"Old Boys Old Girls\\" describes the life of a young man who spends years in Lorton prison and his attempt to make a life for himself when he is released. Jones contrasts the life of his down-and-out protagonist with the lives of his wealthy and successful family. \\"A Poor Guatamalean Dreams of a Downtown in Peru\\" tells of a young poor girl who achieves great academic success but whose life has otherwise been filled with catastrophe and loss. \\"All Aunt Hagar's Children\\" is a complex story filled with themes of womanizing, murder, family, and wanderlust. It is a compelling portrait of African American life in the Washington D.C. of the early 1950s and it touches briefly as well upon African American -- Jewish relations.My two favorite stories were \\"Root Worker\\" and \\"Bad Neighbors\\" both of which explore themes of the search for love and finding it in unexpected places. The main character in \\"Root Worker\\" is a young successful woman doctor who gives up a planned vacation to travel South to consult a root doctor for what ails her mother. In the process, she learns a great deal about herself. \\"Bad Neighbors\\" tells the story of a large, poor family that rents a home in a middle-class black neighborhood where they are shunned and feared by their more successful neighbors. There are many turns as the story progresses, as the main character, a young woman who has become a nurse, gains a deeper understanding of people, status, and love.Jones' stories depict African American life in a loving, involved manner but without polemicizing or blatant social criticism. They are rooted in African American life but, in their treatment of love, sexuality, change, and character speak universally as well. The stories are dense and thoughtful and will reward careful reading. I am pleased that many of my fellow Amazon reviewers have enjoyed this outstanding book and written insightfully about it.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"All Aunt Hagar's Children","review":"This author has done it again with brilliant illustrations of a city and families that touch the core of our compassion.

Second, mutual cultural ignorance and even ethnocentrism affected the relationship between Chinese and Americans.At the center of the novel is Major Baldwin. A civil engineer in civilian life, he commands a US Army demolitions team aiming to cut roads and destroy supplies as the Japanese advance. Sergeant Michaelson, before the war a mine foreman and union representative, is another well-drawn character. The other men represent a variety of personality types that set up leadership choices. The Chinese side of the war is voiced by two Chinese characters who join the demolition team on its week-long journey, just ahead of the Japanese, climbing from Guangxi province to Sichuan.White did a good job in describing the technical side of demolition and ordnance in layman's terms. Small details in the plot and the dialog well described the disfunctions and fatal shortcomings of Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist government.Here's why this book needs to be re-read in the twenty-first century. To many Americans in the China theatre, the Chinese were regarded with disdain and prejudice. Missionaries and headquarters officers might sense China's great traditions and culture, but the views of ordinary American soldiers and airmen were more often shaped by China's poverty, a failing government and command, and the cruelty let loose by the war. Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan can find much to recognize in the novel -- and in the 1960 movie that starred Jimmy Stewart.And now, as much as then, every officer and NCO who leads troops must be prepared to quell the urge to take revenge. They might find Major Baldwin's dilemmas -- and his final thoughts on power and command -- instructive.-30-"},{"Title":"The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science. 2 volumes.","review":"The Intelligent Man's Guide To ScienceThe Intelligent Man's Guide To Science (1960) by Isaac Asimov should be on everyone's bookshelf.

I feel that there will be no closure to this story as some people involved in this case are either dead or are keeping quiet for ever. I have seen the house that these shootings took place as it seems to have become a bit of a tourist attraction for those in New Zealand who know and wonder about this case. I even have a family member that lived in the area and knew Arthur Alan Thomas when the shootings occured. It has become a public fascination and one of lifes' mysteries.David Yallop has taken chances when writing this book as the case is still mentioned from time to time and the question of who fed nany Rochelle is still asked. I found this book fairly hard to read as the scientific evidence is hard to sift through.You read about more than one trial here and it can be hard going although to really understand why AA Thomas was convicted,you must first read the 'evidence'. I don't know who shot and killed Harvey and Jeanette Crew or who fed the baby but I feel that it was NOT Arthur Thomas.Maybe it was the dad (Len Demler) and maybe the sister Heather is involved and that's who fed the child but I just don't know for sure.Nobody does.It's why this case is still popular. David Yallop claims that he has evidence that a 'certain' woman was involved and he 'knows for sure' that she was in the country.Heather right?I think so but he cannot come out and say it for legal reasons I suppose. The book does show you that stuff ups were made in the trials.All the evidence about all the guns in the area not being tested is true.I know,as one of the few rifles not tested belongs to a family member of mine and he told me that it was offered for testing but the police couldn't be bothered to come and get it.We still have that gun,I have used it myself. Everyone who reads about this case will form their own opinion and everyones will be different. This case is fascinating but I don't know as you will get the full impact by reading this account.The book is long and heavy going but you can still catch enough of the details to see where David Yallop is heading. My advice is that if you start to read it and you get confused with all the details,then put it away for a couple of days and then try again."},{"Title":"Beyond Reasonable Doubt","review":"I read this book some years ago after finding a mention of it in an old Readers Digest article. (Nov.'79) David Yallop's examination of all the evidence quite clearly portrays Arthur Thomas'es innocence and tears to shreds the police investigation and evidence of some of the wittnesses. Makes me wonder what did go on and it seems that Leonard Delmer had something to do with it... But one feels sorry for Rochelle Crewe, (the baby found in her cot) now in her thirties, and apparently living in America.The whole book is one which makes me feel for the living victims of this tragedy."},{"Title":"Beyond Reasonable Doubt","review":"This is a book that will appeal to many readers in New Zealand, not only because of this famous murder trial but because it will take them back to the age of country innocence that they remember.David Yallop's ego is overpowering within the text to the point where one begins to doubt his own convictions, however most readers will feel vindicated when Arthur Allan Thomas is finally pardoned.Along with a lot of other New Zealanders I am convinced that Len Demler and his other daughter were involved in the Crewe deaths however, David Yallop himself is a main character in this account so it is a little difficult to feel as though you are really reading the facts.For those too young, whose back doesn't shiver when they hear the words 'Crewe murders',I would recommend taking a look at Yallop's fascinating and well-researched account of this 1970's double homicide and try and decide for yourself!"},{"Title":"Beyond Reasonable Doubt","review":"A tongue-in-cheek, razor-sharp analysis of the Arthur Allan Thomas case which was probably the key factor in his pardon. However the book is somewhat dated and heavily biased in favour of Thomas (the late Prime Minister Rob Muldoon records in his autobiography that three people complained to him their statements had been slanted in a way that did not convey their true opinions). However if you want to get to grips with the A.A. Thomas case, this is the book to read. I am finding definite parallels between this case and the Jeff MacDonald case (see &quot;Fatal Justice&quot;).Ironically, Yallop's assertion that he knows who the mystery woman was turned out to be wrong. The woman concerned was out of the country at the time. The Eyre rifle has been eliminated: Dr Nelson made a mistake when examining its signature - a mistake which went unnoticed for 10 years.If Len Demler knew the truth about the murders, he has now taken that secret to the grave. The case will most likely remain unsolved."},{"Title":"Beyond Reasonable Doubt","review":"The problem with a discussion of this book is that anyone who goes outside its parameters risks court action. Any bdiscussion while pricipal actors are still alive, which might seriously challenge Yallop's assertions must therefore await untill the hand of God permits a more open discussion of what did, and did not, what might, and what might not, have taken place.certainly, to dismiss the &quot;dead cartridge in the magazine&quot; theory out of hand as the one person Royal Commission did (and he was a person not without controversy in his own right) is hardly fair to anyone involved."},{"Title":"Legacy of the Diamond (Black Diamond)","review":"Uusually I rely heavily on the reviews of others before I buy a book.

It's a position very close to the top of the American Political System (Third in line to be the President). But it's not a position on which the country votes. Instead, some state selects a Congressman, and the Congress selects its leader. And generally speaking most of us who live outside his home state have never heard of the man.Such was the case when Denny Hastert was given the position. And unlike some of his predecessors, he has not become a nationally known, or perhaps reknown is a better word, figure.In this book, he talks about how he got to where he is: sixteen years as a government and history teacher at the high school in Yorkville, Illinois. In addition he coached football and wrestling, and sometimes drove the school bus.He writes that the best training to become speaker of the house is to drive a school bus. \\"You're got to (1) keep the bus on the road, (2) keep your eye on the kids in the rear-view mirror, and (3) watch your back.\\" As he says, \\"Hearding cats.\\"The toughest job: \\"teaching sixteen-year-old kids the basics of economics\\" was his original answer, now he says: \\"Teaching economics to some Members of Congress.\\"This book reads like a novel. It's too easy to say to yourself, \\"I'll read one more page before turning out the light.\\" It leaves you with a better understanding that Congress is just people. People who have different ideas perhaps, but who have to work together to get anything done. It's quite a book."},{"Title":"Speaker: Lessons from Forty Years in Coaching and Politics","review":"I have an autographed copy of this book--Speaker Hastert signed it for me in a Kansas bookstore. As the Speaker is next in line after the Vice President to be President if--God forbid--something should happen to the President or Vice President, Speaker Hastert holds the third highest position in the federal government. I want to personally thank Jack DeWolfe and the others in the Speaker's security detail for letting us have time to talk.Speaker Hastert and I grew up a short ride from each other (two of my cousins grew up just minutes from his childhood home). We were both wrestlers at one time in school. But, those are not the reasons why I like him so much.Congressman Hastert is, unlike many of his peers, a man of integrity. He's also got a great deal of common sense and no delusions about himself. You can't help but respect him, and I would respect him if he were still working on a feed truck in a small Illinois town rather than holding the third highest position on Capitol Hill. He is that kind of man.Talking to \\"Denny\\" (as he prefers to be called), you understand a few important things about the man:*He's humble.*He knows what he believes and why.*He does not make excuses.So, what about this book? Well, it's a very hard book to put down. You find yourself glancing at the clock and saying, \\"OK, just one more page.\\"Denny is candid and honest. Unlike Bill Clinton, he did not write a bloated, self-aggrandizing tome of excuses for failure and try to make it sound like success. Instead, he speaks from the heart and engages you. Oddly, though the book is about him, it isn't about him. And neither is the way he's conducted himself in public office.He did not write an advertisement for the Republican Party or try to lay a foundation for a future Presidential bid. Instead, he gives credit where credit is due (regardless of party). He also tells you some of the negative--but he does so in a civil, calm, dignified way. He does not resort to name-calling or histrionics. He lays out the facts and lets you be the judge. As a reader, I like that.He did not write an embarrassing book like Al Gore's \\"Earth in the Balance.\\" This is not a book that the author will later wish he could get people not to read. It is a book that he can be proud of, and it's one that will probably be read and recommended decades after he's gone.Denny starts out by telling us where he came from. No silver spoons in his background. He knows the value of work, and he knows nothing is free--which explains his political philosophies. His entering politics was almost accidental, as was his rise to Speaker. He had no aspirations or grand plan to get there. Things just kind of turned out that way, and he took the opportunities as they came along. Which turned out to be very, very good for the rest of us.The book provides a fascinating view into the inner workings of government at the state and federal levels. In this book, you'll find information you won't find in the biased media such as our newspapers and television (which, by the way, are undergoing huge losses of audience because of that bias--mainstream America is sick of it). Denny is amazingly unbiased and fair, which is refreshing in this age of bias and blame.You'll see an insider's view of what it's like to deal with the dirty tricks played by the various bipartisan politicians, and Denny makes it clear that there are good and honorable people in both major parties. But you'll also see why our Congress and Senate have (in my opinion) been such abject failures for the past half century or so.On the upside, you'll see where there's new hope. In fact, in the last six or so years our Congress and Senate have departed from their previous \\"let's fail to do what we were elected to do\\" modus operandi--they have actually done some good. That hasn't been because there are now more Republicans than Democrats. No, something else is at work there and Denny explains what it is.Anyone who wants a good understanding of how government works should read this book. If you pay taxes, you should consider this a \\"must read\\"--taxes are the single largest expense for nearly every citizen and this book helps you understand how that money is spent (or misspent). Denny was a high school history teacher at one time, so he knows his stuff from that angle as well as from being intimately involved in the legislative process.Had I not met Denny, I probably would not have bought a book by \\"yet another politician.\\" But, that's just it. He isn't just another politician. And this is no ordinary book."},{"Title":"Speaker: Lessons from Forty Years in Coaching and Politics","review":"Denny Hastert is not a name most people would recognize in the world of politics. And he says that's the way he likes it. We had a chance to meet Speaker Hastert at the Reagan Library, and though we didn't get a chance to speak, he was extremely cordial. His book is a quick read--despite its 300 pages, I read it in just two nights--and his story is worthwhile. I appreciate the fact that he has not forgotten his roots, and I was amazed that his wife continued her teaching career despite her husband's rise to power. The Speaker's remembrance of his teaching and coaching career--he even mentions his wrestling team's state championship in 1976 on the book's dedication page--make it clear that politics was not what he ever intended to make a career in. In fact, this was a man who not only coached and taught but drove a school bus, for Pete's sake!As a private school educator myself, I felt a special kinship to him; now that I know him better, I feel I will better understand the situation he faces in the dog-eat-dog political world of Washington, D.C. One final comment. If nothing else, this book confirmed to me that our national political system is filled with holes, especially in the colloboration between the two main parties. The tricks played by the parties--and I have to say, most of the blame appears to lie at the feet of the Democrats--just to make the other side look bad is, in reality, bad for America. What can we do? Vote those who are the rascals out and get some work done. Let's cooperate, people, and quit with the individual agendas that single out special interests."},{"Title":"Speaker: Lessons from Forty Years in Coaching and Politics","review":"This was a fantastically fast read. I really enjoy learning about Washington and politics and Denny Hastert seems to be your every day kind of guy who has inside access to real power in Washington. His September 11 story is worth the price of the book alone but the story about how an average school teacher turned Speaker of the U.S. House almost became President of the United States is unreal. HOW COME NO ONE KNEW THIS?!!?!Amazing. Gotta read this one."},{"Title":"Speaker: Lessons from Forty Years in Coaching and Politics","review":"It seems to me that we overweight the past with a significance it never had when it was the present. Certain events seem more to have a more straight line connection and they are remembered and most else is forgotten or temporarily put aside in our memories until needed to create a new explanation of how we arrived in the present. I bring this up because it is easy to remember the Tip O'Neill or the Sam Rayburn as significant Speakers of the House and to dismiss Denny Hastert, but I think that would be a real mistake.Certainly, I was one of those who said, \\"Denny Who?\\" when Newt stepped down as Speaker (before he would have lost the vote) and Livingston at the last moment succumbed to scandal. In this terrific autobiography, Speaker Hastert shares his life with us in a compact narrative that always lets us know what he thought and felt without ever becoming maudlin or vicious.Without recounting his life, the first chapter tells of his boyhood through beginning work as a teacher and coach. He shows us through his life experiences how he learned about hard work, developed his religious faith, and developed a love for athletics (especially wrestling). He never claims any special virtues except for his abilities to listen, coach, and help people come together.I found his transition to politics very interesting and why it is really a fatal experience to underestimate Speaker Hastert. He is very sharp, is able to express his judgments clearly and concisely so you know exactly where he stands without ever sounding mean or vindictive. He knows how to play the games of politics well, but for him it is not the game, it is working towards the things he believes in that matter most.Frankly, as I learned about his personal political views and what he has been working on in the Illinois State House, as a US Representative, and now as Speaker, I have to say I wish I could vote for him. The last chapter of the book is a quick review of the current issues of the day. There is a brief addendum where Mr. Hastert shares his thoughts on the death of Ronald Reagan.This is neither a deeply philosophical tome nor a tell-all book to settle scores. It is a simple story of a life that is interesting and easy to read. There will be other histories written that will be more comprehensive. However, we should not dismiss what is happening in our present. It is always good to pay attention so that as the present fades into the past we have a better context for what really happened than the more artificial context dreamed up by historians who were never there or who carefully set up the lighting on the set of facts they present to better support their own agenda.Good book, good read, good insight into what is going on in Washington today."},{"Title":"Speaker: Lessons from Forty Years in Coaching and Politics","review":"I bought this book after reading the review from Mark Hammil.

Definitely buy this one."},{"Title":"Speaker: Lessons from Forty Years in Coaching and Politics","review":"I tend to read a lot of political books from both sides of the political spectrum by both politicians and pundits. Due to this I find myself holding these books up against each other in comparison. This comparison process leads me to the less then perfect score I would give this book. The author admits in the first part of the book that he is not much of a reader nor author and tends to almost exclusively rely on verbal communication. Given that he is a politician that is probably not all that bad. Unfortunately for the reader, this lack of experience with the written word tends to lend its self to a somewhat bland and simple story. Just to be clear, I am not attacking the man, just the writing style he uses. And to give him credit, he did not employ a high profile ghost writer to basically write the book like so many of his cohorts tend to do. He states his story with a down home style that is simplistic in the word choice and is rather shallow in detail.With this criticism said I did find one aspect of his book very pleasing. Unlike so many books of the type, he kept the personal attacks out of the book and remained above the nasty level of partisanship that is all the rage in Washington now. Admittedly this was a surprise to me, I half picked up the book just to read the assumed sniping and caustic shots he would take at the Democrats. This is not to say that he does not let you know how he feels about the leaders of the other party, in very respectful ways he lets you know that he disagrees with the Democratic platform and almost all of their standard bearers. He did liven it up a bit in the last chapter when he starts to lay out his plan for a GOP utopian dream. He throws some punches, but they are almost good natured considering what is said on any given Sunday morning via the talking head shows. He also did a bit of complaining at the end that rang hollow to me given the issues he was so concerned about happen on both sides of the political spectrum.Overall I found the book average. It lacked real depth to offer anything more then a high level view of the last few years in the house. The book reminded me of an after work conversation with friends on how an average work day went. The author did not take the opportunity to fully explain or expand on his political views other then to let you know he was a Republican. I came away thinking that he was going to do whatever the President asked him to do instead of fighting for what was the best for the people of his state. I do give him some credit for putting out a most positive book, especially in today's political climate. It is easy to read and moves at a fast clip. If you are a GOP'er and are not looking for anything that digging too deep into the mundane inter working of the house, then you would probably enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Speaker: Lessons from Forty Years in Coaching and Politics","review":"The Speaker would be a great neighbor. I'm sure his friends, family, and neighbors are extremely proud of the Speaker and rightly so. He is a good man, the salt of the earth, but he is also a lightweight that has allowed politics over principal to prevail in the House he runs.We have a divided nation; Rep. Hastert claims to have attempted to work with the opposition but consistently gets the cold shoulder. While I believe his examples are real, there is no real in-depth analysis that presents both sides' arguments fairly; instead we get a shallow apology from the right and what appears to be a highly spun-media release on the perspective of the left. See Bob Rubins' book as Sec. of the Treasury for a great example of a public servant defending his positions while respecting and enlightening us on his position relative to a respectful analysis of his opponents.Rep. Hastert does not go into any substantial detail on WHY Gingrich was outsted as Speaker, even though his perspective would be invaluable.Hastert also provides no real insight on his policy positions or what the driving factors were in the House regarding the policies debated beyond mere vote whipping. Hastert defines himself as a cheerleader more than a coach."},{"Title":"Parties and Politics in Contemporary Japan.","review":"The book provides a usually rather dry snapshot of post-war Japanese political parties, stopping at 1960. There are some prescient statements, \\"...the Liberal Democratic and Socialist parties are likely to dominate the national scene for the forseeable future.\\" Not a bad prediction, considering the Liberal Democrat takeover was only three years old in 1960, and the \\"one-and-a-half\\" party system lasted another 24 years after 1960.It's hard to get a lot of post-war Japanese history in English as \\"history\\" rather than \\"current events\\" (John Dower's excellent Embracing Defeat is an exception) so I like to pick up outdated current events books like this one -- unfortunately, the book is awfully dry and technical, lots of raw data and charts.

It appeared in 1894, four years before the U.S. war against Spain, and before Puerto Rico became a \\"U.S. Possession\\", and twenty-three years before Puerto Ricans became defacto U.S. citizens via the Jones Act. La Charca [The Stagnant Pond] is a sad realist account of rural exploitation and class struggle, yet it reads like a flesh and blood multi-dimensional tragedy, rather than a dry social critique. I will be teaching Latina/o Studies this coming Spring and wanted to see if this text was in print. Happily, it is. It is important for readers of U.S. Latina/o Literature to read books written by Puerto Ricans who were not primarily interested in the Puerto-Rico U.S. encounter, or another stereotypical U.S. P-R prison tragi-comedy with a predictable conversion or otherwise nihilistic ending. Readers should note that THERE IS a Puerto-Rican Literature of the nineteenth century, and this wonderful book is a taste of that rich literature. Juan Flores is a wonderful critic, so be sure to read any article he has on La Charca, even if it doesn't appear in this text.

A few months previously, Mansel's wife and daughter were found bloodily murdered in the summerhouse whilst Mansel wandered the ground drunk. He cannot remember a thing about that night, only that he came to in the summerhouse covered in blood, as was his stable boy Virgil Morrisey. Now he's haunted by the tragic night, unsure of his own involvement in their deaths and mystified as to why his family was killed in the first place.Living a wretched half-life where his only interest is the well-being of his horses, Mansel is wandering about a fairground when he comes across a dubious diviner named Henry Jones who claims to heal all physical ailments. More to Mansel's interest though is the youth that Jones identifies as his son, a boy named Abel Hawkings and who claims to communicate with the dead. Both repulsed and fascinated by his claims, Mansel arranges a series of meetings with Abel who reveals both his powers and his tragic past - and promises to communicate with Mansel's family.Meanwhile - just to complicate matters - Sergeant James Riley has renewed interest in the case, and is asking several strange questions concerning their deaths. Furthermore, the correspondence between Lucy Allcot and her mother, the housekeeper at Mansel's mansion reveal more background as to the murders since both women know matters of the case and the people involved intimately.This simply isn't Crew's best work, though is entertaining reading throughout. Often the dialogue is stilted and comes across too much like exposition (such as the discussions of the crime) for the benefit of the reader and Mansel does so much back-and -forthing when it comes to conversations with Abel that it gets frustrating. The letters between mother and daughter often take long digressions on pointless gossip and some younger readers may be a little confused at the resolution of the entire story - I won't give it away, but there is an added \\"coda\\" of sorts that discusses Mansel and Abel's eventual fate which will make some go: \\"huh?\\"But Crew ingeniously leaves the crime itself partially unsolved - that is, although someone is eventually brought to justice, there is a lingering unease as to who the real culprit was. You can either look at this as an annoying red herring or as an extra mystery in tone with the Gothic atmosphere of the novel - I for one quite liked the note of ambiguity it brought to the ending. Most will enjoy this novel, but compared with Crew's other work and other mystery/supernatural YA reads in general, I have to admit I was a little disappointed."},{"Title":"The entailed hat; or, Patty Cannon's times,","review":"This book must have cult status on Maryland's Eastern Shore, and if it doesn't it should. I have lived my whole life on Maryland's \\"Western Shore\\" and had never heard of this book until I picked up a first edition of it in a bookshop.Published in 1884, \\"The Entailed Hat\\" weaves together the lives of a cast of characters in a tale only someone who lived close to those times could tell. As the story unfolds the reader can trace the geography and historical allusions in much of it. A group of citizens of the fabled town of Princess Anne in Somerset County have their lives turned upside down by the good hearted but wayward Judge Custis and the exceedingly evil Patty Cannon and her gang of kidnapping thugs. The story takes place in the 1820s. Cannon, who was a real person, committed suicide in prison in 1829. She instigated a web of crime in Caroline County and southern Delaware kidnapping freedmen and slaves and selling them in the South. Another central figure is the man who inherits a hat that is more than 100 years old - no problem there - but he dares to wear it about town, bringing scorn upon himself from his fellow townspeople and embarrassment to his family.You may have learned about Cannon in James McBride's 2009 novel \\"Song Yet Sung.\\" McBride came upon the Cannon story while researching for his novel and placed her as a character in his story about a runaway slave. It was in McBride's novel that I first learned about Cannon. So when I picked up \\"The Entailed Hat\\" at an antiquarian bookshop in Kennett Square, Pa., curious about the title, I was hooked, because when I opened it I found the subtitle was \\"Or, Patty Cannon's Times ~ A Romance.\\"But the title of this engrossing novel was the attention getter - first of all, what is an entailed hat? An entailed anything has to do with inheritance, but at what point does the story take place, I wondered ~ before or after the heir is bestowed with such a fortune as a hat? To solve such mysteries, of course, one has to read the book.The novel was written by George Alfred Townsend who was a Civil War correspondent and reporter for the New York Herald and New York World. He grew up in Georgetown, Delaware, the town where Cannon was jailed. Townsend was a writer with heightened sensitivity for the downtrodden of his day and his writing is both bold and beautiful.I have to share a part of it, so you can judge if you wish to be in his company for the time it requires you to take this incredible 500+ page journey to the pre-Civil War borderlands where lawbreaking was easy and justice hard to come by for much of the population.In a chapter about a black woman's attempt to escape kidnappers, Townsend pulls together with poetic license the sights and sounds that beckon to her and help her forget her suffering along her tortured route on the swampy backroads near Maryland's border with Delaware. There are many such passages as this, and if you love language and poetry as I do, you will want to re-read, as I did:\\"The sounds of restless animation, intenser in the night, as if the moon were mistress here, and wakened every insect brain and tongue to industry, grew prodigious in the sick girl's ears, and seemed to deaden every word her male companion had to say, and, like enormous pendulums of sound, the roaming crickets and amphibia swung to and fro their contradictions, like viragos doomed to wait for eternity, and each insist upon the last word to say: 'You did!' 'You didn't!' 'You did!' 'You didn't!' 'You didn't, you didn't!' 'You did, you did!' Thus the eternal quarrel, begun before Hector and the Greeks were born, had raged in the Cypress Swamp, and increased in loudness every night, till on the flying slave girl's ears it pealed like God and Satan disputing for her soul.\\"I loved this book, and you will too, if: you love 19th century novels you can learn history from, and you have a great patience for and appreciation of the language you find there and make allowances for same. If you make your way to this gate, prepare for a rich experience, of things and people you have never come across before. This is a truly unique tale peopled with characters who have strange vocabularies and ways of thinking and times you won't soon forget."},{"Title":"The entailed hat; or, Patty Cannon's times,","review":"I like his writing. It is history written in fiction and as you read it you actually feel as though you are involved in what goes on... Mr. Thownsend writes very discriptive of the era he writes about and the people. He covers the area of the eastern shores of Maryland, Chesapeake and Delaware very well in his writing. I find it a very good read and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys history written in this way."},{"Title":"The entailed hat; or, Patty Cannon's times,","review":"This book is remarkable in that the author, George Alfred Townsend (1841-1914), was a man of the time and place he wrote about. His novelized story, THE ENTAILED HAT OR, PATTY CANNON'S TIMES (sic), has its foundation on the real life of Patty Cannon and her pack of slave-kidnapping thugs, although it meanders slowly in pursuit of those events. It takes place along the Eastern Shore of Chesapeake Bay where Townsend was born and raised. The author didn't have to recreate the locale or dialogue and the characters, with all their peculiarities and old-fashioned comportment. He portrayed them as they really were. Nothing was contrived by the author and his accounts of human behavior, both courtly and crass, can be accepted as authentic. Unfortunately he was a blowhard.The author was a famous Civil War correspondent. He wrote under the pen name \\"Gath\\" and was widely read and admired in the late 1890s and early 1900s. According to author David Meredith, Gath's writing greatly influenced F. Scott Fitzgerald who \\"used certain themes, situations, devices and characters\\" to add to the \\"effect and significance of The Great Gatsby.\\" Fitzgerald also may have picked up some of Townsend's wordiness.Gath was fixated on the story of Martha \\"Patty\\" Cannon, a fearsome slave trader who was the leader of an early nineteenth century gang that kidnapped slaves and free blacks from the Eastern Shore and transported and sold them to plantation owners located further south. The United States Congress banned the importation of slaves in 1808, raising their cash value and creating a strong incentive for kidnappers. The gang's activities continued for many years, aided by local law enforcement's fear of local reprisals and Patty's reputation for violence when opposed.In 1829, when several bodies were found on Cannon's farm property, she was indicted for murder and jailed. Townsend, in his book, claims she poisoned herself. A side story that's not in the book because it happened in the twentieth century is the fact that her body had to be moved from its original burial site to make way for a parking lot. Her skull, separated from her skeletal remains during the reburial, was on display in several venues until finally loaned to the Dover Public Library in 1961. (Sidebar: According to Bob Wetherall, former library director, the skull, in fact, was at the library, kept in a red hat box, and shown when requested. It is now at the Smithsonian Institute and could be used as part of an upcoming display on life on the Eastern Shore.)HAT is not an easy read. It is tedious and wordy and the writing is stilted. The grammar is faulty (see my notation about the title) and the dialect is not always easy to follow. But it is an accurate portrayal of tumultuous pre-Civil War times in a backwater country. The author presents tragedy, whimsy, inhumanity, rough living and even a sense of dignity with absolute authenticity. He should have taken less time to accomplish it.Although Patty's exploits are mainly related in the second half of the book, the first half is a primer of period life leading up to the Cannon story. As a reader, I felt as though I was eyewitness to an interesting historical era, although it was a tough, uncomfortable journey. I will only recommend this book to the very dedicated historical scholar. It has limited entertainment value.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES"},{"Title":"Bicycle Repair Step by Step: The Full-Color Manual of Bicycle Maintenance and Repair (Bicycle Books)","review":"This is a very good book.

Just picking the book up for the first time, we see that it is filled with illustrations, from the most ancient to the most contemporary, of the sacred dances of the world's greatest cultural traditions. We are struck immediately by the powerful, feminine nature of dance, ultimately the celebration of the mystery of the feminine. The text, at once scholarly, informed, personal and at times touching the ecstatic, takes us to the inner spirit of the dance as a uniquely feminine expression. Lines like the following from the book leap out at the reader: &quot;The belly dance in the context of the birth ritual...was done not to project eroticism or to present the woman as a lure but to display a consciousness of the wonder of birth and the awesom power of motherhood.&quot; (p. 83)This book definitely opens our eyes to the sacred nature of dance and to its importance down through the ages for celebrating and teaching the great mysteries that defy verbal expression or scientific scrutiny. If we dare take it seriously, and Iris Stewart gives us every reason that we should, then it may be one of the most effective ways open to us for healing our relationship to nature.Because the book is so beautifully designed and illustrated, in an oversized format, it is a wonderful gift--but not your usual &quot;gift book&quot; or innocuous &quot;coffee table&quot; book. Its beauty extends deep into a brilliant text."},{"Title":"Sacred Woman, Sacred Dance: Awakening Spirituality Through Movement and Ritual","review":"This book has an unusual approach to the history of dance. It has lovely photos/illustrations, and thorough notations throughout. I recommend ot for its unique approach to dance, but not for its (sometimes suspect) history. It's an interesting book, with a lot of information.I can see using this book as a form of meditation I suppose that's as spiritual as you want it to be. There are interesting ideas here, and women who are exploring the meaning and origin of dance will probably find it a good read. As women's studies (which is one of the subjects this book falls into), it's a little lacking. She doesn't really provide enough hard evidence with some of her theories and interpretations to consider this a scholarly work. Women who are interested in the goddess will also find value in this book.I recommend it as an interesting read, as long as the reader understands that much of what she writes is an interpretation of history, and cobbled together from whatever sources were available. Since much of women's history was never written, interpretation is necessary, of course, but I don't know how much is interpretation and how much is embellishment."},{"Title":"Sacred Woman, Sacred Dance: Awakening Spirituality Through Movement and Ritual","review":"Many years ago when I first realized in a crystalline moment that I was one with the Universe, I was alone in a dew-wet field at sunrise with a very large old tree, and I suddenly and gently percieved that the tree was dancing with the Universe and I allowed myself to join in the dance. Ever since that time dance has been an important part of my spiritual expression and discovery. I am pleased to have come across this wonderful book by Iris J. Stewart because it is a treasure for any dancing soul. It is filled with inspiring illustrations from ancient to modern times of dance as a soulful pursuit of sacred knowledge. The author, herself a dancer, has written beautifully about her own experiences awakening to the spiritual aspects of movement as well as the history and applications of this creative and feminine form of spiritual expression. She introduces the reader to the dancing Goddess and the dancing Priestesses. She introduces us to some of the pioneer dancing divas like Isadora Duncan and Martha Graham and Mata Hari. We meet women from many cultures dancing evocative and colorful prayers to the Goddess. She inspires and invites us to allow ourselves to be moved and to follow that impulse into movement. She shows some of the many applications of the dance in theology, and in the art of healing, expressing lament, and in celebrating the coming of age among other creative uses. She has fresh and moving ideas for creating rites and offers descriptions of dances one can perform for moon rites and labyrinth meditations. She discusses the role of costumes and drumming. There is a brilliant chapter on the Dance of the Elements with lively and clear instructions for each of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire. The back of the book has a thorough list of resources that include addresses, phone numbers and websites that are concerned with sacred dance including a list of pilgrimage/study tours. The writing is so interesting and filled with details about the female experience of the sacred that even if one is not particularly interested in dance one will still be enriched by this contact with women for whom it is a part of Life. I recommend it to any woman who wishes to know herself better and to thereby know her sisters better. It is a joyous expression of the feminine vibration and one that should not be missed."},{"Title":"Sacred Woman, Sacred Dance: Awakening Spirituality Through Movement and Ritual","review":"I found this wonderful book while taking up the dance after a 25 year period of no dance in my life. It is like an instruction manual for awakening movement. Each chapter has an activity at the end that seems to break down old inhibitions and moldy ideas that crept in during the years I sacrificed for my family.The author and other individuals who contributed to the writing of this wonderful work gently encouraged me. As a practicing Buddhist,I found the Dance of The Twentyone Tara's very inspiring. I have contacted the creator of that dance and she returned contact with me. It is a living link between ancient times and tangeble resources available today!Happy Dancing one and all."},{"Title":"Sacred Woman, Sacred Dance: Awakening Spirituality Through Movement and Ritual","review":"What a beautiful compilation!

This book tells a beautiful story through images and words. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sacred Woman, Sacred Dance: Awakening Spirituality Through Movement and Ritual","review":"This book is a gem for anyone interested in Sacred Dance for Women. It delves into the history, types, costumes, ritual, current and ancient traditions of dance. As a Beginner to Sacred Dance, I found this book easy to understand, full of hte &quot;basic movements,&quot; plus rich with well researched information that dispells some myths about dance. For example, belly dance was not really a dance of enticement, but a birthing dance used by women having a baby. The photos clearly invite one to a feast of dance. I found this book very inspiring to a Beginner like me to realize that dance really is such a rich and ancient tradition of natural movements for a women. Through the various movements of the body, a woman can delve deeper into her own healing process and spirituality in a natural and honorable way. Sacred Dance is a wonderful and ancient form of a spiritual path which this books gives a wonderful overview. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in the Dance tradition with a spiritual twist yet not too technical. The modern resources in the back of the book do not leave one stranded but wanting to follow-up and go search out places to go dance!"},{"Title":"Sacred Woman, Sacred Dance: Awakening Spirituality Through Movement and Ritual","review":"Iris Stewart has done a fine job of illustrating the history of women and sacred dance from paleolithic to modern cultures.

The chapter about trance dancing is very informative also, enchanting in its descriptions.The book's many pictures are stunning (as is the author herself), and certainly every picture enhances already intriguing text.My favorite picture is a photograph of Russian dancer Vera Morova (who gave up ballet to pursue Oriental dance) in a pose from her Snake Dance - the most exotic costuming and form imaginable!A generous resource guide, notes section, and bibliography conclude the book."},{"Title":"Sacred Woman, Sacred Dance: Awakening Spirituality Through Movement and Ritual","review":"This is a wonderful book for any woman who is searching to uncover her own hidden &quot;feminine&quot; gifts thorough dance, or for one who is searching out all woman history to re-build her own.

Is that not worth a few dollars? One could call it the bible of spirituality through movement, music, beauty. For it is a moving exploration, both personal and academic; through dance, history, archeology, ritual, music, raiment and more. A rediscovery of ancient ways lost or pushed aside by the growth of organized, hierarchical religion. A means to rebirth of these ways that are being revived, or were kept alive, by and for women as well as men. One of the most amazing things to me was to find out that many modern dancers that i admired as free spirits were also deeply philosophical, and deeply committed to keeping personal spiritual expression and sharing alive. In addition to the exploration, there are: movement experiences to try, an extensive compendium of further sources, and many colorful visuals~~~~~"},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"As much as I want to rave about Tertium Organum, I can't. The early chapters of Tertium Organum build such a grand beginning with expectations that a deeper understanding would be found. What I discovered is a light weight conclusion that gave way to a religious experience that only suggests the author couldn't answer his own question. I can not recommend Tertium Organum. The author is well educated and has a talent for expressing his opinion in lanuage easily understood. Yet, what he promises for the reader at the begining, is not what the conclusion resulted in. I advise caution when attempting to embrack on this quest, and warn that though the author makes strong points, I felt less sure of my understanding of what I read and more upset with the lack of ability to end the conversation strongly."},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"There is a dichotomy between those using exclusively rationalist approaches who require a \\"scientific basis\\" for any theory in order for them to consider it, and those who are more open-minded and intuit that the mere intellect is not equipped to understand transcendant and ultimate truths.This book is an intellectual exercise based on intuition and great learning that goes way beyond conventional speculation."},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"This book is one for the ages, baby!

Great read!"},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"I read this many years ago and confess that most of it was over my head at the time. Something about the human body being nourished by different types of \\"hydrogens.\\" I dismissed most of it as incoherent new age fluff.What I do remember are the parts about Gurdjieff. He is quoted as saying that there is no \\"secret knowledge;\\" there does not need to be since most people aren't interested in taking the necessary time to learn about these systems, so the knowledge is just as \\"safe\\" if it is freely available. This ties in to another story Ousepensky relates. Gurdjieff apparently owned a rug store. A customer insisted on haggling the price of a rug far beyond what was considered reasonable. Finally Gurdjieff lost patience and offered to sell the entire stock of the store for his asking price for the one rug. The customer paused briefly, considered, then continued haggling.Gurdjieff was a charlatan and a con man, but those glimpses of his life made more of an impression on me than the blather about \\"hydrogens\\" and how A can be A and not-A. I also learned about \\"Meetings With Remarkable Men\\" which was made into a very fine and remarkably beautiful film.\\"It is either raining or not raining.It is not raining.Therefore, it is raining.\\"\\"'Yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation' yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation.\\""},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"Translated from the Russian by Nicholas Bessaraboff and Claude Bragdon with an introduction by Claude Bragdon."},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"Although in a genre of the mystical rejected with vehemence by a scientific age, this, the best, of Ouspensky's works, before he got caught in the morass of the Gurdjieff system, outsmarted such charges by the cogent beginning of his consideration in the works of Kant. Any metaphysical startup needs a Kant bypass routine, Ouspensky's is clever (J.G. Bennett's at the beginning of Dramatic Universe is mostly hot air). The beginning is a tour de force in its perfect pitch for an age of positivism determined it seems to make men forget what man is, and what constitutes his real evolutionary psychology. From this gambit the work is suspect in so far as this invocation of metaphysical austerity is a moment's penitence for a renewed vision of the ghostseer, yet finally it asks the question that haunts the modern technological world, with its ideologically impoverished one-dimensional man. Like Schopenhauer and Hegel together in the shadow of Kant, Ouspensky nonetheless knows he must risk the venture beyond the finished critiques of metaphysics, and his journey carries an extraordinary resemblance to the forgotten steps of Hegel's journey into his own logic of the infinite. One often suspects these reactionaries of wishing to rewrite Hegel without his modernist vein. The comparison is useful, for it reminds us that Hegel, as so often, came here in his groping fashion, and did so alone with less polish what Ouspensky finds in derivative readings of ancient texts, and brought to it the idea of freedom, where Ouspensky still labors in the murky obscurities of political antiquity. The demand for a new logic is, in principle, a perfectly acceptable move, however premature its hope, and the imperfection of the result. At the end, we are left to wonder how a man who struck this note of such charm succumbed so readily to the suspect metaphysics of Gurdjieffian hucksterism."},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"\\"Tertium Organum\\", by P.D. Ouspensky (Uspenskii), a Russian mathematician-turned-mystic who studied under another Russian mystic, G.I. Gurdjieff, is characterized by its regression into Platonism with an Eastern philosophy/psychology undertone. His conception of consciousness, \\"cosmic consciousness\\", as well as his interpretation of Einstein's Theory of Relativity and fourth dimension, is highly mystical and thus has little to do with reality qua reality. The following is a comparison chart that demonstrates the difference between Aristotle's Organum and Ouspensky's Tertium Organum:Organum: A is A.A is not not-A.Each existent is either A or not-A.Tertium Organum: A is both A and not-A.orAll is A and A is all.If A is both A and not-A, how can one identify A in the first place? If Tertium Organum is true, then everything loses its identity and nothing can be known -- even Tertium Organum itself cannot be known. Ouspensky recognizes that his logic is absurd and attempts to exculpate himself from this apparent contradiction by saying, \\"We must be prepared for the fact that it is impossible to express superlogical relations (\\"higher logic\\") in our language.\\" Ouspensky's philosophy is based upon a profound mistrust and contempt for man's \\"ordinary\\" cognitive process and the power of reason. His philosophy leads to a complete denial of conceptual knowledge and his \\"higher logic\\" is a total negation of reality in the name of a \\"higher reality\\". Only those individuals profoundly dissatisfied and unhappy with reality could aspire to such a philosophy. Although, P.D. Ouspensky was one of the most brilliant Platonists in history, integrating Eastern mysticism into Platonism with remarkable intellectual sophistication, this brand of mysticism like any other is a symtom of man's default in epistemological integrity and the cause of all human suffering."},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"I wrote a longer review, but it got deleted. So I'm writing a short one and hope to post a longer one later. I believe Ouspensky should not be taken seriously, because there are parts in this book where he treats objective subjects like mathematics and makes grave errors in reasoning to support his ideas. This is more disturbing in light of the fact he is called a mathematician. He mentions Aristotle, Bacon, and Einstein, but this does not mean his thought is on par with theirs. The fallacies in his logic cannot be excused by saying that people in his time were naive. After all, Einstein must have understood his own theory of relativity. Ouspensky even makes a mistake to the effect of, \\"If a square has length x, then it has area x to the xth power.\\" (It should be x squared.) If his mathematics cannot be taken seriously, why should his philosophy?"},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"I agree with the previous review. The math is faulty, the philosophy the same. Ouspensky is a hack. This book is a mere curiosity, nothing more! Reader beware: The Fellowship of Friends, an international cult uses Ouspenskian philosophy as its centerpiece!"},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"This is one of those great Books that has suffered because of a lack of readership capable of comprehending it. If one has the left brain traits necessary to grasp the transfinite logic and mathematics, then the mystical implications are ungraspable. And if you have the right brain intuition to understand the mystical implications, then you often struggle with the logic and mathematics. This book requires a reader with not only a first rate mind, but also a balanced one.To briefly abstract the primary thesis: time is really motion in extra dimensional space. This is profound, for Ouspensky was the first to actually point towards where an actual, physical fourth dimension can be found. Our brains confuse this dimension with time. It can be split off from time with an adjustment, or evolution, of consciousness. You see, this represents the next huge leap in understanding the nature of the universe and reality. Just as Newton's undefined quantity of \\"gravity\\" was shown to actually be curved space, so does Ouspensky show Einstein's undefined quantity of \\"time\\" to be motion through higher physical dimensions.If you want a book that will challenge you, this is it. One day these ideas are going to shake the very foundations of mainstream science, of mankind's collective view of \\"reality\\"...."},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"Ouspensky brings together many of the most extraordinary facets of Relativity Theory, Kantian philosophy, Eastern mysticism, Western spiritual traditions, ways of looking at the symbolism of art and ordinary life, and powerful revelations from mathematics. In this book, he is a master of using images, metaphors, and analogies to help free the mind, opening the intuition to amazing areas of wonder. The suggestive power of many of the ideas in Tertium Organum are at a breath-taking level. I especially recommend this book to anyone who has an abiding love of Philosophy, Religion, Science, and Art."},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"P.D. Ouspensky lucidly and along definite philosophical reasonings guides the reader from our 3-dimensional world to higher dimensional realities. As humans we perceive the &quot;World&quot; not as it is, but rather as our perceptive faculties communicate it to us. Therein lies the difficulty of comprehending higher orders (our own hard wiring). Ouspensky's greatness is his ability to elucidate higher truths by straightforward analogy and reasoning. The author marries the ideas and teachings of many great thinkers into one multifaceted format. Mystical teachings are explained from a scientific slant and revolutionary scientific Ideas lead to a mystical end. The ultimate aim is to lead the reader to the ultimate truth of &quot;THOU ART THAT&quot; or &quot;I AM&quot;."},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"Ouspensky's philosophy may seem dated to some, but is interesting within its historical context. At the early part of the century, physics, psychology, technologies and arts such as cinema, etc. were coming into the public consciousness. Through the mediums of the phonograph, the photograph, and the film, time and space were fractured - one didn't need to be somewhere to experience something. Our understanding of the nature of the universe had been undermined by physicists and mathematicians such as Planck and Einstein. Moreover, theosophy had a large audience (a result of these factors, to an extent). Within this mileau Ouspensky penned his work describing, to a large degree, how our perception played into things. There is a fantastic section in the book where he describes (a very film-reel-like) rotating circle and how it would be perceived by someone in a one-, two-, three-, and four-dimensional world. Then he explains that these perceptions could exist side-by-side, that it isn't the physical world that changed, but merely the perception. Given how the world seemed to be changing radically due to an increasing understanding of it (or at least our models of it), such a conclusion, while elegant and genius in its own right, seems plausible.Ouspensky's interesting background helps explain his insight - he is an early \\"out-of-the-box\\" thinker. He was a mathematician (logic, models, etc.) who was influenced by/a follower of Gurdjieff the mystic (a bit of the opposite of math, I'm afraid). Moreover, Gurdjieff, or at least interest in him and his teachings, have a lot to do with Ouspensky sticking around to the extent he has. People have explored him via their interest in Gurdjieff or later followers. That is a shame, because I think that Ouspensky's ideas are worth consideration on their own. If some seem dated, ridiculous, or quaint, look at the work of some of his contemporaries that are held in high regard (Freud comes to mind here).Another reason to consider this book, however, is its influence on a small number of influential people. For example, the American poet Hart Crane was influenced by Ouspensky's Tertium Organum, and some references can be seen in his epic poem \\"The Bridge\\" (though they may be confused with some of the Blake references/influences).Overall, I recommend the book. I found it challenging at times, but worthwhile reading. I especially think that scholars of Modernism and/or Gurdjieff will find interesting material in it. At the very least, it may change your perception of what people were thinking and discussing in the early 20th century."},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"This book is amazing.

Some of these regions such as Lazio have been the beneficiaries of several excellent treatments. For some reason, all the treatments of Tuscan cuisine in general have been too heavily oriented toward the travelogue or too self-serving to the business interests of the author. One notable exception is \`The Tuscan Year' by Elizabeth Romer' which, however, is much more a personal memoir than a good survey of the region as a whole.To be sure, good regional cookbooks come in at least three different flavors. Romer's work and Vincent Schiavelli's \`Many Beautiful Things' (on Sicily) is the culinary memoir, Mario Batali's \`Simple Italian Food' and Suzanne Dunaway's \`Rome, At Home' are examples of personal interpretations of home cooking from a region, and Lynne Rosetto Kaspar's \`The Splendid Table' and Fred Plotkin's \`La Terra Fortunata' aim at giving us a fairly representative survey of a regions most distinctive dishes.Cesare Casella's \`true tuscan' falls somewhere between the personal treatment and the more scholarly study. But, the fact that it does not fit into an easy pigeonhole is definitely not a reason to consider it a poor book. It is, in fact, a very, very good book of Tuscan dishes. The means by which the author certifies this as a representation of Tuscan cuisine is by the simple fact that it is his cuisine, he is a professional chef, and he is Tuscan, at least originally. One thing this means is that there are more than a few dishes herein that originated in Liguria, Lazio, and points south. This is not really surprising since this book tends to confirm Fred Plotkin's statement in \`La Terra Fortunata' that Tuscany is really in the middle of the pack among Italian regional cuisines, after Emilia-Romagna, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Campania, Liguria, and even Puglia. And, my respect for this book is based heavily on the fact that it is one of the very few Italian cookbooks, which exemplifies the poverty of the historical Italian cuisine. In fact, Tuscany boasts two major influences to interesting cuisine in that during the Renaissance, it had one of the most powerful noble houses in Italy, that being the Medici's of Florence. And, a noble court is one of the four underpinnings of great cuisine stipulated by Paula Wolfert.This is one of the very few books which shows the importance of inexpensive ingredients such as beans, greens, stale bread, cheap fish, and organ meats in a lot of different dishes. One or more of these ingredients appear in virtually every recipe. At the same time, the book celebrates another hallmark of Italian cuisine, the celebratory dish, especially the now very famous timbale seen in Stanley Tucci's film, \`Big Night'. This is specifically the \`Pasticchio alla Fiorentina' with a pastry shell rather than a pasta or bread based shell. Like all the other \`big' timbale recipes, this includes everything but the kitchen sink, with both a bechamel sauce and a meat ragu similar to ragu Bolognaise.I really like the fact that Casella has organized his recipes by the five major traditional courses of an Italian meal. These are:Antipasti, featuring several dishes which are a lot more complicated than the simple crostini. Tarts made with vegetables and organ meats plus dishes based on octopus, cuddlefish, and squid are heavily featured. There is even a recipe for an octopus salami. One of the most interesting I found is an oven fried calamari. It also includes a very Sicilian salad of shrimp, blood oranges, and fennel.Primi Piatti (Soups, Pastas, and Risotto) with lots of soups based on cheap vegetables such as potatoes, onions, and leeks. True to the doctrine laid down by Mario Batali, the chicken stock is not your typical French production requiring many hours. It needs nothing more than some chicken legs, celery, carrots, onions, salt, and an hour to cook. I am also surprised to find three different gnocchi recipes. I am becoming more and more convinced that gnocchi is even more universal in the various Italian regions than either fresh or dried pasta, as everyone seems to have a recipe for it. Swiss Chard, the true Tuscan leafy green (not spinach) is the featured ingredient in one of the gnocchis. The most interesting recipe in this chapter is a technique for cooking pasta \`al cartoccio' (in parchment).Secondi (Seafood, Poultry, and Meats) which includes the original recipe for monkfish \`osso buco' and a cowboy style \`Tuscan Spareribs' (\`Maremmana') which the author delights in clarifying by noting that there are, in fact, cowboys in Tuscany, in the district known as Maremma.Contorni (Vegetables, Beans, and Other Side Dishes) , has the most typical Tuscan dishes containing either green leafy vegetables or beans, plus beets, potatoes, peas, and mushrooms.Dolci (Desserts) is a rather small chapter, quite in keeping with the conventional wisdom that the Italians are not big sweet dessert eaters. And, one of the features in this chapter is the molten chocolate cake made famous by the very French Jean-Georges Vongerichten. But, even this short chapter has some treasures such as bean fritters \`Fagioli Fritti', with a little plug for Casella's \`Republic of Beans' business for importing dried Italian beans.The book ends with a decent bibliography and list of sources, but you probably know everything there already if you have three or more good Italian cookbooks.For a list price of less than $25, this book is a great find, and the very best book of recipes I have yet found based on the cuisine of Tuscany, even if the author colors outside the lines a bit.

Maybe &quot;cluetrain&quot; would have been prophetic had it come out 5 years earlier, but I was left feeling &quot;so what?&quot; and &quot;that's all you could think of?&quot;. And if it was all they could think of, they were successful at delivering in the most stupefyingly annoying way. Reminds me of some over-the-hill pot-bellied geezers who hobble with their guitar to the stage with the assistance of walkers and beller &quot;ARE U READY TO ROCK?&quot; and fall down.

The Internet changed everything, all right. Those who can bite back the irony long enough to see the big picture and keep reading will find some valuable practical advice on using the now-not-so-new-technology of the Web to do business more effectively. We recommend this pivotal book for the sake of your sense of perspective (or to give you a critically necessary background if you are too young to remember when Amazon was just a river.)"},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"Hits the nail on the head and is still relevant in 2001 and beyond --- I can't understand the other reviews that diminish the depth and understanding that is in this book --- Bravo!!"},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"Yes, we all know that Internet is chaging the way we live, but we do not know how. I've enjoyed this new view of things, because the authors truly believe in what they say. They are not your typical gurus trying to make money with their new book. Original, entretaining, and, above all, will give anyone who works with the net, has a wide view of business and a little of power to change things, the perfect tool to start from scratch and reinvent the way we talk to each other, either in work or in our private life."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"While this book was a little too earnest and revolutionary for my taste, I no longer rate books on their overall style, delivery, etc... If I get one or two ideas that turn on a lightbulb in my head, that's good enough for me. And this book more than did that. This book was like music for the soul. I had long ago realized I was burned out on empty, disingenuine sounding marketing rhetoric and that the idea of conducting business without decency and ethics just did not work for me. So this book was like balm for the soul in that it a) reassured me I was far from alone in the deaf ear I had developed toward 'marketsy speak&quot; b) convinced me that a new age of business is dawning - one that will promote honesty in how an average company conducts its affairs internally and externally and one that will restore dignity to the average worker.

The faux communication that this book attacks is EXACTLY what I've always found really frustrating about working for one of the largest technology companies to yet exist, the false impression that management can control communication positively with the market.

I buy milk and t-shirts and fax machines and hotel rooms without entering a conversation - online or offline. So the notion that markets are conversations falls apart under casual inspection.In fact, most people aren't going online to \\"join the conversation\\". They are going online to shop for books in their pajamas, or read the news, or watch YouTube videos. This is another fiction stated loudly by the authors but not supported by evidence.They ring the warning bell loudly but there's no fire. The authors caution businesses that won't let their employees speak freely online, saying they can go out of business \\"overnight\\". But they don't produce a single example of a business that failed because it wouldn't join the conversation.The authors use phrases so full of gas it makes your upper lip curl. Case in point on page 120 \\"The web world is bigger than the business world and is swallowing the business world whole. The vague rumblings you're hearing are the sounds of digestion.\\" Truly reptilian.In their defense, they do make a good point that marketing has taken on a tinny and hollow sound. But that's been true for decades. I do agree it's time for marketers to sound like human beings, not brochures. For this point alone, I give them 2 stars.But this is a work of fiction by 4 self-absorbed pseudo-intellectuals who are clueless, but aren't afraid to just write the manifesto anyway."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"I discovered the Cluetrain Manifesto through Wired magazine, visited the Cluetrain website, then bought the book. For maximum value, I recommend either visiting the site or reading the book, but not both -- they reinforce each other more through repetition than by complementing each other.The book contains some interesting anecdotes that can't be found on the site, and of course can be read on a plane or bus. There are some additional insights in the book, and things are covered in a little more depth.The fundamental message is a good one: consumers will find each other and interact more than ever (mostly thanks to the Internet/Web). As they do this, these conversations will seem more &quot;real,&quot; &quot;honest&quot; and &quot;authentic,&quot; and that will erode carefully prepared marketing messages, branding, positioning, etc. (which will be viewed for what they are -- BS) For companies to be successful, say the authors, companies have got to come to terms with this, and realize that well-connected consumers are immune to rhetoric, and in fact may rail against it.The hyperbolic book and manifesto may be overwrought, but there's truth at their heart, and they are entertaining reading.

Because the wisdom it dispenses apply not only to our own time and place. The authors hurl criticisms valid and not so valid at the current state of the affairs, but the criticisms will apply just as accurately to whatever replaces the Internet and the virtual enterprise. This book could have been self-righteous. Instead, it is righteous. There's a lot to learn and a lot to forget. I keep this book close by and refer to it from time to time to calibrate my humanity."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"It's true that the authors of The Cluetrain Manifesto aren't saying anything new to those who've believed in the power of the Internet from the first time they launched a web browser or read a newsgroup. But they've enumerated those beliefs in a very compelling and awe-inspiring volume of the truths of operating in the Internet Economy. Namely that doing business in this world means opening up your organization to the scrutiny of your customers and every member of your organization; that markets are conversations and those who can best facilitate communication will triumph; that information yearns to be free. If you're looking for a how-to book or a silver bullet to reinvigorate your business, look elsewhere. But if you believe in the power of technology to connect you to your customers, or desperately want to believe, get on board the Cluetrain."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"I enjoyed reading this book...the authors had a lot of very enlightening points and they presented their material in a much more &quot;down to earth&quot;, magazine style way than the average business book.

Their description of worker motivations and customer reactions was quite accurate.They captured the idea of the Internet being a tidal force in the marketplace very well...HOWEVER - they authors beat the dead horse WAY too much after the first 75 pages or so. I feel that the book could have been made much stronger by heavier editing - truly 20% of it could have been completely axed and we'd have all been better off for it...Overall, though, I highly recommend reading this book for its unique perspective on the Internet and how it may change business from both the customers' and employess' vantage points.

My guess is that its the delivery people don't like, not the message. Personally, I tend to think its just plain common sense but I won't pretend I had a clue before reading. After reading, its painfully obvious.There are several extremely valuable realizations about how the internet changes business (and much more) which you likely ought to consider as you think about your business.If you want better insight into what is so exciting and empowering about the internet for customers this is worth the read. Some of you can probably get enough by just reading the manifesto. Status quo corporations, you need to be on your guard (chances are you're not reading this anyway).I would have preferred a little less 60's &quot;revolution is in the air&quot; hype. If you're looking for a revolution, take another hit of acid and wait. This book simply describes what inevitably happens when better communication and information is available in a free market economy.I also think the book could have been written in about 30 pages but those 30 pages were powerful enough to deserve 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"If you've given this whole World Wide Web thingamajigger any modicum of serious consideration, then the Manifesto is required reading. This book provides a smorgasbord of food for thought, along with plenty of chuckles and a genuine belly laugh or two. Above all, it manages to articulate (in easy-to-swallow in-your-face style) a liminal moment not just in the evolution of business, but in the evolution of human culture. An overstatement? It might seem so ... now. Read this book, and you'll see it's more like the tip of the iceberg. But wait, there's more -- you'll probably find your optimism meter ratcheted up a few notches.

Your are aboard whether you know it or not."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"This is about as far away from a traditonal business book as you can get. The Cluetrain Manifesto is about the end of business as usual and the role of the Internet as the empowerer to the masses. It whitewashes the world that traditional marketing and advertising paint. The authors clearly present a simple choice to businessmen. Ride the Cluetrain, understand that markets are conversations, and that customers and workers will have these conversations whether you like it or not, or lose your business. The book is written in an anecdotal fashion and as such some of it should be taken with a pinch of salt. An interesting and provocative read - not for the faint hearted or unimaginative."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"Ignore what you've heard.I suspect that at the dawn of the next century, when they discuss the follies and hubris that surrounded the Net Set just before the stock crash of early April, The Cluetrain Manifesto may merit its own footnote as the most concise example of what went wrong.One should naturally be suspicious of the marketing efforts for a book on marketing. Obviously, right? But nine out of ten people that I asked about Cluetrain recommended it without ever having read a page.When I actually brought it home, what I found was, in equal measure, recycled thinking, poorly supported thinking, and thinking that simply hadn't come with the appropriate scrutiny. If the authors had not been so (justly, I might add) famous, it's doubtful that this mess would have seen print, let alone mention in the NYT Review of Books. The one or two genuinely interesting ideas -- cited in every single review, so I won't bother mentioning them here -- are strictly inapplicable to real life.I'm hard pressed to think of a reason to buy Cluetrain, particularly when there are so many other, more compelling works on the market. Unless, of course, you want a keepsake from the turn-of-the-century follies."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"I have found the book as a place where the old business thinking collides with the new breed of business people and not only those related to e-commerce but in general.The work summarized in the Cluetrain Manifesto finds many supporters as well as many detractors. The attitude towards the book is directly related to the environment where the reader has developed.In my mind the controversial work in Cluetrian is a signal of a major change going where the sincerity, the honesty and the consistency of any business in the world will be one of the defining factors in the success or failure of any company or new venture.I have rated 4 stars because the authors put too much blame in people which grew business when the rules where different. However it is very inspiring from the central thoughts repeated along the book.As readers, our home work is to distill the wisdom associated with the basic ideas of the book and to implement them appropiately for practical and profitable applications.I strongly recommed its reading."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"The rise of the internet has enabled people to restart conversations in a global world, conversations which were interrupted by the rise of giant bureaucracies which were able to use their special knowledge, the power of advertising and public relations and sheer distance to suspend true market conversation.That is the basic message of this very unusual book. Its corollary is that the balance of power is shifting back to articulate, well informed and, above all, well linked consumers. The large suppliers will try to ignore this at their peril.The book starts with 95 theses which constitute the 'Manifesto' - presumably a direct reference to Luther's famous 95 theses against the sale of indulgences (in 1517) that marked the start of the Reformation in Europe. One senses a bit of a stretch to get to the full 95, but the seven pages of the Manifesto are well worth reading (and deserve a place in many Boardrooms).Like Luther, the authors of this book want to change things. They are serving notice to big corporates (today's equivalent of the early 16th century Church) that they had better start human to human conversation and a bit of old-fashioned listening. Advertising, 'PR statements' and similar tools are becoming counter-productive. (The whole genetically modified foods debate is a fascinating example of the effect of people power on large corporates.)This is a book to browse. It has a serious and important message about the impact of global conversation on the way business will be done. It is discursive, very funny in patches, and highly informative about the incredible variety of ways in which conversations can now be maintained. Its main concern is the impact of these conversations on business. I found myself speculating about their impact on politics, which is becoming at least as profound. It is a fair bet that within the next few years, elections will be won or lost on the internet and the sterile 'machine politics' of so many democracies will (hopefully) become an endangered species."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"Read this book, then read this book again.

Businesses, the authors theorize, are merely collections of conversations among employees, managers and customers, and they always have been. The Internet is a tool, which has empowered customers with a human voice. It has also empowered employees to speak to each other and to the customers with their own voices, outside of the controlling dogma the organization may expound. The Internet, say the authors, is inherently radicalizing.The Corporate world, with its hierarchical structure and its fervent management of people and products, may convey a sense of security to those who live in fear of risk, failure and unfairness. However, this over-management also stifles the human voice. We have embraced the Internet, say the authors, out of a desperate need to reclaim our voices and experience unfettered human interaction. This networked interaction, is making smarter markets, networked markets that aren't the least bit interested in advertising and don't have to pay attention.If companies want to remain competitive, they will need to speak the language of their customers. This language is informal, sincere, open and honest. In the future, successful companies will share the concerns of their customers. They will need to be a part of the community and participant in the conversations within their communities.The authors are not promising a step-by-step method which corporations can use to \\"fix\\" the disconnect between themselves and the market. They don't believe there is one. Instead, they are making provocative statements designed to draw corporations into the conversation, encouraging them to carefully consider the issues and people involved. Involving yourself in the conversation, they say, is the only way to make sure you aren't left behind. You can familiarize yourself with their ideas by reading their 95 Theses on www.cluetrain.com."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"This book definitely opens up one's eyes to the way the internet is changing business and communication. It puts into words what many of us have understood, but up until now have been unable to articulate. The problem I have with this book is the tone that assumes that no one else is smart enough to have figured this out and their continual references to &quot;scared middle-aged white men&quot; is boderline militant feminism and racism. One last comment is the fact that they act like they have all the answers and the way current business is run is all wrong. Well companies have been doing pretty good long before this book came out, so they are doing something right. Lastly the way they promote openess to information amongst people and companies borders on communism. &quot;Let information be free&quot; they cry.

The authors are right about certain things: networked markets learn fast. Buzzwords prevent actual communication. But... the book is a big sloppy mess. The authors unfortunately are clueless about the history of business, of economics, or about how most people actually live. The book is long rant, repeating the same thoughts over and over, but terribly short on substance. The only example of the power of their new way of thinking is a story about how United made some people on a newsgroup like them. That's about it, folks. The biggest problem is the idea that before the web, we were all big slugs absorbing info from the TV, and since the web, we are all zooming around reading newsgroups and talking to people about every purchase we make. I wish the authors had spent more time talking to actual everyday people, instead of their fellow hardcore webheads. A bit of perspective would have helped them a lot.Their take on industrialization is also pretty silly. A little time spent reading about the history of business would have helped them a lot. The last section of the book goes totally off the deep end, offering the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima as examples of why they're right. Whatever, guys. It can be fun to read (and some of the contributors are a whole lot smarter than others) but ultimately, there's nothing there. The ideas are appealing, you *want* to believe the whole thing, but when you start noticing the really bad assumptions the authors have made, the lack of concrete examples of anything, the incredibly repetition, you just can't. And it's a shame, because there are some really provocative ideas here that shouldn't be dismissed, however badly the authors have presented them.

You want us to pay?

That doesn't mean you'll want to take all the advice the authors offer you. Some of it is dished out for shock value, some of it you might well find beyond the pale.But it will help you to understand some of the underlying principles and values of conversation on the web, why some things look and sound the way they do, and why a broadcast model marketing pitch is *not* the way to go when you're doing business on the net.The 'advice' offered by the authors was the part I found hardest to swallow - like this tenet that you \\"have\\" to play, because conversation on the net is not the place for things that re more serious and goal-oriented (really, so no-one's trying to do business?)What I found most helpful was the analogy of the internet as a bazaar, the conversations that are springing up like the ancient trade routes, congregating around common interests and shared points of view. This provides us with a meaningful hook for thinking about the way we write on the web: to engage; to attract attention; to leave the room for a conversation; to banter, barter and have a bit of fun; to make a lasting connection (so folk will come back); to speak the same language as those who are moving past; to listen to what you hear people talking about and looking for.This is the main 'take-away' message that I got from Cluetrain: \\"If you want to barter, get down off that camel!\\"It's a powerful and valuable message and I'd say the book was worth reading to \\"get\\" this and some other big ideas that drive the modern web... just remember to take the advice with a pinch of salt, and find a way of writing that reflects your personality, your style, your personal and business values."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"This influential book lays out the reasons why companies need to replace corporate speak and marketing puff with online conversations. The reasons are compelling, but the way the authors make their case won't win them many converts. They go on the attack with scathing gusto, dismissing \\"Fort Business\\" as a bunch of obsolete buffoons and/or swindlers. Strangely, these buffoons and swindlers are the very people Cluetrain hopes to convert to an entirely new way of thinking.Looking past the rhetoric, Cluetrain really does make some crucial points. Here are a few that stood out to me -1. The control mentality of management doesn't work in a wired world where people and information are easily and instantly connected.2. Companies pay too much attention to competitors and not enough to customers.3. If companies did pay attention to customers, they'd discover that customers want \\"Authenticity, honesty, and personal voice ...\\" (p. 51) Companies mistakenly view customers as consumers instead of people. We don't exist to consume (hopefully).4. \\"Positioning should help a company become what it is, not something it's not (no matter how cool it would be).\\" (p. 99)5. You can't bluff about your company or products online. People will find you out.6. The Web challenges formal corporate organizational structures. People can connect and collaborate with whomever they need to in order to get the job done. The Web values competence over position.Of course, all of this was just as true before the Web. However, the Web has magnified their importance. Today, the penalties for ignoring the Cluetrain principles are stiff, and the rewards are huge, and in the years ahead - even more so.For a gentler and more balanced assessment of conversations in business and the new marketing rules, tryNaked Conversations: How Blogs are Changing the Way Businesses Talk with CustomersandThe New Rules of Marketing and PR: How to Use News Releases, Blogs, Podcasting, Viral Marketing and Online Media to Reach Buyers Directly."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"Reading the \\"Cluetrain Manifesto\\" today is like reading an historic document. The book fuses the countercultural ethos of the 1960s with the go-go business dynamics of the 1990s. Written during the height of the Internet boom, the authors forecast the end not only of corporate marketing, but of traditional corporations altogether. They predicted a transition to an Internet-enabled marketplace of bartering and bantering individuals. The book's pages contain a wealth of overstatement, hyperbole, and provocation (as many have already noted). The flurry of lawsuits based on offhand email (\`evidence mail') which emerged after the Internet crash have reemphasized the need for the caution and disclaimers to which the authors so passionately objected.The basic message of the book remains fresh and contemporary, however. \\"Markets are conversations.\\" Corporations should encourage those conversations, not inhibit them. It's clear that many corporations still haven't gotten the point. Some companies still require that customers sign pointless non-disclosure agreements to talk with their representatives and other customers about their products. Other companies treat their websites like big, glossy advertising brochures instead of centers of community. Still others issue the bland and senseless press releases derided by the Cluetrain Manifesto to their customers, leaving bloggers to read between the lines and to speculate about what's really going on inside the company.But some of the largest corporations have clearly gotten the message--or at least a tempered form of it. The best way to cultivate loyalty and confidence among consumers is to become more transparent by allowing conversations to take place not simply between consumers and public relations representatives, but between people working with products and people designing those products. Microsoft's Channel 9 is a good example of a corporation sponsoring an online community that connects individuals to individuals. While this kind of marketing will doubtlessly always be somewhat messy and make some P.R. folk uneasy, it's far more effective than the business-as-usual approach of issuing sanitized press releases to an anonymous group of \`consumers.'

The authors do an outstanding job explaining the change and where to go from here.Main premise: Until the late 1800's/early 1900's the world mainly traded as an agrarian society. Markets were local meaning we traded in our own village and local societies. Markets like these were very personal. With the onset of the industrial age, markets became impersonal and markets were spoken to in masses through large advertisements and other one-way mediums. Today, the world is turning into a mass-agrarian society. Through technology and transportation the world is becoming small and advertising has become two-way meaning the consumer has a voice. Great for the consumer. Challenging for the marketer.

The central startling simple revelation in the book is that business is (or should be) a conversation. That customers want to talk with the people behind the faceless corporations. That these conversations are already taking place on the Internet in places like Yahoo stock boards, Usenet newsgroups, mailing lists, AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) sessions, and chat rooms. That the conversations are taking place with or without the people behind the corporations. That these conversations are taking place inside of companies as well on unfettered corporate intranets.

This book is largely a diatribe against business, mass markets and mass media. Their writing is anecdotal, repetitive and frankly boring. The underlying theme and theses; however, is right on the mark. The internet will tend to flow power back in the hands of workers and consumers and take it away from the corporate, academic and government elites. Interestingly, it was the corporate elites taking it away from the academic and government elites that created this possibility. If you can get beyond the heckling and flaming style and tone their basic message is interesting.

Cluetrain is less a book, or even a collection of essays, than a collection of ideas. Often fascinating and insightful in its challenge to unmask \\"business as usual\\", its real strength lies in two of its collaborators: Christopher Locke and Rick Levine. Their chapters are by far the strongest, whereas David Weinberger and Doc Searls seem more out of place (you'll do best in skipping David Weinbergers disastrous ramblings \\"The Hyperlinked Organisation\\", it cost this book a star in its rating). Messrs Locke and Levine, however, carry every trait of the business world's answer to Tom Waits and Vic Chestnutt: Angry, outsiders, intelligent and provocative. Their chapters savour with a wonderful blend of cynicism and a \\"we- want -change- now\\"-attitude. As a source of inspiration, Locke and Levine will provide cannon fodder for many a young, ambitious, corporate up and comers. That is, sadly, where Cluetrain runs into the usual management literature-trap, \\"the consultancy tongue\\". Their thoughts, inspirational and insightful as they are, have little if any relevance when it comes to applying them in the real world. Yes, it is important to be honest and open as an organisation (Peter Drucker taught us that in the 1950's), yes corporate-speak is ridiculous (Scott Addams has made a career out of this for the past decade) and yes, everything that the net is used for today is out of sync with its original intent (similar to Einstein's molecular theory not being intended to be used to nuke Hiroshima). Cluetrain is a book for the slightly cynical individual of the modern organisation (i.e. most people from New York to Newcastle), the kind of people who find delight in challenging bourgeois ideals (sit up straight, eat with your mouth closed, talk only when asked to do so). Tom Waits tears apart Prada-jackets on stage; Vic Chestnutt laments in his wheel-chair; Locke, Levine et al. rip apart traditional corporate jargon. Unfortunately, their nostalgic-oozing want for the early days of the Internet becomes far too obvious in the 250 or so- pages. The result is a book that struggles and ultimately fails to get past the \\"interesting thoughts by angry academics\\"-category."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"This is about as far away from a traditonal business book as you can get.

Ride the Cluetrain, understand that markets are conversations, and that customers and workers will have these conversations whether you like it or not, or lose your business.

I was hoping for more insights, but what I got was mostly immature garbage."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"As the name suggests, this book is an outburst of irreverent iconoclasm, reminiscent of the manic outbursts we expect from those attention-deficit-disordered hyperactive uber-creative types, whom teachers and managers everywhere recognize as banes of ordered working environments despite their occasional creative genius. The book resonates in every paragraph with the voice of prima donnas who hugely overestimate the value of their work, its value not withstanding. Euphoria is the marketing hype employed here. Ironically, it is the hype chosen by four authors ostensibly united in their rejection of marketing hype.More pointedly, however, the firm is not dead, nor is business-as-usual banished to bad old pre-wired days, as they wishfully proclaim. Let us examine the logic of their claims.Free markets fail in three ways. First, there are never an infinite number of buyers and sellers. Even commodity markets are comprised of a finite number of individuals.Second, there is never perfect knowledge among all traders.Third, markets ignore externalities. These are the costs and benefits that do not enter the pricing mechanism; goods taken from (or given to) the commons. Unregulated markets allocate to the commons fewer resources than would be pareto-efficient. As Ronald Coase (Nobel prize, economics) pointed out, when all parties affected by the commons are able to negotiate - especially when catalyzed by their rights as set out in the law - efficient outcomes can be approached. These externalities are brought into a market constituted of collective entities.The efficiency of a Coasian market is limited by the costs of organizing, negotiating and coming to an agreement. These costs are highest when many independent parties share the costs and benefits of the commons. Furthermore, this process breaks down to the degree that free riders prevent (or at least, undermine) collective bargaining, which is seen by Coase as another kind of transaction cost. Hence there are limits to the degree to which Coasean bargains can bring externalities into a pricing mechanism.Ronald Coase showed that firms exist because groups are able to achieve some ends more efficiently than free markets. When groups of people get together to pool their resources and bargaining strength, they are effectively decreasing the transaction costs associated with making a Coasean bargain. The legal structures that make modern corporations possible (conventions such as limited liability, for example) decrease the transactions costs of organizing. Read John Roberts, \\"The Modern Firm\\", published by Oxford University Press, for an outstanding discourse on the where, when, why and how choices that managers of firms must understand in order to succeed. The firms that get these right are not about to disappear.The Internet enables market mechanisms to function more efficiently.First, the Internet increases the number of traders. Markets that were once local are now global.Second, it provides more and better knowledge of the competing goods being offered and the relative prices of all possible trades. It does not always do this; most of us are aware of the vast volume of disinformation out there. Nevertheless, it often does this.However, this does not alter the other mechanism responsible for market failure which the Internet leaves more or less untouched: That markets ignore externalities not internalized because of high transaction costs. And that Coaseian bargaining is depressed when free loader problems appear. That is why we need governments, police, law courts, partnerships, corporate entities, copyrights and patents; and we need methods of management for all of them.Indeed, the Internet is itself a victim of these market failures. That is why we have spam, viruses, worms, spyware, phishing and so on. The transaction costs associated with getting everyone who suffers from spam to negotiate with the spammers is impossibly high, so high that the bargain shall never be made.However, the situation is not as hopeless as I have sketched. The Internet can be used to broker some Coaseian bargains not otherwise possible. This is what Google does, by connecting merchants preferentially to potentially interested customers; Amazon, too, by coordinating the opinions of many disparate buyers in the on-line reviews. One can call this a \\"conversation\\", and that is an attractive trendy phrase, but that misses the logic of how and why it works.By failing to understand the logic of the Internet and the market place these authors have failed to show how the social and business innovations it has brought are changing the world in which we live. We are not standing on the lip of a revolution in human affairs; rather it is a rapid evolution according to well established economic principles.Now, let me turn to style. We read: The point is what this latest technological wonder brings back into the world: the human story. A story that stretches back into our earliest prehistory. A story that's been in remission for two hundred years of industrial \\"progress.\\"The scare quotes are not mine. And this is flatulent nonsense; not only in the literal sense that prehistory is by definition the epoch before which the earliest \`stories' are known, but in the suggestion that modern history is not a human story. Markets are about people making choices. Progress is about improvements in the human condition. Industrial activity is as quintessentially human as any activity taking place on this planet.We read, for example, \\"Oh the new computer was nice and the usual customers would buy it, but the larger market ... could care less.\\" The author means \\"...could NOT care less.\\"We read, \\"But an editor would rather insert a crab in his butt than a press release in their publication.\\" So, is \\"an editor\\" a new kind of royal plural, or should that be \\"his (or her) publication\\"?The book is crammed with this kind of illiteracy and poor copy editing. These errors - and the euphoric hype - make it difficult for a sympathetic though critical reader to suspend disbelief and enjoy the show. The ignorance of mechanisms that operate in social, political and economic systems, the mistaken perception of modern history, and the irritating slap dash style of this book - alas - spoil something that could have been much better."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"One of my employees bought some copies of this book for his department and I was pretty excited to read it, I'd heard about it a lot from him when it was a webpage.I finally got around to reading it, and sorry, it really wasn't that hot.

After that, I wondered where the chapters on gopher, ftp, and archie were.To someone with networking savvy (that is, I know how to create web pages and write CGI scripts), this book will add little to what you know and provide small compensation for the price of the book and the time you will spend reading it.Also, I got real tired of the authors' tone.

Any blessed insight from the authors, therefore, must be manna from networking heaven.Another title for this book could be Dilbert's Networking Advice for the New Millenium"},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"When I read this book, I was so engrossed in that I forgot to watch daytime TV.

At the beginning, it makes a lot of sense, with discussions about markets and the power of the Internet. Here it succeeds. The problem is that it runs out of steam. A lot of concepts are repeated over and over and some of them make less sense the more they are repeated. There are some good ideas about using the technology to reconnect with customers, co-workers and the world at large. The case histories are also quite illuminating. These guys have clearly been there and done it. The problem I have is that they think the Internet is somehow a magic cure for a lot of these problems. Technology by itself never fixes anything and I say this as someone who is an IT professional.I found it an interesting read, but was left wanting more from it in the end. Some of the observations about organisational hierarchy and culture I think are over simplified and at times plain wrong. As a companion to the book, I would recommend readers try &quot;Good to Great&quot; by Jim Collins, which deals with how some organisations make the jump and some don't. It's an interesting counterpoint, as it focusses a lot on effective management of people, any organisation's most valuable asset.

Information spreads freely and rapidly, whether we like it or not. The time has come to embrace rather than fight this phenomenon. It is undoubtedly an uncomfortable situation for many, used to having complete control over corporate information through traditional one way marketing communication messages. The Cluetrain, presents the idea that a marketplace is becoming a conversation. To stay alive and thrive in the new marketplace, companies must actively engage customers in meaningful, honest conversation. Employees must be empowered to participate in the new marketplace, to talk to people frankly and honestly, to build relationships with real people.The rate of change is over estimated in the short term, and under estimated in the long. It'll be a while till we see if the Manifesto plays out, and to what extent. Companies will still utilize the traditional carpet bombing methods of marketing, advertising, and public relations for sometime to come. Companies and the people behind them will eventually realize snazzy new CRM software is simply for automation and not relationship building. Fundamentally, the web is a new medium to communicate, for people to communicate, one to one. Those that realize and embrace this will reap the rewards of the &quot;new economy&quot;The Cluetrain is bold, it talks about massive change in the way business is conducted, and puts forth numerous examples illustrating this change. It's a real book about real happeneings, authored by real people, not clueless consultants selling their marketing verbiage.

Their cute &quot;tell a story&quot; and equally cute advice to have big boxes for customer stories in the forms provided for input, simply do not cut it with me.This book is a 5 for the one great idea, a 2 for beating the idea to death, a 3 for presentation, and a 4 overall because it was just good enough to keep me reading to the last page."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"I don't much care for business books. But this one blows away the category. Business is, after all, not about dollars. It is about people. Dollars are simply a way to keep score. And what could be more human than conversations? The notion that markets are really conversations is so old it's new. The Cluetrain Manifesto shows how we humans lost our way accepting the command and control structure and format of modern business. We have been engaged in a one-way conversation, with companies doing all the talking, while most folks tuned out the message.This book demonstrates how the Internet is bringing people back into the commercial process. Technology has frequently been perceived as dehumanizing our world. That's why it is especially ironic that it took a technological revolution in communication to bring back the human side of commerce. We are seeing a sea change where commerce is moving from a seller's market to a buyer's market.Read this book. Pass it along to your boss. Give it to your employees and your customers. Buy copies for the heads of your engineering, marketing, manufacturing, corporate development, or whatever group. The brave new world is here, but Big Brother's not in charge. We are."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"Over the last several years, I've come to the conclusion that &quot;business-as-usual&quot; had to come to an end--that the world, culture, technology have changed so much that a new business paradigm is not only required but desperately needed. And it can't be simply a change of rules--the entire *game* has to change.So finding the on-line Cluetrain Manifesto last year was a real pleasure. Here were these four guys with 95 wild-eyed idealistic theses for overthrowing the business world order--and setting up a new paradigm based upon (of all things) human interaction and conversation. I signed right up.So you can imagine my delight when I found &quot;The Cluetrain Manifesto&quot; book had been published. I bought it in a millisecond.Inside, you'll find the reflections of the Cluetrain's originators--in more detail, with more reflection than their Website provides. The Manifesto's background and philosophies are brought into a clearer focus--*not* crystal clear, mind you, but clearer than before. And it's a *very* enjoyable and provocative read.It's not a flawless work. There's redundancy, for example, in the multiple essays within. Some chapters (Chapter 1 especially) are outstanding, others are so-so. One might even be called elementary. But there's always food for thought.And don't expect to find some kind of &quot;formula&quot; or &quot;strategy&quot; or &quot;plan&quot; to prosper in the brave new world we live in. It's not there. In fact, such a plan, the authors remind us, would be *counter* to the Manifesto's assertion that honest human conversation is the key to success in the future.But you will be stirred to find your voice and to add it to the voices of the revived marketplace called the Internet. Heck, you might even be inspired enough to try to help your company find *its* honest, human, authentic voice (rather than brochureware and doublespeak). And I think that's what would delight the Cluetrainers most.This book is one of several that dramatically affected my life and career. I heartily recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"I recently received a letter from a company that sells software for &quot;personalizing&quot; consumers' online shopping experiences that illustrates why the world needs The Cluetrain Manifesto, an extraordinary polemic against the dehumanizing practices of business.Although I don't have an ecommerce site, the exhibitor's letter began, &quot;By now you have had time to evaluate your Internet sales numbers from last quarter and hopefully you met and beat them.&quot; The letter was insulting by violating simple etiquette and unauthentic because it showed total ignorance of my business. The letter began &quot;Dear David.&quot; Can't you hear Andy Rooney saying, &quot;Does it ever bother you when people you've never met, and aren't sure you want to know call you by your first name right off the bat?&quot; The letter writer thinks that using first names personalizes a letter. But first names are properly an acknowledgment of personhood. I'm not a person to that letter writer. I'm just a string of 0's and 1's in his database. I'm no more a real person to him than are website visitors analyzed by his company's personalization software. This company doesn't know what personalization is about. Its shtick is depersonalization, a corporate perversity The Cluetrain Manifesto rails against.Cluetrain is the product of marketing specialists Rick Levine, Chris Locke, Doc Searles and David Weinberger who posted 95 theses on the virtual doors of the Internet, indicting the corporate world for exercising unforgivable arrogance in the marketplace, and suddenly were getting thousands of hits daily. Perseus Books quickly came up with a handsome offer for Cluetrain, the book. These putative Four Horsemen of the Internet Apocalypse that will lay flat the walls of the Old Economy declare that business no longer controls the marketplace. Their Sixth Thesis counsels &quot;The Internet is enabling conversations among human beings that were simply not possible in the era of mass media,&quot; then business is warned by the Seventh Thesis: &quot;Hyperlinks destroy hierarchy.&quot; Hierarchies rank people and restrict information flow because information access is a function of rank. Hyperlinks democratize information flow, nullifying the main offensive weapon that hierarchies depend on to remain hierarchies.Most leaders in Old Economy hierarchies see the Internet as just a new product distribution channel. They don't realize that the Internet is a new conversation channel that greatly amplifies the voices in the marketplace. As Cluetrain's First Thesis states, &quot;Markets are conversations.&quot;If you're tenaciously anchored to the Old Economy, the First Thesis's real meaning might not click in at first. But work at it. Make it the opening topic of your next staff meeting. With persistence, you'll see what it means. Suddenly you'll find yourself at the gateway to a much different world, kind of like when Dorothy stood in the ordinariness of her tornado-tossed black and white Kansan house and first beheld the splendiferously colorful glory of Oz.Cluetrain's authors are not wet-behind-the-ears webheads, but seasoned businessmen who grew tired of mass manipulation of people, and endless trickery, cajolery and even threats to get them to buy mass produced products thrust at them by generals of mass marketing in the &quot;battle for their minds&quot; as Al Reis and Jack Trout characterized marketing in a book called Marketing Warfare.Here's a military metaphor for the clueless who still define marketing with military metaphors: Cluetrain's book jacket poses a question that penetrates the mind like a smart bomb burrowing into one of Saddam Hussein's subterranean bunkers: &quot;What if the real power of the web lay not in the technology behind it, but in the profound changes it brings to the way people interact with business?&quot;Wow! There's a hint of Ted Kaczynski in that question, for as a society have we not become too obsessed with technology to see our humanity? Does this blinkered view make it easier for executives and managers to be as unaware of a receptionist's or entry level worker's humanity as the personalization company who wrote me that letter was of my humanity?Cluetrain is written write with the ink of irony. Its authors aren't looking to start anything - no Naderesque foundation to squabble endlessly with corporations, no legally constituted organism to spread their message. All they want to do is to remind us all of our humanness in such a provocative manner that their lessons stick and grow to envelop the thinking of people who run companies and make marketing decisions.Cluetrain's authors believe that as people regain an enlivened sense of their humanity through conversations made possible by the Internet, what ever is best that could happen will happen. They abhor the idea of shackling Cluetrain thoughts to a legal incarnation that would soon lose touch with humanity in order to promote itself and its leaders.The Cluetrain Manifesto is a way of thinking that can lead businesses toward success in the unstructured environments of the Internet. Of course, many Old Economy business leaders want their Internet operations to have palpable structure like their bricks and mortar operations have, but they won't succeed. They are like Archimedes wistfully imagining that if only he had a place to stand he could move the earth. There is no place to stand for leveraging the Internet in ways that will give anyone control over its movements.Cluetrain portends the end of control strategies in business. The Old Economy ethos of control is being replaced by a New Economy ethos of influence. This means The Cluetrain Manifesto instantly makes whole libraries of books on marketing obsolete because they are all based on an ethos of control and written from a vendor perspective. So empty your book shelves of all the covers you have on marketing and recycle them. That's their only value now. The Cluetrain Manifesto is the only book about markets that matters, because it is the first book on markets written from the consumer perspective.

In fact, if it were only thirty or forty pages, I would have been trying to rate it at ten stars! It starts out by making bold, mostly clear, sometimes odd statements. All of which are hugely entertaining and frequently provocative. The book does drone on a bit though, and I found it tedious towards the end.I was surprised at the content, however. To me it was much less about how the Internet is changing the economoy and business, and more about how it is changing how people connect. Far beyond a clinical explanation (this is a Manifesto after all), it postulates about the changes this newfound, hyperlinked communication has made in employee, customer, and vendor expectations.I happen to agree with almost every message. Down with empty happy-talk and command and control management...long live capability, knowledge, and real, heart-felt communication.This book would certainly have received full marks from me had it been less repetitive."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"Outside, and inside my &quot;day job,&quot; I have spent the last three years immersed in cyberspace conversations. The Cluetrain Manifesto accurately reflects the feel of this medium as much as any book could. It reads like a long and intense rap session, and it hits reality again and again in a way that corporate America so far fails to by and large. Trust me, you haven't read a book like this. If you feel as though you do not yet understand cyberspace, this book will immerse you in the culture in an easy to understand yet frequently irreverent way.The topic of this book comes down primarily to people, conversation, and culture. Not business, and not technology. The common misperception that business and technology form the driving force behind the Internet, reflects a common misperception still very prevalent in society at large. It reflects a misperception that will cost companies billions and billions of dollars if they continue to believe it. Indeed it probably already has.In a turn of events that will send shudders of terror through corporate America, most of the business-as-usual ways of thinking, acting, and talking, of the last century prove absolutely toxic to the would-be successful corporation doing business in this new medium. In yet another turn that will provide some comfort, most of what you know about life outside your current &quot;day job&quot; will prove more useful than anything you ever could have learned in obtaining a marketing degree. If you hate your job, but you love the rest of your life, you may find yourself far ahead of those overachieving &quot;team players&quot; who love business as usual. Cyberspace changes the rules, and the Cluetrain Manifesto shows us how.The payoff in understanding this, will prove handsome. Corporate manager types who wonder how to turn their employees &quot;wasted time&quot; on the Internet into money and &quot;market share&quot; now have their answer. The answer, however, means that they must accept that they will never really have control over their employees again. Of course the easiest way to accept this is to realize that they never did."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"Like medicine, this book is good for you, despite tasting bad when going down.Essentially, it's a long, repetitive rant about business, commerce and formalness, making three key points (markets are conversations; genuine word-of-mouth is more effective than advertising; business communication is out-of-touch) over and over again.

That's the spirit with which The Cluetrain Manifesto takes on the arrogance of corporate e-commerce.&quot; E-commerce is a baby that's just begun to babble, as far as I'm concerned, and isn't mature enough to get knocked down from a position of arrogance... But then I'm no web expert and the author's of this book seem to have those credentials.While the book focuses on the web's ability to facilitate dialogue and talking storey, contrary to their great expectations, I think the web will represent &quot;TV with a buy button,&quot; for millions of sorry souls. However, I can see that in the world of corporate governance, the internet is making a huge difference by empowering shareholders. Maybe the Cluetrain authors aren't exaggerating in the long run. The book is great for one liners. &quot;Word of mouth has gone global.&quot; &quot;The community of discourse is the market.&quot; Markets...want to participate in the conversations going on behind the corporate firewalls,&quot; and corporations that let them are likely to benefit. There's also the Cluetrain Corollary to Metcalfe's Law. &quot;The level of knowledge on a network increases as the square of the number of users times the volume of conversation.&quot;So in my field, as Corporate Governance NETwork grows, it becomes easier to learn the truth about corporate governance around the world and at individual firms. Like Linux, nobody is managing or controlling it, but many voices are contributing. All those &quot;best practices&quot; are helping firms discover, rather than invent, their own identity when used properly.Here's another line from Cluetrain, &quot;controlling information is like trying to control a conversation: it can't be done and still be genuine.&quot; &quot;The questions we ask aren't going to predict the future. They will create the future.&quot; So far, what we hear most on the internet is positioning by those who want to be our saviors. &quot;The questions themselves are intended to confuse the issue, and the answers are nothing but the smirk on the face of someone who just proved himself right.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"Yes, it's wonderful; Yes, it's true.

I know less about these other worthy gentlemen but trust they are the same exemplars of sobriety, rectitude and tact that characterizes Mr. Locke. But, what's it all about?, you say. You say you work in a world where the fastest computers and biggest monitors gather dust in executive suites? That the product managers don't understand the technology? That marketing is still lobbying to put P. T. Barnum on Mt. Rushmore and the salesmen all drive away after leaving their laptops on the bumper?

It cheers the power of the Internet to create productive informal relationships between people.The book's primary message is &quot;Markets are conversations.&quot; It should have been &quot;Marketing is a conversation.&quot;Economic transactions are the exchange of information as well as economic goods and money. The authors are right to condemn the traditional tendency to focus too much on the exchange of economic goods for money. By overstating their case, the authors imply that we can safely ignore the exchange of economic goods and money. As many dot.com investors learned the hard way, dominating a particular conversational niche on the Internet does not automatically lead to success in business.As a book about marketing over the Internet, this book deserves four stars. As a book about Internet economics or information age management, it deserves none."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"This thought-provoking book actually was one of the catalytic influences which dynamited me out of my complacency in terms of my own existing web site. Just like Dr. Martin Luther, posting his similarly disruptive &quot;95 theses&quot; on t&quot;he Power and Efficacy of Indulgences&quot; in 1517, Mssrs. Levine, Locke, Searls, and Weinberger put a definitive stop to the notion of &quot;business as usual&quot; in the newly &quot;wired&quot; world. It kind of reminds me of a next door neighbor I used to have: he predicted that the internet would be &quot;a fad just like CB radio.&quot; In a pig's eye!The co-authors assert that &quot;markets are converstaions&quot; and that they &quot;consist of human beings, not demographic sectors.&quot; Much like this site, with the numerous hyperlinks, connecting YOU, the user with more information, logically organized, than you would be able to construct yourself, the authors also assert that &quot;hyperlinks subvert heirarchy.&quot; In other words, if the shortest distance between you and the knowledge that you need is a short clickable link on the world wide web, executed by the 1/10th of an inch movement of your index finger on a mouse, the &quot;priesthood of experts&quot; fall.This is an &quot;in your face&quot; book that should be read by EVERY entrepreneur, EVERY fee-for-service practitioner of ANY profession, and EVERYONE connected with modern networks and the internet.

These visionaries (Weinberger, Locke, et al) let those of us in the world of business know in no uncertain terms that we have absolutely NO CLUE what the Web is all about (and our customers are laughing at us, not with us.) In the words of Weinberger, it's time for us to \\"get our heads out of our [buttox]\\" and realize the Web is about communication -- not about \\"thousands of eyeballs\\" or mass marketing opportunities. Also highly recommend as a companion read Gonzo Marketing by Cluetrain co-author Christopher Locke. -- D. Payne"},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"I forced myself to listen to the first one-third of the 6-hour Audible version. Get the abridged version instead.This book has one good point: consumers don't like the way many companies talk -- \\"mission statements,\\" fluffy advertising pitches, \\"your call is valuable to us\\" while they put you on hold for 30 minutes. In contrast, consumers respect companies that let you talk to a real person with the knowledge and power to solve your problem.The book rightly says that the Internet can help companies to do the latter, instead of the former. That's everything worth reading in this book. Feel free to mail me the $... I've saved you. :-)The authors take this one good point and repeat it endlessly. They don't give examples of how companies have implemented this good idea. They don't talk about possible pitfalls of taking this good idea too far. All they do is say how smart they are to have this one idea, and how stupid everyone else is. I suspect that the authors are consultants.Strangely, this book doesn't talk about the Internet, post 1992. The authors rave about how great the Internet was in the 1980s. Newsgroups were populated by Ph.D.s and bright college students, passionate about their fields. This is true. When I got on the 'net in 1983, the people were wonderful. I met two girlfriends online.But the Internet today is different. Better in many ways, but the chatter of most newsgroups and e-mail lists isn't worth reading. Spending time on-line with customers in my field is a waste of time. Many newsgroups started with smart people, but as stupid people (esp. stupid people with lots of time on their hands) joined and the signal/noise deteroriated, the smart people left to do more useful things, dropping the signal/noise ratio to zero. No mention of this problem in the \\"Cluetrain Manifesto\\".The \\"Cluetrain Manifesto\\" doesn't explain how to design a website to improve feedback from customers. They don't talk about (to give three examples of bad design) websites that have no way to contact the company; \\"contact us\\" forms where you have to choose from their list of what they want you to say; and websites that make it easy to join, but have no way to quit (e.g., Audible.com, AllExperts.com). I get the impression that the \\"Cluetrain\\" authors haven't been in the Internet in the last 8 years.--Review by Thomas David Kehoe, author of \\"Hearts and Minds: How Our Brains Are Hardwired for Relationships\\""},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"There are two books I'd recommend for summer reading (or anytime): &quot;The Trillionaire Next Door&quot; to make you laugh, and &quot;The Cluetrain Manifesto&quot; to mkae you think.

But I do enjoy the blunt writing style, especially the chapters about the evolving role of marketing in the business world."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"You've undoubtedly been to the website and seen and read the manifesto. The book is an expansion of the 95 or so 'commandments' targeted towards corporate America and how they perceive their customers (and the public as whole). I wasn't disappointed by the book, however, I expected the book to further expand on the ideas that are posted on their website. However, what you will get is a collection of anecdotes and examples that support, rather than extend, the principles outlined in the ClueTrain Manifesto. Regardless, this book is a valuable tool, make that a bible, that every corporate slave should read and begin to incorporate into his or her views towards the people he or she is dealing with on a daily basis. Also, this is a necessary read for those in the marketing or advertising fields as it will remind them of what exactly they're here to do: to communicate more effectively. Better yet, to be able to carry a conversation for longer than five minutes without a cosmopolitan in one hand. Read the book and be in touch with how business should be doing business."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"I just finished reading this book, having checked it out from the library. I am glad I didn't buy it. I voraciously read business books, but this one was a chore, at best.The first 105 pages could be easily condensed down into 1 page at most, and perhaps even a single paragraph or a few bullet points that explain the basic premise:* The Internet will bypass any attempts at controlling your corporate message, so you might as well plan to talk to customers and allow them to talk with you.* \\"The Market\\" is \\"Conversations\\", so you need to participate in the \\"conversation\\".* Speak to customers in a \\"natural\\" voice, not corporate-speak.That was the first half of the book, in a nutshell. The remainder basically reinforced this, with continued exhortations on how one must \\"join the conversation\\", speak in a \\"natural voice\\" because that's what \\"markets\\" demand.I guess if you were the CEO or other top executive of a large firm, this book might be applicable. However, I am not. I am a sole proprietor who runs an internet retail operation. Perhaps I got so little out of it because I've already done what they're telling/advising folks to do, so much of it seems like a series of \\"well, duh!\\" internal comments.The other thing I don't like about the book is that examples are very few, IMO. Where are the success stories, apart from a notable example of Saturn or United Airlines (I think that's the airline involved...could be wrong).Overall, I'd say if you don't spend / haven't spent a lot of time on the Internet \\"conversing\\" (Internet forums, chat rooms, Usenet, etc.), then perhaps this book would be helpful. But I would advise to borrow it from your local library rather than buy it."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"Very good book.

I was so jazzed after reading it that I drove my wife nuts blathering about how great it was.Amazon's customer reviews and general customer-2-customer involvement are, by the way, a perfect example of the &quot;markets are conversations&quot; dynamic of which Cluetrain speaks. ...."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"After reading heaps of books on the internet and business, here is one which really offers a unique perspective. Wacky yet logical, funny yet tragic, whimsical, yet empirically and intuitively sound. It's the first book that has given a plausible explanation at a human level why the internet is the phenomenon it has become. For all in business, this is the voice of the market, and indeed, maybe the people. It should be required reading by all snr mgrs looking to move their businesses onto the web."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"The authors post 95 theses which suggest all manner of ways in which to communicate more effectively during the New Millennium. For example the first thesis asserts that \\"Markets are conversations\\", also the title of Chapter 4; the last thesis asserts that \\"We are waking up and linking to each other. We are watching. But we are not waiting.\\" That is to say, the Internet and the Web have created unique, indeed unprecedented opportunities for conversations between and among people almost anywhere, anytime. So much has already been said and written about technological connectivity and interaction. The Cluetrain Manifesto provides a wealth of insights concerning connectivity and interaction in human terms, connectivity which is permitted by technology but not dependent on institutional ventriloquists. Of course, all this is occurring in so-called nanoseconds. (Check out Guy Claxton's Hare Brain Tortoise Mind for some thought-provoking perspectives on the concept of time.) The authors obviously do not expect their readers to agree with every thesis. Indeed, I suspect, they would be upset if any one reader does. In effect, they say \\"Rigorously consider what we suggest and then formulate your own theses.\\" Their book combines a cordial invitation to think with a passionate imperative to care."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"...a clue, that is.Truly something that should have been written a long time ago, and about something that we've all been dying to say something about...the decline of marketing.For those who thought it was a primer for networking, keep in mind that there are still A LOT of management out there who are clueless about the possibilities of e-mail, chat, etc., and would not know where to start on how to leverage these technologies."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"In The Cluetrain Manifesto, we see the classic sign of a revolution. Even the reviews here show it. The sign is this: controversy. Loosely quoting some dead guy, &quot;If an idea does not at first seem absurd, it is doomed to failure.&quot; Marketeers, execs, and PR Heads all agree, the idea of actually letting your marks and your worker bees communicate freely is absurd. Yet, given the demand for it, maybe the market is on to something.That something is not new, just as the Manifesto will tell you. That something is a return to business in a networked market, rather than a disconnected, you'll-never-see-who-made-this market. The similarities between Omar needing a new flying rug, and asking his neighbor (who's in the business) what he should look for in a quality flying rug, and me looking for a computer and looking at what other consumers had to say about the company I found a great price from, are obvious. If I need information on a product, the first place I go is to my computer. If need be, I then go to the phone (a form of market equalization that was never fully exploited).If the web had been prevalent twenty years ago, my father wouldn't have bought a PC Jr, because he would have known what people on the inside were saying. And hey, make it a two-way street, and people on the inside will know what we require from their company. Nice, eh? That's the core of the book, and while the truths are fairly self-evident, the Cluetrain Manifesto goes all-out to explain them in the gonzo-est way possible, to the people who need to open up most: the companies."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"Markets are conversations. Uh huh. So what. Feeding the cat in the morning is a conversation as well, nobody is paying me a six-figure advance on that tidbit-o-wisdom.This book is very 1999. Yeah, the whole \\"Internet revolution\\" thing was a real turn on back then. Today, we know the reality. While the Internet may be a very cool thing that is transforming markets, its also full of a lot of self-important dipwads who think they have a bigger handle on the universe than the rest of us.The authors firmly believe that the Internet will infuse some kind of populist collectivism into the purchasing trends of consumers. The result will be some \\"new paradigm that fully leverages the best-of-breed synergies of real-time information distribution.\\" Or some such nonsense.Unfortunately, as we now know, people are drooling semi-simian dolts who follow whatever carrot is placed in front of them. How else can you describe the leaders we elect to run this nation? All you have to do is push the masses in one direction and most will follow. Sure, some will go off a drive strange French cars and load Linux on to their X-box. Yet, the majority of consumers behave themselves and purchase what they are told to purchase from the local bulk-product distribution center.As such, this book's insights are only mildly interesting and accurate. While the whole \\"markets are conversations\\" thing sounds great to college professors and coffee house philosophers, it doesn't translate so cleanly to the suburban buying centers that drive the economy.This isn't a bad book, its just not terribly \\"revolutionary.\\""},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"I had trouble rating this book. While I agree with a large percentage of what the book has to say, I also felt that the authors did not address the full extent of the issues they are raising. In addition, the book is organized like a cross between a Web site bulletin board and a series of monologues with Internet examples. As a result, the book has little internal structure, is much more repetitive than necessary, and creates a lot of energy without successfully channeling that energy.Here's my rating scheme. 5 stars for useful thoughts. 3 stars for being incomplete in discussion. 1 star for writing style and organization.Nevertheless, I do recommend you read the book. It strikes hard and relatively effectively at the kind of unemotional, dissociated, everyone-look- out-for-number-one thinking that amoral executives can be guilty of. Unfortunately, the book also slams the methods along with the lack of trustworthy purposes. For example, anything aimed at the subconscious mind gets condemned in this book. Unfortunately, one can communicate better by addressing both the conscious and the subconscious mind at the same time (that is what branding is all about). The Cluetrain authors seem to think that all subconscious communications cannot be trusted. I agree that they have to be watched carefully, or influence can be smuggled into our lives that doesn't belong there.The best part of the book is its many ways of communicating how trust can be developed. The Internet isn't really going to develop properly until levels of trust among individuals and companies can be expanded, based on proper skepticism about the possible hidden agendas. Extended conversation is certainly a great help in this regard. Reputation is another way. Certification by some external process is yet another way. I felt that the authors lacked openness to other ways that trust can be built. For example, I suspect that when most of us are using video on the Internet, our ability to see the other person will give us many more clues about how much we can trust what is going on.The authors make a great case for less constrained communication. Obviously, with more sources and information, understanding will develop faster. Also, we will be more interested in communicating with people than with very polished messages. The work on complexity science and chaos theory could have been successfully invoked here but were not.The biggest missing element of this book is what we as individuals (both as consumers and employees) should be doing differently to create this environment of increased trust through communication. That would have made more sense than aiming the writing and the original manifesto at those who are communications challenged.If you like the ideas in this book, I recommend that you consider other books that will give you guidance on how to implement the concepts behind the manifesto. The Soul at Work is very good on the subject of trust building. Simplicity is a fine source of ideas for how to get rid of obstacles between people.In the meantime, do read and enjoy this book in the spirit of the untamed Internet."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"Contrary to what seems to be the prevailing attitude displayed by net media people, there are people who, when sitting at their computers, are not just interested in selling or buying. For those who appreciate reading a book which includes the undervalued qualities of having something to say and saying it clearly, Cluetrain is a pleasure. Its entertainment value is icing on the cake. If the companies I need to deal with on-line displayed the type of intelligence encouraged by the writing of Locke et als, then there is the real possibility of meaningful communication. That is an exciting prospect. Power to this movement!"},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"A fascinating business book that has the nerve to call virtually every business book fodder for the cat box. If you happen to communicate with people for a living, read this book and think hard about how the Internet continues to change the nature and style of business. It makes the definitive case for discarding business speak, hype-laden jargon and for finding relevant \\"stories\\" told by a heartfelt, less sanitized \\"voice\\". It's written by four smart, experienced guys, who may just be a little too angry, or too bored for their (and this book's) own good. Nonetheless, I really liked it.An interesting case is also made regarding the evolution of business as a whole. They try to explain how and why we evolved from the fluidity and interpersonal intensity of the Moroccan Bazaar to the disembodied positioning statements of the demographically entranced, struggling modern Corporation. I buy some of it, but not all of it. Their blanket message that hierarchies serve little purpose other than to disrupt the all-knowing benevolent employees from saving the company, the world, you name it - seems to disregard the very complex interconnected world they proclaim the virtues of. The Department of Defense creates the NET, the greatest achievement ever! However, hierarchies suck! Reconcile those two facts. You can't cherry pick history to prove a point. It begins to sound like someone who had a bad boss day wrote a manifesto.Processes, people, knowledge, skills all need some help in finding efficient organization towards an end. Their independent existence is largely futile. Maybe we need less hierarchy than currently proffered, but don't expect increasingly complex sub-specialties to erupt into functionality without an organizing force. Thinking utopian about how unrestrained individuality might get things done, doesn't get them done - this is where I see anarchy creep into the book. They seem to be celebrating the web as a universal platform for the angry, profound, and funny individuals to express their rage, humor and untested ideas without consequence. Let's face it, Manifestos as a whole seem to be more about the incitement of anger than understanding, and Cluetrain largely follows suit.Next time you write a line of ad copy or promotional fare - consider the message from Cluetrain; Stop writing and thinking like a business \\"bot\\" that believes its own BS, and start thinking about whether you've actually got something meaningful to say in an open, honest, personal voice. That alone, makes this a worthwhile read and a welcome message for the age we live in."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"This book starts great.

Like many web-devotees, they seem to believe that all was dank misery in business before the advent of the internet as people toiled under the sinister menace of Management in the evil Corporation. If you can work past its strident &quot;Welcome to the revolution!&quot; attitude, the authors do make salient points regarding the internet's unprecedented ability to foster collaboration and how this capacity is changing balances of power in the business world. But you have to read through so much howling, so many unsupported grand statements (of course, this is a 'manifesto', so maybe I'm out of line here), and so many sermons on the obvious (&quot;Questions...lay the groundwork for answers&quot; was a standout towards the end), that it's a frustrating read. &quot;Cluetrain&quot; would have done better at 50 pages with far less devotion to trying to show how glib, clever, and irreverent the authors are.

Because we tend to get too caught up with the here and now and forget that we have only been on this journey a very short period of time. When we look back 10, 20, 30 years from now we (the collective we) will look back and point to the Cluetrain as marking a time when a major inflection point occurred. The Cluetrain did not cause the inflection point, it simply captured its essence.Yeah, everyone now repeats the \\"markets are conversations\\" meme, but I suspect that few really understand what that means. Why? Because it is not a done deal. We are still trying to figure it out. It is early in Web years. We are still at the base of the mountain and nowhere near the summit. It pays to go back and revisit one of the earlier maps."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"Even though the Cluetrain Manifesto was published several years ago it is still a valuable and insightful read today. Many of the trends identified by Christophe Locke et al, are still very relevant today and the book serves as a good reminder of the importance of personal contact - the power of marketing/sell one-to-one and individual conversations rather than one-way broadcast media.It emphasizes community and collaboration and how leading organizations (or sometimes even specific individuals working against the outdated/draconian rules of their employers) are embracing new technologies to capitalize on the ability to fully engage customers and build true rapport/loyalty.Overall, great book that is well worth the bargain prices it can be found at today."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"First if you classify this as a contemporary business book you will be disappointed.

And in doing so set the tone for blogger attitude and panache!

The tone of the time was probably a shock to most readers back when originally published in 2001, and even still it upholds some wry quirkiness the authors were going for as they wrote about the future of the Web. Much has changed in the world of Web since the manifesto was released, and I'm certain, not all of it to the authors liking. The web has become much more corporatized, ecommerce much more like traditional commerce and online marketing shows some vast similarities to off-line marketing. The current web isn't quite what the authors anticipated!But much of what the authors preach about the web being a conversation is still so very true. And amazingly, many businesses still have not figured that out. While business on the web may bear some resemblance to the off-line world, it's still a very different place. That's what Cluetrain is all about.Cluetrain will help you understand that the same old processes and strategies that worked off-line for some many years, need not apply here. While there are many similarities, online and offline marketing operate very differently. The book will put you in the mindset to realize that marketing on the web can be done with new ideas, fresh strategies, and most importantly, on a person-to-person level.

It's time to build a new playbook entirely."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"Having grown up with high-speed internet as an expected must have, this book serves as an interesting reminder of the days I have missed. Multiplayer games, cross-referencing product review on web forums, asking other internet users for advice on products, all the things that seem natural today are in many ways changing the rules of the marketing game, and Cluetrain is all about this dynamic: markets are conversations. Broadcast media is once again being replaced by an older strategy of person-to-person contact, instead of a one way marketing stream.Some of the information is slightly outdated, some of the sections are plain wacky, but it's an interesting work nonetheless, especially if you're into marketing."},{"Title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business As Usual","review":"I was extremely pleased to read this book because it was a validation of everything I tried to communicate to my former mindless employers.

As one of the reviewers above says, &quot;In a turn of events that will send shudders of terror through corporate America, most of the business-as-usual ways of thinking, acting, and talking, of the last century prove absolutely toxic to the would-be successful corporation doing business in this new medium.&quot; Except that the 'would-be successful corporations' are going to the wall at a rate of knots, and the 'business-as-usual' ways i.e. making a profit by selling stuff, turned out to be right after all.

It gives a history of the language from its introduction in 1887 to the late 1980's. It also has a textbook for learning the language and a small, but good dictionary. Perhaps its greatest strength is that it combines these other elements with a selection of short readings. If you are only going to buy one textbook on Esperanto then Teach Yourself Esperanto or Step By Step In Esperanto would be a more complete choice. However, you should strongly consider this book as a second one to complement either of those."},{"Title":"Esperanto Learning and Using the International Language","review":"This is one of the first books that I purchased when I decided to learn the international language Esperanto. The book was an excellent introduction to the language and to its grammar. It was also nicely complemented by a selection of interesting texts of different origins, each with a vocabulary list.

The first part of the book is a good overview of the &quot;language problem&quot; and Esperanto's solution to is. It's also a good (but increasingly dated) overview of Esperanto culture and resources.The second part of the book is a reasonable 10-lesson section on Esperanto itself. it does a good job at this for its size by immediately integrating the reading of dialog at the end of every lesson.Finally, the most unique part of the book is its last part: a small Esperanto reading anthology that allows you to immediately try your new found skill.If you're interested in Esperanto in any capacity (save hard linguistics, perhaps) this book is your first stop. Get it."},{"Title":"Esperanto Learning and Using the International Language","review":"This is my favorite beginning Esperanto book. The vocabulary choices are good, with more difficult words being introduced in a logical manner (not all at once!) The excercises are at a good gradient - not too hard -- and the words a new Esperantist would need are introduced early on.Within just a few days I was able to correspond with Esperanto speakers from all over the world.I highly recommend the language and this book!"},{"Title":"Esperanto Learning and Using the International Language","review":"This book is in many ways the lineal descendant of the once popular \\"Esperanto: The World Interlanguage\\", to which a younger David Richardson himself made some minor contributions. I've never been particularly happy with the system used in both books, breaking the work down into expository section, lessons, reader and appendices. Each of these deserves a book of its own. The problem is always what weight to give each section vis a vis the others; and every reader will have his or her preferred balance.Having said this, I have to add that Richardson did an excellent job of implementing the system in this book, better than the one in its predecessor. For one thing, he omitted the purely topical (and so ephemeral) material, such as the earlier work's long list of currently popular books and magazines in Esperanto, and UEA delegate categories.The four chapters of explanation (\\"Communications and the Language Barrier\\") are well-written, and still of great interest, though they were written in the 1980s and so do not address the changes in the world over the past two decades; I don't find any mention of the internet, for instance. Perhaps for a fourth edition Richardson or some designated person will add a fifth chapter to bring the reader up to date.The hundred-page ten-lesson Esperanto course will teach you everything you need to know about Esperanto to actually start using the language (actually, you can start using it after the first one or two lessons). The ten-lesson system unfortunately requires that even in a language with an excellent word-building system such as Esperanto there will be relatively long lists of basic vocabulary to memorize, but Richardson offsets this to some degree with well-thought-out drills and exercises.For me, the real meat of the book is in the 130-page reading section. This isn't just a collection of reading material, but devotes almost as much space to annotations and explanations, which to some extent makes it an extension and polishing of the ten-lesson course.The whole thing is rounded off by a bibliography, which also suffers (slightly) by being somewhat dated, and a fairly complete Esperanto-English vocabulary. Since there is no English-Esperanto vocabulary, the purchaser might also want to get a copy of an appropriate dictionary. For the neophyte, I'd recommend the inexpensive two-way EAB MiniDictionary; the more ambitious student may want a copy of the Comprehensive English-Esperanto Dictionary.All in all, a good book to acquire if you intend to learn Esperanto and pursue the language to whatever degree."},{"Title":"Esperanto Learning and Using the International Language","review":"If you've already started studying Esperanto, you probably have a textbook like \\"Teach Yourself Esperanto\\" and a dictionary like \\"Teach Yourself Esperanto Dictionary\\" by J.

Its history of Esperanto has no information of anything happening since 1981 (despite the renaissance that the Internet has given the Esperanto movement), and the glossary has no computer/Web/electronic terms.

What I enjoyed most about this book was its history of the Esperanto language and movement (written in English, in the first section of the book), and the large number of reading exercises on diverse topics in the last section. The reading exercises are very helpful if you've advanced to a level where you find the basic stuff to be a little to easy and you're ready for more of a challenge."},{"Title":"Esperanto Learning and Using the International Language","review":"This book is divided into four parts. First is an extended essay on the language and the movement, past, present and future--good information for the newcomer. Second is a ten-lesson &quot;basic course&quot; that covers the gramar and hits the high points of usage--the lessons are acceptable, but not outstanding. Third--and the real strength of the book--is an intermediate-level reader of texts, with notes and commentary. Last of all, a word list that makes up a reasonable &quot;my first Esperanto dictionary&quot; before buying, say, the Wells dictionary. There are better choices for a first book on the language--in particular, the Teach Yourself entry--but I think this book is hard to beat for the _second_ book you put on your shelf, to expand your skills and deepen your understanding.

So I can't offer the perspective of someone who is new to the language and wants to learn it from this book. My objective for buying this book was to expand my C# library with a book covering some advanced features of the language.Simply stated, this is a good book filled with useful information that comes at a very reasonable price. I don't think it's a &quot;comprehensive&quot; reference to C# (what book is?) and it doesn't go into great depth on any one topic. But it does offer a very broad cross-section of the language.Since I've purchased the book I've found myself opening it to find out information that is not clearly explained in the MSDN library and not mentioned at all in other books. And the majority of the time, that information was covered in this book in a simple, succinct manner. For example, very few books out there cover asynchronous I/O in C#, but C# Bible devotes 6 pages to the topic - with sample code.For the price, this book is a worthwhile addition to your C# library."},{"Title":"C# Bible","review":"I praised this book on a Mircosoft newsgroup... But the more I read this the less I like it. I wanted to share some thoughts here. After comparing this book to a few others on C#, I feel this has one a more comprehensive table of contents. You get a full 9 pages on XML commenting while others give a paragraph or two. There are some cool chapters such as \\"Building Mobile Applications\\", \\"Working with COM\\", \\"Working with COM+ Services\\" and \\".NET Remoting\\". These are topics that my 1600 page VB.NET book (Francesco Balena, Microsoft Press) didn't cover.However, there are a lot of typos, a lot of fluff, explanations are sometimes very poor, and organization is pretty bad.It hasn't been very thoroughly proofread. Take this for example: \\"Abstract classes are also, by definition, virtual methods...\\" Still not sure how a class can be a method. There are a lot more like this, but re-reading the paragraph you can generally figure out what they're talking about.By fluff, I mean that they do things like give an example of operator overloading for each and every unary operators (come on, do I need an example for unary plus AND unary minus?) Or how to cause about 6 different exceptions (OutOfMemory, StackOverflow, NullReference, etc) and how to catch each one. It's a good way to pad the page count, that's about all.The overall organization of the book doesn't make it a very good read, either. It really skips around a lot. For example, talking about overloading members and virtual members BEFORE talking about classes seems like a poor choice to me if you're really aiming to help novice programmer.It claims to be written for novice and experienced developer alike, but I'm not sure it makes a great first book on .NET. Although, if you are a veteran programmer, you'll fly through the first 11 chapters since they are written more so for the novice.If you already know VB.NET and want to transition to C# (like I'm doing) then this book will get you up and running with all of the important things. However, the WROX books have gotten some good reviews on newsgroups, so I might give those a try instead."},{"Title":"C# Bible","review":"This books is poorly written. It tries to be a book for beginners, which is fine with me, but it then mentions complex topics in passing without elaboration. For instance, it talks briefly about structures. It assumes I know what/how/when to use structures vs. classes (until much, much later in the book). What's the difference between a structure and a class? It just assumes that I know. That may not be the best example, but it's one of MANY examples.Another qualm I have with this book is it is too much \\"what\\" with very little \\"why\\". It pays very little attention to best practices. For example, it will tell you how to implement an interface, but what are the best ways to implement an interface. Granted this gets into more esoteric OO design concepts, but still, give me some ideas on HOW to do stuff, not just WHAT I can do. Most other programming books have more of this HOW kind of discussion.Finally, there are the annoying typos. It clearly shows that this book was just thrown together. The quality just isn't there.I can't recommend a specific alternative, but go with something that has better reviews.***********************OK - I'm revising my review as of 5/21/03. The above review still holds, BUT I have now read 2 other C# books, and to my utter astonishment, they are worse.

This turned out to be a big mistake as this book is poorly laid out, covers some topics to a depth that seems ridiculous and other topics are just barely touched.

It doesn't spend a lot of time going over the basics that you should probably already have learned from other languages (controls, variables, etc.) but has gotten me up and running with C# in no time flat. I wouldn't say it's 100% comprehensive and I have purchased other book to accompany this one as I finish reading it, but it is definitely a good read for someone who has some knowledge of other C languages (some background in C++ OOP is definitely helpful, the author starts in talking about object oriented structures from the beginning and assumes that you know what he is talking about) will do fine with this book."},{"Title":"C# Bible","review":"This is my 6th book on C#.

This volume begins with two unfinished novels. Sanditon, begun in the last year of Jane Austen's life, deals with issues unknown in her other novels, like the culture of commerce and hypocondria. The Watsons, begun in 1804, is a work more similar to Jane Austen's most known work. Both writings are delightful. However, perhaps even more delighful are some of the other works on this volume. Lady Susan, a short epistolary novel about a scheming widow, is one of the most ironic and original works by Jane Austen. And last but not least, there is Jane Austen's juvenilia, works created when the author was between fifteen and eighteen years old. These miniatures are a testimony that the humor and mastery of language of Jane Austen was present at an early age. Among the best of the juvenilia are Love and Friendship, the very partial history of England and Jack and Alice. All of this early works (which were occasionally quoted on the film Mansfield Park) present a very sharp humor. There are also at the end poems and three prayers.The excellent edition and introduction by Peter Washington makes this Everyman's Library volume a must for all fans of Jane Austen and English literature."},{"Title":"Sanditon and Other Stories (Everyman's Library)","review":"I read this book beacause I am a Janeite. I had been looking for a volume of Juvenalia, but I bought this instead. It is a must for anyone who likes Jane Austen. It includes her juvenalia (all three volumes), her poetry, two of her prayers, leters, Sanditon, Lady Susan, and The Watsons. I liked the &quot;History of England&quot; and I absolutely adored Sanditon (even though it is just a fragment). There are many fragments in this volume and unfinished works, but they are wonderful to read even though they laeve you wishing that there were an ending. I also noticed that this volume included &quot;Venta&quot; which was written shortly before Jane Austen died. It is full of Jane Austen's delightful satire and includes many pieces which I found delightfully funny. I enjoyed reading Love and Friendship simply because of its wonderful quotes like &quot;run mad as often as you choose but do not faint&quot;. I would reccommend this to any Jane Austen fan and even some non-fans. My best friend had never read Jane Austen before and now she is a Janeite for life. One thing that I like about this book is that it is a well-made hardcover book and will not fall apart on me after multiple readings and rereadings!"},{"Title":"The Bourbon kings of France","review":"&quot;Licentious or bigoted, noble or ignoble, there has seldom been a dull Bourbon,&quot; wrote Nancy Mitford.

I still laugh out loud at every reading. The very complex plot deals with Pongo Twistleton and his Uncle Fred, who visit Blandings Castle as imposters (Sir Roderick Glossip and his secretary, to be exact) in an effort to prevent the Duke of Dunstable from stealing the Empress of Blandings, Lord Emsworth's prize pig, and to keep him from smashing the drawing room furniture with the fireplace poker. Polly Pott (daughter of private investigator Mustard Pott) is also in attendance, pretending to be Sir Roderick's daughter. The story also involves the Duke's two nephews and their romantic problems: It seems Horace Davenport has hired a private investigator (none other than Mustard Pott) to tail his fiancee Valerie (Pongo's sister) and she has called off the engagement as a result, and Ricky's jealousy of his fiancee's attention to cousin Horace has landed him in the onion soup. Money won and lost at Persian Monarchs, the slipping of mickey's into people's drinks, and a Duke who throws eggs at people who whistle The Bonny Bonny Banks of Lock Lomand outside his window add to the hilarity. Of course, Mr. Wodehouse's unique turn-of-phrase doesn't disappoint in this delightful novel. I recommend this book to anyone who seeks diversion from reality. A must-read."},{"Title":"Uncle Fred in the springtime: [a novel]","review":"Professors of literature are fond of writing that the three greatest novelists of the twentieth century are Marcel Proust, Thomas Mann, and James Joyce. In this, they could hardly be more in error. The only contender for the title of the greatest novelist of the twentieth or any other century is P.G. Wodehouse, farceur supreme, or, in plain English, an extraordinarily funny writer.Wodehouse wrote novels and stories that can be easily classified into several series: there are the Bertie and Jeeves novels and stories, the Blandings Castle novels and stories, the Mr. Mulliner stories, the Uncle Fred novels, etc. The characters from one series rarely appear in another. This novel is an exception. Uncle Fred appears at Blandings Castle, where he poses as Sir Roderick Glossop, normally seen in the Bertie and Jeeves novels (and one story); indeed, he encounters Sir Roderick while traveling to Blandings Castle. Uncle Fred, properly, Frederick Altamont Cornwallis Twistleton, fifth Earl of Ickenham, is a man who \\"together with a juvenile waistline, . . . still retained the bright enthusiasms and the fresh, unspoiled outlook of a slightly inebriated undergraduate\\" at the age of sixty or so. It is he who sets in motion the events that enable young lovers to marry and his nephew Pongo to settle his gambling debts. In general, his role is that normally played by Lord Emsworth's younger brother Galahad.Of course, any reader of Wodehouse novels knows at the start that things will turn out all right for any sundered hearts or frustrated lovers, as he knows that, any time the efficient Baxter appears, he will be discredited despite being thoroughly correct. The fun is in discovering just how it happens.And what fun it is. Wodehouse's mastery of the English language is unrivaled. He succeeds in producing prose that not only is enjoyable in its own right but also moves events ahead at a pace that is nigh exhausting. In the Bertie and Jeeves novels and stories, it is Bertie's narration that does this. In this novel, it is the dialogue as much as the narration that moves events ahead, establishes the characters, and gives the reader immense pleasure."},{"Title":"Uncle Fred in the springtime: [a novel]","review":"If you have ever read &quot;Elements of Style&quot; by Strunk and White (and if you haven't, then you should be legally prohibited from writing even so much as a thank-you note), then this book, like all Wodehouse books, is a perfect example of how to violate almost every rule in the book.Consider the following: &quot;The ninth Earl of Emsworth was a man who in times of stress always tended to resemble the Aged Parent in an old-fashioned melodrama when informed that the villain intended to foreclose the mortgage. He wore now a disintegrated air, as if somebody had removed most of his interior organs. You see the same sort of thing in stuffed parrots when the sawdust has leaked out of them.&quot;How's that for failing to &quot;omit needless words&quot;? And how's that for vividly portraying the feeble-minded Lord Emsworth, one of Wodehouse's most memorable of his many memorable and hilarious characters?The plot here is typical Wodehouse: a few love-stricken young people see their dreams of eternal wedded bliss threatened by either misunderstandings or lack of cash or both, and a young ne'er-do-well has run up some gambling debts, a circumstance which puts him in danger of some painful bone-crushing. Enter Uncle Fred, an aging playboy with a manipulative mind and a sense of adventure. He orchestrates a plan involving a visit to Blandings Castle (the Emsworth estate) which results in everyone living happily ever after.But, of course, that plot outline is pretty much the plot outline of every Wodehouse novel. What makes it (and every Wodehouse production) a 5-star novel is the delicious phraseology, the preposterous and yet believable characterizations, and the continuous twinkle in the author's eye. You either &quot;get&quot; Wodehouse or you don't. If you don't, then go to a doctor and get it fixed immediately!"},{"Title":"Uncle Fred in the springtime: [a novel]","review":"P.G. Wodehouse has written this wonderful book about a pig, and love relationships (the author makes fun of the love relationships, nothing to worry about). In the beginning, it seems boring, but it speeds up after about 30 pages. Unlike other Blandings books where the hero is Galahad, in this story the protagonist is Uncle Fred. But it is the common Wodehouse theme where the Empress is kidnapped, and couples cannot get married because of the shortage of money. The funny things about his books are the way he plays with the character's personality. Beach-cold and calm. Empress-with a frown on her face tries to eat a bit of soap while locked in a bathroom. Mr. Wodehouse has a way with words when he describes the character's actions and he puts them in such a way that you laugh until tears pour down your cheeks. This is a really good book, and if you think it is boring in the beginning, stick with it for it becomes very funny. Enjoy!!!! Cheers!!!!! : )"},{"Title":"Uncle Fred in the springtime: [a novel]","review":"A complete Wodehouse fanatic, I would have trouble giving less that five stars to anything I have read so far.

Wodehouse followers will have a lot in this to talk about."},{"Title":"Uncle Fred in the springtime: [a novel]","review":"The Wodehouse world is a world free of suffering - a kind of return to the garden of eden. Perhaps this is why, dying that I am, I have found the books so invigorating - the books are a great tonic - a true pain killer. Anyway, in this Blandings novel, impersonation is very important with Lord Ickenham coming to Blandings at Emswoth's request but hacing to pretend to be the London Brain surgeon Sir Roderick Glossop in order to keep Lady Constance off the trail. To give a taster, there is a scene where Ickenham heads off Glossop on the train with a view to deflecting Glossop from coming to Blandings but also he wants to get some information on how Glossop goes about his work:\\"I wish I had a brain like yours\\" said Lord Ickenham, \\"What an amazing thing. I suppose you could walk down a line of people, giving each of them a quick glance, and separate the sheep from the goats line shelling pees...\\"loony... not loony...this one wants watching.. this ones all right...keep an eye on this chap.

Then I decided to move on to other Wodehouse books and have read a few since. I have to say this is one of my favorites! It definitely compares to the hilarity of the Jeeves/Wooster books. Uncle Fred or the Fifth Earl of Ickenham is one of my favorite Wodehouse characters. He always seems to be dragging his nephew Pongo Twistleton (occasionally mentioned as a fellow Drones club member in the Wooster books) into trouble but always seems to get through it as is typical in the Wodehouse books. Anyway, it is a great read, a good laugh, and a lot of fun. On a side note, if you like Wodehouse, the dvd series of Jeeves and Wooster (starring Hugh Laurie from the tv show House) is also very funny. You will see many of your favorite Jeeves story lines in them and they are very true to Wodehouse."},{"Title":"Uncle Fred in the springtime: [a novel]","review":"I had heard of PG Wodehouse for the longest time but, for some reason, I thought his humor would be of the British sit-com sort that appears on PBS and too obtuse and understated for my taste. I then read about Wodehouse inLives of the Mind: The Use and Abuse of Intelligence from Hegel to Wodehouse. There Kimball writes about how incredibly funny Wodehouse is. Based on that, I decided to give Wodehouse a go and I was not disappointed. In fact, I am exhilarated. He truly is a writer of comic genius. His characters all have something to offer the funny bone and his plot twists and turns keep you expecting something else unexpected but satisfying. You can literally get a laugh from almost every page. This story about an uncle who takes life by the horns and is always positive and looking to advance his agenda is funny and compelling. Wodehouse's descriptions of motives, clothing, attitudes, and expectations - you name it - are all clever, entertaining and hysterical. I can't wait to not only read another book by Wodehouse but to go back and re-read Uncle Fred in the Springtime."},{"Title":"Uncle Fred in the springtime: [a novel]","review":"This book is absolutely hilarious even by Wodehouse standards.

Worth reading."},{"Title":"Uncle Fred in the springtime: [a novel]","review":"Wodehouse obviously spoke to a generation of English people - but what was he saying to them? That their fears and prejudices were good things, that women and romance were not to be trusted? It may have been partially that, but he was an author of escapist fictions, and as Anthony Lane points out so well in an essay about Wodehouse, like other second rate authors (Tolkien and Doyle e.g.), when one turns the key and enters their world, one enters a world of limited possibilities and guaranteed outcomes - and therein lies the pleasure. As for me, I have never been able to become a fan, and that is not because I have never tried. Wodehouse seems like the perfect summer author - I enjoyed reading a few stories in my teen years, but when I looked into his stuff later on, I found it to be fluffy to the point of tedium. Similar fare, with a contemporary viewpoint, is readily available on TV. I like humor that has a bit more bite to it - Wodehouse seems to do little more than celebrate harmless, pointless foolishness.This is widely considered to be his best book, and it is a pleasant enough farce, full of mild young men in pursuit of haughty damsels, the occasional ruffian, private detectives, old lords whose gray matter has been out to lunch for some time, prize pigs, and weekend parties at country houses. Spinning out an absurd plot, with odd twists based on mistaken identities and misunderstandings, was Wodehouse's forte. The general idea is that a young man wants to regain the hand of his beloved, who has spurned him after he sent a private detective after her during a foreign vacation. Enter milktoasty Pongo Twistleton and his madcap Uncle Fred, who immediately gets to work setting things right. Problems continue to crop up, and the pair make their way to Blandings Castle, home of the Clarence the prize pig, and the Earl of Emworth. The ending truly is brilliant, as one absurdity piles upon another, and everything turns out well. This story is classic farce and good for a few laughs, but I struggled to maintain my interest for a reading of the whole thing. What I did really like was listening to a dramatized version of this on the BBC, with good English actors doing the parts - now that was funny!"},{"Title":"Islamic Peril","review":"This is a significant book, and for me the primary significance lies in the way it has seamlessly galvanized an incredible range of media reportage on the contemporary Muslim world. The book persuasively demonstrates how Muslims are represented in ways that betray all the self-proclaimed principles of informed journalism, and in fact the author hardly needs to argue this case, as it becomes amply borne out by the author's meticulous citation of innumerable examples from North American print media.The theoretical discussions in Chapters 1&amp; 2 on the ways in which violence is represented in the news media, and particularly when violence is associated with Muslims -- these discussions raise some very fascinating intellectual questions about the structural roots that lie behind the reductive (stereotypical)reporting of Islam and the Muslim world.The author very ably unpacks and draws our attention to the ways by which journalists create dramatic 'narratives'that inevitably posit Muslims as the anitpathetical or threatening 'other'; and also the ways in which journalists are complicit in 'scripting' and'constructing' dehumanizing images of Muslims. The book forces us to change our passive media consumption habits, and journalists will find this book especially helpful as it will make them more self-aware of the ideological, cultural and historical assumptions that shape their reporting practices. In effect the book throws down the gauntlet to all practicing journalists who care to live up to the self-proclaimed ideals of their profession. The words 'violence' and 'Islam', and the conjunction of the two, can now no longer be seen nor be perpetuated without a nagging sense of self- examination.The book is obviously making an impact as it was recently the receipent of one of Canada's most presitigious awards for books on Communications and Media, the 2001 Gertrude Robinson Award.Farouk Mitha Victoria, Canada"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Contemporary Latin American and Caribbean Cultures (Encyclopedias of Contemporary Culture)(3 Volume Set)","review":"\\"The Encyclopedia of Contemporary Latin American and Caribbean Cultures contains more than 4,000 brief entries in English about society, politics and culture after 1920 in said regions.

The story is reverent of its focus, and readers are likely to sense the author's deep appreciation for her subject. It never devolves into genre or religious tract. With this much religious matter, both Christian and Jewish, I expected to be preached to at least a bit, and I kind of held my breath waiting for it to happen, but my fear was unwarranted.Ostensibly a murder mystery, the crime serves primarily as a great excuse for us to look in on the lives of the religious in 1141 England and the forces influencing them. The characters are well developed, with individual voices and motivations. The text is well written with great attention to quality story telling and no perceivable axe to grind.Being personally familiar with western monastic tradition, I found her details ring true and the settings spring to life in 3D. I highly suggest this to all fiction readers. You do not have to have a penchant for historical or religious fiction to enjoy Graven Images. But don't expect a fluffy murder mystery that just happens to be in a monastery. This story has substance, including an important peek under the cloak of historical oversimplification.I've already passed my copy on.

Trying to figure out how to prepare and blend ingredients I wasn't very familiar with has been complicated and time consuming. Stephen Pyles \\"New Tastes From Texas\\" has done more for my grasp of New Texas Cuisine than any other cookbook or resource I've read. In this book, Chef Pyles provides not only the basic preparations (pure chili powder, chili pastes, etc.) but also some of his very best recipes. Having recipes for Star Canyon's \\"Cowboy Ribeye\\", \\"Rock Shrimp Taquitos\\" and \\"Heaven and Hell Cake\\" are alone worth price of the book. Buy it . . . you'll love it!**Update 12 years later: My ingredient splattered copy of this book, with the binding all but disintegrated, is still the cookbook I use the most when entertaining. I don't eat red meat any more, but have adopted some of the meat recipes into vegetarian dishes. I read some reviews on this site that considered many of these recipes to be difficult. To me it's not that the recipes are tough to make, but that to cook in this style requires learning some basic techniques that don't apply in other cuisines. Once you've got a handle on the basic southwestern salsas, sauces, condiments, powders and purees, the recipes come together fairly easily. The strength of this cookbook is the flavors. They are unique and have clearly stood the test of time. I've still never tasted a southwestern dressing that comes even close to Pyles' Southwestern Caesar, never found a seafood sauce as enticing as his Mango Barbeque Sauce, never enjoyed a roasted nut as much as his Sweet and Spicy Pecans. This book has made me a better cook for sure, and I don't know that there's a higher compliment once could give to a cookbook."},{"Title":"New Tastes from Texas","review":"This is just an outstanding cookbook, filled with info, unique recipes and sources for ingredients, and spectacular shots of finished dishes.I keep making one new recipe after another for guests and compliments are on the high side of all fare I prepare and serve.

This is the book that was on the executive chef shelf for us to refer to, these are the recipes I prepped and cooked for the guests every night to include his famous Heaven and Hell Cake; for me making it was heaven compared to slicing it and keeping it straight on the dish to reach the guest's table, that was hell! But for Chef Pyles this cake represent his childhood, his favorite things in life, his sweet tooth, his yin-yang. My other favorite recipes featured on his menu and in the book are the Southwestern Caesar Salad dressing (page 79) and the Bone-In Cowboy Rib-Eye Steak with Mushroom Ragout and Red Chili Onion Rings (page 80 and 81) - my Southwestern diet!So if you are like me or want to channel the spirit of Stephan Pyles for a meal, you will find this and his other books to be an indispensible resource to get to know and understand the sensible approach to Southwestern cuisine."},{"Title":"New Tastes from Texas","review":"I have enjoyed watching the PBS series and this companion cookbook really helps.

There are some that are somewhat simple but the majority are not. Great photography in the book."},{"Title":"New Tastes from Texas","review":"this book is seriously frustrating.I finally attempted to break mine in for a dinner party after drooling over the thought for a few years. Because so many of the dishes are so intricate, and many require time-consuming \\"pre-prep\\", you need to make sure you read the recipes VERY carefully before proceeding.None of them have a list of ingredients you can just add. Many of them are \\"roasted garlic puree, see p. 4\\" so you have to flip to that page and complete that before you can finish your recipe. Some of the more difficult ones have 2 or 3 other ingredients like that, that are included in another area of the book. Although it saved him printing costs, it's really annoying to have to keep flipping back and forth as you cook.I made the coriander cured beef tenderloin. I've never cured anything in my life. How helpful is \\"put the paste in a bowl and add the tenderloin.\\" OK, now what? You're supposed to let it sit 3 hours. Wouldn't beef spoil if left out? I put it in a sealed Tupperware container and had to put it in the refrigerator overnight, not sure if I was supposed to coat the beef or what.For those of us who have never roasted garlic, I wasn't sure if I needed to remove the papery husks from the outside before I placed them in the oven.For the Heaven and Hell cake, I was really excited to make it since I'd heard a lot about it. For the life of me, I searched EVERYWHERE for a 10 inch cake pan, but they evidently do not exist. The cake cooked over the sides and eventually broke apart as I was removing it from the pan.There are very few courtesy reminders or steps for anyone just starting out. Now, I'm a foodie and cook a lot, and even I was thinking \\"???!\\" in some of these dishes.Save your money and head to Dallas to one of his restaurants.

I agree with one of the poor reviews about the book being too much about the author, his success in life, and his great parenting skills. I also found his views to be too paternalistic and traditional for my tastes. Generally speaking, the author has firm views that can be inferred on the role of women and men. In short, men are hard working and rational; women are caring and emotional. (I'm curious how his daughters turned out to be as adults and whether they stayed in the orthodox tradition. . . .)I have two under age 10 kids, which prompted me to read the book. I only liked two chapters, the one about God and the one about asking your kids \\"Who they want to be?\\" not \\"What they want to be?\\". I liked the God chapter because it stated one can struggle with God and the bad things that happen. The author acknowledged the duty to do right and did not strictly tie that to believing in God. I like the \\"Who\\" not \\"What\\" chapter because it is a good way to think about who you want your children (or yourself) to be.For the majority of the book, I did find myself mentally rolling my eyes too often while reading.

I cannot understand why the author's political statement found its place in a book about parent-children relationship."},{"Title":"10 Conversations You Need to Have with Your Children","review":"This book is, first and foremost, about Rabbi Boteach. It is not about his kids and not about parenting advice -- it is about him. The phrase that occurs most frequently is \\"I tell my kids ...\\" In particular, his wife is almost never mentioned; it is not about what they tell their kids, it is about what he tells his kids. Odd, especially since he dwells so much on the importance of all aspects feminine. And ironically, Orthodox Jewry presents the real obstacle to imparting the feminine by prohibiting women from serving as rabbis and community leaders.The author is self-aggrandizing, with many reminders by Rabbi Boteach that he is on radio, TV, and was at Oxford. I sense that writing the book was also a bit cathartic, as the author takes the opportunity to talk about his relationship with his own father so much.Rabbi Boteach gives money and advice to the receptive homeless, he lifted his nephew from drug addiction, he tolerates his gay brother, takes long RV trips, has a silent and a supportive wife, kids who gather round and listen intently to Bible stories and garner lessons from them. But how about some real advice for real parents with real kids?"},{"Title":"10 Conversations You Need to Have with Your Children","review":"This has been the only book I have ever read that hit a huge cord within me and stayed. The messages and insights will stay with you long after you've put the book down. We have stopped watching TV with our kids during the week and instead talk, play games, go on walks and enjoy each other's company. We have learned to destress our house and focus on happiness. My husband and I have reconnected and our family is happier as a whole. This book, if you allow it to, can teach you miraculous things. Shmuley Boteach is an incredible rabbi, teacher, husband and above all, father. This book is worth 10 times it's price.

I have had more conversations with my 5 and 7-year-old children in the past 6 months than ever because I truly know what to say. And I have to say, they are conversing back. If you are looking for a book to teach you how to be a better person-parent, friend, co-worker, etc., this is the book.

For parents to be role models for the younger generation, they can only influence their children's behavior through their own actions. This book outlines the steps to take, using real life examples. Although at first glance it seems easy, it may take 2-3 reads to fully digest the entire book.I praise Shmuley for another great book. Thank you."},{"Title":"10 Conversations You Need to Have with Your Children","review":"Great book for anyone with children! I would highly recommend this.

Parenting is the most important job a person ever has, and this is a good manual to help you in that job."},{"Title":"10 Conversations You Need to Have with Your Children","review":"The theme of 10 Conversations You Need to Have With Your Children by Shmuley Boteach is to teach your children to find their own way in the world by listening to their own, unique, inner voices. It's a great message for all parents.Boteach stresses the importance of interaction with your children. He says that everything that happens in life provides an opportunity for conversation, and you shouldn't overlook those opportunities; rather, you should train yourselves to see them.All parents can learn from Boteach's book that making the investment in children by conversing with them and teaching them their uniqueness will reap rewards. Work on motivating your children to hear their inner voices, and it will inspire them to become better people. Boteach says, \\"Success is never immediate, and sometimes it's nowhere in evidence, but talking to your kids really works.\\"Boteach's book also has four great lessons for improving communication skills with everyone you live with or work with. These are Boteach's four lessons:1. You can control your emotions by controlling your actions. When you force yourself to behave in a certain way, even if you don't feel it, the action creates the emotion.2. The foundation of every relationship and interaction you have is the \\"desire to know\\". Much of Boteach's advice is based on the premise that you have to find ways to be stimulated every day, and your relationships and interactions are a source of stimulation.3. The world will be a kinder, gentler place if we each honor and exhibit what Boteach identifies as the \\"feminine qualities\\" we all have within ourselves, such as peacefulness, tenderness, nurturing, and relationship-building.4. Show the people around you that you know you make mistakes and that you are seeking forgiveness. Furthermore, you should be willing to forgive those people who are seeking forgiveness from you. Boteach says, \\"An unforgiving heart is a heavy heart. When you don't forgive someone, you become bitter, and that feeling festers, affecting you more than it affects them. When you forgive, the one you are truly freeing is yourself.\\"The book has great lessons on parenting skills as well as general communication skills.[...][...]"},{"Title":"10 Conversations You Need to Have with Your Children","review":"I've seen Shmuley on TLC's \\"Shalom in the Home\\" and I really like the advice and counsel he gives on the show. When I saw that he also wrote books, I decided to check this one out. I ended up reading this book in one day. I could not put it down.Shmuley uses situations from his own life raising eight children as well as stories from the people he meets to illustrate the importance of a parent's role in their child's life. He has inspired me to be a better role model for my children, and also inspired me not to be afraid to discuss some of these critical topics with my children. This book has had a HUGE impact on how I look at my role as a parent: not simply as making my kids do what I want, but inspiring them to be the best individuals they can be. To discuss these deeply important topics, like what kind of person they want to be, the importance of dignity and forgiveness, being happy, how to ignite their passion for knowledge... these are critical things we simply are NOT teaching our children, which I believe is the reason why so many children have such a hard time dealing with the challenges of life today.This book has also helped me see that I can integrate these concepts into my own life to be an inspiration for my children. Many people tend to focus on Shmuley's Jewish beliefs, which he clearly articulates in this book. Come on! He's a Rabbi! Would you expect him NOT to write about them?? I am not Jewish nor Christian. I choose not to label or identify myself with any organized religion. Shmuley writes in the last chapter about the importance of teaching children about God. He gives very compelling reasons why this is important. He also gives examples of how America was founded \\"Under God,\\" which is true. Shmuley simply states why he believes children need the concept of God, and of course he's going to talk about it from a Jewish perspective. Like I said, he's a Rabbi!! If people take his discussion on God as a condemnation of their own beliefs or some kind of Jewish recruiting ploy, I think they missed the point completely.This is a wonderful book that will inspire you to be a better person and parent."},{"Title":"10 Conversations You Need to Have with Your Children","review":"This is the book. The only one you need. The one you pick up, read a chapter, put down and immediately find ways to include it in your life. Not just for you children but also for you. It just simply reminds you about what is most important in life. Being good. The best line: You can never go wrong when you do the right thing. It is the stuff of life. It is a great book to read, think about and spark a conversation with your spouse, friend, mother, father, sibling whomever and most importantly your children. I started reading this book and quickly put the conversations into action. Our family has lived in 7 places in 9 years, so my children are constantly going through change and adjustments. Sometimes as a mom it is hard to remember how much they need the \\"good convestaion\\" reinforcement when your in the midst of unpacking, adjusting and trying to make a new home yourself. Everyone is busy, just in different ways and my kids just have started acting up in a way that has been difficult to figure out how to best fix it. I've tried star charts, the 1,2,3, method and a bunch of others, but this book just hit and home run and life is so much better now. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"10 Conversations You Need to Have with Your Children","review":"I absolutely love rabbi Shmuley's passion for the family, and I have certainly found inspiration from him to be a better parent. This book will give you some power tools in creating what I believe will be a lasting and influential relationship with your children while also instilling strong moral values. I have several good books of Shmuley's, but unlike the others, I have totally marked this one up with notes and highlights. I'll be keeping this book for years to come and I'm certain I will be refering to it often."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"I started with Kafka on the Shore and wondered why I was reading it, when it suddenly hooked me. So much so I have since read 4 other books by Murakami.My reviews for each are all the same. Excellent, peaceful, innovative, captivating.I hope Murakami writes quickly so I'll have something to read when I finish his others."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"I can name all of the books that made me feel the way A Wild Sheep Chase did. They are: The Stranger, The Crying of Lot 49, and The Catcher In The Rye. That's it. And this one definitely entertained me more than those books. I guess I'm a sucker for stories about alienation, loneliness, or confusion about one's identity, but this book is so much more than that. It's a detective story with no detective, science fiction without any spacecrafts or timetravel, and also extremely funny and erotic in parts. Murakami is a master of stringing the reader along and having him or her at his mercy. He grabs your attention early, keeps you intrigued and entertained for a long time, then even attempts to lull you to sleep before pulling the rug right out from under you. Like I said, I'm generally attracted to individualistic characters who are not sentimental or melodramatic. But Murakami adds just enough emotion to his characters (sooner or later) that your body vibrates as he tugs on the heartstrings when you least expect it.The main character does not give us his name. There aren't many names in the book at all. \\"I\\" is recently divorced and runs an advertising/translating business with a friend. One day he recieves a postcard from a different friend who has run off to Northern Japan. The postcard is a photo of a field of sheep, presumably in Northern Japan. \\"I\\" decides to run it in an ad for an insurance company. Before you know it, a man in black arrives in a limo and tells \\"I\\" he will have two months and endless funds to find a particular sheep in the photo. This sheep supposedly has magical powers that allow it to enter people's bodies, where it then hatches plans to control the world. The man in black is a representative for a very shadowy, influential war criminal who is in a coma---the last man the sheep entered. If \\"I\\" fails to find the sheep, the man in black threatens, his business will go under and his life will be ruined. \\"I\\" agrees and starts researching sheep in Japan. Along the way, he meets a seemingly clairvoyant woman who has astonishingly perfect ears. They travel together to Northern Japan to look for the sheep and for \\"I's\\" friend who may know more than he's let on.That's really all I can tell you. Whatever you do, don't be scared off by the talk of science fiction or magical, world dominating sheep. Obviously absurd, these things should be taken as they are---there is a magical sheep, even a talking \\"Sheep Man.\\" However, there are very personal, more down to earth themes here. You shouldn't let Murakami's imagination get the better of you. Or maybe you shoud. It's a lot of fun.There is a follow-up to this book also. It's called Dance Dance Dance and it picks up right where Sheep Chase leaves off. If you like Sheep Chase, read it. It's a good sequel, meaning not as good as the first, but definitely worthy, if only for one character named Gotanda.Enjoy. I certainly did."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"&quot;A Wild Sheep Chase&quot; introduced the English-speaking world to Haruki Murakami's superb literary talent. It is simultaneously a sly homage to great American crime fiction from the likes of Raymond Chandler and a thoughtful meditation on alienation and loneliness in modern Japan. Indeed, the novel could be seen more as a critique of Western culture since the plot makes few references to Japan. Instead, Murakami constantly refers to popular Western culture. His lean, lyrical prose is quite akin to the early work of William Gibson, the noted Canadian-American cyberpunk writer. Like Gibson, Murakami introduces us to a dazzling universe of bizarre, complex characters, ranging from the protagonist to the World War Two war criminal who sends the protagonist on &quot;a wild sheep chase&quot;, and finally, the Rat, a long-lost acquaintance of the protagonist. Through a series of carefully crafted twists and turns, the protagonist winds up in the northern edge of Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island, amidst a field of sheep. This fine novel remains a splendid introduction to Murakami's fiction. Indeed, Murakami is now regarded as Japan's greatest living novelist."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Imagine a Crime Noir novel set in the '70's Japan, and then throw in a little David Lynchian eccentricity and you'd have the skeleton for this page turner of a book. In effect a detective story, the main character is really an advertising agent. He is apathetically walking away from a lackluster marriage, when he begins dating an average looking, part time prostitute. He considers her mediocre in nearly all senses except for her extraordinary ears, which provide her another income as an ear model. he is insisted into an undeniable job by a politician who remains nameless the whole story, referred to only as &quot;the boss&quot;. Like all good crime noir, we follow this charismatic protagonist through interlude after interlude. this book is as absorbing as it is eccentric and off the wall.

I admire his lyric style, his mood painting, his searing perceptiveness as he gets right into the human soul, and his imaginative powers. His books transport you to another time and place -- this one quality perhaps more than anything else is the sign of great literature. When I read this book, I entered Murakami's landscape of magical happenings and incredible twists and turns. It says worlds about Murakami that those who bought Sheep Chase immediately went and bought all his other books too. This one was one of my very favorites -- positively mind-altering!"},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"The main character must find the special sheep with a star-mark within one month - the main character must have started the adventure by the strange man's order. This whole story is covered with mystery, so we can't say clearly why, where, when the story happened - and of course, this is the charm of the book. &quot;A Wild Sheep Chase&quot; is a mystery, but for me, the interesting point of this story is the main charecter's thoughts and interpretation of the world. Sometimes he notices really small things that we always ignore or don't care about and makes us agree with his thinking. For example, when he saw himself in the mirror, he noticed, &quot;This is me everyone see.&quot;, but at the same time, he thought that the man in the mirror might just copy him, and perhaps, he might copy the man. The thinking is sort of common, but it hides in our mind deeply in daily life, so It remainds us that we consider it in the same way, and we can make sure of it. The reason these things happen is because he is a ordinary person with a normal life. That is, he is seme as us. Usually people try to escape from boredom, but he doesn't do that. When people come to accept their life, people might notice importance of life. I recommened this book to the person who likes mystery of course, and the person who tries to escape from foredom because you can find from the book not only something interesting but also something important.

I also use it to describe the author; because while the main character is a freak in his own right, he's one of an entirely different caliber.A Wild Sheep Chase takes us to Tokyo Japan 'round 1980 and dumps us into the sharp but entirely unexercised, and increasingly apathetic mind of our 30 year old (male) main character. Funny, I just checked the book because I couldn't remember his name. I couldn't find it.

His prose (even though translated) is at once elegantly crafted and playful. I recommend this book highly.Christian HunterSanta Barbara, California"},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Murakami is an acquired taste, but fortunately he's very easily acquired. His novels are typically a mixed bag of comic absurdity, pathos, suspense, and philosophical speculation but written in a straight-ahead, colloquial style. *A Wild Sheep Chase* is no exception. Here a struggling adman ends up recruited by a mysterious client in black to find a sheep that has appeared in an insurance company advertisement our hero's firm has designed. The sheep in this ad is special...it takes over people's consciousness.That's the least of what you need to know to understand what kind of novel *A Wild Sheep Chase* is. And yet for all its imaginative \\"wildness,\\" the novel has a traditional, hardboiled-style first-person narrative that easily draws you into the story. In fact, I'd say that three-quarters of the pleasure of this novel comes from spending time with the likeable, hard-luck narrator. Witty but not a wisecracker, laid-back but no Joe Cool, fatalistic but not cynical, he's a guy who is thoroughly convinced of his mediocrity and okay with it. He's got the kind of applied equanimity to life's vicissitudes that you wish you had, taking things as they come, taking things as they go. He knows life is heading for loss and sadness, but he's not whining about it. If he's not the kind of guy you could ever be, than he's the kind of guy you wish you had for a friend--and that makes spending 350+ pages in his company a pleasurable experience. And that's a good thing because if I had one criticism about *A Wild Sheep Chase* it's that it's about 70 pages too long. In the last third of the novel, there's a lot of description of the narrator sitting around waiting for the climax to occur when it could have occurred pages and pages beforehand. Well, as I said, he's pleasant enough company so it wasn't intolerable. Still...I got a little tired of hearing what he cooked for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, how long he slept, what things he saw upon looking out the window.And, as for the climax...well, don't expect the usual resolution in a Murakami novel. The original mystery--or what seemed to be the original mystery at the start--has a way of shifting around to become something else entirely. It's the kind of mystery where the search becomes even more important than the answer and the answer is often left open to a good deal of reader interpretation. In this instance, however, things seem even more obscure than usual and I found the resolution of the novel unnecessarily muddied. In a novel that depends a lot on chance, coincidence, and the arbitrary, the pay-off struck me as a little too much dependent on all of these. Perhaps something was lost in the translation from the Japanese, but I found the ending of *A Wild Sheep Chase* rather unsatisfying.These caveats aside, Murakami is more than just a mystery writer. With his reality-bending plots, ambiguity, and philosophical questioning, he is a genuinely thought-provoking literary artist and a *A Wild Sheep Chase* is an ultimately intriguing, rewarding, and, perhaps most of all, fun read."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"The genius of Murakami's &quot;Wild Sheep Chase&quot; (like the genius of his other works) is the total believability of his characters and plot. Everyone who reads this work is immediately engrossed and sucked in, and only realizes how truly bizarre the whole thing is when they try to tell someone else about the book.The narrator of &quot;Sheep Chase&quot; begins as something of an Everyman. His mate leaves him, his job pays him well but isn't very satisfying, he is intelligent but little in his life seems to stimulate him to thought. You wouldn't say he is going through life with blinders on, but nor is his life totally examined, either. Life is, more or less, something that is just happening to him. You could probably think of a dozen people you know who would easily fit his character.Still, this is a Murakami novel, after all, and pretty soon he is, in the words of Tolkein, simply swept away, a stranger in a strange land with no idea of how he got there. A perfectly ordinary photo that he uses in a brochure catches the attention of a powerful political figure, &quot;The Boss&quot;, who has been inexplicably lying on the verge of death for some years, hanging on as if by some supernatural power. The photo, it's discovered, has a special sheep in it. A type of sheep who's breed does not exist. A minion of The Boss makes him an offer he cannot refuse: find that sheep...He meets up with a young woman who, among other things, is a call girl for an exclusive members-only club, and does ear modeling on the side. Together, they set off to find this elusive sheep-that-doesn't-exist, all the while trailing the narrator's old friend, The Rat, who seems to always be one step ahead of them.Much has been written about Murakami and &quot;Wild Sheep Chase&quot;, including that this work is a shining example of the postmodern novel. While this may be the case, potential readers shouldn't shy away from this book simply because they may not know a fig about postmodernism. Unlike other &quot;postmodern novels&quot;, which are often thickets of high rhetoric and voluminous nonsense, &quot;Wild Sheep Chase&quot; can be read on a multitude of levels: both as lit crit and as pure, enjoyable fiction. To read it strictly as one or the other is to do a great injustice to this work."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"I enjoy Japanese authors, Kawabata, Dazai, Mishima. All very different in style, but all presenting serious work. So when I randomly picked this book up after seeing it was by a Japanese author, I really had no idea what I was getting into.I more or less read it in one sitting because it's quirkiness grabbed me. A lot of people compare Haruki Murakami to Kurt Vonnegut. But I have to tell you, after reading nearly all of Vonnegut's work (Excluding Happy Birthday Wanda June, and the two &quot;new&quot; books, Bagombo Snuff Box and God Bless You Dr Kavorkin), Vonnegut is a thousand times more lucid.That isn't to say I didn't like A Wild Sheep Chase, it was bizzare, humorous, and at times touching (when the protagonist visits the beach he used to hang out at, and finds that it has been filled in and there now sits pavement really affected me.)And in many ways the non clarity could be considered a strength. When you have a story as absurd as this one, trying to explain the universe in which it is operating can cause it to just fall apart.But I was also left with a feeling of, &quot;What the hell is this guy trying to say?&quot; Then agian, does he really *have* to say anything?Interesting characters and extremly fun. I enjoyed it and would recommend A Wild Sheep Chase."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"It's hard not to reach the end of Haruki Murakami's wonderfully entertaining A WILD SHEEP CHASE and not find yourself asking, \\"What was THAT all about?\\" Sometimes hilarious, sometimes sad with loss, almost always quirky after the style of Kurt Vonnegut, Murakami's story line pulls you in and keeps you hooked with unexpected twists and turns that leave you as desperate as his nameless main character to learn the ovine truth.On its face, the book is a combination mystery story, grail quest, and science fiction novel, laced with biting sarcasm. A perfectly regular young advertising executive is approached one day by a mysterious stranger concerning a photograph of sheep grazing in a mountain pasture that the agency used in an insurance company ad. Buried within the herd is one sheep of an unknown breed with a star-shaped birthmark on its back. Unbeknown to the young executive, he has transgressed some unmarked boundary and caught the attention of The Boss, an immensely rich Tokyo businessman and power broker. The mysterious stranger delivers an ultimatum from The Boss: find the sheep in one month and be exceedingly well-rewarded, or be forced into permanent career ruin if he fails. The balance of the book traces the quest of the young executive and his unusual girlfriend to find the sheep and discover its bizarre significance.With A WILD SHEEP CHASE, Murakami has constructed a bizarre novel populated by an alcoholic business partner, a godlike mysterious stranger dressed in black, a girlfriend with uncanny sixth sense and ears that turn her into an irresistible beauty when exposed, a philosophizing chauffeur, a borderline psychotic Sheep Professor, and a man who lives in the woods and dresses like a sheep. All of the characters are nameless, at most given nicknames like The Boss, The Rat, J, and Sheep Man. Only the hero's aged and unnamed cat is bestowed with a name, Kipper, in the course of the story.Fabulous imagery and clever prose riffs abound in Murakami's world. Consider the following small sampling:-- \\"Far off, someone was practicing piano. It sounded like tripping down an up escalator.\\"-- \\"The elevator shook like a large dog with lung disease.\\"-- \\"Occasionally, someone coughed with a dry rasp that sounded like a mummy tapped on the head with a pair of tongs.\\"-- \\"The yellow glow of the light bulbs drifted about the room like pollen.\\"-- \\"The house kept its own time, like the old-fashioned grandfather clock in the living room. People who happened by raised the weights, and as long as the weights were wound, the clock continued ticking away. But with people gone and the weights unattended, whole chunks of time were left to collect in deposits of faded life on the floor.\\"So what is the book really all about? Perhaps it's a commentary about economic and emotional gain and loss in our lives, or maybe it's a parable about the existence of free will and how much more difficult it is to exercise than we think (and how less often we really do it than we believe). Or possibly, it's a novel about individuality and mediocrity in Japanese society. Then again, it could be a protest against a powerful and homogenizing globalization that threatens to turn us all into nameless, unindividuated sheep. Of course, it could just be a silly, pseudo science fiction story without any meaning. Whatever - res ipsa loquitur, the thing speaks for itself.A WILD SHEEP CHASE is a great read, fun and funny, full of memorable characters and pungent commentary about modern life. This is Murakami with a twist. Step up to the bar and take an unforgettable drink. And don't forget to write down God's phone number and give him a call."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"This was the second of Murakami's books I've read (previously read \\"Sputnik Sweetheart\\") and I can easily see myself becoming addicted as I have fought all urges to buy \\"Dance Dance Dance\\" before I work down my pile of previously purchased books.Murakami is particularly gifted in working with imagery and symbolism which are the qualities that give this book its dreamlike atmosphere throughout. Everything takes on a feeling of \\"unreality\\", as if we are walking through a waking nightmare which can turn disastrous or horrifying at any moment. I was reminded of my own nightmares where I struggle to speak or perform some act that increasingly seems impossible, or reach for a person or object that manages to remain just out of reach. When I wake from such nightmares I'm left bothered and questioning for the remainder of the night, sometimes days afterwards, questioning with nothing there to offer me solace or comfort. I analyze every angle and image and am often left with nothing but a mystery that will not leave me.That's what \\"A Wild Sheep Chase\\" did to me.What does it mean to be \\"sheeped\\"? Who is The Rat? What will become of the Sheep Proffessor? Murakami seems content to not let us know. I'm perfectly willing to not know.This book is not for you if you must have answers to all questions. I could attempt to make comparisons with other authors, but I feel he is unique (to me at least). The only comparison I could make outside of literature is to say reading the book is like watching David Lynch attempting to be slightly more accesible- and I pray that never happens.What remains is a feeling of a need to re-read, knowing there are mysteries that will reveal themselves in time and with patience. Meanwhile, I itch for more of his work. The titles need to be devoured."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"I've never read a novel which passed between the mundane and the bizarre so easily. Once I accepted that a magical sheep with a star on its fleece could become an obsession to an absolutely normal lead character, I stepped into a world where anything could happen. And Murakami does not disappoint. And he never over-explains, either. The story is told simply, refreshingly bereft of any self-agonizing characters or deep dissection of events. The plot unfolds and the reader is left with absorbing its odd contents and memorable characters. Overall, a beautiful, reality-suspending novel written with a light touch."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"I like this book very much because I couldn't help identifying with the central character who reminds me in some ways of Woody Allen's screen persona - a nerdish type loser of no particular physical attraction who has a way with words and who usually gets a very attractive woman to sleep with, though he spends most of his time rueing what he HASN'T got and is continually in search of that SOMETHING. This novel is about a quest. About dreams. And finally, about the realisation that life is about bugger all, so you'd better enjoy that friendship, that meal, that lovemaking, that scene, that memory, and relax a bit and have a laugh. There are laughs aplenty in this sly book, many of the laughs are in the details such as the scene where a very damaged black moggy cat sitting on the front seat of a distinguished limousine causes the Chauffer to lower the windows from time to time on account of the deletirious odour the cat emits from time to time in the form of brief but audible farts.And I suppose, in our life we don't wander around the shopping mall thinking \\"themes\\" or \\"great and noble thoughts\\" but more like \\" Why does that woman get into the 8 item express lane when she clearly has 11 items?\\" Incidentally, the novel is also a very likeable and satisfying read."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Haruki Murakami is modern-day Japan's most popular novelist. Both a literary success and a commercial success, Murakami has been the recipient of the Noma Literary Award for New Writers (A Wild Sheep Chase) and the Tanazaki Prize (for The Hard-Boiled Wonderland and The End of the World).Murakami's fiction shares almost nothing in common with more classical Japanese authors like Kawabata, Mishima and Tanazaki, and early reviews compared his work to that of Raymond Carver, Thomas Pynchon, Raymond Chandler and Thomas Berger. Comparisons, however, are always unfair. Murakami is most definitely an original. The worlds he creates are his and his alone, and although he invites us to visit for awhile, only he can truly inhabit them.Embracing Murakami's signature themes of isolation and alienation, A Wild Sheep Chase is part detective thriller, part allegory, part fantasy, and part post-modern send-up. It is thoroughly Western in both its outlook and writing style and thoroughly original by any standard.Murakami, who is more likely to speak of the Beatles (a book he titled Norwegian Wood remains his best seller in Japan) and Heineken than of kabuki and sushi, takes us on a wild-and-woolly roller coaster ride in A Wild Sheep Chase that often modulates from deadpan minimalism to a kind of fantastic fantasy world reminiscent of magical realism wherein sheep inhabit men's souls, a woman possess ears so beguilingly beautiful that they must be perpetually covered and old friends often return as ghosts for no other reason than to share a beer and a chat.A Wild Sheep Chase features a signature Murakami protagonist: a nameless, aimless, ordinary man, just about thirty and living an equally aimless, ordinary life in an essentially nonexistent Tokyo. In other words, &quot;Everyman.&quot; It is this talent of Murakami's to capture the everyday individual innuendo so easily and fully that endears him to the hearts and minds of both Japanese and Westerners alike. In fact, a signature Murakami protagonist could well be Charlie Brown all grown up--a seemingly ordinary man caught up in extraordinary problems and one for whom nothing ever goes right; the personification of Murphy's Law in the extreme.This particular novel's protagonist has his &quot;sort of&quot; life interrupted with the unexpected arrival of something as seemingly innocent, innocuous and mundane as an advertising photo of a field of sheep, sent to him by his old friend, &quot;the Rat.&quot;When the narrator makes the mistake of printing the photo in a newsletter, he then draws the unwanted attention of a singularly sinister stranger currently in the employ of &quot;the Boss,&quot; a powerful political and financial magnate who is now lying near death and whose extraordinary avocational abilities are somehow derived from the very same sheep pictured in the mysterious photo.Blackmailed into procuring the definitely desired sheep, the nameless narrator, along with his girlfriend (she of the covered ears), embarks upon a parody of adventure of near mythic proportion that finds its climactic end in a stormy sea of surprises on the remote island of Hokkaido.Although not as densely-layered as The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, (to date, Murakami's masterpiece), A Wild Sheep Chase is nonetheless filled with the verbal agility, antics and double entrendres for which Murakami is so well-known. It is, after all, Murakami's narrator, himself, who says, &quot;sure we're tossing out fluff, but tell me, where does anyone deal in words with substance?&quot;The answer, of course, is: right here. Murakami does. Although A Wild Sheep Chase may, at first, seem almost as inconsequential as the latest detective thriller in a long string of detective thrillers, the weight of this book, as with all of Murakami's works, eventually lands on the reader like a ton of...sheep."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"If this was Murakami's first novel translated into English, he must have been born with the knack.This is a little more juvenile than some later masterpieces, possibly. But what a great mess of worlds. Mystery plus surrealism plus existentialism. And a conspiracy theory in the center of it all. Entertaining writing without joining the trash league.The big right wing Capo has tied up the world behind the screen, but met with natural problems. His underlings try to bully our hero, the little uptight nobody, and the little guy stands up and becomes obnoxious. Add some weird characters like the Rat or J or the narrator's alcoholic business partner or the narrator's divorced wife, not to forget the Capo's personal assistant, who is maybe one of the best incarnations of Mephisto.And of course: the girl with the most beautiful ears. This is all ear fetishists' favorite novel, I am sure.Great entertainment on an intellectually pleasing level."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Reading Murakami is like falling into a waking dream, sideways. Or watching the slanting orange sunlight during the waning days of autumn, the cool blue rays on the periphery just outside your reach. It's a field of fertile thought, a radiant garden; the pollinating, winged creatures absorb the nectar of its flowers, their fecundity extending the garden from the earth to the air, visibly and ethereally. Murakami's surreal prose invites the reader into a wonderland of quirky motifs and recurring themes; the iteration of symbols--sheep, landscape, and isolation, to name a few-- and the concentration on the minutiae of the protagonist's life--smoking, drinking a beer, listening to music, eating and cooking--ushers the reader into labyrinthine connections with the story.We open with the narrator, a joint owner of a translation and advert business in Tokyo, an imperturbable young man who appears almost anhedonic, but perhaps he is embracing a devotion to mediocrity, a concept explored with some regard. He clearly embraces his girlfriend, who isn't beautiful, but has a sixth sense about the future and exceptional ears that foment his carnal desires. At intervals, he ruminates on his failed past marriage with a gestalt acceptance.A strange man in a black suit sends the narrator on a wild goose chase--actually, a portentous wild sheep chase, to locate a single and singular sheep with a star on its back. (The paperback edition has an apt picture of the titular sheep.) It is an offer the young man can't refuse, as it is consigned to a dire but obscure ultimatum. He accepts the challenge, liberates himself from employment, colleagues, and material matters, and leaves with his girlfriend, headed to the punishing, mountainous landscape of Hokkaido.This is the first Murakami novel (1982) translated into English, and it helps to know that it is the third novel in his TRILOGY OF THE RAT (the other two books not translated at this time); when the Rat character is introduced in the story, the reader senses a historical connection, a pull to the past--not just the protagonist's, but the story's. In Asian culture, the rat is a vehicle of the Hindu god Ganesh, unlike the unfavorable associations in Western culture. Moreover, sheep symbolism is linked to pastoral and idyllic imagery, as well as being sacrificial animals in many religions.Although not as fully realized as Murakami's laterThe Wind-Up Bird ChronicleandKafka on the Shore, it shares the elastic nature of time, the cultural implications of Japanese imperialist expansion, and the encroachment of Westernization. His postmodern expression of war crimes and corruption are both artfully enigmatic and representational, i.e. he fuses the corporeal with myth and fantasy, so that the reader experiences a rarefied adventure laden with figurative images--images that seem initially obtuse, but as the narrative progresses, unfold into the heart of humanity.The purity and beauty of the writing engages the willing reader into the thematic core of emptiness, loneliness, and alienation. Optimism? Cynicism? Pessimism? Yes, and it is left to the reader to interpret the many philosophical threads. Just lay back and let the words wend through you, and the story will inevitably penetrate the many layers of your consciousness. At the end, my mind and even my body felt like a conduit of Murakami's prose.Many kudos to Alfred Birnbaum, whose translation into English is exemplary."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"This is the fourth Murakami novel I've read and chronologically the earliest novel of his translated into English (two prequels to it are not available in English translation, which is a shame as it might better explain the relationships between the main character and the characters of \\"Rat\\" and \\"J\\", who developed their history in a couple of earlier books). Nevertheless, despite the absence of the two prequels, the story still holds up on its on, and is pretty straight forward for Murakami. The physical and the metaphysical meet, perhaps not as convincingly as some might like, but rather magically still. There's a girl, in this case for a change, one who is the same age as the protagonist more or less, and boy and girl set off on a quest to find a sheep that can't really exist. Their quest will take them to the far northern island of Hokkaido, where autumn is rapidly turning to winter and where if they aren't careful, they will end up having to spend an entire winter in an abandoned house in snow-covered fields beneath snow-covered mountains, and wait for spring to bring passable roads as well as sheep, the reason for their being their in the first place. The assistant of a mysterious right-wing power mover and shaker, is on a mission to find a particular sheep with a star-shaped birthmark on his back for his boss, who is in a coma dying of a blood cyst in his brain, and the narrator of our story may have a connection with this particular sheep.These images are just the catalyst for the story, which is really about growing up out of your twenties in a Japan growing up and hopefully out of its post-war apathy. The sheep is a metaphor for many things, as is the heavy sound of silence often found in a Murakami novel, a disappearing woman, and a cat in need of attention. Muramkami would go on to develop some of his heavier points a bit better in novels such as The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (Japan's post-war guilt), Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World (the safety of the sub-conscious and the desire to blend in and guarantee happiness), and Kafka on the Shore (what's really in our sub-conscience both individually and as a society). He doesn't quite have it down in a Wild Sheep Chase, but the core elements are there and its definitely worth reading after one has gotten a little bit of Muramakami under his/her belt. Yes it's easy, but it's also a bit confusing, and if you're going to go for confusing you may as will go for the masterpiece (Wind up Bird), or Murakami's other great book on good and evil (\\"Kafka on the Shore\\"), two books that are, in my opinion, better starting places for reading for Murakami, as is \\"Hard Boiled Wonderland\\" if you want to start with a more sci fi route.But you can't really go wrong with Murakami, especially if you want books that are easy to read but really make you think. no matter which translator is doing the work, the writing is beautiful in English and Murakami writes about that which is in us all, Japanese, English, whatever -- the connection between our darker selves and our higher ones, between good and evil, and what lurks way down in our conscience."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"I'm going to make this brief in honor of how much shorter the book should have been. I love Murakami and did enjoy this book, but frankly, the whole thing seemed like a short story that ballooned into a novel. I can't help but think Murakami was sitting around one day, came up with a great idea, then decided to write about it only to find that he had written a novel-length piece that he had originally intended to be 40 or 50 pages. The story centers on a guy who gets a postcard from a friend of some sheep that he puts in an ad. Unfortunately, this starts a series of bizarre events that lead to a stunning conclusion (I would say more, but you really have to read it to get a sense of how hard it is to capture the small details Murakami includes in this story). I think what may have eventually turned me off to this book is the ending and Murakami's desire to explain everything to us, something that is not present in his later books. But everything he writes is enjoyable, so this is a chance to see a writer growing and improving his craft over time."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Wild Sheep Chase, by his majesty Murakami-Sensei, is another superb addition to the fiction section. I absolutely loved this book for it was short, clear, easy-to-read and most of all - unlike other Murakami novels: A COMPLETE STORY! Like \\"The Chronicles,\\" this novel also has a sequel (well, prequel - maybe) called \\"DANCE DANCE DANCE.\\" However, in order to enjoy the book fully, Pinball must be read as well.WILD SHEEP CHASE starts out with Murakami's early 30's protagonist being heart broken as his wife walks out on him. Right when the reader is caught up feeling sorry for our narrator missing his wife's non-existent slip, story takes a cute turn with the bombardment of Rat's first letter. Rat is on a lam and writes letters to the narrator about his plans, confusions and personal thoughts. Rat's name in the Japanese version is RatMan.In many ways, the narrator is similar to most other Murakami novels for he is - single, smoker, spontaneous and slightly more neurotic. He's a great cook and has a magnet for attracting unusual women. In this book, however, he has a lot of money. Greatest thing about the book is that it surprises you more than just once. The story unfolds its mystery towards the last 150 pages, every 50 pages with a new mystery embedded in itself. Rats letters, especially the picture of the mutant sheep with a star on it's back, gets our narrator in a deep sh*t. This is also where the wild sheep chase begins. Although, the novel is filled with wacky characters like the professor, sheepman, limo-driver, narrator's business partner and J; each and every character has a meaningful existence and is worth the confusion.I do not want to give away the secret, but feel free to email me if the story is confusing."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"This is the first book of Murakami's I've ever read, and if they're all this fun and bizarre, it won't be the last book I read.

The ending was certainly unexpected, it definitely left me wondering what would happen to the protagonist.An ordinary man experiencing an extraordinary adventure ... his quest to find a mysterious sheep ... if I had to describe this book to someone who's never read it I wouldn't be able to do it without explaining the entire book!

I'd read all of his books published in my country. I loved Norwegian Wood but the most I love is A Wild Sheep Chase. If you had read 'Pinball 1973' where he described a confused youth, you can easily meet again these young people in A Wild Sheep Chase.

I know his most daring book is Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World and his most moving book is Norwegian Wood. But, A Wild Sheep Chase is the most creative, well edited, well rounded exercise of Murakami's genius that there is in English. I have become disenchanted with the newer titles: South of the Border, Sputnik Sweetheart and even Kafka on the Shore not because of the content but because of the translator, Philip Gabriel. Alfred Birnbaum and Jay Rubin (the latter my personal favorite) breathe life in their translations rather than just translate it word for word. I read and write Japanese myself and can attest to the fact that Gabriel's texts, while more accurate, lack the Murakami boyish spirit and reckless randomness. Here, Birnbaum pulls out all of the stops paraphrasing double entendres in a natural accurate style giving the very random plot a cohesive feel. Part deadpan absurdity and part absurdist absurdity as opposed to Gabriel's translations which play deadpan absurdity the whole novel. The plot is basically simple. The nameless narrator must find a sheep. It is a sort of metaphysical, supernatural sheep that \\"enters\\" people giving them great will and strength. There is a character named the Sheep Man. There is a Sheep Professor who is now \\"sheepless.\\" having had the sheep \\"enter\\" and \\"leave\\" him. The narrator's girlfriend is an ear model whose ears somehow augment her otherwise normal appearance to great beauty. The story's absurdity and creativity are handled with great skill. There are fewer non-related sidetrips as in Wind-up Bird Chronicle (of which I love but tend to dilute the pace of the novel a bit). Anyhow, a golden rule, check to see who translated the Murakami book you are about to read. Jay Rubin/Alfred Birnbaum yay, Philip Gabriel boo."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"The book is good, but not as good as Murakami's Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (WBC).

The actual plot is a bit hard to summarize but it involves our leading man, a disillusioned Japanese 'salaryman', being hired by a mysterious power broker to find a mystical sheep in the wilds of Hokkaido. Of course the story is wacky, but it moves along nicely and it is very entertaining overall. But in the end the story goes from strange to exceptionally surreal, even by Murakami's standards, and doesn't quite come together in the end. I finished the book thinking &quot;what the heck was that all about ?!?!?&quot;.But this book still has its plusses. The translation by Alfred Birnbaum is excellent, and Murakami captures the essence of disillusioned Japanese youth *so well*. Japanophiles will find much to enjoy (and learn) from this book.

So I knew what to expect with the 'Sheep Chase' but I was terriblly disappointed. The writing seemed amateurish throughout most of the novel. The 'Sheep Chase' has characters that seemed to just drop out of the book suddenly for no plausible reason (The Girl with the Ears). And the strange power of her ears is never fully explained or even demonstrated in the book. The first chapter of the novel doesn't really seem to have anything to do with the rest of the story. Several of the characters seem to do things that are 'out of character'. For example, the mysterious 'Boss' Assistant' who is so powerful and rich (with a host of servants) and demanding agrees to take care of the protagonist's cat. This just seemed somewhat peculiar.

His writing is crude, with strange word choices that keep one confused as to the tone he's trying to achieve. Or is he trying to sound cacaphonus on purpose? (Or mediocre on purpose, which seems to be the protagonist's most important characteristic). Or does he have a terrible translator? Because of the prizes, I stuck with it, and am still trying to figure out if there is some authentic message he's trying to communicate. Do sheep have some special symbolic meaning in Japanese culture? I wondered if the sheep was a distortion of &quot;The Lamb,&quot; which represents the good in Western culture, but I haven't been able to get very far with this idea. Still, of all animals to pick to serve his purpose, why a sheep?? Is the title a play on &quot;A Wild Goose Chase&quot;?

The story is about a man in advertising who went in search of a rather unique sheep becuase of an advertising photo that was used for one of his clients. I had a tough time following the direction of the story because it talked a lot about the geography of Japan and I felt that for me to have a better understanding for the story I should have had a little knowledge of Japan. So for me to try and clarify everything, I would ask the people in my book club group to help me out.The tone that the author used was could have been a bit lighter to add more color the story. Murakami make the chase of the nameless main character appear boring because and seem to drag when he would go out for about a day and come home with no findings. Then he would seem convinced that he would not find the sheep, so that made me lose interest in finding the sheep either. Also, the tone of the book made it harder for me to catch the comedy that Murakami was trying to use.I think that this book would be good for anyone who would know something of the geography of Japan.

Maybe this book is still a little bit unbalanced every now and then, but I look forward to reading his next books."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Yes, just one of those books that every thinking human being likes.

I found it very easy to read and couldn't stop turning the page, anticipating each turn and step in the adventure. I found the ending quite unexpected and it left me hanging with a few unresolved issues. Unlike other Murakami works I read, I foung the lack of resolution in \\"A Wild Sheep Chase\\" a bit unsatisfying, which is the perfect excuse for me to read the \\"sequel\\" soon!"},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Being a Murakami maniac, I couldn't criticize a bit of his works at all. If one said his works had numerous flaws and awkwardness in addition to weirdness (although I would think it his creativity), I would still agree that all those commit to the perfection Murakami elements. His works are perfected from being flawed; and yes, that is an irony. In general, his literatures spring up from the very thought no one could ever imagine of -- the ideas are not only ideas but also symbols of everything that might happen around us. Murakami does it so well in working out what he is trying to describe that his novels approach me so quickly and manipulate my mind until I fully am aware of his very thoughts. \\"A Wild Sheep Chase\\" is the best works, I daresay, out of what he has done so far. I'm still an amateur in grasping what the authors try to message me, so I haven't figured out quite yet of what exactly he is telling me. However, as I read through the book again and again, I start to comprehend. Not that he did poorly on his descriptions, but it's his thoughts that are too deep for me to understand. If you are a competitive person, you might want to CHALLENGE Murakami by understanding the variety of multiple meanings of symbols.P.S.:By the way, (no offense if I sound like a racist) I recommend this book especially to Asians in their own languages. Asian countries share the same culture as to the use of the native language. I mean to say that your language may add much more taste to Murakami than English since some expressions in Asian languages are not often used unless describing extremes, etc."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"This is a timely re-issue of a an excellent novel, giving a vivid and likeable picture of modern Japanese society wrapped in a post-modern detective story.

It's like an incredible roller coaster you never want to end. This is an entrancing plunge into the vast world that exits just below the surface of what we perceive as the everyday, a world brimming with delightful insanity and flavor which, though never acknowledge is what truly adds flavor to our lives. Murakami's everyman protagonist is plucked out of his mundane existence and shown first hand how bizarre and deep this mundane world can truly be if you're willing to peer beneath the surface. A wonder of a tale that will make you long for a quirky metaphysical adventure of your own, and just might move you to launch one"},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Fabulous! Picturesque, dark, with much of the same melancholy as &quot;Norwegian Wood,&quot; and told in the same offhand style. Murakami is a novelist with the heart and style of a poet, and the dry wit of a satirist. His stories, told in this loose, comfortable style seem to slip lightly along, until you are sucker-punched with tragedy or insight, related in the same voice. Once again, I can only describe Mr. Murakami's work as deeply haunting and memorable"},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"A Wild Sheep Chase is a warm-hearted, mysterious, detective story that engages the imagination and elicits conjecture. I think the narration of the story is unique. Haruki Murakami uses a lot of meaningless humor;he brings focus to circumstances or objects that people usually don't pay attention to.He strongly shows isolation, but the way he describes it is not at all gloomy or serious. The story doesn't reveal the answer to the mystery of the sheep easily. I thought I would be able to solve the riddles in the story while reading because Murakami drops many hints. However, as I continued reading, I realized that I still could not have predicted the end. I read it without stopping because of my curiosity. The ending was quite unexpected and desolate. I like the story very much because it was full of suspense, surprise,and shifty turns. I want to read this story again, but in Japanese.I think reading it in the original language is best because the expression and humor will be true to the writer's meaning, which is sometimes lost or compromised in translations. I recommend this book to people who like detective stories, mysteries, and dramas. Also, I think it's better to have a little knowledge of Japan."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Like the life of the protagonist, this book takes half its lifetime to get going. It begins like a disaffected diary, detailing all the cigarettes smoked, beers drank, outfits worn, meals eaten. The protagonist is a bored 20-something advertising executive, who yawns through his mediocre life even as personal tragedies sweep past him: his best friend starts to self destruct, his wife leaves him. He doesn't seem to care much, or be actively searching for meaning, he just lets everything wash over him and gazes at the scenery.Then, he runs an ad recycling an innocuous picture of sheep in a pasture that a long lost friend sent him for no apparent reason. A mysterious and ominous man appears at his office, forces him to stop running the ad, and takes him to a secret villa to brief him on the journey he is about to be sent on. Despite this sudden intrigue, our protagonist remains bored. Instead of trying to decipher who these people are or what they are doing, he takes naps, thinks about meals and outfits past. With a shrug he accepts this quest, and smokes his way through the northern countryside of japan.When he gets his first lead and meets the \\"Sheep Professor\\", a bitter retired man who claims he knows the pasture in the picture, the story picks up considerably. The protagonist is still bored (though expresses a new emotion finally: confusion) and spends much time describing the scenery around him even as his time is running out, even as the conspiracy is closing in around him. But now there's an interesting tension between the reader's expectation of crisis, and the protagonist's nonchalance.Finally in the last 30 pages of the book, we get what we had been anticipating for 320 pages: a fantastic conspiracy, an ancient villain, an awakening of our bored protagonist, and an explanation of all the ridiculous details leading up to the climax. The ending is far worth the slog through the bemused navel gazing."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Add \\"A Wild Sheep Chase', to the reasons why I don't like sheep. My lifelong fear of sheep has had nothing to do with the Haruki Murakami's magical mystery tour around Japan in search of an elusive mutant sheep with the powers of mind control...until now. I did not know there was a mutant sheep on the loose in Japan and that sheep could in fact take over your body. It' exerts it's mind control through a cyst it creates in your brain once it gets in, apparently through telekinesis while you sleep. And, if that's not enough, this particular sheep is bent on no less than world domination. Finding that sheep and destroying it's evil master plan describes this novel in a nutshell.OK, maybe the story isn't everybody's cup of tea. It's not my cup of tea, particular with my lifelong bias against sheep. But in typical fashion, Murakami held my attention...in this case for two solid days at the beach. He is a magnificent storyteller, of this we have always been assured. Whereas I might have been disappointed by the plotline, I was not disappointed by his character descriptions, the Japanese vistas he paints, and the other reasons we keep turning his pages...his a-political view of world events, his ability to capture common life, and the torment in the mind of his main character...when by all accounts we should be putting the book down when plot starts to develop. There could be no redeeming ending to this book...a complete flight of fancy...right down to the Sheepman who smoke's Seven Stars and drinks brandy. Yet we have \\"A Wild Sheep Chase\\" in the portfolio and on our bookshelves.This is only my third Murakami novel I have read both \\"After Dark\\" and \\"Norwegian Wood\\". I have also read two of his non-fiction works. I will read a few more. Start with four stars for a Murakami novel full of his descriptive prose, and take off one star for sheep with mind control."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"If you love Norwegian Wood (or similar Murakami novels) this is a good introduction to his more surreal stuff... not too bizarre until the last handful of chapters."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"I came across this book years ago, and was absolutely delighted by it. I was very saddened that, at that time, it was the only one of Murakami's books translated into English. The years passed, and imagine my delight to find it, along with others of Murakami's books--a veritable treasure trove of good reading just waiting for me! I heartily recommend this book--the mood, the imagination, the universal themes--a wonderfully compelling read."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Haruki Murakami was born in Kyoto in 1949, and is one of Japan's most famous authors. He started writing at twenty-nine - the ispiration, apparently, appearing out of nowhere at a baseball game. \\"A Wild Sheep Chase\\" is his third novel and was first published in 1982. It apparently follows on from his two previous novels - \\"Hear the Wind Sing\\" and \\"Pinball, 1973\\" - to form the \\"Trilogy of the Rat\\". Unfortunately, for those of us who don't live in Japan, the first two parts of the trilogy are unpublished in English outside of the country - Murakami himself (apparently) isn't too happy with them and is against their translation.Our narrator's thirtieth birthday is quickly approaching, and he's had a tricky couple of months...the book opens with a couple of rather difficult endings. (Before the story's even properly got started, he's attended an old girlfriend's funeral and seen his marriage has end in divorce). However, the adventure the book sends him on comes out of his professional life. He and his business partner - old friends from college - had started out running a small translation company, before (successfully) branching out into advertising. The pair had once been good friends, but that friendship has faded a little as his partner's drinking has increased. The trouble really begins with a PR bulletin our hero had drawn up - one that uses a photo of an idyllic Hokkaido landscape. (Mountains, grass, sheep, that type of thing...) The bulletin is to be stopped, apparently at the request of an exceptionally well-informed, politically well connected, exceedingly rich and very influential character with right-wing tendencies. The character in question (referred to only as the Boss) owns half the advertising industry and has more money than you could shake a bank at. The message is brought by the Boss' second in command...and he's very keen to make our hero an offer he can't refuse. Thankfully, he won't be on his own - he'll be helped along the way by his new girlfriend. (Not only does she have the world's sexiest ears - EVERYTHING seems better when they're uncovered - but she also appears to be a little bit psychic).A pretty sad book, overall. Having kicked the book off with the funeral and the divorce, I was sure that - somehow or other - the events or the characters involved would be revisited at some point, later in the story. They never were...instead, it seems they were used to set the tone for the book, as the kicks just keep coming. Having said that, it's not an entirely sad book...it is also a little surreal in places and it's certainly very enjoyable. Absolutely recommended - I enjoyed this one more than both \\"After Dark\\" and \\"Norwegian Wood\\"."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"This gem of a novel was required reading for a world literature class I took. I waited until the last minute to read it, but it ended up being a breeze to get through because it was so fantastically odd.

But Murakami's calm, reasoned, well-described mysterious quest on which he sends his main narrator overcomes my usual distrust of the unbelievable in books and I was willing to enjoy and even love the novel despite its slightly fantastical twist(s). Murakami's characters are fresh--you can see pieces of people you have met or know, but his characters are unique, the plot proceeds despite the completely illogical assignment given to the main character, and the bad luck on the quest makes the happy coincidences that much more easy to swallow. The descriptions of landscape and weather lend authenticity and depth to the novel. There are many traces of Japanese culture in the characters, but the stories and characters are universal. Murakami defies description, he blends so many threads of brilliant writing together. I highly recommend this novel!"},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"This story starts with a funeral and ends with a dead person. What a lot happens inbetween. I felt that I was missing something because of all the references to animals: rat, sheep, dorks. It was well written and a very good story. I was taken aback by the final chapters. It was not what I expected at all, and yet it was a really good ending. I guess that it ended with mediocrity winning. That is reality for all of us: we are mediocre, with flashs of excellence.

The way it's told is beautiful and believe me, you don't want to stop reading once you start it. The thoughts behind everything is profound. Often confused between reality and his own imagination, the protagonist either can't or sub-consciously doesn't want to make connection between his own existence and the real world. There is also an obvious lack of his real emotion in his relationships with his ex-wife and girl friend. Why? Murakami did an excellent job making us think what we usually neglect. How do we identify ourselves? Do we need to? What's reality and what's our imagination?"},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"First off, know this was my first Haruki Murakami novel and I had no expectations. And I realize this review may upset some die-hard fans. Still, here are my thoughts... The mystery of the story kept me going, though the character's seemed somewhat flat and staid (wish I knew that word when I was taking the SATs). There were a few brief moments of really nice creativity, but they came and went far too quickly. An example is one of the characters late in the book. The moment he made things interesting, he would disappear again into the woods.With all that being said, I still finished the book and was glad I read it. While the story could have used some lift, what really kept me going was Murakami's use of language. He really sets up scenes and characters extremely well. And the mystery around the book was fairly interesting - enough to keep me reading anyway."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Not as exciting to read as his other novels, but there were some parts in the story that made me look forward to getting on the train during rush hour so that I can pick up where I left off... Made me think a lot about our advanced capitalist society (along with Dance Dance Dance), and had a few interesting characters, but definitely not as interesting as his later novels.Again, someone told me that the first Murakami book that you read (the one that got you hooked) will always be your favorite, and at least for me, it's true. Kafka on the shore (Hard boiled Wonderland takes second place) is still the best."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"I think Murakami is an excellent author. He has proven to contain more imagination in a single paragraph than other authors have in an entire novel.If you haven't read any books by him, I recommend starting with this one.PROS 1) Brilliant imagination. 2) genuinely intriguing and intelligent. 3) completely unique 4) mysterious in a very strange way 5) absurd humor 6) very strangeCONS 1) This book is a translation. I don't know about you, but I don't like translations. Yes, it's true, you lose something in translation. I find the prose in his book to be stale and uninteresting. This particular book isn't his worst translated novel, but it's still below my satisfactory level. You read Murakami for his imagination, not for his wirting style. 2) It's got a hard-boiled first-person narrative style. This could be a pro or it could be a con. For myself, I believe it is a con. In fact, if you absolutely despise the idea of a hard-boiled narrative you probably won't enjoy Murakami very much. 3) It's a bit too long. One downfall of Murakami, in my opinion, is that his novels are overwritten. I don't need every little mundane detail when I read a book. You decide whether that is a pro or a con yourself.I recommend this book to anyone interested in magic-realism, bizarro fiction, subversive writing, and offbeat speculative fiction."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Excellent book by the wonderful Mr Murakami.

The main character is the nameless &quot;I&quot; who experiences a personal journey of sorts while trying hard to locate an inner touchstone within himself.

His strange style seems to be much better suited to those punchy fable-length works than to the novel form. Ultimately, I found this book to be strangely disappointing. I was entertained enough to read through the end, but then found the whole enterprise to be largely forgettable. Often the odd details seemed to be inserted merely for the sake of oddness, rather than to create larger meaning. This is not magical realism of any great moment. Perhaps future books will see Murakami's obvious talent for story telling and terse observation focused more efficiently on delivering a story of real impact."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"I will have to admit Murakami's more famous books \\"Hardboiled..\\" and \\"Wind up bird Chronicles\\" did not float my boat, although I agree he is no doubt talented and a gifted writer of vivid imagery and twisted plots. I must however give him due credit here for this book, the first Murakami book I read, though I'm not sure I would read it again if that makes sense. I think I was uncomfortable the whole time I read this book, but perhaps you will love it.This book is pure entertainment. The reader will be quickly immersed in a trippy, nightmarish wonderland of modern Japan. Perhaps its comparable to Alice in wonderland where \\"Alice\\" is a middle-aged Japanese man and \\"Wonderland\\" encompasses an acid-trip OD of neverending hallucinations, mysteries, and metaphors you probably won't understand.

I have read this book in Chinese before, and the English translation is also terrific. If you haven't read any book of Haruki before, I would recommend you to start with this.The Wild Sheep Chase is a bit of an extension from Pinball 1979, but you can also read it as an individual story, since only the characters' names are repeated.Like all other Haruki's stories I have read (I read almost every work of him), this book gave me a good taste in my mouth for quite a long time, and I kept re-read the whole book again and again whenever I have time.You probably think that my opinions are biased given the fact that I am Haruki's big fan, but I hope you can give it a try and I am sure that you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"I read Kafka on the shore and figured the meloncholy feel to parts of that book may have been particular to the story. Well silly me. Though a completely different adventure (even the bleak episodes here are not boring), Wild Sheep Chase has some very sad moments that left me feeling like I had been hit hard or at the very least needed some strong drink for a few hours. The sensation lingered on into the next day (I guess a sign of good writing if the book can affect you for a while).I could be wrong but it seemed to me the main character is also in this melancholy state. At one point he says something like he doesnt mind the (actual word would be a spoiler) sad moments as it better than emptyness.So despite it all I would still recommend this if you are not already unstably blue. I am going to be careful of which book I read by him next (I read many short stories which were more insightfully weird and subdued than tearfully sad like KOTS or AWSC). Its worth it for the highly detailed characters and scenes and especiallythe bizarre and downright paranormal events that are handled very deftly. And admittedly it wouldnt have been such a bummer in parts if it wasnt for getting attached to the characters.Actually my only real frustration was that some of the mysteries of the book were less resolved at the end than the start (to me anyways). Maybe I have to read it again. Not sure.I guess I was looking for a book that would be both mind expanding and liberating from dull everyday life.

Suddenly he is thrust into the search for a sheep that shouldn't exist. Accompanied by his girlfriend, an expensive prostitute with magical ears, he learns more about sheep than he'd ever want to and is even confronted by a small man dressed like a sheep.

Its very different from other Murakami novels, because there is no big 'pay off', nor are the ending sentences (oh so important in a Haruki context) effective at ALL. In fact, the last page probably sank the novel for me, and sort of tarnished the confused beauty that came before it.The story literally is about a wild sheep with a star on its' back - whether this is a real sheep or a sheep that inhabits' humans' souls is left to interpretation. Lets just say that Murakami was still finding his bearings here, and the confusion definitely shows. Its as if much of the story was made up as he was writing it, and even though the writing is good (the typical jazz influences, etc), the overall effect is what one can only call 'underwhelming'.Don't get me wrong - Murakami is on fire when he's on (\\"Norwegian Wood\\", \\"Dance Dance Dance\\"), but I would not rate this anywhere near the top of his catalog. I think this one and \\"Underground\\" are probably his most uninteresting efforts - though this one scores slightly better because at least there is some semblance of a storyline before the disappointing and idiotic ending.Three Stars."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"murakami almost wrote a flawless novel in A WILD SHEEP CHASE. the typical murakami elements were there: a centralized character confused, but yet accepting of their own mediocrity. throw in some telepathic supporting cast, a mythical/mystical creature that supercedes space and time, and the sound of one hand clapping. it's the latter zen-like quality that takes murakami's craft above other modern day cult writers like amis and welsh. but in this book, i found that the quiet, reflective qualities helped create its biggest weakness: scale. maybe i am too used to western literature's climax. but i felt that the peak was a little too close to the end of the book. still, 4 out of 5 is damn good. i will read it again."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Wild Sheep Chase is just like it sounds in the title. It is a comedic meandering through the life of an aimless, newly divorced man with a penchant for the female ear. He works in an ad and translating agency. Actually, he suffers from indifference, lethargy and displays no ambition. He is approached by a mysterious man, asking him to seek out a specific sheep of a breed unknown to Japan. The sheep is distinctive for a cream coloured star located on its back. The mysterious man tells the narrator that this sheep once inhabited his boss (as well as various other individuals) and had ruined their lives when the sheep chose to leave these unwilling, unwitting hosts. The man&#65533;s boss was once a powerful and important man, but now barely clung to survival, with a cyst in his brain and unbearable hallucinations (80% of them haunted by sheep). At first, the narrator is confused: why him? First of all, he viewed himself so mediocre that he was not qualified for a mission of this magnitude and impossibility. (&#65533;Age certainly hasn&#65533;t conferred any smarts on me. Character maybe, but mediocrity is a constant, as one Russian writer put it. Russians have a way with aphorisms. They probably spend all winter thinking them up.&#65533;) The narrator argues that because he has nothing to lose, the man and his boss cannot threaten him. The man counters that every man has something to lose, but they only realise it when it is gone. It becomes clear also that the narrator has published a photo of this particular sheep (without knowing it).

I like sci fi, I like this book. Murakami has a tendency towards the insane... but makes it seem like reality. Somewhat. This book is perhaps one of the most delightfully messed up, insane, but reality based books I have read in ages. Trust me, you won't get it.

Reading this book, hilarious in part, insightful and desperately sad in others, its not hard to see why Murakami is one of Japan's best selling authors."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"By calling this book a &quot;Fun Read,&quot; I don't mean to imply that there is a scarcity of things to think about. There is plenty. Murakami simply doesn't insist that you think about them. It is pleasant to read this book at a fevered pitch, allowing the layers to rest unconsidered below the surface, validating and facilitating the fun. Murakami grants us that freedom by creating a protaganist who skims across the surface of things himself. Murakami's prose is not unaware, he just makes it very easy for you to be aware. I have heard complaints that Murakami recycles themes and characters from book to book. Well, here's one guy who's not complaining."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"First off, I am a big Murakami fan. This was the first book of his I read, but I read quite a few others since. This is one is still one of my favourties. I really liked how westernized the heroes were in their daily actions and habits, yet how that made them only more non-western, more japanese, more human. Contrasts of all types abound. Writing is strong, Mr. Murakami is a great writer and Alfred birnbaum did an amazing job translating. The language is fluid, forming itself on my mind and adding an atmosphere and context all by itself without the use of words for descriptions, thoughts, and feelings.As with many other books, the story itself is somewhat secondary, the quest is more important than its result. In this book, however, I did not even thirst for a climax. I just savoured each page and hoped to find more of the same in other books by the author. I did."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Murakami is probably one of the most brilliant authors alive today. What's his work like? Think an updated Vonnegut for the new millennium, think Dali painting in words. His deft combination of surrealism and postmodern apathy aptly captures the attitudes of today's youth and whisks the reader away on a nonsensical journey that leaves them craving more of Murakami's unique worldview. Thank goodness he wrote a sequel, &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot;."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Meanwhile the narrator's friend who sent this infamous picture, known only as The Rat, writes cryptic letters to the narrator, leading him on another sort of chase. The Rat never tells where he is or why he is writing. He seems to want something from the narrator, but this quest for what the Rat wants is just as mysterious as the chase through Japan for a unique sheep.The narrator is given two months to find the sheep. He decides to embark on the search, reluctantly, because it seems he has no alternatives. His new girlfriend, who is entirely unremarkable save for her stunning ears, accompanies him and, interestingly, often predicts the turns their path will take in her dreams. The two-month deadline in curtailed as the Boss takes a turn for the worse; they want to locate the sheep before the Boss dies.The narrator and his girlfriend travel to Hokkaido, where all clues point to the sheep being. The girlfriend has a feeling that they should stay at a place called The Dolphin Hotel. The narrator hates it there, but later they discover that the building used to be the Hokkaido Ovine Hall. SHEEP AT LAST! It also turns out that the father of the hotel's owner lives there and maintains the Sheep Reference Room on the 2nd floor of the hotel. The father is known as The Sheep Professor. The narrator and his girlfriend talk to the man and discover that the Sheep Professor indeed had been inhabited by the very same sheep they were chasing. He was a changed man after his encounter. \\"Can you imagine what it's like to be left with a solitary thought when its embodiment has been pulled out from underneath you, roots and all?\\" The Sheep Professor goes on, \\"The sheep that enters a body is thought to be immortal. And so too the person who hosts the sheep is thought to become immortal. However, should the sheep escape, the immortality goes.\\" Apparently, before the sheep embodied the Sheep Professor, no sheep of this kind had existed in Japan. The Sheep Professor had been a soldier in China, and that is when the sheep jumped into his body.The hotel owner sympathised with the narrator and his girlfriend and their quest for the sheep, but he had his own problems. He had never been able to get close to his father at all, and he blamed the sheep, \\"Sheep hurt my father, and through my father, sheep have also hurt me.\\"The narrator continues to search for the sheep but the search leads him closer and closer to where he believes his old friend Rat is staying. The narrator and girlfriend head to a villa up in the mountains where, it turns out, Rat must have been and might still be. Once there, the narrator begins to have encounters with a Sheep Man who gives him cryptic warnings. The girlfriend disappears mysteriously in the middle of the night and the Sheep Man tells the narrator he will never see her again. Eventually reality and fantasy mix, until it is not clear anymore (to the reader or to the narrator) what is quite real and what isn't. The narrator begins to realise that everything happening at the villa is like a \\"grotesque comedy of mishaps\\".As it turns out, the sheep with the cream-coloured star on its back had inhabited Rat, and he was the one orchestrating the whole affair of the narrator having to seek him out. The Rat is interacting with the narrator, but the Rat is basically already dead. The Rat recognised the destructive power of the sheep and had been driven crazy and decided to make sure the sheep could never escape again and hanged himself. The book ends in a surreal haze. Nevertheless, an entertaining haze.Sheep Chase is not Murakami's best work, but it is fascinating and highly detailed and unusual."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"As I myself am living in a very small isolated town on the Japanese Island of Hokkaido, this book couldn't have come to me at a better time. Not only are his descriptions acurate but they rang so true to me in a very meaningful way. What a wonderful story. It reminds me of Allende's \\"House of the Spirits\\" in a very modern sense. Where reality and magical reality come together so perfectly that you cannot identify one from the other. His tone is so frank and honest...often in life we tend to dramatize every detail, his character takes it all in stride in an envious sort of way and makes one question their own dramactic handling of their own life. I laughed so much throughout this book and look forward to reading more of his work."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"&quot;A Wild Sheep Chase&quot; is a wonderful and colorful read. Ostensibly the story of a nameless and flat protagonist as he searches for the answer to a puzzling riddle, the story sees to wander greatly in the first two-thirds of the book. The lead character, coerced into searching for a missing and mysterious sheep, never seems to sense the urgency of what his failure could mean. He is a character who feels he has nothing to lose. Indeed, his only redeeming characteristics seem to be that he cares for a missing friend (called &quot;The Rat&quot;) and that he has enough curiosity to even push him towards an attempt at solving the riddle.While the protagonist is very much an empty vessel, the reader of this book will find themselves attracted to the detached yet interesting interactions with some of the other main characters. The characters and scenes, for the most part, are David Lynch-like; quirky, with murky motives, and strange communications.Structurally, the book wanders around a bit while getting started. It feels as if the author just started writing one day and learned how to tie it all together as he went along (near the end of the book). Even so, while it may feel that not much plot progress is being made, however, Murakami is able to delight the reader enough with his inventiveness that the story seems worthwhile. The book climaxes with a brilliant metaphyical dialogue between the protagonist and his friend. The last several chapters are done so well, I had to read them a couple of times and scribble all over the pages (that's surely a good sign).I found Murakami to have a concise and enjoyable writing style that is deceptively simple for the deeply layered plot it conveyed. I certainly wil be recommending the book to my friends."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"For those who don't know, this is the third book of his chronology: (1) Listen to the Wind Song; (2) 1973's Pinball; (3) A Wild Sheep Chase.

A story about &quot;I&quot;, &quot;Mouse&quot; and &quot;Sheep Man&quot; - with the grand finale in &quot;A Wild Sheep Chase.&quot; So, if you like this one, read Murakami's first novel, Listen to the Wind Song and proceed. Finish off with Dance Dance Dance in the Dolphin Hotel of Sapporo. Enjoy."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"A story that starts off in a familiar way - The main character - a man who seems average to us - has a job and a house, a cat, he just split with his wife, he isn't happy, but he isn't really unhappy either really. The most un-Japanese of characters, a stranger in his world, but still an Everyman. Changes in his life come when he is contacted by the agent of a mysterious but powerful man about a strange matter: Some time ago he published a picture of a field of sheep, seemingly ordinary. Hidden in this picture was a sheep, one with a cream star on its back, which was far from ordinary. A sheep utterly unknown by the world. Our nameless main character is ordered to find the sheep, put under threats to his job and material life. With his girlfriend, a woman whose ears possesses the power of zen satori (momentary enlightenment), he embarks on a journey across Japan and through the levels of his consciousness. The goal he approaches becomes more personal than physical, and what he finds in the end is not at all what he was looking for in the beginning. Along his search for the sheep he meets people who have encountered the sheep in their lives. The sheep has profoundly changed the life of everyone it has touched. When the sheep is in a person (for that is what it does, it takes control of people; using them to its own sheepish ends,) they can do no wrong. They experience leaps and bounds in every aspect of their lives and unbelievable satisfaction, happiness and success. When the sheep leaves them, they are destroyed. They spend the remainder of their often short lives searching desperately for the sheep, trying to re-gain the perfection their lives had during its presence, recapture their lost enlightenment. Many readers of this book believe that the sheep symbolizes zen enlightenment, as the sheep possessed characters often demonstrate these characteristics. This contrasts sharply with the author's estrangement from his own culture which can be seen by his characters' surprising Americaness, so we are left to wonder why he has based a book around an idea as Japanese as enlightenment. All characters touched by the sheep in Murakami's novel are hurt by it; he may be suggesting a different approach to life, something our modern consciousness can better reconcile with. A different way to find happiness. Perhaps zen enlightenment is too difficult and unrealistic a path for humans, with all our flaws, to pursue. Perhaps we need a path that focuses on embracing the present in the face of an uncertain future instead of demanding our faith in the unknown. A goal that Murakami expresses as unreachable save through supernatural, and possibly corrupted help (the sheep) is perhaps not the path he is recommending to the reader. Through the course of his search, the main character slowly sheds his material possessions and gains a sense of intuition which he did not have in the beginning of the book. He goes from having a very extrinsic personality to having true intrinsic understanding. This could be viewed as a progression along both/either the path of zen enlightenment or existentialism, philosophies in both of which the character embraces their life for what it is and rejects the false appearances of the world. Something Kundera would call stripping away the kitsch. The last person we meet who was touched by the sheep, the sheepman, finds the strength, (or weakness, in this case they are the same) to reject the sheep from himself. He is too weak to give up the simple pleasures of his life for the greater ideals offered him by the sheep. He is strong enough to resist its lure. Thus instead of embracing a philosophy which focuses on the pain in life and on death, he chooses to embrace his own life. He states that he was too weak to give up his life, too in love with the world to let the sheep take over. His weakness in this way becomes his strength. And he is able to attain true happiness unlike other sheeped characters. Perhaps the only strength of humankind in general is our weakness, and we do not have the moral fiber it takes to pursue the sheep. Even the title, &quot;A Wild Sheep Chase&quot; implies that the sheep is something which cannot be caught, that perhaps does not exist at all (a wild goose chase). Instead of following the sheep the main character embraces his life for what it is, all the suffering and pain, but all the beauty at the same time. Despite the meaninglessness of it he finds point in living. In the end having nothing left in his life he sits on a beach to cry, but possibly less over his lost life than over what Camus would call the \\"gentle indifference of the world\\". This is an existentialist awakening. He could, at this point, be considered an existentialist hero. He has discovered that the meaning in his life lays not in what he does with it, or in some greater truth beyond it, but in himself, and in his love of the world around him. In the end the main character has lost everything in his life, and though he cries it could be said that he is, at last, truly happy."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Multiple story lines; multiple characters that maybe aren't.

Told in first-person perspective by a man whose name the author doesn't mention, this is a story about our aimless quest for something we don't have. We chase it and when we have it we take it for granted.'The Man' (for lack of a name) has divorced his wife or rather the wife decided to call it quits with a loser who lives like a zombie. Working at an ad firm with his business partner 'the man' sleepwalks through his life. Then he chases and wins over the affection of a girl with 3 occupations who has an ear so magnificient ... you would have to read Murakami's description to get the picture.Then suddenly a picture of sheep grazing among the mountains brings him to a Boss's experienced assistant who coolly involves 'the man' into a hunt for a special sheep with a star on its back. This Boss controls everything but he has lost the sheep so 'the man' has to find it or face doom.Out among Northern hills 'the man' faces great characters such as the Sheep Professor, the Sheep Man, his old friend The Rat and his own mirror image.Then on, you just keep turning the pages as it gets murkier, more thrilling, cold, breathtakingly beautiful and sad. If you think too much into what 'the man' thinks and goes through then probably you would go to the looney-ville and check in.A thoroughly enjoyable and engaging novel from the author who knows the soul of young, lonely, aimless men of this world."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Murakami is known for his unconventional storytelling, sometimes completley surrealist, in which images have more importance than ideas. When he seems to be trying to say something cohesive, it's still hidden behind layers of strange imagery. What I liked best about A Wild Sheep Chase was that the message was so direct - and, at least to me, interesting. It seems to be suggesting that humanity and 'greatness' are irreconcilable (of course, it's a lot more complicated than that), which is especially interesting in contrast with a reference to Yukio Mishima near the beginning. I found it very though-provoking.On other levels, though, it isn't so succesful. A lot of the characters are very thinly drawn. This may be intentional; it works in the case of the main character, who I guess is supposed to be one of those everymen, but his girlfriend, for example, has such a total absence of personality that when she disappears from the narrative, it seems like an attempt by the author to get rid of an awkward character. A few of the characters really are outstanding - the villians, and one eccentric chauffer, but they are mainly present in the first half of the book. Later, when the narrative rests entirely on the protagonist and his girlfriend, it gets somewhat boring. Its first novel status, though, is more than an excuse for that. I still recommend it."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"I am very privileged to go to one of those high schools that believes in \\"progressive\\" and \\"forward tinking.\\" Therefore, Sophomore Year, I was enrolled in our *World Literature* class, where we studied authors from around the world. Different mindsets, different morals, different plots. Of all the books we read that year (From the fabulousThe Master and Margaritato the boringIn the Time of the Butterflies), A Wild Sheep Chase by Haruki Murakami has left the most lasting impact and ultimately shaped my literary taste and experience.It's been 3 years since I first read this novel, and in that time, I have read a good chunk of what Murakami has to offer, re-read a few of them, and solidified Murakami as my current favorite author. But even when I get the satisfaction of finishing another one of his novels, I always have the yearning to return to the one that started it all for me.A Wild Sheep Chase is actually the third book in a trilogy, however, Murakami and his publishers both agreed that the first two entries, Hear the Wind Sing and Pinball, 1973, were not good enough, and thus where never widely published in English. They *were* translated into English for ESL students in Japan, so, if you try hard enough, you can get your hands on a copy. I actually managed to do that, and while I enjoyed them, I don't recommend that you attempt it unless you *really* like Murakami.Although it's the third book in a trilogy, it actually stands alone pretty well. The plot is deceptively simple from the start: A translator is sent on a journey to find a mythical sheep with a black star on its back, or face financial ruin at the hands of a large businessman. But, interestingly enough, like all journeys of the classical renaissance, this one is less about completing the goal and instead about the characters met and sacrifices made along the way.Murakami's writing style is often misunderstood. I believe part of this is due to the Japanese Language itself, which has its own constraints, and certain nuances don't translate well into English. The other part, however, is Murakami himself. And the best way to describe the style is as \\"efficient\\". Things often move slowly, with seemingly unimportant details or off-topic rants flowing in and out of the picture. But rest assured: each and every word in this novel has a purpose, a point, a reason.What's so beautiful about Murakami stories is his notion of surrealism and magical realism, coupled with eclectic and quirky things. The best example of this is probably the character of the narrators unnamed girlfriend. She is a model, and she has the power to almost magically channel life force to her ears and make them the most beautiful in the world.The conclusion of the novel leaves a lot of loose ends, but they don't make you feel empty. It's less about what happens and more about what you gain from it. And for me, a certain two-page long chapter toward the end of the novel (I believe its 47) is one of the most interesting ways to tie up almost everything the novel ever spent time on.This book is amazing, zany, very fun. Its almost like the Japanese-Equivalent of Kurt Vonnegut, if his novels had babies with those of Ernest Hemingway. Do not pass the opportunity up.It should be noted that there is another Murakami novel,Dance Dance Dance, which answers a lot of the questions asked by this novel. It's not quite a direct sequel to *this book*, but instead more of a spiritual successor to the trilogy. Pick both of these novels up for a nice vacation of deep reading."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Excellent book, interesting and intriguing.

The kindle version is perfect, nothing else to add.thank you"},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Creepy.....as....hades.But that's why I loved it!!!I'm serious. This book was so creepy it had me wiggling around in my seat in discomfort. Yet, I was absolutely captivated! I couldn't put the book down!If you're a reader looking for a book that will take you more than one read to truly grasp, then this is the book for you. It had my brain churning and my fingers tapping with nervous energy.I'm not going to give a bit of a run-down of the book as I've done in previous review mostly because it would sound too convoluted out of context. All you really need to know is our main character is forced to go chase a non-existent sheep out in the cold country. He gets trapped on a mountain, in a creepy cabin, all alone, and is occasionally visited by a sheep-man.There you go.Murakami's imagery is rich and the meaning of his works heavy and grey, like a cloud hanging right over your head while the sun shines everywhere else. He is not an \\"IN YOUR FACE\\" horror master. He's the type that likes to really get under your skin in a very subtle way so that he has unguarded access to your subconscious. When he gets there he gets busy digging and thrashing around and without suspecting it... you're suddenly disturbed.I honestly have no complaints about this book. To be truthful, I really need to read it a few more times to better gather an understanding for the work. As a piece of pure entertainment it's thrilling, as a work of intellect it's probing and there are quite a few exchanges in the book that make you say \\"Wait... What?\\" You wish you had the option to raise your hand and ask for an explanation.A Wild Sheep Chase is a love child of myth and philosophy and there's plenty to decipher along the literary journey from cover to cover. That's what's so nice about it, and it's what makes this book a fantastic one for a book club that's really looking for some grit to grind.The sheep-man is probably my favorite character, though he's undoubtedly the most bizarre and unsettling. He shows up randomly and you're never quite sure if he's real or not. You're never completely positive that the main character hasn't lost his mind. Near the end of the book you're not even completely positive that you haven't lost your own mind. Doesn't that make a darn good book?!Highly recommend this work. ABSOLUTELY."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Just when you think you've read everything, and there's nothing new, here comes Murakami with his delicious books (if you read 'SHEEP CHASE, you'll end up reading them all). Creating the mystery and fun of a detective story with minimalist style, master Murakami reinvents symbolism and the Japanese novel while telling a wondrous story of sheep, a quest through urban to rural Japan, and ghosts. (The ending of this book will haunt you!) Simple details--drinking a beer while raiding the refrigerator, putting on a jazz record, taking a nap--punctuate the action in Haruki Murakami's worlds. Noble and yes, melancholy details--breathe life into this remarkable and quite funny work of a modern literary genius."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Murakami's A Wild Sheep Chase is a detective novel in spare prose, albeit one that often (too often, near end) leaps over the details of the narrator's world in favor of laying that world flat before the reader. One of the joys of Murakami isn't so much his prose style as the manner in which he writes the extraordinary as though it is merely average. In this novel's world, the narrator hardly blinks when he is called up regarding a photograph of some sheep he has used in an advertisement for an insurance company, under threat of the destruction of his small company. Murakami's mystery, of where one of the sheep (with a star on its back) came from and where it is, and where the narrator's old friend the Rat is and why he sent the photograph of the sheep to the narrator, doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you try to map it out (there's one sheep in Japan of a breed that isn't documented anywhere in the world? this sheep makes itself a part of, then takes over, people's consciousness to achieve its [mostly unstated] goals? a powerful figure wants this sheep found?) but works in the scheme of the novel because Murakami presents it with such confidence.Murakami has always struck me as an author who promotes unnecessary fear among his potential readers - this idea that he is writing stories beyond the scope of the average reader. A Wild Sheep Chase, a stand-alone novel that is also the final book of a trilogy about the narrator's friend the Rat, though, makes me wonder (more than usual) why he's an author so often approached hesitantly. This novel encourages reading as a straight detective novel, and until Murakami lets us down at end by revealing how many of the narrator's discoveries were already known - how much of his work could have been circumvented if his \\"employers\\" hadn't been toying with him - the novel doesn't suggest itself as anything more. There are the typical Murakami touches, like an unnamed girlfriend who appears perfectly average until she reveals her ears which she is capable of \\"blocking\\" or \\"unblocking\\" to reduce or increase their effect on others; a \\"sheep professor\\" who locks himself away for years, obsessed by the sheep that briefly used him as its carrier; a \\"sheep man\\" who dresses as a sheep and occasionally visits the narrator and is himself not who he first appears to be; but none of these characters make the novel read like more than an off-kilter detective story with occasional dashes of John Irving.Much of this novel is devoted to the early stages of the narrator's literal wild sheep chase: to his meeting his girlfriend, being called in about the sheep photo he's used in an advertisement, planning the search and then the early, unsuccessful stages of that search. It's not until about a hundred pages from the end that the narrator makes any real progress with the search, and Murakami rushes things once he nears actually finding the star-marked sheep. Even then, the narrator doesn't so much \\"find\\" the sheep as stumble upon it, finding himself a part of some other plan that he himself seems to only halfway understand. It's as if, having used the trope of the detective story to shape A Wild Sheep Chase, Murakami is unable to bring it to closure in fitting fashion; he's reduced to vagueness, to tossing in the off-center elements that he's known for but that here don't contribute anything beyond removing the need for explanation.A Wild Sheep Chase works on its own, but I wonder if reading the previous two novels in the Rat trilogy would have benefited my reading - at least in illuminating elements of the Rat's life (what is that manuscript he sends to the narrator, that is never opened or described?) that aren't explained here. Although the structure falls apart at end, that Murakami bases most of the plot around a recognizable frame makes this a fast read, a surprise given my memories of spending weeks on some of his other books. It's not, though, the best of his that I've read, and had this been my first Murakami I'm not sure I would have bothered seeking out more of his work."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"This is the first Murakami novel I'd read and also one of his earliest. It's nearly fifteen years since I initially encountered the book. While I vaguely remembered the outline of the plot I'd forgotten all the details. It is in the details that the author excels.It's Chandler meets Kafka or maybe Borges. Hard boiled insanity or pulp magic realism. It can be both hilariously funny and deeply moving, often in the same paragraph.

I'd missed that feeling of putting down a book to take it all in, and then hurriedly bring it back to my eyes to immerse myself once again. &quot;A Wild Sheep Chase&quot; is one of these gifts, a wonderfully mystic and fantastical tale set in a time and place nearly all of us can relate to, the modern city. It's true what they say, Murakami speaks to his readers across the continents, his Japan is about as far away from kimono's and tea ceremonies as Texas. We see ourselves and our families in these stories, and we all marvel at how we, and the characters, all adapt to bizarre situations as though they were simply meant to be.

Orhan Pamuk refers to White Sheep Men and Black Sheep Men in his book \\"My Name is Red,\\" who were legendary Medieval marauders from the North who invaded the Middle East.The narrator is a young man who is searching for his friend, nicknamed \\"Rat\\", who has disappeared.

Perhaps, this time, with an author that so many rave about... but, sorry, no. Not this time.I read until the end because I was mildly interested to see how the plot would resolve itself, and because as a literature graduate I felt slightly obligated to make an effort to *get* this book, if only as a means of starting to appreciate surrealism. To me, the ending was a disappointment, as was this whole meet-up with Murakami.Though it must be said that he can convey some quite poetic images and draw interesting observations from everyday life.

Metaphor, mystery, heartbreak, surprise, great writing, I don't know how this could have been more interesting and riveting. I know it was one of his earlier books, and I am (sadly) only now becoming a fan, but it was one of those books you read and can't believe you didn't know about or hadn't read. One of the things I wondered about was how the author wrote in Japanese, it was translated, and yet the poetry of the prose still rang true. I'm going to read Dance, Dance, Dance next, which is sort of the sequel. The author must be the coolest guy ever!"},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"One of the top reviewers for this novel pointed out that in spite of being so bizarre, this novel is \\"fun\\". Fun is right! Now, in the wake of Murakami's latest novel, _1Q84_, it is time to take a look at some of the highlights of an incredibly creative and prodigious mind who has created some of the most oneiric and memorable novels and short stories I have ever read.While it is true that Murakami has been compared to authors like Vonnegut, his true roots can be found in the likes of Dickens, Tolstoy, and other Victorian and late-Victorian authors. Murakami's ability to draw from Japanese history and literature, temper it with a good dose of classic storytelling inspired by popular authors of the 19th and 20th century, throw in a good strong mixture of philosophy and pop culture, and do this all under the umbrella of postmodernism has been a recipe for success, a creative breeding ground, that has given birth to works that are as thoughtful as they are enjoyable to read. It is no wonder, then, that his works have found as much success on bestseller lists as they have in critical journals and post-secondary classrooms._A Wild Sheep Chase_ happens to be my personal introduction to the novels of Murakami, so for me it is completely unforgettable. What impresses me most about this novel after all these years is the influence of American detective novels on Murakami's writing. This is not the only novel of Murakami's in which this influence can be found, but it is, I think, the most thoroughly-developed here. In _A Wild Sheep Chase_, Murakami frequently adopts the tone and many of the elements of hard-boiled detective novels and film noir, but don't expect a classic mystery narrative. There are no easy answers in Murakami, and he is far too clever to lead us into territory where we would expect to find ourselves.While Murakami may often lead us into territory that is unsettling -- even, at times, disturbing -- he does so in a way that does not make us uncomfortable. Consistently in Murakami's work, the surreal becomes real, and this element is intact in _A Wild Sheep Chase_. Readers expecting conventional plot twists and clean resolutions will be disappointed. Readers expecting orthodox science fiction or fantasy should likewise turn back now. Murakami is peerless in his ability to attack the surreal and dreamlike with the pen of a realist, but he will never find himself on Oprah's reading list.If you approach _A Wild Sheep Chase_ with the right frame of mind, it can be one of the most memorable reading experiences you will ever have. Allow yourself to be taken on a search for a sheep that hasn't been seen in years that will lead you on an exploration of Japanese and Western culture and history, leading to a satisfying resolution that you may be least likely to expect. In short, have fun!"},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Made the mistake of starting to read Dance, Dance, Dance before reading this book. This book brings clarity to the plot. It is different. Not a commercial book. Read with an open mind and enjoy the trip."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Japan, 1978; after a brief introduction of our un-named main character and his own description of a casual fling he had with a former classmate that has recently died we are brought forward 8 years to 1978. Now 29 years old and partner in an add agency. A friend had sent him a postcard with an unusual picture in it and asked that the picture be used in something that would be viewed by a lot of people. What our protagonist doesn't know is that captured in the picture is a sheep that isn't supposed to exist in Japan and a very powerful politician/business man is very curious as to the whereabouts of the sheep. With the threat of financial ruin placed over his head, our protagonist sets out with his new girlfriend to locate the sheep...\\"A Wild Sheep Chase\\" is another interesting story by Murakami. This is my third encounter with Murakami, with \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" being my first and \\"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle: A Novel\\" up being the second. When comparing the 3, \\"Kafka\\" stands out as the best with \\"Wind Up\\" bringing up the rear. For those not familiar with Murakami, his books are filled with metaphysical elements, and mythological elements. His characters tend to be very average people caught up in situations that are much larger than they themselves are. The protagonist from \\"A Wild Sheep Chase\\" is no different. He is a very average person who begrudgingly takes on the task for no other reason than he really doesn't have anything else to do.The Good: The characters, even though very average for the most part, are still very interesting. Murakami's writing is full of the main character's internal musings which are as crazy, or more so than your own internal dialogue. The story itself and the character building aspect of it unwind in an interesting and atypical way. There are lots of metaphysical and mythological aspects that add to the Japanese flavor of this book which is one of the things that I enjoy about Murakami.The Bad: Nothing memorable for me.Overall: Enjoyable book and if you haven't tried Murakami before this may be a good place to start."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"This is not the first time I'm reading this book but the first time I'm reading it after readingDance Dance Dancewhich its sequel is.I enjoyed it much better this time, finish reading after intensive 4 hours.A Lonely 29 old guy meet lonely weird girl with ultra power ears. They enjoy chain-smoking and casual sex. A photograph of the wild sheep has appeared accidentally in a newsletter the guy had published. He is asked by a business man with plan face to go out on a quest to find the sheep. This is a mystery story with a long chase. On the way we meet interesting characters. One is called the Sheep Professor, another Rat, a rather nice fellow despite his name.The story is both realistic and fantastic. It is humorous and surreal, and at the same time reflects loneliness, and longing for love.I'm reading Murakami's books on the wrong order... if you think of reading this, you might consider reading 'Pinball, 1973' andHear the Wind Singfirst. 'The Wild Sheep Chase' is the sequel to Pinball, and is the third book in Murakami's \\"Trilogy of the Rat\\". Both 'Pinball' and 'Hear the Wind Sing' are out of print in the US and are available online for free."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"The first book I read by Murakami,(South of the Border, West of the Sun) I hated. The second, (Kafka on the Shore) I had mixed feelings about. The third, I loved -- this was the third. A Wild Sheep chase is in my opinion a great place to start if one has never read Murakami before. It is easily accessible, intriguing, and interesting, while still being thought-provoking. The fact is, you can read this book on vacation for fun and you can also spend half a year exploring all of the allegorical possibilities.The general academic consensus is that this book explores the search for the identity of Japan in a postmodern world. There are several different interpretations, however -- see Dances With Sheep: The Quest for Identity in the Fiction of Murakami Haruki (Stretcher)It's important to note that this book is the third book of Murakami's Trilogy of the Rat (although the first two are out of print because Murakami considers the fledgling novels weak) and there is also something of a sequel (Dance, Dance, Dance -- also recommended but very different)."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"I kept thinking of the odd characters that appear in David Lynch movies as I read this book--those ones that play peripheral parts we don't know too much history of, but filled with eccentricities and some type of magick. This book is a romp through such a landscape--odd people with odd behaviours, all tinged with some tragedy or sadness. We have a girl who looks plain until she shows off her ears and then she becomes stunning. A man who dresses as a sheep and talks in unbroken slurs. A best friend who disappears 5 years ago and communicates strange favors by mail without disclosing where he is. It is all strange and mysterious, and in fact, the story reads like a Western detective story told first-hand. If you are looking for a good storyline, Murakami is probably not your author as much of the enjoyment of the book is in the absurd. However, if you are interested in modern Japanese literature, this has a very Western feel to it and cultural differences will not affect the enjoyment or understanding of it."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Uhm. Yea. I can honestly say this is the most original novel I have ever read. The hunt for the evil sheep with a star on its back...No one but Murakami would think of something quite this insane. Which isn't to say to book is bad. It's manic and rarely makes sense, yes, but it *works*.This is my second Murakami book, the first being Wind-up Bird, which I loved. Compared to Wind-up Bird, though, A Wild Sheep Chase comes off more like a short story than an independant novel. It is not any where near as spawling or epic as Wind-up, nor is the plot as deep, or the characters as rich. But inpsite of this, I still really liked A Wild Sheep Chase. No, there were not any profound themes, and my view of the world has not really changed. But man, was that one enjoyable read... Great, but shallow, story. Great, but hardly dynamic, character. And, most importantly, GREAT writing. Man I love Murakami..."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Like Pallahniuk or Nick Hornby (his counterparts in America and England respectively), Murakami's first-person narrative has a fast-paced, personal feel. The plot unfolds in the same way such an unbelievable tale might be recounted on the stool of an intimate bar. Our hero, a recently divorced 29 year-old advertiser from Tokyo, is forced into A Wild Sheep Hunt based on his connecton to a mysterious photograph; a photograph that on the closest examination reveals a nonexistent breed of sheep. In the course of the novel, Murakami's readership is introduced to a panorama of remarkable characters and bizzare coincidences. We eventually understand that the events we're witnessing are controled by something of an invisble hand. For the greater part of the novel we are a part of a mystery of the highest form.On the otherhand when the loose ends were quickly tied in the last three or four chapters, I was left with the feeling that the answers were less than satisfactory. There were definately moments riddled with a depth of insight (his thoughts on his ex-wife's slip or the discussion about the reproduction of body cells, come to mind), but on the whole i felt the novel was a bit superfiscial; that it was, to some extent, just an outrageous story. Murakami's inclination towards the abstract metaphor and his quiky descriptions of the visual were ofte inspired but after 350 pages the device was stale. Though the journey was extremely interesting, the destination reached was, for me, hardly worth the exciement.This was the first piece i'd read by Murakami and I look forward to reading other works (especially The Elephant Vanishes), but it won't be tomorrow that i rush out to by one."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Haruki Murakami has the depth of perception of Mishima, the beauty of Kawabata, and the sense of wonder of Abe. This is the story of an ordinary man who has learned to roll with whatever life hurls his way. His wife leaves him - he reasons that she probably never really felt like she belonged to him anyway. His best friend disappears after sending him a picture of a sheep - he's sure his friend will show up again. The sheep turns out to have mysterious mental powers and is trying to take over the world - well, we'll stop him somehow. The beauty of this book is how effortless it all is for Murakami. There are passages of incredible beauty, as well as breathtaking humor, all delivered almost conversationally. I've read this book at least fifty times, and it never grows old. I have thankfully never taken any literature classes - I have, however, read thousands of books in my time - and for my money, Murakami is the best writer walking. Forget about the Lit Crit Voodoo Guru Of The Month - this guy is the real thing!"},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"I am not sure if most of the reviews here are from the authors friends but this book wasn't very good. Maybe there is some meaning or some existential stuff at the end but the end was just plain confusing. I don't want to spoil it if you do want to read it based on other reviews but when I read the conclusion I was thinking \\"What the !@@#$\\". What sucks is it builds up a big mystery and then goes off on the most incredible useless tangent I can think of. Maybe I just don't understand it but if you are looking for something to read that doesn't require a degree in philosophy then I don't recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"I didn't think this was as good as the other two Murakami books I've read (1Q84 and Kafka on the Shore), perhaps because it is an early work of Murakami's and he hadn't developed his combination of fantasy and realism that made those other books so intriguing. The first part of the book was not very interesting and didn't seem to tie in very well with the main plot involving the sheep. I didn't get the ending--I'm feeling maybe I'll reread the book and see if I missed something."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"I've read very little of Murakami's work before but the book I've read was very good. Additionally I've heard great things about 1Q84. I won't say that the hype left me disappointed with Wild Sheep Chase, just that it didn't prepare me for the kind of book it is. I try to not be a person who constantly sees subtext to stories but in this book I think that all there is is subtext. In that vein, while I'm reviewing it after a single reading, I feel like a person may wan to read this multiple times before being truly done with it.Wild Sheep Chase is extremely quick to read and has a pleasant conversation tone that made me want to just burn through it looking for the plot. Early on I noticed some oddities though. The narrator is very flippant about recording any detail other than conversations or extremely random, inconsequential seeming notes. Also, we don't learn anyone's name.The story progresses from the mundane to the inane but under guidance. We learn of the protagonist's quest and his resistance to it. Eventually he does undertake it with the occasional, obvious authorial nudge in the form of the girlfriend. It seems that the entire story is behind the curtains though. The sheep may be symbolic but I suspect it is simply a MacGuffin to allow us to see the rest of the story. Instead, I think this story is the author's own exploration of his feelings on early-mid-life and all that has passed before. A great deal is said about the places and people that are important to us as children. Nothing is said about the future.I can't give this book a flat yes/no recommendation. I can say that if you're ok with a book that is more subtext than content, this will probably be a good choice for you. If you want action, adventure and resolution, you'll do better elsewhere."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Murakami has a way with short stories that continues to astound me. He can take something as mundane as cooking spaghetti or having a loveless affair and turn it into something equal parts magical and sad. For that same reason, the first few chapters of A Wild Sheep Chase are all amazing. Murakami takes those same small things and does the same magic on them, and for maybe a quarter of its length the novel works as an interconnected series of short stories. It's only once the plot gets going that things turn bad. A detective story becomes a meditation on life in Japan becomes &lt;spoiler>a hastily finished ending in which everything was all a lie with no clear reason as to why&lt;/spoiler> becomes whatever. It's as if the novel were trying to subvert its own greatness, which is a huge disappointment given the beginning. Only Murakami can take a whale penis and make it so achingly meaningful.A note on the translation (cause the translator is 100% as important as the author cause what you read in translation is never more than their interpretation of the original novel): supposedly Birnbaum's translation adds a level of comedy to what was written in a much more serious manner. I find this odd, because one of the most likeable things about Murakami is his humor. Is it even his? I'd really like to read the book as something more serious, because the novel sure takes itself very seriously.A note on the audiobook (cause audiobooks can completely change the way you interpret things): Rupert Degas seems like the perfect voice for Murakami's hard-boiled work. He sounds like a bored detective hiding behind a lack of emotion. I only listened to portions on audiobook, but I'd recommend the recording."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Murakami's gift is a powerful imagination to conceive magical surrealism and crackerjack observations out of our daily drab ordinary reality"},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"I was driving down to London with some friends in 2009. That was the first time I heard about Haruki Murakami. I read this book and I got hooked. Ernest Hemingway, wrote novels using the simplest prose and simplest words available and yet excelled. Haruki Murakami excels in many ways in this regard.A girl with the most beautiful ears, a sheep professor ... combinations of events that are comical and seemed so impossible to connect, yet he manages to tie everything together, delivering powerful imagery that you are left looking at the tumbling landscape of Japan on the turning pages, as if words have taken to roots and green leaves, even when you've never been to Japan. A simple coffee shop or just the way a beer is uncorked and then downed, you experience every moment.This was a fun read and definitely goes down as one of my classics for inspirational writing."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Murakami has a special talent for making the urbane captivating and for inducing a sedation of contention in the reader merely by keeping his sentences short, his adjectives to a minimum and the vocabulary minimalist. It's all deceptively simple but the metallic scaffolding of the novel resonates with skilled observation and tactful narration.Most dialogue is short and to the point whereas most novels are full of verbose yet languid conversations which say very little. Murakami is the opposite of this- a little said says it all. It's an entire atmosphere he manages to piece together with simplicity, an whole chapter can be summarized by the five-word ending which emphasizes the urbane nature of daily life: \\"We actually did see a double feature.\\" \\"The rain kept falling until midnight. \\"Time was surely passing.\\"Once you're enveloped in the glow of the artistic minimalism of the prose, the gears shift a bit. There are two congruent chapters (Chapter 17 and 18) full of lengthy dialogue that runs counterintuitive to the rest of the novel. It's so out of place in the novel that it annoying sticks in your mind while you're trying to enjoy some of the more innocuous things in the novel like a shopping list, a farting cat or the consumption of beer. I found it terribly distracting.Nearing the end, time began to be counted off by the days and by bottles of brandy. The sheep chase was obviously coming to a close but it was also tapering off into boredom as the adventure was pretty much as its end. The conclusion had be shrugging my shoulders, admitting to myself that I didn't understand it but I'm sure I just missed something. The fantasy elements included in the unraveling plot also had be shrugging and hoping that the novel could be based more so on the intricate details of daily life, an observational novel of the mundane. This novel almost breaches this sub-genre but goes off on its own tangent.Wild Sheep Chase had a good thing going before Chapters 17 and 18 and it also had a great run between 19 and 32. I give it great marks for making me smile, laugh and for leaving me in awe at the clever simplicity."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Freakishly Delightful!

The characters you already know. Their names? Not important. What begins as an unusual approach suddenly blends into an excellent perspective; often readers are given useless information, proper nouns and meaningless labels with the intent of sculpting meaning and setting. Instead, Murakami concentrates on the seemingly trivial: names of whiskeys, types of cigarettes, a perfectly shaped ear, an unusual sheep, even stranger people... all wrapped in a wild dream. Just like a dream, selective attention plays a large part. For in the inevitable awakening, one only remembers a few things of dreams, yet with above average lucidity. That is exactly how this novel should be read, as a dream."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"this is one of those strange books where it's easier to keep reading than it is to put it down, though you're not quite sure which you would rather do. i finished it in about four days which is fast for me but i definitely preferred norwegian wood to this, i think because the characters had more depth and less time was spent in the fantastic realm. i rate it pg for pretty good."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"I never would have thought that so much could be built from such a simple premise, but Haruki Murakami manages to wrap a small woolen mammal into something much larger: a conspiracy that draws together powerful forces and interesting personalities as our protagonist is sent (somewhat against his will) on a wild sheep chase. The title is perfect: this is a book about a quest to find a sheep: both literally, figuratively and spiritually.The plot can be confusing (and even somewhat boring in the first part of the book), but it pulls together nicely at the end. The real enjoyment, however, comes from the descriptive qualities of Haruki Murakami's writing. He is able to capture an immense quantity of personality and flavor in even the most off-hand observations. This technique was so successful in capturing my attention as a reader, that any other minor shortcomings are easily overlooked. In fact, I finished the book happily thinking &quot;wow, what a great book!&quot; and could only really criticize pieces upon reflection.Combined with the plot (yes, somewhat confusing) and the characters (which seem flat on the surface, but are very &quot;real&quot; and likable), this descriptive quality made A Wild Sheep Chase a real joy to read."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"This is the 4th book by Murakami I've read (which include: Wind-up Bird Chronicle, South of the Border, West of the Sun, and The Elephant Vanishes.) and it has to be my favourite. The characters appealed to me more so than in his other books and the story felt more real to me, even though it is the most unrealistic tale yet. I also found that the story itself flowed better than his other books, but the reason behind this I'm not sure. It might be due to the text being translated by Alfred Birnbaum and not Jay Rubin, or it might just be the case that this book appealed to me the most.

Although it seems like a fantasy story, I believe that this book and author call out to those of my generation (I am 23), coming of age in a world that is apathetic and too full of choice.Although I have not read the English edition, from my experience Birnbaum is an excellent translator able to capture the feeling of the original text."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"Murakami's novel provides a elegy to the mystery writers that inspired him (especially Chandler), the American jazz and cigarettes that fueled his passion, and a delicate sense of a novelist's balance while mixing mystery, science fiction and passion. It is, as the daughter of a friend who read the book told me, a very strange little book.Through the lead character, Murakami develops a sense of presence with the reader that is both distant and intimate, incisively cool and restrained and yet warmly intimate. Clear a landmark novel, the work is exceptionally well translated.No devote reader of the modern novel should miss this book."},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","review":"This is Murakami's first novel in that &quot;Pinball 1973&quot; and &quot;Hear the Wind Sing&quot; are more mini-novels that preface this work. And as such, this is a debut of startling originality, ease of language and namely, vivid allegory. At the centerpiece of this sepertine novel lies the sheep. The philosophy of &quot;sheeplessness&quot; is so inspired and layered, not only is it the crux of this entertaining novel, it is also the foundation of a much broader understanding of contemporary Japanese society. Echoing a theme found in much of his work, the advance of technology over the humane strikes a sharp chord in this work and contributes largely to the understated melancholy that permeates the work. The novel, and it's successor &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot; are rich, allegorical works that offer up hints of rebirth and renewal in modern society. Needless to say, the novel is highly entertaining, humorous and wonderfully written. But below the surface, like so much of Murakami's work, lies a deeper message. This book unfolds upon many subsequent readings and although there are no easy answers, the wording never deadens and the characters live on in infinite space.

I realize this is probably the Japanese version of magical realism, but for some reason it was a tedious read.

One day he got a letter and a picture of sheep from his old friend and used that picture on a publication. After a couple of month, a man in a black suit came to his office and told him that one of sheep in that picture was special. Moreover, he threatened him to find the sheep giving money and saying if the main character cannot find that sheep, the man in a black suit will prevent the main character get back to the society by all means. The main character was reluctant to begin with looking for the sheep, but his girlfriend whose ears are mysteriously attractive pushed him to a chase of wild sheep...This is a slow and not-very-dynamic detective story unlike Hollywood movies. However, there is quite detailed description of surroundings and the character's feeling. Finally, the case develops in an unexpected way; surprising not-typical ending as a mystery. A Wild Sheep Chase has some confusing parts. Even though I tried to be patient and wait to solve unclear parts, I didn't understand those parts well. That difficulty to understand might caused by the very detailed description and explanation which sometimes sound like digression that don't relate to the part of chasing the sheep itself. For example, strangely enough to me, there is a great amount of explanation of the main character's sex life and his interest in ears. Unfortunately, I am not able to quite understand the purpose of this story. Perhaps, it is to describe the humor of eccentricity of people or the humor of contradiction of people's behavior or just for simple entertainment? I hope you will figure it out by yourself. This is a detective story, so you might think you have to read quite carefully to solve the mystery. However, some of the details are not directly linked to the main incident apparently. Those parts sound funny create this novel's unique style, which some people love. On the other hand, some people may get frustrated by this style. I was surprised and disappointed with the way to how to end because the presence of spiritual things gets much bigger at the end of mystery. Therefore, you should not expect logical completeness in this novel, which you might expect when you read typical detective stories like Sherlock Homes. I also felt disappointed because many parts that sounded important remained unclear and seemed scattered without any connection. Finally, I recommend this book to people who have time and who are patient. I hope you can enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Theoretical Aerodynamics, 4th Edition","review":"I am an aeronautical engineering graduate and have been working in the aviation industry for over 20 years after graduation.

Historical writing is the most original genre in classical and medieval Armenian literature. Greek works (including the Chronicle of Eusebius, now lost in Greek but preserved in Armenian) constituted the major part of translated histories. But in the thirteenth century the extensice Chronicle of the Syrian Patriarch Michael and the first part of the Georgian chronicles were adapted for an Armenian readership. The collection known as the 'Georgian Chronicles' was finally codified in the eighteenth century and represents only a small part of Georgian historical writing. The thirteenth century Armenian version is in fact the earliest attestation of this growing corpus of texts, predating all extant Georgian manuscripts of it. This book presents the two texts, Georgian and Armenian, in English translation for the first time. The Introduction and Commentary draw attention to the ways in which the unknown Armenian translator changed his original material in a pro-Armenian fashion. His rendering became the standard source for early Georgian history used by later Armenian historians. The book includes a useful overview of the background to the chronicles, the history and culture of Christian Georgia and Armenia, and their respective languages and literature."},{"Title":"Rewriting Caucasian History: The Medieval Armenian Adaptation of the Georgian Chronicles: The Original Georgian Texts and the Armenian Adaptation (Oxford Oriental Monographs)","review":"I am a Georgian living in the US and I am quite offended by the ignorance of Georgian history portrayed by the reader from Germany.

I am German and in our schools we read many history books, and none of them have claimed the Georgians to have existed before the armenians, it was the opposite, considering the fact that the #1 comes before #2, logic implies that Ur/Armenos/Hayasa, as this is what they were called in the BC timespan existed and the Georgians didnt, the Armenians had a language, but the Georgians didnt even exist yet. as it is writen by not only Greek and Roman historians but of Original Arabic decent historians from that time period, whose books were not burned and distroyed, they were preserved in their countries.The Armenian language has been studied by anthropoligists, historians, lingists, and other academic scholars from Germany, England, America, and so on... however the Georgian language is one that they adapted FROM the Armenians...This book would be in the same category to a book about how Hitler was actually attacked by the Jews and not the opposite... does that make sence? no it does not... therefore this book is untrue, it is a falsity, and it is a discrace that someone took the time to attempt to discredit the entire world...Please read books by French historians, American anthropoligists, and German Linguists, from all of the different views you will only come up with one conclusion, they all state that the Armenians and their language are one of the oldest and purest languages and culture (unmixed and unadapted from others)Please dont be swayed by some minority of people's who attempt on a daily basis to distort the history of the entire European and American countries.I say to the person who wrote this book, how about try your attempts on the Greeks. say that the Greeks adapted your language? wait you cannot since they lived much before you did, but that is the same case with the Armenians, they lived much before you did.

What I liked the most is that the story flows well and it kept me intrigued. The characters and story line are developed with just enough clarity that personalities or the plot didn't get foggy with excess detail. I was taken in by the main character, his sense of humor and approach to solving the crime, and all the ways he showed he cared about his family and friends. The end was good, because even though I tried to guess along the way what really happened, I wasn't even close."},{"Title":"Splendor Bay","review":"What a fun book! As an avid reader of mysteries and legal thrillers, I was delighted to find such a talented new author. L. B. Cobb writes with just the right mix of mystery, humor, and romance. With a protagonist named Bill Glasscock..., you know you're in for an interesting ride from the very beginning. Bill's a man who left his lucrative job as an attorney to become an aging \\"beach bum\\" after finding his wife in bed with another man. The man just happens to be the governor who turns up dead on the beach - leaving Bill, his family, and friends as prime suspects. The setting could be your small town and the people, your high school buddies. The camaraderie and affection are evident in the good-natured bantering between old friends. Along with the unexpected twists and turns, Splendor Bay is a very entertaining summer read. I'm certainly looking forward to the next release from Ms. Cobb!"},{"Title":"Splendor Bay","review":"This is Ms Cobb's first novel and is a story about Bill Glasscock, or Fragile Dick to his friends. Bill wakes up at his girlfriend Sally's beach house on Splendor Bay and sees the city cops looking at a body on the beach that has diamond studs in his shirt. Bill being the good ex attorney and private investigator decides to wander down to the beach to find out the details of the John Doe that has appeared on his girlfriend's beach. Come to find out it is the Governor of the state, and said Governor is his ex or soon to be ex wife's boyfriend. His girlfriend also seems to be missing and Bill takes you on the search to find who did this to the Governor, because all fingers are pointing at him.The dialogue in this book is very witty and I think it reminds me of the Robert B Parker Spenser series because of the sarcasm. I found it to be a very good, easy and fast book to read. Very likeable characters that you begin to really care about. A bit of a love story about how even though you have an ex wife, is she ever forgotten? Do you just stop loving her because you have found her in bed with the Governor? Do you stop loving the girlfriend because the ex wife that has just lost her boyfriend and tells you she still loves you? There is also your son of sixteen years to consider. Bill has been a bit of a bum for a while and what effect is that having on him. Should Bill get his act together and try and spend some time with Davey, or should he just let his wife worry about that.There are lots of different twists and turns in this book and I found them delightful. I liked the interactions between Bill, his friends and extended family. I liked the fact of him being an ex-attorney on suspension and the dilemma about what he was going to do with the rest of his life. I would like to see this become a series, but my understanding is that she is in the in the process of having another novel published with new people. I for one will have to have a look at it."},{"Title":"Splendor Bay","review":"Eat your heart out, New York. Or, more specifically, all you New York publishers. You've let another rising star slip through your fingers, this time to be published by a small press from the Lone Star state. The Advance Books Company of Texas may not be a big name player in the book business, but with the release of L. B. Cobb's Splendor Bay, they showed the publishing world that they recognize true talent when they see it.And talent would be L. B.'s middle name if she didn't already have one in the form of an initial. This is one savvy lady who not only knows how to plot an intriguing mystery but also knows how to people that mystery with remarkably complicated yet true-to-life characters. The fact that she does this so skillfully belies Cobb's standing as a first-time author and makes this book a pleasure to read.Splendor Bay's story line might be considered trite if handled less deftly: jilted husband finds body of wife's lover outside his home, becomes prime suspect in the murder, then escapes arrest by deducing the identity of the killer. An age-old theme of mystery novels, but in Splendor Bay, the commonplace becomes extraordinary due to the identities and emotional intensity of the characters.Bill Glasscock is not your everyday high-priced lawyer. Instead, he's a man who walks away from his job in the middle of a trial -- thus earning himself a suspension from the bar -- after discovering his wife in bed with the governor of the state. But it's not only his job that Bill abandons. He shakes off an entire way of life, reverting to a beach-bum existence that includes shacking up with his wife's cousin, the beautiful state's attorney general, Sally Solana.Likewise, Eleana Glasscock is no ordinary housewife bent on a fling with a political celebrity. She's a woman whose position as head of the state archives provides her with ample opportunity to mingle with the local power brokers. Her involvement with Gov. Wallace Moreno is due more to loneliness than love, her husband being too busy getting rich to pay her much attention.Toss in Bill and Eleana's teenage son, Davy, an insulin-dependent diabetic who's torn between both parents, and you have the makings of a family in turmoil where forgiveness and healing seem almost impossible. But murder has a strange way of drawing people together. In Splendor Bay, the need to protect Eleana and Davy drives Bill to reexamine his relationships with both family members and friends. Most difficult of all, he's forced to take a long, hard look at himself. His quest for self-discovery becomes as arduous as his hunt for the governor's killer.It's rare for a writer to be able to imagine, much less clearly convey, the emotions of both sexes. Earning the simultaneous sympathy of the reader for differing characters is even more difficult. Cobb, though, accomplishes both of these things in Splendor Bay, and she does so in a way that is neither maudlin nor contrived. Instead, she uses crisp dialogue and cleanly written prose to portray the torment of love gone astray and the soul-searching task of personal recovery. What makes Cobb's feat even more remarkable is that it's accomplished in the context of a murder mystery. Make no mistake; Splendor Bay is a fast paced suspense story sure to appeal to lovers of the genre. But it's a mystery of the heart as well, and as that, it succeeds where many other novels fail.L.C. Cobb is one helluva writer. Thank goodness she chose to shine her light in the field of mystery!"},{"Title":"Splendor Bay","review":"One glorious morning, Bill Glasscock, aka Fragile Dick, awakens with a glorious hangover. He's at his girl friend's house. She's gone and when he looks out the window, he sees a body in the surf that just happens to be that of Governor Wallace Moreno, his soon-to-be-ex-wife's new boyfriend. It's not long before the cops decide Bill did it in a fit of jealousy. From there, the plot catpults with intrigue, quirky characters, conflicted relationships and wry, wry humor. Did I mention the humor? This writer is a fantastic new voice in this genre that will have Kinky Friendman, Carl Hiassen and Robert Crais looking to their laurels. Keep up the good work, LB. I can hardly wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Splendor Bay","review":"Show me the way back to the sea...In the ocean of life, Bill Glasscock finds himself tossed into the waves of crime in Sleepy Splendor Bay. A by-the-sea town with sparkling turquoise water, where cutesy-touristy restaurants serve homemade biscuits and gravy or a slice of strudel amidst glorious scenery.On a day when the cornflower-blue sky looks down on the hulls of old boats and waves that lazily lap at the sand in a never ending cycle, something washes up on the beach covered with seaweed and spoils the view.Bill is on a vacation from real life, playing out his fantasy as a part-time detective and part time knight in shining armor. He is on a journey to discover the true beauty of life while his own personal pain and loss seems to surround him. The turmoil of his own soul leads him down a path where he tries to drown the pain by drinking his life away.As Bill says: \\"Things happen. Sometimes you have to ride the wave.\\"He is a victim of circumstance, having taken his focus off his life for what seemed like moments, only to return to find his wife seeking solace in the arms of another. Now he finds his wife's love interest, Governor Wallace Moreno, in the arms of the sea, tossed onto the beach as casually as he feels he was tossed aside by his soon-to-be-ex-wife Eleana, a government official.State attorney Sally Solana has sought to rehabilitate him back to his former existence as an attorney after he was suspended for malpractice. When his wife and Sally disappear after the Moreno murder, he steps up to the challenge, all the while having to avoid becoming a suspect and therefore being detained.L.B. Cobb's writing style takes full advantage of verisimilitude in a similar way many of W. Somerset Maugham's stories evoke a sense of confidence in the reader. She also uses those little twists and turns that keep you questioning and her chapter endings plunge you into the next page with a sense of undeniable curiosity.The character development bonds the reader to the characters with heart-felt emotions and moral ambiguities, making them memorable and human.\\"I heard the agony in her voice as the stainless blade of betrayal sliced into her heart. I closed my eyes and saw the crimson drops of heart pain, hers and mine. I said nothing. What could I say? That, in a moment of selfish, hurting need, I had betrayed her? That I felt her pain along with my own? That once I had pledged my love ... there wasn't any left for another? pg. 111There are many moments of beauty and you will really start to love Bill for his thoughts. Be they the thoughts of a man in love or the conflicting thoughts he faces in trying to solve the mystery of his life. Or the humorous, laugh-out-loud contemplation of one witty guy who is trying not to take life too seriously, while learning life can be one serious game when those you love are in peril.An expertly crafted mystery with a touch of sensual intrigue. Splendor bay will leave you amazed by the poetic justice of it all. The best mystery I've read, bar none. Told from a male perspective and sure to be loved by both sexes.Summer reading at its best!Also look for: ISBN 0970622406Old Fashioned Recipes for Modern Cooks by L.B.

They need to keep most of the old data, so I wouldn't take off points for that. You can see the publisher's review for all of the new features: I noticed that the Historic Preservation chapter has been shortened a bit.Potentially, the biggest addition is the CD-ROM, which has CAD files ready to use, and includes pretty much everything from the book. You might think that you are getting all that for the cost of the book, but...no. The &quot;demo&quot; CD comes in a sleeve inside the back cover, and is noted: &quot;Full functionality, Limited data.&quot; You can access a drawing of a bar joist, for example. It exports a DWG or DXF file with layers based on line weights. The interface is pretty clear; you don't have to read any instructions to start using it. The CD actually has all of the data, but you have to pay another $425 online to &quot;unlock&quot; it. That could be a bargain, but I suspect that most firms will feel that their own detail library is more applicable to the work they do. Still, $425 represents less than a day's worth of billable hours.Every architect knows the value of this book, and most every architecture firm (in the U.S. anyway) will want at least one copy just to stay current, and because the old one is getting worn out. You might as well get it now, and decide on the CD-ROM later. I'd love to have a special edition set with each page ever published in all of the AGS books, or even just the last 3 or 4. I'd give that 6 stars."},{"Title":"Architectural graphic standards for architects, engineers, decorators, builders, and draftsmen","review":"Once again the editors of Graphic Standards have promised a useful reference for architects, and have fallen way short. In architecture school (1972), I purchased the sixth edition and found it better than most reference books for students of architecture. However, even then I noticed many sections of questionable value. Pages and pages of dimensions of designer furniture and kitchenware fall into this category.Recently, after practicing architecture for 20 years, I was suckered back by publisher Wiley's siren song of how the new tenth edition is new, informative, refreshing, up to date, etc. Fooled again. Sure, the Graphic Standards is a fair source of information, but I question the editors' judgement as to what is worth publishing between the wonderfully bound front and rear cover. For example, look up &quot;R-value&quot; in the index and you are directed to 55 words on page 486 how R-value relates to windows and that it's the inverse of U-values. Nothing on the R-value of all exterior skin construction materials or how the R-value relates poorly to thermal massing materials. These things should be very important to architects and are disappointingly absent from the Graphic Standards. However, if you ever need to know what a Zamboni looks like, or need to know the dimensions required for a rodeo barrel race, this is your book! Want an entire page showing ten pieces of gymnastics equipment (pg. 777) or how to draw an ellipse using pen or pencil (pg.999)? Seek no more. Twenty four pages of kitchen utensils and garden tools are still there. This is the best place to find loads of pages of barely useful information of dubious worth.Once the editors of Graphic Standards discover that a meaningful discussion on R-values in building materials deserves more space than the dimensions of a belt sander, then I might reconsider purchasing a later edition, but I won't hold my breath. Oh, one more thing, for you architects out there working on a Macintosh platform, the accompanying CD-ROM is useless."},{"Title":"Architectural graphic standards for architects, engineers, decorators, builders, and draftsmen","review":"A good reference book but of limited use, Its tables of materials is quit limited, especially sections dealing with steel,wood and concrete structural properties.

As many of you know, the work done in arch. school is very design/idea based, and not necessarily rooted in a feasible final product. However, I strived to include as many true-to-life elements in my design, and this book got it done for me. Many standards and sizes, etc. that had my classmates scrambling around on the internet or looking through dozens of books to find were easily found in the index of this book. It eventually became a class resource for a couple semesters until people bought their own.As a professional, many people's firms have a specialty or three. For instance, I work for a healthcare firm at the moment. However, as a student, you can run the whole gamut of different building types. Despite how far-out some of my designs were, the fact that they were rooted in current, workable building methods and systems that were detailed out helped me immensely when applying for jobs. Knowing the details and showing them in your design is not only good for your reputation, but good for ability as an architect.I'd recommend this to many arch students if the price is right for you. I happened upon it at a time with the book (no CD) was around $80 or $90.

Although I disagreed with the late Dr. Kofsky about the fundamental potential of the species H. sapiens (and thus remained a political opposite, far, far to his right), as his student I continue to marvel at his research a decade after his untimely death. I must concede that it has sadly gone to waste a bit in the text of this book--though good, it's not at all special in the company of its peers. I must also agree that its tendency toward Marxist religious banter (which must inherently replace logical conclusions in Marxist writing) reduces its academic value per se; none the less I still find it beautiful in its architecture. I can only hope that the breadth of his life's work fell intact into the hands of his graduate assistant, who took over instruction in his last days as a professor in Sacramento. Whether it has or not, this book is well worth considering, especially to a student designing his or her own research. Its annotations and bibliography promise an excruciatingly well investigated line of departure for any intended work on the period, right, left, or simply rational.

Truman and the War Scare of 1948: A Successful Campaign to Deceive the Nation","review":"The best recommendation a book like this can get is a one star pan from an indoctrinated tool of corporate imperialism like the one below."},{"Title":"Harry S. Truman and the War Scare of 1948: A Successful Campaign to Deceive the Nation","review":"This has to be the stupidest book I've ever read. It is so completely infantile, it could only have been written by a leftist academic. I am very glad I got this out of the library instead of paying for it."},{"Title":"Inventing our Selves: Psychology, Power, and Personhood (Cambridge Studies in the History of Psychology)","review":"For those who are interested in Foucault's concept of \\"governmentality,\\" and for those who are uncomfortable with liberal humanism's triumphal celebration of \\"freedom,\\" please check out this book. If there is one question Rose wants to answer in this book, it seems to me to be the following: how can social control take place in our contemporary world, where we are thought of as autonomous subjects? Rose suggests that \\"freedom\\" has not, in fact, triumphed over \\"coercion\\" and \\"discipline\\" in our contemporary age - rather, he argues that discourses on freedom and individual autonomy set up the conditions in which bodies can be territorialized and controlled in new ways. He argues toward this conclusion not through an analysis of state disciplinary practices or \\"pastoral power\\" (as Foucault did), but rather through an analysis of the \\"psy\\" disciplines, which include psychology, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, etc.Rose writes in a clear and straightforward manner - his text is relatively free of the type of jargon and self-indulgent prose one typically finds in \\"critical theory\\" texts. I found the book very accessible, and read it quickly.My research intersects with exactly these types of questions and problems, so I absolutely loved this book. In fact, upon completion I immediately ordered another of his texts."},{"Title":"Inventing our Selves: Psychology, Power, and Personhood (Cambridge Studies in the History of Psychology)","review":"Nikolas Rose has got to be one of today's top sociologists. This book which compiles some of his work up to the mid 1990s is testament to the novelty and thoroughness of his research and is definitely an enjoyable read for anyone interested in Foucauldian thought and scholarship. Cutting across conventional histories and representations of the field of psychology and its relationship to power and the social, Rose argues the contemporary significance of psychology lies in its relationship to the question of government in modern society. This book is a fabulous complement to his other books, Powers of Freedom and Governing the Soul, and his array of articles."},{"Title":"Inventing our Selves: Psychology, Power, and Personhood (Cambridge Studies in the History of Psychology)","review":"Nikolas Rose writes a powerful and thought provoking work that radically alters how the work of the &quot;mental health&quot; professional can be understood, detailing its critical relevance for each of us."},{"Title":"Maximum Velocity","review":"Hats off to Bruce Jones! This book is one of the best thillers I have ever read. Lots of action, never knowing what is going to happen next. The characters were very strong. Chris will stop at nothing to save his family, Frank is so determined to get Matty, that his bizarre tatics will keep you amazed. I simply could not put this book down. Great ending, with a surprise twist."},{"Title":"Maximum Velocity","review":"Bruce Jones is known for his breathless thrillers, (Game Running, Sprinter, In Deep) but he really outdoes himself on this one. His cinematic style makes the reader feel as if he is being sweep away on a terrifying ride as Chris Neilson, a writer living in the Rockies with his wife and child, struggles desperately to get his life back when Matty's ex, Frank Springer, a notorious psycho with a CIA past, intrudes into the picture, claiming Matty and son as his own.The action sequences are outstanding, without sacrificing the humanity of the characters. I highly recommend this one for anyone who is looking for a thriller with brains."},{"Title":"Maximum Velocity","review":"I don't usually read this kind of book, but it was recommended to me, and to tell the truth, I found it riveting the same way &quot;Vertigo&quot; was riveting. From a web of lies Jones has constructed an intricate and subtle plot, believable yet larger than life characters, and a hero, Chris Neilson, who can actually rival the villian in brains and courage.The kidnapping of Chris' son and wife and the compromise he works out when no one believes him is sheer inspiration, and the thrills come a mile a minute. I think women will love this book just as much as men, and I can hardly wait for the movie. Let's hope Jones doesn't let Hollywood water this one down."},{"Title":"Maximum Velocity","review":"This writer may not know firearms, but he sure knows a hell of a lot about suspense! From the time the villian, Frank Springer, showed up on hero Chris Nielson's doorstep, my heart was in my mouth! Jones draws fantastic villians (see GAME RUNNING) and his chase sequences rival the best. He also gets into the heart of his protagonist, and it is a big heart. Matty, Chris' wife, is as complex a female character I've read in a long time. I read this book in one sitting, unable to put it down--no one writes thrillers like Bruce Jones! To quote Truman Capote, everything else is just typing."},{"Title":"Maximum Velocity","review":"This is one of the most implausible, poorly researched books of this sort I have read. Skeet &quot;rifles&quot;? Quail hunting in Rockies? If you have even a passing familiarity with weapons, hunting, or geography, I suggest you pass on this one. It appears the author did little, if any, research, and just assumed the reader would would share his naivete. Even if you can tolerate a fair amount of fact-stretching, by the end of this novel you will think the author's dramatic license should be revoked. This author needs to do more research, and/or a better editor."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],q={key:0},B={key:1};function E(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",H,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",B,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",q,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const j=u(M,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-1795726e"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/31.md","filePath":"glossary/31.md"}'),P={name:"glossary/31.md"},z=Object.assign(P,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{D as __pageData,z as default};
