I know because we've been reading it to both in my family since it was a new book. I have many fond memories of my mom, my dad or me reading it to my brother when he was a little guy who wanted to take everything he owned with him on visits to our grandparents. My mom is a kindgarten teacher who uses the book in her classroom as well. Yesterday afternoon I got out the same copy of the book to read to my three-year-old. She loved it! In fact we've read it five times in 24 hours. The book's gentle pace and vivid watercolors with lots of details are charming. The pictures are full of details to notice and enjoy. Today, for instance, we noticed that Sam Cat, the family's gray cat, comes along for the whole trip. This is a book that holds up well to multiple readings (an important consideration for parents) and celebrates the excitement and love that should fill a roadtrip to Grandma's house. The book is dated perhap by the Grandmother's stereotypical appearance as noted in the description of the book but more noticably is that the little girl is only wearing a lap belt and isn't in a booster seat (a reflection of the safety norms of 1987). Those two things do nothing to take away from this sweet, fun, energetic and gentle book."},{"Title":"How Could God Allow Suffering and Evil?

Abundant colorful images whet the reader's decorating appetite while presenting examples of a number of styles of chandeliers.Were this the book's intended purpose it would be highly recommended. The authors, however, purport to provide an authoritative guide, and here Chandeliers falls short. Missing almost entirely is a discussion of historical designs, antiques, and the styling of formal and grand chandeliers. The authors' clear preference for the whimsical and casual decorative idiom skews the content of this lovely book and ultimately limits its usefulness."},{"Title":"Chandeliers","review":"The history of the Chandelier covers many years, including several eras in history. Taking that into consideration, this book only covers a very small amount of what is a huge amount of history. For those of you wanting a detailed history of the chandelier it will be disappointing, but for those of you who just want to touch on the subject it should be quite adequate and you will not find better for the price as the selection of chandelier books is so limited. I went into a well known B and N bookstore and asked for a book on Chandeliers and was told they did not have one in stock. Not one. So I am keeping this one for my collection, even though it is not an A+ on my list. It was worth the money.Eileen"},{"Title":"Chandeliers","review":"This is a lovely little book.

Essentially, it is very close the same episode from the movie except without any hint of danger in the background. It's all cheerful and nice.Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather try to make a cake and a dress but they only end up making a mess. That is, until they whip out their wands and make everything right.Now, having said that, we come to the \\"Step into reading\\" part of the book.Level 2 is supposed to be for children in the Preschool to Grade 1 age range. It is defined as \\"For children who recognize familiar words and sound out new words with help\\".Well, in my opinion, they would need a whole lot of help. And the prime reason for this is that the book is written entirely in the past tense. My daughter (5), for example, can read simple primer materials: books such as the \\"Biscuit\\" series, or Margaret Hillert's primers. But she was entirely stymied by the use of past tense.Examples:She lived in the forest...While she was gone, they planned...Briar Rose was returning...(So that she could read live but not lived.)Four Stars. It's a nice book that I would buy again. The simple text makes it a good read-aloud that doesn't take much time. My only concern would be if you were thinking about using \\"Surprise for a Princess\\" as a primer. I would be afraid by the time they could read the text, that the story would be \`beneath' their interest, i.e. their level of sophistication.More text follows so you can judge for yourself:\\"Let's have a party for Briar Rose,\\" said Merryweather.\\"With a cake!\\" said Fauna.\\"And a dress fit for a princess,\\" said Flora.Flora began to make the dress.She cut.

If you've read 'Carry on Jeeves,' there's a lot of overlap here, although the style was polished up a bit later. The second half features Reggie Pepper, Bertie's prototype. His stories are entertaining in their own right, although they can't hold a candle to later Wodehouse. Still, it's interesting to see the evolution."},{"Title":"Enter Jeeves: 15 Early Stories","review":"Before purchasing this book I had only been aquainted with Wodehouse's most famous characters Bertie Wooster and his stalwart man servant, Jeeves; and I must say that it was a pleasant suprise to be introduced to Reggie Pepper. His stories frolic in as much fun as Bertie's and he is a man who can think for himself (althought I do miss the perspicatious Jeeves standing in a corner ever ready to solve all the world's problems). With a mixture of Bertie, Jeeves and Reggie you're sure to have a jolly old time."},{"Title":"Enter Jeeves: 15 Early Stories","review":"Even darling P.G. Wodehouse had said it.

Bertie Wooster on the other hand had been well developed from the get go.Reading the Reggie Pepper stories is a gas.

You can get a lot of these stories for free on Kindle, but there were still several I had never read.This collection of stories includes 8 Bertie Wooster/Jeeves stories, plus 7 Reggie Pepper stories. The seven Reggie Pepper stories constitute the entire series for Reggie Pepper.I read somewhere that Reggie Pepper and his sometime valet Voules were the prototypes for Bertie and Jeeves, but I don't think this is true. Voules is in only one of these stories, and he is not the admirable and clever character that Jeeves is. Reggie Pepper is kind of a cross between Bertie Wooster and Jeeves, in that he schemes like Jeeves and occasionally blunders along like Bertie. Like Bertie, he is comfortably well-off and a member of the British leisure class.Some of the elements in Reggie Pepper do re-appear in the Jeeves stories. Among these are the character of Florence Craye, who appears with the same name (and with a brother Edwin) in both series.The Jeeves stories in this book are:Extricating Young GussieLeave It to JeevesThe Aunt and the SluggardJeeves Takes ChargeJeeves and the Unbidden GuestJeeves and the Hard-boiled EggJeeves and the Chump CyrilJeeves in the SpringtimeThe Reggie Pepper stories are:Absent TreatmentLines and BusinessDisentangling Old DuggieBrother AlfredRallying Round ClarenceConcealed ArtThe Test CaseEnjoy!"},{"Title":"Enter Jeeves: 15 Early Stories","review":"As PG got his feet wet, so did Jeeves....by reading this book, you will see the evolution of Jeeves into that solid character we love so much.

Reggie Pepper is the original Bertie Wooster and his accounts are not as halfwitted and entertaining as the Wooster accounts. All-in-all, the Wodehouse charm engages the reader. This book, however, would not be my recommendation for a reader in the envious position of reading Wodehouse for the first time."},{"Title":"Enter Jeeves: 15 Early Stories","review":"Although only half of the stories feature Jeeves this is still a great book and a hilarious read. If you know of Jeeves and Wooster only through the BBC television series then you owe yourself the opportunity to read the original stories, which many were completely changed when put on TV. I didn't care as much for the \\"Pepper\\" stories, maybe because I was expecting more Wooster, but this is a great book to lounge away an afternoon."},{"Title":"Enter Jeeves: 15 Early Stories","review":"When Wodehouse started writing, he began with periodicals for newspapers. It goes without saying that his well written, clever and very funny tales brought him to prominence and he later went on to write novels, most famously around Bertie Wooster and his \\"man's man\\" Jeeves.It is delightful, then, to read these first early tales. For a true sense, it probably would be better to start with the stories of Reggie Pepper, the precursor of Bertie Wooster, and then read the stories in the first half which revolve around Wooster and Jeeves.Wodehouse has an unmistakeable writing style which makes you feel intimately comfortable with the narrator (Reggie or Bertie) as if they were in the room with you, filling you in on their \\"real life\\" escapades as you sip brandy before a roaring fire. The tales themselves are usually convoluted, usually as a result of the main character being rather idiotic or wimpy enough to not say no to some foolhardy mission of mercy a friend or relative has put them up to. Both characters fit into the \\"nouveau riche\\" category - oodles of money and plenty of time to waste it on...and while most of us will never be in such luxury (or experience such laziness), you cannot help but laugh at the situations they find themselves in. Aside from crafting such believable characters, Wodehouse has a unique way of describing things which will often leave you laughing.I highly recommend this book, especially to those unfamiliar with this great author who want to try him out before delving into his longer Jeeves novels."},{"Title":"Enter Jeeves: 15 Early Stories","review":"Wow!

I kept after it and I really did enjoy the stories.This isn't a novel - it's a collection of stories previously published in periodicals. Don't expect a 'flow' - each story stands alone, as was the intent of the writer in writing for periodicals. The good thing about it is that you can read them story by story and put the book down not wondering what in the world happens next.

Many desire to study the Bible, but few really know how to go about it. They end up relying on the comments of someone else to study the Bible. Torrey shows you how to systematically discover what the Bible teaches on your own. He has a particularly helpful section on studying an entire book. If you desire to know what the Bible teaches for yourself, take heed to this book."},{"Title":"How to Study the Bible","review":"Torrey's little book on Bible study is composed of eight chapters of good, practical suggestions. He organizes the bulk of the material into particular approaches to study, such as topical, biographical, typological, etc.The strongest (and longest) chapter is that on individual book study, chapter 2. It contains a step-by-step how-to methodology to approach a book study. This is where Torrey's little book shines. Most of the other introductory texts on bible study contain principles (\\"observe intimately\\", etc). Torrey just cuts to the chase and serves up a recipe for how to move through a study. It's almost like Robert Traina's old book, Methodical Bible Study, in pamphlet form.In a strange inconsistency, Torrey recommends that the beginner choose 1 Thessalonians for his first study, and specifically cautions against 1 Peter, explaining that it contains some significantly difficult texts. Then Torrey goes ahead and uses 1 Peter as his model for the rest of the chapter.The remainder of Torrey's book is fairly so-so. Chapter 3 deals with topical study, and it's pretty good. By the end of this chapter Torrey has shot his wad; there's not much left. The remaining chapters are all three and four pages long, and are of limited value.Having said that, this is a good little purchase for someone interested in learning how to study their Bible more carefully. I'd read just chapter one and two, and leave the rest. Chapter two alone is worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"How to Study the Bible","review":"This book combined with the hermeneutics class at Covenant Training Institute has significantly increased my ability to understand God's word!"},{"Title":"How to Study the Bible","review":"This is a good basic book on studying the Bible.

In Making Change Stick he defines sticky as the ability to accomplish and sustain change. Reale correctly observes that leaders tend to focus on the technical side of change but typically ignore the human or people side of change. But, change is personal and involves human emotion and commitment. Any process that emphasizes technical skills at the expense of soft skills is doomed to failure. To provide a balance, Making Change Stick offers the reader twelve principles for making change effective and lasting. These principles are based on a philosophy that long-term success is built on a foundation of a culturally open system. Reale defines this as, \\"ready to adapt as necessary to prosper under any market conditions.\\" He further adds this culture should be \\"dynamically adaptive and supportive of the needs of customers, employees, and shareholders.\\"The twelve principles for making change stick are a series of repeating patterns that help an organization to become change-capable. Reale believes that one or more of the twelve principles have been violated or ignored when change does not last in an organization. For example, principle number six is confront fear. Many leaders are unaware of why individuals are fearful of change and how to openly discuss it. A healthy culture nurtures an environment where workers feel safe to discuss their fears. It is when these fears are gracefully exposed, they can be confronted by the individual, and their feelings defused.After the twelve principles are discussed, Making Change Stick concludes with a couple of beneficial chapters. One outlines how to create a culture that sustains change. Reale is a strong proponent of establishing a guidance team or transformation management group to facilitate this need. The final chapter offers sage advice to organizational leaders, and encourages them to use their emotional intelligence to relinquish control throughout the organization to committed and competent followers. Each chapter ends with some questions to ponder and practical ways to put each principle into practice. Reale also spices the book with his personal experiences, quotations and charts to develop his major points.Making Change Stick is a practical primer for anyone involved in the change process within an organization. It provides many valuable points that together show how connected the entire company must be for change to be lasting and successful. It reinforces why change is both a technical and people oriented process. If you are personally involved in any change process, this book will help it to all make sense and help you to be a productive part of the process."},{"Title":"Making Change Stick: Twelve Principles for Transforming Organizations","review":"In Making Change Stick, Richard C. Reale introduces twelve principles for transforming organizations. These principles urge us to know where we are going, challenge our thinking, involve and be involved, align our culture, honor emotions, confront fear, don't wait for perfection, communicate intentionally, set people up for success, catch people doing something right, measure stuff that matters and lead from the heart. Reale's principles drive the reader toward embracing organizational and individual change as a choice - one chooses to change or not. Reale coins the term sticky change to refer to those changes that become institutionalized as a part of the corporate culture - the Company DNA.While Reale's twelve principles seem trite and shallow on the surface, they are filled with depth and insight. Being obvious doesn't make them any less true or lessen their impact when properly implemented, it simply means that we should have done them all along.I recommend Making Change Stick by Richard C. Reale. His simple yet effective blueprint for embracing change draws the leader toward an endgame strategy of helping the organization choose to change - a willing change that will be embraced and embodied by the organization."},{"Title":"Making Change Stick: Twelve Principles for Transforming Organizations","review":"Those who are preparing to launch change initiatives or who have only recently done so would be well-advised to consider the truth of what Peter Drucker suggested more than 40 years ago: \\"There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all.\\" In this volume, Richard C. Reale identifies and then examines twelve principles that can help to guide and inform the formulation and execution of initiatives that can transform any organization, whatever its size and nature may be. He devotes a separate chapter to each principle, none of which is a head-snapping revelation nor does Reale make any such claim.Of special interest to me is his clever use of various reader-friendly devices such as \\"Questions to Ponder\\" and \\"putting the Principle into Practice\\" with which he concludes chapters. They focus on key issues and summarize key points that facilitate, indeed expedite frequent reviews of the material after a first reading. They also serve as \\"gut checks\\" that enable the reader to evaluate the progress of change initiatives and to measure their effectiveness throughout various stages of the change initiative process. I also appreciate the provision of relevant quotations from various sources. For example:\\"The significant problems we face today cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.\\" Albert Einstein\\"On a group of theories one can found a school; but on a group of values one can found a culture.\\" Ignazio Silone\\"We see the world not as it is, but as we are.\\" The Talmud\\"Scalded cats fear even cold water.\\" Thomas Fuller\\"One great mistake is to try to extract from each person virtues which he does not possess, neglecting the cultivation of those which he does have.\\" HadrianAll change initiatives encounter resistance and many barriers are the result of what James O'Toole has aptly characterizes as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" Reale offers a number of strategies and tactics to overcome resistance but reiterates throughout his narrative of setting crystal clear objectives (\\"know where you are going\\"), validate the assumptions and premises on which the action plan is based (\\"challenge your thinking\\"), establish a broad and deep base of participation by others (\\"Involve and be involved\\"), maintain proper alignment of initiatives and resources with the given strategy to achieve objectives (\\"align your culture'), and rigorously monitor progress throughout the entire process (\\"measure stuff that matters\\"). I presume to add that unless and until those involved, especially leaders, nail these and other fundamentals, much of the resistance to change initiatives will be justified.Presumably Reale agrees with me that it would be a fool's errand to read his book and then attempt to adopt and then apply all of the material he provides. Think of his book as an operations manual for organizational transformation. It can guide and inform both the planning and subsequent implementation of a plan that is most appropriate to the needs, resources, and ultimate objectives of the given organization, whatever its size and nature may be.I think his book will be of great value to all decision-makers but especially to those who have little (if any) understanding of the mindset, perspectives, and analytical skills that effective change agents have. They see each problem as a challenge, of course, but also as a learning opportunity. They realize that what those who comprise a team know is much greater than what any one member does. And finally, they have patience as well as determination when facing the resistance their efforts will inevitably encounter."},{"Title":"Making Change Stick: Twelve Principles for Transforming Organizations","review":"Two figures stand out when reading this book: twelve and twenty. What do they have in common? The same man, Richard C. Reale. For twenty years, he's studied why change fails and why it succeeds. Then he boiled down his knowledge base into twelve principles that are absolutely necessary if change is to happen correctly and last in an organization. The amazing thing is that these principles will not only ensure the success of a transformation, but will pay dividends in the long run, by having made an organization more change-capable.So what's missing? What's causing organizations to fail when implementing change? The most common reason is the \\"failure to consider the human side of change.\\" It's easy enough to draw the roadmap. The hardest part is the execution, the fulfillment of that plan. If you don't believe it, just look at the last time you resolved to do something. What was harder: making the decision and putting some thought into how to best achieve it, or actually doing what you planned?The twelve principles outlined in this book allow organizational leaders to focus on the people, and to empower them to bring change to fruition. It's about setting down the right process for change, and following along closely, making sure change is proceeding as planned. It's about walking the talk, and encouraging people to do the same by praising their efforts to change, and setting them up for success. It's about monitoring the right metrics, the ones that will tell you how you're really doing. In theory, it doesn't sound hard, but in practice, it's another story. Fortunately, the author explains every one of the twelve principles in detail, and the examples he gives clearly illustrate the point. Inspirational quotes from notable personalities are also provided, to help drive home the point.This book is a wonderful resource. Twenty years of \\"on-the-job\\" experience can't be wrong. The author's expertise shows, and will help guide the book's readers toward that great goal of organizational change, which is a hard goal to achieve indeed. If individual change is hard, organizational change is orders of magnitude harder - but this book will show you how to do it successfully. Get it, and achieve lasting change!"},{"Title":"Making Change Stick: Twelve Principles for Transforming Organizations","review":"Based on his experience, the author has written a top-notch, practical guide to successful organizational change, centered on twelve principles:1.

In fact, Mr. Reale recognizes that it is essential for leaders to honor both the task and maintenance roles in order to create the impetus for change.

Rich Reale employs powerful examples and real-life circumstances that draw the reader into the text and provide a deeper understanding of how to move an organization from a standstill into a successful and lasting transformation.This is not just another book on organizational change. It is evident Rich Reale not only understands what makes for corporate growth and success, but that he also possesses an unusually keen understanding of human nature, and how this impacts an organization's growth and development.He shows how this is one of the most essential elements of achieving lasting, successful change: knowing what makes your people tick and how to build upon that in the transformation process.I found the book interesting, engrossing and enjoyable. I especially appreciated the realism that the author displays in recognizing what the human person needs in order to be drawn into the often difficult and challenging aspects of organizational change, changing them from apathetic observers, to enthusiastic proponents of lasting change.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book as a highly useful, engaging and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Making Change Stick: Twelve Principles for Transforming Organizations","review":"As someone who has worked hard at bringing about change in organizations of all sizes, I found Rich Reale's book very insightful and delightful reading.

The whole discussion on transitional stages and DISC could have been expanded, as far as I am concerned. This is somre really good stuff some of which I have seen elsewhere but was packaged it quite nicely in this book. Of course, if you throw in the range of Emotional Quotients (EQ) that employees bring to the workplace daily, it's a wonder any productive work gets done. I find this especially true in small to medium-sized businesses.In summary, I believe Mr Reale has truly captured the essence of change in organizations. There are many books on change management but few focused on making change happen and be sustained. This book focuses on successfully making it happen. It should be a must read for executive and mid-level managers and supervisors of all levels regardless of industry."},{"Title":"Making Change Stick: Twelve Principles for Transforming Organizations","review":"Most of us are resistant to change, and in most cases, this resistance to change is not a good thing. We must overcome it or be lost in the stagnant pond that should be a river of success. As a leader, it often becomes the challenge to create positive change around us. Making those changes stick is the harder challenge. To the rescue is author Richard C. Reale and his Twelve Principles for Transforming Organizations. This is a motivating guide that will change your practices, permanently for the positive.I'm not much for reading business-geared works of non-fiction, but this one truly has merit. Of the twelve principles Reale speaks of, these are just my favorites: Know Where You Are Going, Honor Emotions, Don't Wait For Perfection, and Lead From the Heart. There are eight more and each of them warrants examination and reflection. Reale talks you through the process of that too. Each principle is completely thought out, explained in personal terms, has examples of \\"Reale\\" life anecdotes, famous quotes, lists questions to ponder and also gives tips on putting the principle to practice. You can't go wrong! Unless of course, you don't take his advice.For anyone who is in a leadership position, from the warehouse supervisor to the CEO, a police chief, or a microbrewery owner, \\"Making Change Stick\\" is sure to help you in some way. What's more, it is sure to help your employees too. Written in friendly terms the book is easy to read, understand and implement."},{"Title":"Making Change Stick: Twelve Principles for Transforming Organizations","review":"I am constantly looking for the latest reference book on improving my business, employee motivation, being the best etc. Richard Reale's book \\"Making Change Stick\\" came along at the perfect time.

It is much harder to actually do it, and make it stick, from top to bottom. This book, written for executives, is meant to make that process of change not so difficult.The first principle is to know where you are going. Dust off your company's mission statement and start putting it into practice (if your company does not have a mission statement, why not?). Do not be afraid to challenge your thinking. Just because the executive suite has successfully \\"changed,\\" do not assume that all parts of the company will be as successful. There is no such thing as too much internal communication about the change. Silence from the top will invariably be filled with rumor and innuendo from the bottom, usually negative.Take a hard look at your company culture. If you are a strict, by-the-book company, any change may have a hard time being implemented. Perhaps cultural alterations should come first. Some people will have a real problem accepting change, not just because they like the present system, but they will treat it like a funeral, mourning the \\"death\\" of the old system. Even partial improvement toward the company goal is better than nothing, so do not fixate on 100% improvement. Be honest when it comes to measuring progress toward the goal, because numbers can be fudged in any direction. When people are caught doing something right, be sure to reward them.This is a much-needed book for executives of any size company.

Yes, much great work has been done and performance practice is much more informed for the average musician than it was in the 1950s. However, the issues raised in this book are still quite relevant to anyone who wants to do more than receive a music tradition or learn to play music by another's lights.He begins with a clear statement of the problem. It includes not only issues of notation, but of editorship, instrumentation, and changes of style over the centuries. He next takes us into the problems editors face in getting a good score to the performer and what a performer should expect from a score.The next chapter is a very critical one on sonorities. This deals not only with instrumentation over the centuries (changes in instruments, obsolete instruments, but of vocal style, ensemble sizes and composition. Another chapter deals with extemporization, which was not only accepted but expected of performers until some time in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Thank heavens it is coming back as part of informed performance practice.Then Dart provides a series of chapters on style. He begins with considerations about 18th century style. This makes sense because it was the 19th century Romantic style that was the living style in the mid-20th century (along with certain then avant-garde practices). He then heads backwards to the 17th and 16th centuries and ends with a consideration of the Renaissance. Dart offers some helpful conclusions, a section of musical examples, glossary, suggestions for further reading (this would now be out of date, but still interesting), and an index.Since used copies of this are readily available inexpensively, I urge all interested in music to pick up a copy and read this short and informative book. If used copies come in short supply in the United States, simply go to amazon.co.uk and there are many copies there as well."},{"Title":"The interpretation of music (Hutchinson's university library: Music)","review":"The book fell apart upon opening it up. Glue was too brittle.Wish I could have been warned ahead of time."},{"Title":"The interpretation of music (Hutchinson's university library: Music)","review":"According to Thurston Dart, older music must be performed on period instruments in order to sound right. He states as axiomatic that composers wrote for the resources of their day just as modern composers write for theirs. This is the first flaw in his logic. It is tantamount to saying that a great composer's imagination is limited to what his era provides. True, great composers seek to exploit to the maximum the expressive capabilities of the instruments at their disposal. That's their job. However, unless Dart has a B-Minor Mass of his own on his resume, he is not in a position to know how a great composer's mind works.He calls piano performances of Bach's keyboard music \\"absurd.\\" The differences in sound are indeed striking: a hammer strikes the piano's strings. In both the harpsichord and the virginal, though, a jack plucks the strings, yet Dart also dismisses harpsichord performances of English virginal music \\"absurd.\\" He praises Wanda Landowska for playing Bach on the harpsichord. Though her instrument plucked the strings, it had little else in common with those of Bach's day. Today's pedantic purists scorn her work for that very reason. To learn how beautiful absurdity can sound, just listen to the recordings Jascha Heifetz made of Handel's violin sonatas with Emanuel Bay at the piano. Bay's sensitivity is breathtaking. As for Heifetz, Handel would have sold his soul to hear his sonatas played thus. Whenever anyone plays these CDs, Handel wipes celestial tears from his eyes.Dart says of a Palestrina Mass that the way \\"it was then performed in an IMPORTANT Roman church...bore little resemblance to the text as...printed today; for one thing, it was USUALLY accompanied by the organ--softly to be sure....\\" We can accept the unobtrusive organ accompaniment as fact, but maybe it was optional, not mandatory. Perhaps Palestrina saw fit to give the choir extra support to avoid an embarrassing mistake. His Masses were published in his lifetime. What the purchasers did with them lay beyond his control. It also lies beyond ours. We can never know how every church--or ANY church--in Europe presented them. Engaging in a wild goosechase to resurrect a performance that came and went centuries ago is NOT artistry. Palestrina's music sung a cappella is sublime.Nevertheless, one will learn much about the history of musical performance if if he separates what Dart says was done from what he says or implies \\"should\\" be done now. For example, Dart writes that singers of Palestrina's Masses interpolated virtuostic roulades at cadences. Before I read this, I did not know where the \\"cadenza\\" came from.Dart does not even have the facts straight about piano technique. He accuses today's teachers of adopting Czerny's theory that all fingers be made equally strong. Older keyboard music, says Dart, requires the technique set forth by *C.P.E. Bach, which recognizes differences in finger strength. If Dart's first piano teachers subjected him to what he ascribes to Czerny, they were woefully out of touch with reality. Finger strength needs to develop to full potential, but competent teachers know that some fingers remain weaker than others by nature. More importantly, though, they know that technique is just a means to an end: REALIZATION OF A CONCEPT DETERMINED BY MUSICAL INTELLIGENCE, not fingers. None would countenance Vladamir Horowitz' unorthodox technique. However, if the students were to ask, \\"Why can't I be stiff? Horowitz is stiff...,\\" his teacher would probably reply, \\"When you start to play like Vladamir Horowitz, you can stand on your head for all I care!\\" Abandoning piano for harpsichord must have liberated young Thurston's soul. **I'll bet his new teachers exposed him to a technique similar to what Josef Lhevinne outlines in \\"Basic Principles of Pianoforte Playing.\\"At the end of his book Dart concedes that older music appeals to players of modern instruments. Whence cometh this appeal?--from the composer's genius, of course--genius that refuses to be shackled to the ***horse-and-buggy days. Dart also concedes that a beautiful performance demands more than just changing from modern to period instruments. Musicologists, eager to foist their pedantry onto a gullible public, apparently did not bother to read those pages. ****Too many \\"historically informed\\" performances only demonstrate why older instruments were supplanted.A former piano teacher of mine once assured me that musicologists are musicologists because they don't know how to be artists. This does not apply to Thurston Dart. He supplied harpsichord continuo admirably in recordings of Handel's \\"Acis and Galatea\\" (cond. Sir Adrian Boult) and concerti grossi (cond. Sir Neville Marriner). Listeners will enjoy these fine recordings and appreciate Thurston Dart's artistry. Lack of talent did not force him into musicology. He might have become a brilliant concert pianist if his early instruction had not been entrusted to some old fuddy-duddy.----------------------*Essay on the True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments**I haven't read C.P.E. Bach's treatise yet, I admit. Therefore, this statement may be subject to change. Nevertheless, I'll take the risk. Lhevinne's discussion of piano technique is no more and no less than keyboard common sense.***Not that those days were always bad. What composer wouldn't sell his soul to hear his violin music played on a Stradivarius?****One notable exception is the New York Pro Musica. That group lasted for decades for the best of all possible reasons: THE NEW YORK PRO MUSICA BROUGHT EARLY MUSIC TO LIFE. That so few NYPM recordings have been transferred to CD surpasses my understanding."},{"Title":"The interpretation of music (Hutchinson's university library: Music)","review":"If you want to play like people did in 16th century France or Italy,this book might be useful, but to thehip-hop or rock performer of today it is clearly of no real use.As to jazz performance arts it has nothing to say to the performer.So if you are interested in historical or classical music, this book might help you understandold scores and how to use them,but since most don't get paid for playing pretty much dead music,it is an out of date music book that even classical players really don't need."},{"Title":"A Family Guide to The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Looking for a family-friendly and faith-filled tour through the first book in the Narnia series? That's exactly what you will find in these cleverly arranged pages. Author Christin Ditchfield has gleaned some spiritual truths and organized them in a very readable and concise manner. Fans of C. S. Lewis, as well as newcomers to the series, will appreciate the dovetailing of the fantasy story with the Word of God.The author has provided an overview of the Narnia tale, beginning with an interesting biography of Lewis. The original idea, which sparked this famous series, is explained and becomes the perfect place to start the adventure. After readers step through the wardrobe, they will find a chapter-by-chapter look at the symbolism and biblical teaching that make up the framework of the story. Each chapter is quickly analyzed for scriptural parallels and principles. Appropriate Bible verses are also included. The concepts highlighted are simple enough for younger children to grasp, while being pertinent to the adult world as well. Illustrations grace these pages and bring both the characters and the action to life.The remaining part of the book is called, \\"Continuing the Adventure,\\" and includes some entertaining and easy ways to prolong the reader's stay in Narnia. Recipes for English scones and Turkish Delight are included, as well as some ideas for personalizing the story, through crafts and skits.Christin Ditchfield's book definitely enriches the reading of the first Narnia tale by emphasizing some important spiritual insights.

It has emerged and re-emerged, over the years, in a rich variety of applications. The basic idea behind it is in fact quiteclear from the familiar and classical Perron-Frobenius theorem for positive matrices. But Baladi's lovely book deals with the infinite-dimensional case, where the applications are, if possible--, even more striking. The starting point there was the powerful use David Ruelle first made of it in the sixties in his study of phase-transition problems in quantum statistical mechanics. The work leading to the Perron-Frobenius-Ruelle theorem!-- Since then, it has re-emerged in a rich variety of applications in dynamics; both continuous and discrete;-- both experimental and symbolic;-- being central in our (limited) understanding of attractors! It is used both in applications (wavelets, fractals, ...),and in pure math (Zeta functions, and trace formulas, to mention only a few such examples). It is all clearly and wonderfully presented in Baladi's book, which now serves as a lucid introduction to a rich and exciting set of new trends in the research literature."},{"Title":"Resurrection Man","review":"The first chapter of this book has to be one of the most incredible I've ever read anywhere. There's a lot that will shock and intrigue readers in this book, even with its modest number of pages; I thought the story was wonderfully packed and layered.The downside is that this is going to be a tougher book to read and understand than most sf/fantasy/urban fantasy books--Sean Stewart has got a very different Earth here, and only reveals it piece by little piece. A lot is unexplained (this book is almost absent of all &quot;info dumps&quot; so conspicuous in sf/fantasy); most information about the world must be inferred, at the same time Dante is trying to understand the mysteries happening inside him and within his family.The patient reader will be rewarded--this book is emotionally gripping, imaginative, funny and intelligent, and the quality and intensity never lets up. Once I reached the middle of the book, I lost hours of sleep trying to finish the rest of it in one night because I couldn't put it down. The puzzle pieces do fall into place in the last chapter. The whole book was a unique and incredible experience, unorthodox in a lot of places, which was really part of its strength.This was the first book I've read by Mr. Stewart, and I'm looking forward to reading his other books."},{"Title":"Resurrection Man","review":"I picked up this book on a reccomendation, and read it in one night, literally unable to put it down.

A fantastic book, in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"Resurrection Man","review":"The book starts slowly and requires some work on the reader's part, but the effort is well worth it. One of the joys of this books is the author's slow and subtle presentation of the world he creates -- at first it seems almost exactly like our world, then quite thoroughly different (sinister magic is a large part of it) and finally, not so different after all. The characters are all believable, given the oddity of their existence. The author also is extremely good with descriptions and the ordinariness of much of the phsycial surroundings only serves to heighting the eerie atmosphere.

The language of this book is easily one of its greatest strengths. Stewart's style is at once fluid and precise, impressionistic and razor-fine.

I just couldn't get into this one as much. It felt very small and very dark and I never got my mind around this strange world that Stewart created. I didn't hate it, but I just never felt good about reading this book. Definitely not the best of his books to start with!"},{"Title":"Resurrection Man","review":"It was Don Webb who first pointed me in Stewart's direction, but it took me quite a while before I finally picked up a novel of his. This of course was due to no active avoidance, but simply because I have way too many books to read as it is. Still, if I never got any recommendations, I would miss out on some amazing books, of which Resurrection Man is one of them.I like fantasy based in the real world--something magical hidden under the surface. When young, I remember being fascinated by magicians, tarot cards, and voodoo. I liked science fiction, but ESP and telekinetics did not intrigue me as much as the rituals of fantasy. This was the difference between science and magic, even when both could accomplish the same effect. Later in life, this preoccupation with magic had me gravitating to magic realism in my reading, a subject which I still actively seek out.Resurrection Man is not quite magic realism (at least in my definition of the term) because Stewart's world is not our own. It has many similarities, but the differences--angels working for the police, feng shui necessary for building placement--are striking. What makes Stewart seem like magic realism is for his style of writing about this alternate world, almost laconic, but seemingly realistic.The plot is a strange mixture of mystery and secrets that also appealed to me, as the protagonist must deal with his own angelic nature (not as heavenly as you might think), the past of his aunt's husband, and a possible child, both born yet unborn. I liked Resurrection Man a lot, and I'm looking forward to reading another book by Stewart to see if he can capture my interests so completely once again."},{"Title":"Resurrection Man","review":"Stewart has created what is without a doubt one of the most cutting edge fantasy novels I have ever read. Brilliantly combining elements of dark fantasy which border on plunging this narrative into the category of a horror and urban fantasy elements which bring the events depicted almost too close to home, the result is a novel which will both make your hair stand on end and force you to think about its implications long after you read it. The narrative style is tightly woven and highly engaging to those who are looking for a break from the traditional fantasy style. To describe the originality of Stewart's vision I would say that this novel borders on genius; to describe its appeal, well, it certainly won't be everyone's cup of tea. In point of fact this novel would probably appeal to a fairly small demographic of &quot;fringe fantasy&quot; fans. Let me simply say if you liked the X-files or the Outer Limits TV Shows or Movies like The Dark Crystal or The Last Unicorn this book will appeal to you. For the average Joe this book might be a little too dark for your taste; start with something lighter but still on the fringe like Gregory Mcguire's Wicked or, always a classic, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein."},{"Title":"Resurrection Man","review":"I was seduced into buying this book at a time when I was feeling particulary hungry for a good read.

I certainly liked it, and will read a dozen or so other books before tackling another one by the same author, just to let things sink in some more.I was drawn to the book by this quote of the author, from a LOCUST interview. Stewart here speaks of magic, but to me it is the magic of fiction to enchant, the magic of insight to enlighten, the ah ha! experience. If you like this quote, you may enjoy this book as much as I did:&quot;There are several different kinds of truth in the world: truths of one, truths of two, and truths of three or more.'&quot;Truths of three or more are what science is concerned about. They're external, and they're about the manipulation of the world that is shared by everyone.'&quot;Truths of two would be things like the love you have for someone else - very difficult to measure or quantify, but clear to that individual.'&quot;Truths of one are those things that seem intensely true and meaningful to you but are impossible to communicate, to measure and give to someone else in quite the same way you can give someone else a wave length or a hundred kilos of mass, or whatever.'&quot;And when you get magic like you have in a role-playing game, that is profoundly concerned with using theoretically magical things to manipulate the external world - like, 'With this spell, you can generate a fireball that will do this much damage to a physical structure' - that's like a truth of three or more. It seems to me, magic in its most important sense is about those truths of two and one. It has to have some transformative, powerful relationship to the people doing it. Science does not. The whole point about science or technology is that once it's engineered out, it doesn't matter if you turn on the light switch or I turn on the light switch. Magic shouldn't be like that. It isn't reproducible, isn't the same for everyone. It's intensely personal, and speaks to those more personal and subjective truths.&quot;"},{"Title":"Resurrection Man","review":"Urban fantasy as a genre is rife with books that don't even get close to cutting the mustard.

One of the few great examples of an urban fantasy story."},{"Title":"Resurrection Man","review":"This book requires some patience, to sort out what is going on and what the world of the setting is like. Characters, too, are slowly developed. It's hard to pinpoint the exact source of the emotional impact and beauty of the story, and yet it is undeniably there. There are scenes of loss, and confusion, and pain. Then there are scenes of family unity, of peace and contentment. Many of the most compelling passages are those told by Dante's brother, Jet. His love is photography. He describes some of his favorite photographs that he has taken. He describes the atmosphere at the time, his subject, and just why the photo affected him and stayed with him. The book is about the influence of magic on an alternate earth. It is loosely about Dante's mystery of who and what he is, and his journey of discovery. The book works without that plot, however, on the strength of the writing and the insightful moments. It is not a straightforward story. It's really all about the journeys of the characters, rather than their destinations."},{"Title":"Resurrection Man","review":"I couldn't make it past the second chapter. The book completely failed to make me want to suspend my disbelief. The book opens with a character who finds a body that looks just like him. He immediately procedes to do an autopsy on the body in a boathouse - all the while chatting with his siblings as if nothing were out of the ordinary and it was just another day.Tim Powers and James Blaylock do &quot;urban magic&quot; much, much better."},{"Title":"Resurrection Man","review":"If plot is important to you, look elsewhere. While the novel is fairly well written, nothing really happens in it. Its setting is a world like our own except that magic has returned. Unfortunately, this point is kept WAY in the background. In fact, there's very little brought forth in this novel. Characters are never really developed, settings are colorless, and -- again -- plot is very shallow. Like a splash of water on the countertop shallow. I'm not certain how this received a &quot;notable book&quot; award, or if that award is really as prestigious as it sounds. That said, Stewart isn't a bad writer; it's just not a very good story. Maybe his newer books (like Galveston) are better."},{"Title":"Visions Across the Americas: Short Essays for Composition","review":"i received the book very fast and it was in excellent condition. thank you! this is a great seller ^^ i would recommend to any buyer. fast shipping and excellent condition?!

He streamlines the story and renders the verse original in prose, but his prose often achieves exalted effects. The story is far from 'a wearisome alternation of battle scenes and love conquests.' It is a richly symbolic tale of the life of the soul and the achieving of real maturity, told through encounters both magical and martial. Parzival's quest for the holy grail--in this instance more of a spiritualized philosopher's stone--enchants and absorbs the reader in a world of portentous marvels. The 1st eight chapters of the book, known collectively as 'The Wounding,' is the more powerful portion of the story. The concluding eight chapters--'The Healing'--is not as convincing in its impact. The solutions achieved are perhaps too overtly Jungian. But there is still great profundity and beauty in the events that unfold and resolve. Clarke's admittedly loose adaptation of Wolfram's masterpiece makes this reader hungry to get a little closer to the original. As I don't think I'll be tackling the 13th century German any time soon, I may give the complete, literal translation by Cyril Edwards (published by Boydell & Brewer) a try next."},{"Title":"Parzival & the Stone from Heaven","review":"I enjoyed the only other retellings of the Parzival legends I've read, \\"Parzival's Page\\" and Katherine Paterson's \\"Parzival.\\" A brief flip-through the book made me think at first that I wouldn't enjoy it, but I did end up liking it. Clarke does a good job of sapping the stiffness from old legends and making it palatable to the modern reader.The story begins with the story of Gahmuret, who goes off on a Crusade and then returns to Britain, marrying two women along the way -- a Moorish queen and a Welsh queen. He's killed shortly after the birth of his son Parzival, and the shock of his death drives his Welsh widow mad. She secludes herself in the woods with her son, trying to keep him sheltered away from the world that might make him a warrior knight.Years pass, and Parzival accidently encounters three knights on the road. Immediately he becomes obsessed with being a knight, and despite his mother's protests, he leaves to become one. By training and assistance, he does become a knight and marries the beautiful queen Blanchefleur. But before he arrives at King Arthur's court, Parzival comes to a magical castle where he is expected to ask the king a question. His failure to do so drives him away from God and into a desperate quest for redemption.Alongside Parzival's quest, we also have the adventures of Sir Gawain, who seems to develop a crush on any mildly pretty lady he comes across. He becomes enamored of a very proud and obnoxious woman, who is entrapped in the dark magic of an evil sorcerer.This is a nice book. It isn't perfect; with the exception of Gawain and Parzival, the characters are pretty two-dimensional, especially Kei, who is obnoxious for no reason that anyone can really explain. Other characters, like the pig-faced sorceress Cundrie, seem to exist for no other reason than to tell Parzival and Gawain things. Fans of the usual Camelot love triangle will be disappointed, while people who dislike the much-rehashed love story will probably enjoy reading some Camelot-related material that hasn't been done to death.The writing style and dialogue are formal but not incomprehensible; Clarke does a good job of giving us a view inside the heads of the lead two characters. The plot itself is fairly straightforward, with some sudden twists and turns that might confuse people unfamiliar with the original legends. Readers may need to backpedal a few times.This book would probably be a good retelling for teens and adults alike; it has some dirty content that the YA and juvenile retelling doesn't have, such as Gawain almost being seduced by a girl (they're in bed and they kiss and snuggle, but nothing more), and references to the \\"activities\\" of Gahmuret and his two wives, and briefly of Parzival and Condwiramurs. In addition, there are some very gruesome scenes, such as Parzival's maddened, deteriorated cousin who totes around the head of her dead lover.A good retelling for any who enjoyed Parzival's Page, or Katherine Paterson's retelling. Or for anyone in the mood for some freshly-told Arthurian stories."},{"Title":"Parzival & the Stone from Heaven","review":"The legend of the holy grail is one that has captured the imagination since it first appeared hundreds of years ago. It has been told and retold--as well as parodied by the Monty Python troupe. It is not widely known that in some of the original versions of this tale the grail was a stone rather than a cup!This version succeeds at being true to the spirit of the original tale--a long mysterious quest where much is lost and much is gained. The ultimate goal according to Jungian theory is the restoration of balance--lost by a culture that overly values prowess particularly in war. Since this is a perennial problem for humanity, this legend maintains its potency.This writer has managed to vividly convey beauty of the ancient time in which this quest unfolds, as well as the passion and enchantment. An enjoyable fulfilling read!"},{"Title":"Render Up the Body","review":"A bookclub I belong to recently invited Mimi Wesson to talk to our group about this book which we had all read. We discussed whether or not we found the book to be a liberal tract as one of the reviews had suggested. Of course, we are Boulderites, but we felt that the book showed an unusual degree of ambiguity for its type. Ms. Wesson said that she tried to create a main character who was in no way perfect or sure of her every move that is typical of feminist heroines. Cinda is plagued by doubts and pulled in opposite directions. She ends up defending a rapist--who is portrayed rather sympathetically-- in spite of the objections of her feminist friends. She also said that she didn't decide the ending of the book until she had written about two-thirds of it. Other than a few lapses--couldn't the dead body have been identified by fingerprints or dental records? don't the characters talk in a jokey, adolescent fashion?--the book is very intelligent and leaves the reader feeling outraged that habeus corpus doesn't allow for the argument of innocence. Wesson said that she regrets the law's emphasis on procedure at the expense of truth and justice. But this novel is not a polemic but an entertaining legal thriller with the flavor of Boulder to add some spice."},{"Title":"Render Up the Body","review":"Marianne Wesson's &quot;Render up the Body&quot; begins with the retirement of a prosecutor alternately known as Cinda and Minnie Mouse as she prepares to begin working at a rape counseling center. Soon after she starts her new job, though, Cinda receives a call from a Colorado Supreme Court justice asking her to handle the appeal of a convicted rapist and murderer who has been sentenced to death.Unable to refuse, she takes the case, though doing so causes problems with her coworkers, who are understandably uncomfortable with the idea of her representing a convicted rapist. During the appeals process, Cinda begins to uncover some disturbing facts regarding the case. More than that, though, her personal relationships seem to be affected. Her best friend from the prosecutors' office suddenly turns a cold shoulder, and the man with whom Cinda begins to establish a relationship (and who previously represented the condemned man) sometimes seems too aloof.The story of &quot;Render up the Body&quot; is not all that original (though the ending is), but it is very difficult to find original plots in the field of legal thrillers. That being said, &quot;Render up the Body&quot; has a great deal going for it that does set it apart from the field. The writing is crisp and engrossing. The characters seem very real--not the cartoonish good and evil archetypes of so many other genre entries. And Wesson takes her time allowing the plot to unfold, thus letting the reader savor the story and the characters' lives.Another facet of the book that is welcome is the law. Wesson gets it right for the most part. While she does take some liberties conflating jurisdictions, it is clear that she understands law (as well she should given her past as a prosecutor and a law professor). Her lawyers do not run around committing flagrant ethical violations; they do not tamper with juries in the name of their ideals, and they don't run around hiding evidence. Too many books in the genre have no regard for the law and thus become supremely unrealistic. &quot;Render up the Body,&quot; on the other hand, takes the law seriously, and so do the characters. This facet is a welcome and refreshing change from too many genre entries.For readers looking for a simple parable of good and evil with characters who personify those opposites, look elsewhere. But for those looking for a book in which the characters are real people working in a world they do not control completely and in which complex questions are presented without simplistic answers, &quot;Render up the Body&quot; is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Render Up the Body","review":"Render Up the Body by Marianne WessonA well written dramatic thriller set in the most beautiful area of the USA.

It's a page turner which doesn't require that you disable your intellectual and critical functions while you read it.

Based on the first 80 pages, I feel like Kathleen Bates in &quot;Misery&quot; after reading the first 80 pages of &quot;Misery.&quot; The significant difference is that after finishing this one, I seriously doubt that murdering the authoress will be my agenda. (You do know that is a joke, right?) This reads as well as (better than?) the usual (which I LOVE) Grishams and and Turows (which I also LOVE). I know that &quot;bettern than&quot; is a bold statement, but trust me, this one rings real. The people are real. I know, because I do this stuff every day. The realism of the struggles works because it IS real. This is a keeper.

Totally disappointed with the way the justice system handles violent crimes against women, Cinda becomes the head of a rape crisis center. One year later, Cinda is still working at the crisis center where she constantly battles the establishment which seems to reject the notion that loved ones are often the culprits of violent crimes towards women.Soon, everything radically changes for Cinda when her former law school professor, Colorado Supreme Court Justice Hilton James, asks her to represent Jason Smiley, a death row inmate, appealing his conviction of rape and murder. Reluctantly, Cinda accepts the case. Abruptly, her legal friends abandon her and she loses her job at the crisis center. She als finds much discrepancy in the evidence that was used to convict Smiley. An obstinate Cinda will do everything she can for her client even as it places her in an odd moral dilemma.RENDER UP THE BODY is a superb, extremely complex legal thriller that astutely digs deep into a myriad of social issues (perhaps a bit too many for one novel). Cinda and her cohorts are wonderful characters struggling with the justice system on one hand, and what they believe is morally right on the other. Hopefully Marianne Wesson will have Cinda appear in future novels. The verdict rendered on this novel is that it is a must read for fans of a sub-genre that seems to be undergoing a renaissance with lots of new talent, including the inspiring Ms. Wesson.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Render Up the Body","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading the advance copy I have of this book. The novel is extremely well-paced and well-written. The book clearly was not written in a rush. Wesson continually sets up amusing, involving, suspenseful scenes. I was disappointed with the ending because it was far-fetched and, I think, implausible. There were some loose ends regarding the solution that weren't tied up and that was disappointing, but up to then the book was uncommonly well-writen and entertaining."},{"Title":"Render Up the Body","review":"I'll admit I had a bit of trouble getting into this; in fact, it took me three tries. However, the third time was a charm and by page 53, I was hooked and stayed up way too late to finish it. I'm not a lawyer, and I think some of the legal detail is what slowed me down. I really liked the character of Cinda. I did have to remind myself the story is set in 1990/1991 and being very liberal, one of the major plot points seemed a non-issue to me, but I know that not true even today. The story builds well and the ending is effective, even though I guessed it. Overall, I though it was good and will read the next, because it's already on my shelf, but I'm not certain I'd have sought it out otherwise. Think I'll stick to Grisham."},{"Title":"Render Up the Body","review":"Marianne Wesson seems to use this novel as a vehicle to advance her liberal feminist agenda. She seems to take great effort to make none of her central characters seem like mainstream Americans. I also take exception to her portrayal of Christians and stay-at-home moms as a bunch of materialistic hypocrits. The central theme is not new, and her &quot;unique&quot; ending doesn't jive with the facts as she lays them out. The novel should have been subjected to more thorough fact checking before publication. She can't even get the date of Nicole's disappearance straight throughout the book - it varies from one Saturday in August (Jason's version) to the weekend AFTER Labor Day (Nicole's father's version). All in all, I don't believe this book is worthy of a glowing recommendation."},{"Title":"Render Up the Body","review":"The characters are paper-thin, and are comically stereotyped; shaped by the author's knee-jerk liberal feminist outlook. Thus, every white male is a pig, a lout or a rapist, the black male love interest spouts a lot of phony jive dialog, and the female characters are strong, hip and wise - even the villain. None of the characters talks like any real person ever did. If the characters don't annoy you, the plot will. It proceeds at a snail pace through every predictable turn of this type of law novel. The &quot;surprise&quot; ending is telegraphed to all midway through the book. It's a bomb. My advice: stick with Scott Turow, and hope that Mimi Wesson does a better job on her next book."},{"Title":"Render Up the Body","review":"I got this book for my birthday from my husband after I asked for a legal mystery that takes place somewhere other than New York or in the South. I was thrilled to read about a wonderful and unique setting. The information about the inner workings of the legal system were wonderful and all the sub-plots fit in nicely. After reading the beginning I thought how could an attorney defend this scum but wanted desperately for him to win his habeus corpus after getting to know him. I cried uncontrolably at the outcome."},{"Title":"Render Up the Body","review":"Ms. Wesson, in her depiction of DA Groesbeck, adroitly captured what many of us believe Boulder's real life DA to be...and that's not complimentary (read the book about JonBenet Ramsey, and you'll get the idea). The story carried me along, and the ending was unexpected yet believable. I enjoyed the foray into criminal law, learned a lot, and hope we haven't seen the last of Cinda Hayes. A terrific first novel."},{"Title":"Render Up the Body","review":"This book is a work of fiction. It is based on the author's work on the death penalty appeal of my cousin Jerry Frye. You should know that the appeal was denied on all issues raised. With that said. My cousin Jerry Frye is not a person who merits any sympathy that he might garner based upon this work of fiction. I know this man and his history, He is not a good person, nor is he even the average person. He is infact one of the most dispicable people I have ever known. As a child I was the object of his interest, I am a victim of his sociopathy. I also know how he terrorized other members of his family, including his own mother. I only pray that since this is a work of fiction that no monies go to him personally.If you read this book please realize that it is fiction and bears little basis in fact, please dont romanticize Jerry and /or his struggle against an unfair legal system. All of the facts are available on the web. you can read the California Supreme Court's decision, all you have to do is look it up, it's all there.On behalf of his family I appologize to the family of his victims.

Cinda Hayes comes across as a lady with issues; Jason Smiley as a murderer who'll grasp at any straw to escape execution. The plot is simple, which means it accomodates complex legal ideas easily, and the end carries the stinger.Lovers of legal thrillers and good writing should have one command: Render up this novel."},{"Title":"Render Up the Body","review":"I found this book on a friend's bookshelf and hijacked it while looking for something new to read.

Ms. Wesson's ability to bring these people to life during the course of the book astounded me. When I closed this one, I began searching for her next novel which I read just as quickly.Her third in the series is due out in February, 2002 and I will be sitting on GO when the bookstore opens.

The accident is not well known, because it happened in a remote area and was quickly overshadowed by more horrific air disasters in the months and years to follow.Godson tells the complete story of this calamity, focusing on accounts from the few survivors. His book also gives details on several other crashes from the period that help shed light on the crash. In the second half Godson examines why the accident took place, explaining that extreme weather currents likely forced the plane to a low altitude and produced false readings in the cockpit.Perhaps the most chilling section explains why so few escaped alive. Only ten made it out of the plane and of these only four recovered from their injuries, even though only one was injured by the crash itself. Apparently the plastics used in the jet produced hydrogen cyanide when burned, giving passengers mere seconds to exit safely before breathing in the deadly gas.Godson's conclusions may not be news to many air crash researchers of today, but likely would have been for many in the 70's, who had experienced far fewer such accidents. In any event, his book is informative and never boring."},{"Title":"Clipper 806: The anatomy of an air disaster","review":"I read this book thirty years after it was first published. It still is a mesmerizing account of one of mankind's worst nightmares - the air crash. Well worth the time to read."},{"Title":"Housing Policy In The United States: An Introduction","review":"If you're searching for an introductory one-volume treatment of this subject that is also well written and researched, you'd be hard-pressed to top this book. That's not to say that I don't have quibbles; the book could have contained more critical insight and still would have worked fine as an introductory level text.For example both the Low Income Housing Tax Credit and the public housing chapters (chapters 5 and 6) seem to take the inherent value of \\"deconcentration\\" and \\"mixed income\\" at face value, at a time when both notions are finally beginning to receive long overdue critical attention from social scientists (besides William Julius Wilson), not just planners, pundits, and politicians. It turns out that these notions are highly problematic in their actual application. As Edward Goetz and others have pointed out about the HOPE VI program for instance, \\"the program is not so much about improving the conditions for previous residents as it is about reclaiming urban neighborhoods for middle- income families.\\" This is a stronger statement than Schwartz makes on p. 118 of the book where he observes instead that the program \\"does not necessarily improve the lives of all the residents of the original public housing.\\"It is also neither fair nor balanced for Schwartz to neglect to mention that the 1937 U.S. Housing Act, as one of its many compromises, ITSELF required segregated housing projects (in the book he suggests that segregated public housing was more of a local phenomenon). He also overemphasizes the role of elected officials in Black neighborhoods who he says did not want integrated housing because it would have affected their political base. Does he mean to honestly suggest that the black desire to hold on to what limited political power it possessed during the Jim Crow 1930's is somehow to blame as much for segregated public housing in America as the actions of people such as Rep. Henry Steagall (the House sponsor of the bill) of Alabama? Schwartz's simple and direct discussion of racism in the FHA earlier in the book is better and more honest.Then there's the simple but honest critical question that Schwartz doesn't really tackle: at a time of record profits in the secondary mortgage market (discussed in pages 56-62), how is it that housing affordability problems continue to exist and in some cases even worsen in city after American city?On the plus side, the fair housing chapter (chapter 11) is excellent, as is the \\"stubborn facts of housing policy\\" section of the last chapter. Also, Schwartz's summary of HUD's programs for the homeless and disabled is one of the most concise I have read.In the end my nitpicks do not detract from the fact that Schwartz has written the most accessible and comprehensive introductory text on American housing policy out there. By explaining the often byzantine laws and rules governing housing finance, he has performed a much-needed public service.

What would I have done if I were in his place?The lesson translates well to today to teach us how we can grow to be leaders despite (or because of) unfavorable circumstances. The way Dr. Lineberry intertwines Joseph's stages of life with stories from the author's own life make the book very easy to read and relate to. It helps the reader to see how God can turn struggles into something great, as He did for Joseph and the people of Egypt.This is a great read for all ages.

The other highly regarded bio spends almost the first third of the book on Bishop Milton Wright's battles with his church. While that was indeed a part of Orv and Wil's life; that's not what I wanted to read about. This book concentrates on the brothers, and their efforts, experiences, and relationships in their quest for flight. You get it all in this one.

Just amazing."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"An informative and entertaining book about the Wright Brothers and how they got the world to fly."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"The Wright Brothers did not achieve their historic accomplishments in a vacuum, without the advice and support of other pioneers in the quest for human flight. I suppose that this should be common knowledge, but I was unaware of the contributions of Samuel Langley and others to the study of flight before reading James Tobin's remarkable book. Before his in-depth description of the Wright Brothers work that led to the first manned flight, Tobin describes in some detail Langley's investigations into flight, including one ill-fated attempt at a manned flight that would have beaten the Wrights by just several days. Tobin goes on to describe the race for accomplishments in the area of human flight, noting such worthy competitors as Alexander Graham Bell and Glenn Hammond Curtiss. Tobin's book is thus both a touching tribute to the Wright Brothers, as well as a spirited salute to their friends and competitors (some of whom were the same people). Details such as the power struggle within their church may seem irrelevant to some, but to me they provided a richness to Tobin's book that is no doubt missing from many other works on the Wright Brothers. An excellent book, one of the rare works I plan on reading again at some point."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"For history and technology buffs, this very detailed telling of the Wright Brothers, Langley, Alexander Graham Bell, Curtiss and others pursuing the unthinkable heavier-than-air flight, is a fabulous read."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"This is a well written account of the development of aviation. It makes it clear that there were a number of people who might legitimately have claimed a stake in the Wrights' \\"invention\\", and the book details how much of their time was dedicated to protecting their patents toward the end of their lives. I suppose the cutthroat nature of it all was a bit disappointing to me; a couple of Ohio brothers adapting their bicycle mechanic skills just for the thrill of invention is not the story here. In any case, the practicality of flight was proven just as the Great War opened, eclipsing some of their accomplishments much as the newly opened Panama Canal passed from public fascination to military tool at almost the same moment. The book is certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"I've been to Dayton, Kitty Hawk, and the Air and Space museum. But oh how I wish I'd read this book before visiting those places. There has always been something of a gap between the Wright Brother's Dec 17 1903 flight and the fighters of WWI (punctuated equilibrium?). It is hard to see how we got from the Wright Flyer to the Curtis fighters, warped wings to ailerons, etc. There was also quite a gap between those first flights in 1903 and the next appearance of the Wright Brothers, in 1909. This book fills in those gaps."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"Not a biography of the Wright brothers, but the story of early flight from several perspectives. It jumps around a bit, but you do develop a sense for the various attempts and programs that were going on.

Not 5 stars, but close, and an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"Service was prompt and excellent. The book is in great condition just like it was stated."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"This is a review of the audio CD version of the book, which I listened to four times, but which is an abridgement of the print version. As another customer wrote in his review of the book, this book is primarily a story, or a set of interweaved stories, of intellectual discovery, by aviation pioneers Samuel Langley of the Smithsonian Institution, Orville and Wilbur Wright (the stars of the book), and, to a lesser extent, Alexander Graham Bell. Other pioneers of aviation are also covered to a still lesser degree than Bell. I'm not quite sure why, but it wasn't until I got about 75% of the way through the audiobook the first time that the book finally hooked me and I decided I liked it. During my next three listenings, I enjoyed the book from start to finish. The point to be made here, perhaps, is that if you find the book a little boring at first, stick with it; you'll probably eventually enjoy it. One weakness of the book, and maybe it's a weakness of just the abridged audiobook edition which I listened to, is the shortage of relevant political, social, economic, military, scientific, technological, educational, and cultural context which must have impacted in various ways, either directly or indirectly, aviation in its embryonic stage and infancy. Still, the story of the Wright brothers, as told by the book's author, James Tobin, is fascinating. It's a story that would be great for the big screen, or at least for a made-for-TV movie."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"This book races ahead...it's a total page turner. It is well researched and beautifully written. The story of the Wright brothers and their family life (which I knew nothing about previously) is first rate and worth the price of admission in and of itself. Tobin does an excellent job of describing the Wright's single minded determination and provides clarity into the backdrop of skepticism and ridicule that pervaded their efforts. But there's more! Tobin also covers the Wright's competitors including, of all people, Alexander Graham Bell. The state of scientific inquiry at the time, stretching all the way to the people and politics at the Smithsonian in its embryonic days, is also expertly explained. I learned so much and hated coming to the end of this book."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"As the title of the book states, James Tobin offers a study of the progression of the airplane not just as a Wright brothers biography but as an examination of the efforts of many scientists and inventors in the &quot;race for flight.&quot; As Tobin follows the years of research and test flights of the Wilbur and Orville Wright, he also switches to the works of Smithsonian Secretary Samuel Langley and Charles Manly, Octave Chanute, Alexander Graham Bell and his crew of young, ambitious visionaries which included the Wrights' chief rival Glenn Curtiss, and inventors who made their fame in France where lighter-than-air fliers were king. Tobin demonstrates through articles and correspondences how these experimenters influenced and motivated each other in their steps toward the creation of a practical flying machine.Although this book is not a biographical study per se, Tobin does offer a lot of information on the personalities of the Wrights. Tobin examines the many letters between the brothers, their father, and sister Kate to give the reader some sense of what these quiet, mysterious inventors working in a bicycle shop were like. Tobin also gives the reader some historical context for the times; for example, the popularity of bicycles at the turn of the century during which the Wrights had their own cycle company (pg. 45), or the importance of the photos in McClure's magazine of Otto Lilienthal gliding in his makeshift monoplane in 1894 two years before he met a tragic fate in another experimental flight (pg. 49) (photographs of things in motion being relatively new at the time).The details in this book demonstrates exhaustive research. One learns, for example, that the brothers had two buzzers in their cycle shop so that, if the second buzzer rang, they knew the customer came in just to air up his tires and they could remain upstairs conducting their many wind tunnel experiments. Of course, Tobin describes each stay at Kitty Hawk where the brothers tried their machines, Wilbur's demonstrations in France, Orville's demonstrations at Fort Myer (where the brother was injured and one of Bell's young crew members was killed), and Wilbur's sensational circling of the Statue of Liberty. I agree with another reviewer that the famous first flight on December 17, 1903 is not emphasized. I did not realize I was reading about it when I got to it. It is buried among all the many test glides of the Wrights and the frustrations of Langley. But there are many books that cover this topic thoroughly. Tobin is looking at the larger picture in this book.The book is 366 pages of text with occasional photographs and illustrations plus a middle section of photos. It does not become hampered by technical data. The mechanical element of flying machines is described (i.e. the observation of birds to determine how the wings should work) but not in a way that distracts from the human aspect of the story. This is the first book I've read on the Wright brothers and I enjoyed it very much. I also think it is a worthwhile book for those who've already read books on the Wrights as it is an overview of the quest for flight which may cover aspects of the story that other books do not."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"Genius and perseverance were needed to solve the problems of wing shape, stability in flight, propeller design, creation of an engine with adequate power:weight ratio and finally the control of their machine in the air.Mr Tobin enables us to understand the family dynamics that produced individuals who could find answers to these issues when others could not. He goes on to show how the brothers coped with the press, competitors, the government and their personal finances in a way that reveals their humanity and shows not much has changed in 100 years in these areas. All that and it's as entertaining to read as any good novel."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"Jim Tobin has written not just another history of the infancy of manned flight, but the STORY of that brief but exciting, heartbreaking, and triumphant period. The Wright Brothers didn't invent the airplane in a vacuum. They were underdogs in what became a competition. Like in a good novel, the characters, the competitors, gradually unfold. You meet them in their own diverse worlds and then watch them interact. After getting to know the quirky Wright family, the sister and father as well as the brothers, I can't imagine anyone not wanting to cheer when the tinkerers from Ohio solve problems that are misunderstood or botched by esteemed scientists. But, to me, the years after Kitty Hawk are even more engaging. Read the book to find out why it took years for the Wrights to be fully recognized for their accomplishments. There are some goosebump moments here! The book is fairly long but, due to Tobin's seemingly effortless gift for telling history as a story, I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"Exceedingly well done. The author did a terrific job. Primarily a story about the Wright's but great insights into their contemporaries. Terrific read"},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"I've been in love with airplanes since I was a toddler. When I was in grade school, I owned over 100 model planes, and I read &#34;Aviation Week and Space Technology&#34; on a regular basis. I knew much about the Wright Brothers but little about his rivals. It wasn't until 2008, when I saw Samuel Langley's aerodrome at the Steven Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia, that I discovered that Langley's machine almost beat the Wrights to the punch. I almost gave up trying to find a comprehensive account of the beginnings of powered flight, but I happened to discover &#34;To Conquer the Air.&#34; James Tobin's account does a great job of describing the backgrounds of the participants and their relationship to eachother. He also explains why the Wrights seemed to be smug and arrogant, when in fact they were extra cautious due to their religious upbringing and involvement with their father's fight with their church. You can also see how a true scientific approach used by the Wrights won out over the hasty plans of their rivals, who tended to take too much for granted. The only thing that might reduce the rating to 4.5 stars is some of the biographical information was too detailed and didn't add anything to the story about the pursuit for powered flight. Other than that, the book was an engrossing, and I recommend it to anyone who is fascinated by the history of flight."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"Easy book to get through, and had some really quick fun parts.

I wanted to hear the other side of the patent battle story and in that regard Tobin's book delivered. I'll agree with some of the reviews that he does tend to go off on tangents that stretch relevance to the limit but for the most part the characters involved help to fill in the picture as to how society as a whole was in those times.The Wrights are portrayed as they were - extremely persistent with episodes of inspired brilliance. It's true; they did come up with a three axis system of control for their machines by reading everything anyone had written about flight at the time, meeting and speaking with those who had experience with experiments and a lot of trial and error. Their method of wing warping wasn't ideal in hindsight and I don't think they understood adverse yaw (aeronautical knowledge that we take for granted today) but their airplane flew and did it better than any of the others that followed shortly after - mainly because they then stopped flying, locked their machine up in a shed, obtained a patent and attempted to sell it for military use to the government for a very high price.There was a world encompassing fever for human flight in those days. I don't think we can truly understand because it is so common today. So it's no wonder that Alexander Graham Bell formed the Aerial Experiment Association (AEA) of which Glenn Curtiss was a member. The group set out to build a flying machine and succeeded within a year. They didn't use wing warping but they did use ailerons which the Wrights contested was patent infringement. Due to the Wrights litigations virtually no one could do any experimental flying in the U.S. without threat of suit.Tobin's book clearly takes the Wrights side and I think they did have a valid case and point however, in light of the mood and fever for aviation at the time I think they really made an error. Their wing warping system was quickly overtaken by superior methods. They insisted that catapult launch and skids were the best methods for take-off and landing. They only developed an upright sitting position because it was a condition for the Army contract. Their ultimate bitterness comes through even in this book as Curtiss, and by association Bell, Langley, Chanute, Selfridge and others are portrayed as scoundrels.In the end, it's a sad tale but both of the books are definitely worth reading if you are an aviation or even history enthusiast."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"Mr Tobin reconstructs masterfully the events leading to Kitty Hawk, and then carries on to about 1910 in the same style.My own specialized knowledge was increased.

Like most Americans I was pretty ignorant of many of the details surrounding not only the Wright brother's landmark powered flight, but also around their attempts to market the idea in their own country.The infamous Kittyhawk flight is at about the middle of the book. I had rather assumed that it was a fait a complete, that once they had proven their technology the rest was as easy as pie. But nothing could be further from the truth.A very worthwhile read / listen if you have any interest at all in the social politics behind one of the greatest accomplishments of the 20th century."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"Popular culture paints the Wright Brothers as a couple of iterant bicycle shop owners who just happened to build a plane that actually flew. Author James Tobin tells another story -- the real story of how Wilbur Wright pioneered the study of flight by studying the soaring patterns of birds as well as scouring all available scientific literature on flight. Later assisted by his brother, Orville, the two learned the secrets of soaring through a series of annual treks to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The Wrights not only succeeded in doing what no man had ever done, they also did so very much on their own. Tobin describes how the Wrights were in a race against other, better funded and sometimes government supported efforts in the U.S. and Europe. Despite the competition, the Wrights willingly shared their secrets with any all interested parties; for them avaiation was not simply a passion, it was a higher calling. Their quest calls to mind the flights of other intrepid aviation pioneers who followed in the footsteps of the Wrights. Meticulously researched and artfully told, &quot;To Conquer the Air&quot; is a must-read for anyone who has ever wondered how it was that man learned to fly."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"While I am a keen reader, I am no literary expert. Ordinarily I would not write a book review of any sort. However, I felt compelled to make an exception in the case of \\"To Conquer the Air\\". Despite my enthusiasm for the subject matter, I found Tobin's style insufferably painful. He is more interested in tangential minutiae than in telling the story. For instance, he uses a single paragraph spanning almost half a page to itemize the contents of McClure's magazine simply to introduce an irrelevant character by the name of Professor Newcomb (p.117). He regularly snatches boredom from the jaws of curiosity with vignettes about the petty struggles between Bishop Wright (Wilbur and Orville's father) and breakaway factions within his church. How an author can mix ingredients like rivalry, deceit, visionary brilliance, and momentous discovery into such a disagreeable literary cocktail is beyond me."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"Imagine a race to achieve a great scientific breakthrough. Imagine this race pits a well-established, well-financed man of reputation against a couple of brothers, unknowns and without formal training or higher education of any kind. Imagine that the brothers, against all odds, emerge triumphant.But your imagination isn't necessary, because this thrilling, dramatic story is true, and it's expertly told by James Tobin in \\"To Conquer The Air.\\" This is the story of the Wright brothers, bicycle shop owners from Dayton, Ohio, who became fascinated by the potential for man to fly. It's also the tale of Samuel Langely, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, who was pursuing his own, ill-fated dreams of flight at the same time. Despite generous backing by the government and private individuals (including his friend, Alexander Graham Bell), Langely wound up the loser in this great competition.Tobin's narrative vividly brings the Wrights, Langely, Bell and the other key players in the first decade of flight back to life. The narrative moves with the briskness of a good adventure story. We share the exhiliaration of the triumphs these man achieve; we're also party to their sorrows at failure.In addition to making these men fully-dimensional, Tobin also manages to recreate the great awe, skepticism and wonder that greeted the inaugural of the age of flight. I can remember my mother telling stories about how, as a girl growing up in a large city in the 1930s, people would still hurry out of their homes to catch a glimpse of an airplane passing overhead. That sense of wonder, long since forgotten, lives once more, and animates these pages."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"It is probably just a coincidence that two of the greatest inventions of the twentieth century were fifty years apart, more or less. Both of them celebrate an anniversary in 2003. The discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA occurred in 1953 and the first flight of the Wright Brothers in North Carolina happened in 1903. James Tobin chronicles the latter event in TO CONQUER THE AIR.The discovery of DNA exemplifies most laboratory research: safe, sterile and subdued, with no risk of personal danger. This discovery was a great intellectual adventure, but without great physical challenge. Aviation is different and it continues to be different to this day, especially given the recent loss of seven brave aviation pioneers in the skies over Texas in a manner in which the Wright Brothers could have envisioned only in their most far-flung fantasies.TO CONQUER THE AIR is primarily a story of intellectual discovery. It follows the parallel work of the Wright Brothers of Dayton, Ohio and Dr. Samuel Langley of the Smithsonian Institution, all of whom were working on powered aircraft in the early days of the twentieth century. The Wright Brothers are famous but unknown; they appear together in our collective unconsciousness on one windy day at Kitty Hawk and then vanish like smoke, brothers but not individuals. Langley's name is attached to an air force base in Virginia but is otherwise forgotten. Tobin does the reader a signal service in bringing the Wrights and Langley to colorful life and in reminding us of the debt we owe to them.Langley's tale is the least known. He was an astronomer who developed an interest in powered flight late in life. As the president of the Smithsonian Institution, he was perfectly placed to lead the aviation revolution. He had the scientific knowledge, the insight and the necessary funding from an Army contract to build a prototype \\"aerodrome\\". He worked with some of the top engineers in the country to build a lightweight gasoline engine to power his craft. An unmanned version flew for about a mile in initial tests. But the great aerodrome was destined for a series of disasters, mostly in the full glare of national publicity.The Wright Brothers had none of these advantages, but Tobin painstakingly explains how they were able to achieve powered flight when the best minds in the country could not. Their work on gliders, their research on lift and their intimate knowledge of the winds at Kill Devil Hill on the North Carolina coast all gave them an edge over Langley. One of the most memorable passages in the book describes how Charlie Taylor, the Wright's mechanic at their bicycle shop, put together a lightweight 12-horsepower gasoline engine out of spare parts, easily outdoing the best engine that Langley could provide for his craft.The story of the race for flight is not especially romantic at times and it gets bogged down in arcane period details. Tobin might have been better advised to leave out the endless wrangling about the position of the Wrights' father in the United Brethren Church, or the kite experiments of Alexander Graham Bell. But Tobin tells his detailed, exacting story well and makes the mysteries of flight comprehensible. He never forgets how dangerous the whole project was (and still is, at times) and brings the Wright Brothers out of the dust of history and into the reader's imaginations --- as individuals, no less. TO CONQUER THE AIR is a fine book that provides a signal service in illuminating the discovery of flight.--- Reviewed by Curtis Edmonds"},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"James Tobin has written a great book. Before I read this book the only thing I knew about the Wright brothers was that they were the first people to get a manned, heavier-than-air machine to fly, and this happened at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina in 1903. I didn't know what happened before and after, and since I didn't know anything about the brothers they were only hazy historical figures. They didn't exist as real people for me. Mr. Tobin has changed that. By the use of extensive excerpts from personal letters and interviews, both Wilbur and Orville come alive in these pages. Thomas Edison once said that inventing was 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. The Wright brothers exemplified that. Wilbur first wrote to the Smithsonian Institution to get all of the material they had on &quot;flying machines,&quot; which obviously wasn't a great deal. The brothers started going to Kitty Hawk in 1900 and after that it was just a lot of hard work, with much trial-and-error. Finally, in 1903, they felt confident enough in the stability of their glider design that they were able to add a motor and make the &quot;historic&quot; flight. Mr. Tobin takes us much further, though, as the &quot;historic&quot; flight we all learned about in school lasted less than a minute and only took place a few feet off of the ground. The brothers realized that their invention was of use, primarily, to the military, so they had to modify things so that the plane had greater stability and could go higher and further. This involved many more practice flights. It is a tribute to Mr. Tobin's skills as a storyteller that this never gets boring. Everytime Wilbur or Orville go up we feel as though we are with them, and it feels exciting. Wilbur went to France to demonstrate to the government what the plane could do. Orville went to Virginia to show his own government the plane's capabilities. In 1909, Wilbur journeyed to New York and flew around the Statue of Liberty and up the Hudson River, between Manhattan and the Palisades. By one of those amazing coincidences of history, the Lusitania was pulling out of New York harbor and the people on board waved and cheered as Wilbur flew overhead. Of course, none of this happened in a vacuum. Mr. Tobin documents the exciting competition between the Wright brothers and Samuel Langley of the Smithsonian, Alexander Graham Bell (whose team included Glenn Curtiss), and others, to be first in the air and first to develop a plane with commercial promise. (It is also a running gag throughout the book that the French, who had pioneered ballooning, kept putting pressure on themselves to &quot;beat&quot; the Americans. Gallic pride was at stake!) The early history of flight resulted in the deaths of many pilots. It is a tribute to the scientific, methodical approach of the brothers that in the 12 years they were &quot;active in the air&quot; they only had one serious accident. Wilbur was only in his mid-forties when he died of typhoid fever in 1912. Orville lived on until 1948, but after Wilbur died Orville's flying days were over. They had been true partners, but Wilbur had been the driving force. After Wilbur died other people came along and built better planes, which could fly longer, faster and higher. But Wilbur and Orville Wright, two sober-minded, poker-faced brothers (a reporter watching them on the beach at Kitty Hawk remarked that they were so nonchalant they resembled a couple of bankers) led the way. Mr. Tobin's triumph is that he doesn't just give us the nuts-and-bolts, he also shows us the hearts and souls of two remarkable men."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"Later in the year, you will, I predict, start seeing centennial reminders of a truly epochal event that has changed us all, and changed our world forever. On 17 December 1903, a couple of brothers from Dayton, Ohio, managed to get their &quot;aeroplane&quot; in the air, and we haven't come down since. There are plenty of biographies of Wilbur and Orville Wright, but in _To Conquer the Air: The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight_ (Free Press), James Tobin has told mainly their story of intellectual discovery, and made it clear how much work the brothers did in making their dreams come about. As such, it tells a great deal about the others who were thinking about flight at around the same time; the Wrights were not experimenting or flying in a vacuum. The upcoming centennial celebrations ought to be worldwide, and readers of this engaging and detailed chronicle will have a much better idea of just what we will be celebrating.The other main potential aeronaut was Dr. Samuel Langley, president of the Smithsonian Institution, and he hung his hopes for flight on a powerful but light engine. The Wrights, on the other hand, started out with the shape of the craft, especially the wings, to lead to flight. It was to get good wind for their kite and glider experiments, and unobstructed landing points, and also secrecy, that they went to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, for their trials. The developed the idea of warping the wing to control the machine, and invented &quot;Kitty Hawk in a box,&quot; the wind tunnel, to do scientific lift experiments. When they discovered that wing warping would not allow full control without the kite yawing into a skid, they added a vertical tail, and it worked; such things could not be taken for granted back then. After successful flights of increasing length on 17 December 1903, the brothers walked four miles to send a telegram home about their success, ending with &quot;INFORM PRESS.&quot; However, the press either printed exaggerated stories, or for the most part, ignored them. Whole nations remained incredulous, and only when Wilbur took a machine to France, and demonstrated it, and had the entire nation excited about him, did the world, including his own country, start paying attention.There are fine portraits here of these taciturn men, their extremely close relationship with each other and with the father and sister within their staunchly Protestant family home. Neither brother married; Wilbur joked that they had no means to support &quot;a wife and a flying machine, too.&quot; There are other players on the fringes here, like Octave Chanute, Alexander Graham Bell, and Glenn Curtiss, who played extremely important roles in flight or in the Wrights' work. Best of all is the account of painstaking work in an endeavor that all of us take for granted now. The book quotes one observer, for instance, as saying the flying machine looked absurd; cars, boats, and trains all traveled lengthwise, but an airplane came at you with the full width of its wings. In the finale of the book, Wilbur takes his machine on a grand sweep around Manhattan, entrancing the enthusiastic crowds beneath. Readers will be able to feel the enthusiasm."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"Jim Tobin has written not just another history of the infancy of manned flight, but the STORY of that brief but exciting, heartbreaking, and triumphant period. The Wright Brothers didn't invent the airplane in a vacuum. They were underdogs in what became a competition. Like in a good novel, the characters, the competitors, gradually unfold. You meet them in their own diverse worlds and then watch them interact. After getting to know the quirky Wright family, the sister and father as well as the brothers, I can't imagine anyone not wanting to cheer when the tinkerers from Ohio solve problems that are misunderstood or botched by esteemed scientists. But, to me, the years after Kitty Hawk are even more engaging. Read the book to find out why it took years for the Wrights to be fully recognized for their accomplishments. There are some goosebump moments here! The book is fairly long but, due to Tobin's seemingly effortless gift for telling history as a story, I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"Since 1788, men had been flying balloons and later dirigibles. Then during the last quarter of the nineteenth century scientists and inventors began addressing the problems of designing and flying a heavier-than-air craft (i.e. an airplane). This book is the story of the Wright brothers and the invention of the airplane-in the Wrights time they were called aeroplanes.To understand the Wright brothers it is necessary to understand the Wright family. Throughout the book, the text devotes several pages to the Wright family as related to the two famous brothers. Both Wilbur and Orville were highly intelligent self-made men. The author relates how, without advanced education or prior job experience, at age twenty-two, Wilbur successfully defended his father in a church dispute. The author states \\"He argued with a mastery of facts, logic, and wit that veteran lawyers would later envy.\\" Both brothers were proficient in math, physics and other sciences.Their interest in flying began in 1894 when McClure's Magazine contained an article on the German flying pioneer Otto Lilienthal. The Wrights read everything they could on flying experiments and in May 1899 wrote the Smithsonian asking for any Smithsonian papers and a list of other works in print on flying. After countless hours observing pigeons birds in flight, they concluded that balance and control were the key to flying and conceived \\"wing warping\\" to provide lateral control. The author (James Tobin) narrates how in 1900 the Wrights began testing their theories by flying gliders as kites at Kitty Hawk North Carolina because the Kitty Hawk wind conditions met their experimental requirements.Their gliders were biplanes. On October 20, 1900 \\"Will had never made a free flight in a glider. Yet on this day he chose to defy the world's only authorities on the basis of only his own calculations and preliminary experiments.\\" Will made several flights. Their 1901 glider was also successful and provided much design data and flight experience. The text notes that Wrights considered that control and careful accumulation of flying experience were the keys to success. They proceeded in a planned/organized manner. The author recounts their experiments with manned glider flights, relating how they found the data in Lilienthal's aeronautical tables did not correctly determine lift and drag. In order to obtain the required data, they built a wind tunnel and evaluated airfoil shapes developing the required data.Following the success of their 1902 glider, in 1903 using their own data they built a larger glider adding propellers and a gasoline engine, both of their own design, making it an aeroplane. Without first testing the machine as a glider, at 10:35 am on December 17, 1903 Orville made a flight of 120 feet in 12 seconds, the first manned flight. Before the end of the day, Wilbur had flown 852 feet in 59 seconds. In 1904, the Wrights built a new and improved aeroplane and began flying in open field outside of Dayton. The author notes that once \\"Will chased a flock of birds in two circles of the field.\\" By the end of the 1905 flying season the Wrights had become competent aviators. Press coverage of the historic 1903 was scant and often inaccurate. While several invited people including reporters witnessed the 1904/1905 flights, press coverage was still limited. Broad patent protection was granted in 1906, and the Wrights temporarily stopped flying.During this same period several competitors both domestic and foreign were working to be the first to conquer the air. The author does an excellent job summarizing the efforts of these competitors, which included Alexander Graham Bell and foremost, Smithsonian Secretary Samuel Langley. Langley made an unsuccessful attempt at manned flight on December 8th just nine days before the Wrights' successful December 17, 1903 flights. The Wrights and Langley had approached manned flight differently; the Wrights had been correct. Because of the Wrights' reticence, many refused to believe their success. The Army, who funded Langley by $ 50,000, showed little interest in the Wright aeroplane. In 1908 Wilbur Wright took a new aeroplane to France and starting in August began a series of spectacular flights establishing beyond doubt their right to being the first conquers of the air. Also in 1908 the Army became gave the Wright's a contract. The text narrates Orville's 1908 flights at Fort Myer, which after successful pre-acceptance flights resulted in a crash on September 17, 1908 that killed his passenger Lieutenant Thomas Selfridge.The author gives an interesting account Wilbur's 1909 Hudson-Fulton Celebration flights around the Statue of Liberty and later up the Hudson River to Grant's Tomb and then back-down the river. After these flights, it was generally accepted that the Wright's had been the first to fly. Orville in the fall of 1911, when testing a new glider at Kitty Hawk, set a world's record for soaring-nine minutes and forty-five seconds-that stood for ten years. The text recounts the bitter competition that continued, especially from Glenn Curtiss. Certain Wright family members blamed Curtiss for Wilbur's premature death in 1912.The book ends with an EPILOGUE concluding with the 1948 dedication of the original 1903 Wright Flyer at the Smithsonian.This is an excellent well-written account of the invention of the airplane. The Wright brothers were much more than a couple of bicycle shop bumpkins; they were by any measure serious gifted scientists."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"Most of us take airplanes and flying pretty much for granted these days -- in fact, most of us have even flown somewhere. But a century ago, most people believed that if God had intended us to fly, He would have given us wings.In To Conquer the Air: The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight, author James Tobin takes us back to those early days and we meet Will and Orv Wright (I couldn't tell them apart until I read this book), Samuel Pierpont Langley (Secretary of the Smithsonian and spectacular flying failure), Octave Chanute (Wright friend and encourager), Alexander Graham Bell, Glenn Curtiss, and a host of others dedicated to becoming the first person to fly a powered airplane.Tobin weaves his characters together not just with historical accuracy, but so they live and breathe and interact. The reader gets to know these people and begins to understand the challenges that being the first to fly present. Where do I find a light but powerful motor? How do I control this contraption in the air? How do I launch it into the air? How do I land it? As we all know now, the Wrights, those meticulous, cautious bicycle mechanics from Dayton, set established science on its ear when they finally triumphed on 17 December, 1903.This book is a must for anyone interested in flying. It's also a must for anyone interested in history. For everyone else, I'd recommend it as a fascinating read about the patience, drive, discipline, insight and forsight (and lack of same) by a group of people seeking the same goal in remarkably different ways."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"This book would make a great research paper. Many of the things are well documented and described. I do believe the author lost his focus. He seems to forget that this book is supposed to be about the Wright Brothers' triumph. Instead he spends more time talking about Dr. Langely and his failure, and the Wright Brothers' father's dispute with his church.The most disappointing chapter of this book was the part about the day, Dec. 17th, when the Wright Brothers flew for the first time. Here, Mr. Tobin spends almost the entire chapter describing Langley's failure. Then at the end of the chapter, he spends only a few pages describing the one of the most important days in history, the first successful flight.I have no idea why Mr. Tobin would spend as much time talking about a failure, Dr. Langely, as he did about the Wright Brothers.This book is really dry reading. It has no sense of adventure, and especially no sense of excitement. He does not evey try to build up any feeling of suspense leading up to the first successful flight. All of that is done in a few paragraphs.Overall, I find this book disappointing."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"This could have been a tangled &amp; complicated story, or it could have been a one-dimensional story of the Wright Brothers and nobody else. Fortunately, Tobin has the skills as a researcher &amp; writer to sustain about half a dozen different story lines without having the whole structure collapse. I am not sure which was harder --- keeping this book coherent or perfecting the art of flight.What was most interesting for me were how different the incentives were for the various compeitors. For some the incentive was the pure pursuit of science (the Wrights &amp; Alexander Bell), for some the incentive was securing a place in history (S.P. Langley &amp; Octave Chanute), and for some it was the quest for profit &amp; commercial success, plain &amp; simple (Glen Hammond).Just the motives were extremely varied, so too were the approaches to solving the challenge of flight. Langley assumed that the biggest part of the puzzle was power; build an engine strong enough and the other details would just work themselves out. If Langley had had a jet engine available, he might have gotten away with it --- although I wouldn't want to be flying in any plane developed along those lines. The Wrights on the other hand, saw the challenge of lift to be the key to the puzzle --- build a device that could achieve near-vertical lift and you could probably manage without a super-powerful engine.One comes away from this book with an enhanced respect for the natural scientific brilliance of the Wrights. So few of us actually have any knowledge of the systematic approach the Wrights took in solving the problem of lift in their little wind tunnel. Never ones to get ahead of themselves, the Wrights made sure they had explored every wing configuration they could think of before moving to the next stage of development.Tobin could have ended the story with the Wright's first flight, but he is too good of a historian not to look at the larger picture. As soon as one battle was won, other battles needed to be fought. It is open to debate as to who ultimately won this war, depending on what your perspective was.This was a great book. Tobin makes aerodynamics pretty understandable to almost anyone, and he has a great narrative skill. You will be left with a much greater respect for what a magnificent scientific feat achieving flight was --- after all, almost everyone else ultimately failed."},{"Title":"To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","review":"If you had asked me, before I had read this book, what I knew about the Wright Brothers, I would have answered like most Americans would: \\"They invented the airplane!\\"Then I read \\"To Conquer the Air\\", and was hooked! Without a doubt, I list this book as one of my top Ten. . .and I read a lot!

True enough, but this topic has been covered by many other authors in a more convincing (not to mention enjoyable) fashion. This is not to put off Mr. O'Brien, as he is a talented writer, but perhaps his discussion should be left for him at dinner parties and the lecture circuit.As stated in the review title, it is an enjoyable read if you are interested in twentieth century American culture and film (the films cited index is huge), but as for worthwhile information that could be transformed into knowledge or wisdom... that's another story.

Not all were so positive about the rest of the book so I'll just politely disagree. I thought the book lived up to the opening line and did an excellent job of setting up the series with Tremaine et all the characters. M.Wells does an excellent job of developing the characters and as I'm reading book two of this series, she continues doing so in it as well. I grew up reading Andre Norton (and loved her books even now as a Sr. adult) and M.Wells is doing an excellent job of writing with a distinctly more mature feel. If you like SyFy this is an excellent writer to read, and this book was very good."},{"Title":"The Wizard Hunters: Book One of the Fall of Ile-Rien (The Fall of Ile-Rien, Bk. 1)","review":"You can tell in the first few chapters that there was another book that preceeded this book. However, I learned that that book is virtually impossible to get in the U.S. Anyway, it starts a little slow, but then really picks up. Very good book!"},{"Title":"The Wizard Hunters: Book One of the Fall of Ile-Rien (The Fall of Ile-Rien, Bk. 1)","review":"Tremaine Valiarde has a hard time feeling comfortable in her own skin, much less in a society regarding her as a mentally unstable recluse. Ironically, she finds herself in a unique position to possibly tip the balance of Ile-Rien's failing defense against an invading force intent on conquering the land, culling the sorcerers, and enslaving the people. Apathetic with living, but not apathetic to life, Tremaine not only fights to save the Ile-Rien people from the Gardier, her \\"uncle\\" Arisilde the sorcerer from internment, but also to save herself from self-destruction.A refreshingly rare quality among high fantasy adventure creators, prodigiously talented author Martha Wells masterfully reveals vividly detailed worlds through the usage of dialogue and actions versus the more typical descriptive text insertions that can tedious and disruptive to the storyline. The Fall of Ile-Rien trilogy is told from multiple viewpoints; however, it is the primary character's viewpoint that allows us to experience with amazing clarity and perception the mistakes, self-doubt, and growth propelling this intelligent adventure series. Extremely gifted, Martha Wells' extraordinary style in the Fall of Ile-Rien trilogy makes for a very enjoyable, engaging high fantasy read.For a more in-depth understanding of the Ile-Rien cultural history, Element of Fire - predating the Fall of Ile-Rien trilogy by a few generations - is loosely tied to this series and serves as a nice prequel of sorts; whereas, Death of the Necromancer following the adventures of Nicholas Valiarde, Tremaine's father, and the sorcerer Arisilde Damal adds helpful insight and dimension to these two returning faces. For a rewarding high fantasy experience, read Element of Fire followed by Death of the Necromancer and ending with the Fall of Ile-Rien trilogy.Martha Wells' Fall Of Ile-Rien Trilogy Series in order: 1 - The Wizard Hunters, 2 - The Ships of Air, 3 - The Gate of Gods."},{"Title":"The Wizard Hunters: Book One of the Fall of Ile-Rien (The Fall of Ile-Rien, Bk. 1)","review":"This was the first book I read by Martha Wells and remains one of my favorites--and that is saying something considering the range on her books is extremely good to utterly phenomenal. Tremaine Valliarde is an unlikely fantasy heroine. She's a little scattered, isn't the one with magical powers nor prowess with a sword. She's quite competent with a firearm I suppose...but she doesn't trust herself with them given she opens the book trying to find a creative way to commit suicide while bringing in a verdict of natural causes. She is witty, funny, sarcastic, has little patience for rules whether societal or legal, and is absolutely fantastic. She is one of the most memorable heroines I've ever read about and I rather wish I lived around the corner from her. And that's just the first character you meet.Martha Wells' greatest gift is her ability to create complex fascinating engaging characters. No matter how strange their setting or on occassion, in other books, their species, you can't help but get the sense that you have really come to know these people--and that they are well worth knowing. Her worlds, settings and cultures are also rich and fascinating. This book has several. The setting that gives its name to the trilogy is a continuation of the world of Ile Rien introduced earlier in its history in the stand-alone novels The Element of Fire and Death of the Necromancer. Martha Wells is one of the few fantasy writers I know of who has the vision to have her world evolve technologically and culturally over time, moving her world from swords and matchlock pistols to Holmsian gaslight world and finally to the WWI-esque period of early electricity, telephone switchboards, fashionable magazines and majestic cruise-liners...all now suffering from a relentless enemy they don't know how to fight.I'll resist giving too many spoilers about some of the interesting twists and turns these books have, but for those who are interested in a lively fantasy world that breaks out of the primary two camps of \\"medieval fantasy\\" and \\"urban fantasy\\" to give something vibrant and new, with great magic, adventure, and memorable fantastic characters, I cannot recommend Wizard Hunters and the rest of the Ile Rien books highly enough."},{"Title":"The Wizard Hunters: Book One of the Fall of Ile-Rien (The Fall of Ile-Rien, Bk. 1)","review":"I am an enormous fan of Martha Wells' entire ouvre, I'll lead off with that so you know where I'm coming from. I read Element of Fire first, when she posted it serially on her Livejournal, and then bought all three books of this trilogy when the last one was released. They arrived on the morning of a horrific snowstorm that shut my city down for three days, and so I curled up in the bay window with a tealight candle and read them all start-to-finish while everyone else sat around complaining about the cold and dark. Ha! I didn't even know where I was.These books are, on the surface, perfect comfort reading. Lots of swash and buckle, brave characters fighting evil, etc., etc., and there's never a dull moment.But that's not why I was so enthralled-- plenty of swashbuckling adventures don't manage to bring me along for the ride, and i put the book down and never come back to them.Wells has characters, phenomenal characters. Nobody is really a stereotype. All of her books and even her short stories share this; everyone is three-dimensional, even if drawn in only a few strokes. They all have shadows, they all have their own motivations; nobody's a prop. Even her disposable henchmen are human.This trilogy has a protagonist, a young woman named Tremaine Valiarde, plus an ensemble cast; POV is primarily Tremaine's, but for other scenes dips into a number of different characters; it is, after all, somewhat epic, and lots of things happen, and Tremaine does not personally witness them all.I especially enjoyed Tremaine because she is so human. Now, having read the Death of the Necromancer, which deals with the adventures of her father, Nicholas Valiarde, and her mother, Madeleine Denare, it is fascinating to see how skillfully Tremaine is drawn as a descendant of these two, and yet is very much her own person. Wells is an excellent characterizer.And so, in the years since I first bought this book, I have come back to it again, and again, and again. It's not a comfort reread, it is a visit with some old friends."},{"Title":"The Wizard Hunters: Book One of the Fall of Ile-Rien (The Fall of Ile-Rien, Bk. 1)","review":"IF ITS BY MARTHA WELLS, READ IT!! I HAVE READ AND ENJOYED EVERYTHING SHE HAS PUT OUT SO FAR AND NEVER DISAPPOINTED BEFORE YOU READ THE WIZARD HUNTERS SERIES, I SUGGEST YOU READ DEATH OF A NECROMANCER AS ITS RELATED HAVE FUN, READ MORE!"},{"Title":"The Wizard Hunters: Book One of the Fall of Ile-Rien (The Fall of Ile-Rien, Bk. 1)","review":"Wizard Hunters has a great opening line. Unfortunately, it never quite lives up to the promise so tantalizingly held out to us. The good news is the character we meet in that first line, Tremaine, holds up well throughout the book. In general, the characterization is one of the book's stronger points. The story premise is also a highlight, offering up an unusual meshing of cultures--one with magic and science/technology working side by side, another where technology has yet to form and magic is evil, and yet a third (the Gardier), set on invading the first two through a malevolent combination of science and magic.The side-by-side use of modern technology and magic adds a welcome freshness to the fantasy, as does the conflict between two cultures, one employing magic and one fearing it, that seemingly must unite to face a common foe. That conflict and alliance is played out on a small scale in the Wizard Hunters, focusing on a small band of characters thrown together into hostile territory.As mentioned, characterization is strong throughout and the main character is especially well-drawn and an enjoyable presence. A few characters could use some more depth, as could the entire Gardier, a weakness Wells addresses in the second book (ships of air).The major flaws in Hunters belong to the plot. It is at times a bit repetitive, but the smooth flow, often breezy tone, and likable characters make this a relatively minor fault. A larger one is the overreliance on deus ex machina (literally) through Tremaine's use of the mysterious sphere given to her as a child. It too often pops out just when needed, lessening the sense of tension at some of the more climatic moments. Happily, this happens much less in the sequel which is overall I think a better book. The Wizard Hunters is a solid start to an interesting set-up and if the improvement between the first and second book is any sign, the series should only get better. A solid recommendation with a nod the idea of reading ahead to the second book."},{"Title":"The Wizard Hunters: Book One of the Fall of Ile-Rien (The Fall of Ile-Rien, Bk. 1)","review":"The book has a great opening line, the only things that look like flaws turn out to be significant plot elements that make sense and are explained by the end of the first book, and the series holds together well.Steampunk (Victorian era, or about, slightly gritty fantasy set in an alternative world with dirigibles, cannon and fire arms, spells and ocean liners)The series works together well, each book makes solid progress, the main character's legendary father does not overshadow her, the series elements integrate well with the prequel (Death of the Necromancer) and by the end everything makes sense and leaves you satisfied.You won't feel as if you've wasted your time or your money with this book or this series."},{"Title":"The Wizard Hunters: Book One of the Fall of Ile-Rien (The Fall of Ile-Rien, Bk. 1)","review":"Though not quite up to the standard of Death of the Necromancer, The Wizard Hunters was actually a very good book.

Still, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Wizard Hunters: Book One of the Fall of Ile-Rien (The Fall of Ile-Rien, Bk. 1)","review":"Martha Well's new novel, the Wizard Hunters, is a great epic adventure story.

She's managed to make it to a very elite list of mine - the buy on sight list. Wells has an ability to draw excellent characters without sacrificing any attention to plot or setting. In fact, throughout her books (The two stand-alones and the Il-Rien books), she's managed to explore new and interesting worlds and people them with characters you want to spend time with.This new book, the beginning to a trilogy set in Il-Rien (at least initially) doesn't disapoint. Tremaine is one of her most engaging heroines, especially as that's probably the last way she would think of herself. As is usual for Wells, secondary characters aren't stinted; there aren't any two-dimensional people wandering around in the background while your attention is supposed to be focused on the leads. I keep reccomending Martha Wells to friends, and at this rate, I will be able to keep on doing so."},{"Title":"The Wizard Hunters: Book One of the Fall of Ile-Rien (The Fall of Ile-Rien, Bk. 1)","review":"The first sentence of this book should grab just about anyone. Right off hand, you know this is a suicidal heroine, but you don't know why. You also get the idea that one of the characters might be an unidentified wizard, but you don't know that for sure. And it is very much to the author's credit that both questions are resolved by the end of the book in such a way that's true to the characters involved, rather than carrying them over to the next book.Obviously, THE FALL OF ILE-RIEN trilogy will be concerned with revolution and social change in this land of magic and of wizards. The beginning book deals with the attack and conquest of this land by the Gardier, a mysterious enemy helped by their evil wizards. Tremaine Vallarde who lacks magical skills but possesses a sphere which has within it power to defeat the Gardier finds herself along with a female student wizard, a former guardian with wizardly powers, and a young security agent who's apparantly enamored of her transported to a strange world. The Gardier are using a base on this world as a gateway to Ile-Rien. The wizard hunters referred to in the book's titled belong to a race which knows only of the evil wizards who misuse their magic.This alternate world's distrust of those who work magic along with the initial inability of the two races to speak a common language causes an uneasy alliance, and so the story and adventures go from there.One of the good points of this story is the lack of romantic entanglements in spite of the fact that two of the five younger characters are comely women. The strong characterization of these characters makes it obvious that there'll be no fast blooming infatuations or love here, although I expect that will change in the middle book of the trilogy.And so vivid characterization, deft plotting, underlying logic and unanswered questions make this a most enjoyable read with a quite satisfying ending, and yet a yearning to read more about Ile-rien. Highly recommended fantasy adventure."},{"Title":"The Wizard Hunters: Book One of the Fall of Ile-Rien (The Fall of Ile-Rien, Bk. 1)","review":"The Wizard Hunters underwhelmed me. It is competently written and features at least two well-drawn characters, but the storyline and writing did not engage me. The pacing felt imbalanced: slow at the start, quick in the middle, and then almost too fast at the end. The writing seemed dispassionate to me, as if the author were reporting events instead of showing them. To be fair, I credit the author with creating intelligent characters. In other novels, I often know things before the characters do; in this novel, Tremaine came to conclusions around the same time I did. I read a lot of fantasy and do not consider The Wizard Hunters a great achievement; however, I will read another Martha Wells' novel to see if my average opinion of this novel is warranted."},{"Title":"The Wizard Hunters: Book One of the Fall of Ile-Rien (The Fall of Ile-Rien, Bk. 1)","review":"Martha Wells has made a career by working at the boundary between magic and science, and in \\"The Wizard Hunters,\\" she returns her readers to Ile-Rien, a place she's brought us to twice before.The setting in this volume seems to approximate the Europe of the 1920s. There's electricity, telephones, and automobiles, as well as wizards, wards, and spells. And the land is faced with an alien invasion in the form of \\"the Gardier,\\" conquerers from elsewhere who arrive in spellbusting dirigibles that can wreck things made of metal. Like guns and electronic equipment.But where is elsewhere? The author's heroine, Tremaine Valiarde (daughter of Nicholas Valiarde from \\"Death of the Necromancer\\"), is enlisted--well she enlists herself really in order to avoid her suicidal impulses. As Florian the young witch tells her: \\"It's like you're two people. One of them is a flighty artist, and I like her. The other one is bloody-minded and ruthless and finds scary things funny and I'm not sure I like her very much.\\"Whatever she is, she, along with her magical sphere that seems to have a mind of its own and can provide a counter-attack against the Gardier, turns into one of the most fascinatingly capable (if neurotic) protagonists you're likely to meet on the pages of any book. And in addition you'll meet not only her and the young witch, but also a host of people, from several societies on two different worlds. And there are plenty of scaring things to be encountered also.The author's burnished prose moves along in a stately fashion, overcoming along the way a few apparent deficiencies in the plot. Ms. Wells occasionally manages to write herself into a corner, forcing her to create side quests to resolve plot issues that she needn't have created in the first place. On the whole, though, the author delivers on her promises.Notes and asides: \\"The Wizard Hunters\\" is, yes, the first of three; but it concludes satisfactorily. It's BOOK 1 of the Fall of Ile-Rein alright; not a thinly disguised PART 1 that will leave you dangling. So fear not; read it now. No reason why you need to wait for the conclusion."},{"Title":"The Wizard Hunters: Book One of the Fall of Ile-Rien (The Fall of Ile-Rien, Bk. 1)","review":"Some qualifications. I am more a fan of heroic/sword & sorcery style fantasy. Robert E. Howard, Fritz Leiber, Michael Moorcock, C. L. Moore, JRR Tolkien, etc. Next, I did not realize until I finshed the book there is a prequel (Death of a Necromancer).Ile-Rien is a land populated by wizards which is under attack by the Gardier, a mysterious enemy in dirigible like ships who use technology and magic together. Ile-Rien is slowly succumbing to the attacks, until the wizards realize they have a weapon to try against the Gardier. This mission to try the weapon against the Gardier is told from the viewpoint of a woman named Tremaine.At 454 pages, this story plods along. There are a lot of descriptive passages throughout; while this can be seen as evidence that Wells has tried to create a convincing fantasy world, it gets in the way of telling the story and moving the plot along. I would argue, that Wells trips up in the creation of her fantasy world though when she mentions things like automobiles, coffee, and telephones.The epsiodic nature of the book is vaguely reminiscent of the old pulps at times, with Tremaine and her friends going from \\"Burroughs-esque\\" adventure to adventure. The interspersed, detailed descriptions are what slow the story down though. (Yes, I don't need every single detail described--I have an imagination...)The book also suffers from the plot being somewhat predictable. The only real surprise comes towards the end when the source of the Gardier's power is revealed--whether Wells develops this in the rest of the series remains to be seen.From looking at the Amazon reviews, its clear this book will appear to some people. And that's great. If you like some of the writers I mentioned above though, I think you will find this book disappointing."},{"Title":"The Wizard Hunters: Book One of the Fall of Ile-Rien (The Fall of Ile-Rien, Bk. 1)","review":"Martha Wells weaves a nicely complicated tapestry of mythology in The Wizard Hunters, the first installment of The Fall of Ile-Rien series. The book's very first sentence indicates exactly how unusual a fantasy epoch Wells writes: \\"It was nine o'clock at night and Tremaine was trying to find a way to kill herself that would bring in a verdict of natural causes in Court when someone banged on the door.\\"After hooking the reader's interest, Wells becomes an unrelenting story teller, blending the mythology of a modernistic culture with the mythology of a aborigine culture. In Tremaine Valiarde's possession is a mysterious sphere of unknown power. The sphere is a childhood toy given Tremaine by an uncle who turned out to be a wizard of enormous power.A bizarre army of beings is besieging Tremaine's homeland. These beings-Gardier-control powerful airships that seemingly come from nowhere to attack Tremaine's homeland of Ile-Rien.The sphere transports Tremaine and some friends to an island in another world. Coincidentally, the island is a base for the airships of the Gardier. Before Tremaine makes her accidental journey, two brothers from a nearby aborigine tribe journey to the island to see if an enemy sorcerer is still controlling the island. These two young men discover a hive of strange activity and what they initially believe are strange flying whales.Wells writes an extremely good story that ranks with the likes of Modesitt, Hobb, Haydon, and Douglass. She weaves a colorful cast of characters, story, action, setting, and other elements into a powerful fantasy tale. Tremaine Valiarde is an unusual heroine and it will be interesting to see how she develops as a character throughout the rest of The Fall of Ile-Rien."},{"Title":"The Wizard Hunters: Book One of the Fall of Ile-Rien (The Fall of Ile-Rien, Bk. 1)","review":"The off world Gardier use powerful magic to invade the land of Ile-Rien. The off-world military are winning on all fronts defeating the natives at sea, on the land, and in the air. Unless something is done quickly, the people of Ile-Rien will become enslaved. A magical artifact attached to Tremaine Valiarde transports her and two sorceress to the Isle of Storms.They meet the Syrneiese warrior Ilias and Giliead who have come to the island to see if an evil wizard has taken up residence there. The two groups team up when the Gardier, who have an outpost in a huge cave on the island, captures them. Working together, they escape and go to the homeland of Ilias and Giliead and then back to Ile-Rien to get an army together that will destroy the Gardier outpost and subsequently the means of traveling between the two worlds.Book one of the Fall of Ile-Rien is a fantastic opening installment in what looks to be a great fantasy epic. The heroine, a potential suicide victim, finds she has something to live for, as she becomes a freedom fighter intent on saving two worlds from Gardier domination. Martha Wells is an excellent world builder, a writer who makes the audience believes that the Gardier and the two worlds they want to conquer actually exist.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Wizard Hunters: Book One of the Fall of Ile-Rien (The Fall of Ile-Rien, Bk. 1)","review":"This is a difficult book to discuss simply because so very many of the exceptional and noteworthy things I could mention are also significant spoilers.Suffice it to say that the main characters are all interesting and engaging, and that there are no cookie-cutter heroes or heroines here. Tremaine in particular is not what anyone would expect -- she's not even what she would expect! -- and that's part of the book's humor and appeal.Although this is an 'epic' story, it's definitely not in the Tolkien tradition, and the settings and actions and resolutions feel completely new. Ile-Rien and the Gardier are considerably more 'modern' than your typical magic users, their cultures using a mix of both magic and machinery. Which is another point in the book's favor: the different cultures are fleshed out and real. The cultural issues feel real.This is a story with layers. The characters are three-dimensional. The world is three dimensional. There is more going on than is immediately apparent in the first few chapters. Exactly how Ilias and Giliead fit in to Tremaine's story is unexpected.I absolutely enjoyed this book and the entire series. While not my absolute favorite, that's not a flaw in the story but a matter of personal preference (I generally like a little more fluff and a little less dark). It is, however, definitely something I would recommend (and have), and will read again."},{"Title":"The Wizard Hunters: Book One of the Fall of Ile-Rien (The Fall of Ile-Rien, Bk. 1)","review":"I am a little bit annoyed at myself that I waited so long to read this book. I always really like Wells' novels, but there is something unassuming about them in that I often find that too long goes between reading one book and the next. Before this I've readThe Death of the Necromancer,The Element of FireandWheel of the Infinite.This book is the first installment in a series called The Fall of Ile-Rien, but it isn't the first visit Wells has made to that world. I was delighted to come back to the world and the Valiarde family, and even though it has been a while, I found it easy to swim right back into the text.Wells has a particular way of combining steampunk elements with high fantasy to create easily digestible and fun stories that don't have as many sharp edges as some of the more pure steampunk writers. Whether this is a good or bad thing depends entirely on the reader's mood and what they would like to get out of the book. She is also quite a skilled writer, and has a vivid way with character and world-building that I particularly enjoy.I had one major quarrel with this book, and that has to do with the set-up of Tremaine Valiard's character arc.(I don't actually think that it's a spoiler to reveal something from the first paragraph of the book, but if you don't want to know *anything* about the plot, then don't read below this sentence, please.)The book opens with Tremaine contemplating suicide and this is a character element that is supposed to carry her change arc and internal struggle. I found it nearly wholly unbelievable and not well-grounded in the back story that we are given. This alone made it very difficult for me to get into the book in the early part of the novel. I will admit, however, that I lack a sense of humor about suicidal tendencies and ideation so perhaps I was simply too sensitive to the subject to like the way that Wells used it as a device.All in all, very much looking forward to readingThe Ships of Air."},{"Title":"The Wizard Hunters: Book One of the Fall of Ile-Rien (The Fall of Ile-Rien, Bk. 1)","review":"This is the first book in The Fall Of Ile-Rien trilogy. It wasn't until I had started reading it that I realised that there is a prequel called THE DEATH OF THE NECROMANCER that features many of the characters prominently mentioned (but not actually there) in this story.Tremaine is the daughter of Ile-Rien's greatest thief and spy. She's also the owner of a sphere that was given to her as a child which may prove the last salvation of their people in the three year long war against the Gardier. This war and Tremaine's world of magic and technology give her home a feeling of either first or second world war London under siege. Her people are on the verge of loosing everything to an enemy that they seem to have no defence against.As an introductory novel to a trilogy this is a good read. It moves along at a fast pace and the final chapters bring unexpected knowledge to all the characters. I'm looking forward to reading book 2 in this series, THE SHIPS OF THE AIR."},{"Title":"Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River","review":"For a NON white water person the book describes the adrenaline addiction, self challenges, skills necessary to tackle the Tsangpo River, probably the most dangerous and inaccesible river in the world. It describes the physical challenges, political and cultural differences of sherpas and carriers. It describes the kyakers intrusion into sacred territory and the needless aggression of China over Tibet's indigenous people. Insight into high-achievers, and an unseen part of the world."},{"Title":"Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River","review":"As official journalist for Outside Magazine on the expedition, Peter Heller had the opportunity of a lifetime: accompany a group of world class kayakers on the holy grail, a first decent of Tibet's Tsangpo River. Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River chronicles the adventure, from the banks of the river to the insane portages up neighboring mountain passes. The Tsangpo falls through one of the deepest gorges in the world and a fabled waterfall on its course gave rise the legend of Shangri-La. To say that it is a magical place is an understatement and Heller, despite a nagging hip injury, had no choice but to take up this unique challenge.Unfortunately for Heller, Scott Lindgren, the kayaker-in-charge of the expedition, was fairly resistant to the idea of a writer along for the trip. He was compelled to take one if he wanted the funding Outside was providing. That said, Heller's comments to other expedition members that his resulting book could be his Into Thin Air certainly didn't lighten the mood. Perhaps Heller failed to realize that Into Thin Air was so successful because the expedition was a tragic failure resulting in several deaths. If Krackauer's group had simply made it up and back, his account would have been far less popular than it is today. This dynamic sets up most of the drama in the story, Heller battling to tell the \\"complete\\" story and Scott pushing back and asserting his authority. However, the most shocking drama came when the group faced a porter revolt during which porters threatened to kill the kayakers and robbed them at knife point.Overall, the trip was incredibly successful. The kayakers spend more time actually paddling (rather than portaging) than they anticipated and the few close calls experienced have happy endings. Heller's account is interesting, but it lacks a really compelling grip on the reader. For such an intense trip, the book is rather short and you get the felling much is left unsaid. The landscape and scene description is standard at best, but Heller has moments of intriguing insight and clarity. Considering the accomplishment, this is a great follow-up to Todd Balf's The Last River."},{"Title":"Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River","review":"After reading many adventure stories in the past few years, this was the least satisfying. The whitewater descriptions were not clear enough for the uninitiated to appreciate and understand. The two included maps were not very helpful either. Photographs would have helped. Although the paddlers were risking their lives amost every day, I never got involved with them enough to care. In the end I felt sorry for the author who himself endured so much pain but was restricted by the paddlers from using all means of communicating the story."},{"Title":"Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River","review":"I just finished this book and was overall disappointed in how Peter portrays this historic feat. First of all, he is not kayaking the Tsangpo. Rather, he relays on the kayakers for their point of view. To make matters worst, the kayakers don't like him (as he states often in the book), b/c they believe he is there to exploit them (which he is). Instead of telling of their trek, he tells his story of being on the ground. He doesn't even follow the kayakers, like his coworker Charlie, who works as a photographer. Plus, there are zero pictures.I would have more respect for this book, if he actually kayaked the river. It is just not the same. Also, this is his first book and he has trouble keeping a train of thought. Often, he jumps from story to story which leaves me confused and wanting more. He does not create good imagery, either. Overall, skip this book, unless you want to hear about how to trek, not kayak, the Tsangpo Gorge."},{"Title":"Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River","review":"After finishing 'High Crimes' I wanted to be transported back to the Himalayas. 'Hell or High Water' called my curiosity and so I embarked on it. I should say that white water kayaking isn't as appealing as high mountain climbing. There is something to be said about going up as opposed to floating down that makes one feel excited.'Hell or High Water' never seems to find equilibrium, something to build upon and expand. The descriptions of the landscape are plain, almost unimaginative. The story is simple, not in its totality, but in its mundaneness.I don't recommend it."},{"Title":"Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River","review":"I enjoyed this book. However a lot of the writing focus is off the river."},{"Title":"Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River","review":"the book was pretty good but it didn't really capture what was going on in the water. Unfortunately the writer didn't have first hand expierance of the kayaking in the gorge.The book focused more on his joyage than the kayakers.It was like a documentary on the film crew instead of the subject. Pictures were needed for visualazation purposes and also a crude map would have been nice."},{"Title":"Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River","review":"I have read the Outside Cover story \\"Mission Accomplished\\" June 2002 about this expedition. Great article! I have scene Scott Lindgren's, Into the Tsangpo Gorge DVD. Unreal! And I have now read a book by a writer that gives a one sided point of view about personal drama that takes completely away from the accomplishment. Heller is desperate. Where is the action? Heller goes on these ridiculous rants that have nothing to do with this expedition. What is even more out of hand is the fact the he feels so desperate to get his story that he was willing to lie and say just about anything to make this book into something that it is bviously not. Not worth reading the paper it is printed on. All I can hope for is that one of the team members writes a book that will give us a real look into what it took and what is was like to be apart of this incredible expedition. Heller should be ashamed of himself. Buy the Into the Tsangpo DVD or read the cover story in Outside Magazine before spending your money on this book."},{"Title":"Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River","review":"The only paragraphs worth reading are the once Heller got from other books, I'd suggest you'd read those if you want to know about the Tsangpo's history.Otherwise this book is a story written by a man who has little to no self-knowledge, but seems to know what Lindgren (the expedition leader) thinks and feels. Heller criticizes others but doesn't have the gut to look at his own actions."},{"Title":"Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River","review":"I bought and read this book (from Amazon) after seeing it on display at my local Borders. A growing interest in Tibet combined with a passion for non-fiction adventure stories made this a perfect choice. After finishing the book, I received the DVD (Into the Tsangpo Gorge), which brings the whole story to life. However, I am certain I would not have enjoyed watching the DVD as much were in not for having read the book first. If you already have the DVD, I highly recommend the book to round out the story. And if you've already read the book... the DVD is a MUST.While I agree with some reviewers that Heller is not on equal footing with Jon Krakauer, I am a bit surprised at the degree to which they dismiss Heller's writing. First off, the story itself is so compelling that -- even if what these critical reviewers say about the writing style were true -- you would be doing yourself a disservice to dismiss this book entirely. That said, I found that Heller did an excellent job of creating a vivid picture of the Tsangpo Gorge and the harrowing trek that the expedition team faced both on and off the river. When you consider the semi-reluctant cooperation he faced from the expedition leader, Scott Lindgren, and the fact that Heller himself was not actually kayaking on the river, I am rather impressed with how well he is able to capture the spirit of the paddlers and all their daring whitewater exploits!"},{"Title":"Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River","review":"This is an extrodinary book. How these paddlers trekked up this Gorge (with kayaks)and paddled the Tsangpo is absolutely amazing. I did like when the author talked about the history of the Gorge..the steepness..etc. I'm sad that I finished it. No, there is no pictures (for a certain 4th grader)...BUT if you want to SEE this magnificent scenery AND WATCH these exceptional paddlers then buy Scott Lindgren's DVD \\"Into The Tsangpo Gorge\\"..its the movie version to this book. ITS ABSOLUTELY JAW DROPPING! Once you watch this DVD..you will want to read the book again. Anyone who has an interest in this part of the world will ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BOOK AND DVD!!"},{"Title":"Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River","review":"For years, Tibet's Upper Tsangpo gorge had loomed as the ultimate challenge in whitewater. Carving the deepest gorge in the world (over 15,000 feet deep) and dropping in places 250 feet/mile this monsterous river had repelled every attempt to navigate it's turbulent and treacherous waters. In 1998, a group led by Wickliffe Walker attempted a first descent at 60,000 cfs+, only to have U.S. Kayak Slalom Team member Doug Gordon drown almost midway through the gorge. Their perilous journey is chronicled in the excellent book The Last River.After extensive planning using satalite imagery, a team of the world's top kayakers led by extreme filmmaker Scott Lindgren (and sponsored by GM/Outside magazine) attempted a fresh first descent in February 2002 at a more reasonable 15,000 cfs. While Lindgren and his 5 buddies were battling the rapids, Peter Heller (on assignment from Outside magazine) hiked the side canyon on a bad hip with an army of 64 porters providing logistical support. Heller chronicles the boaters' near death experiences from the relatively safe vantage point of the trail overlooking the river. Although unable to provide a personal account of the kayaking experience, his writing is brilliant, describing a Shangri-La like beauty that gives the reader a feeling of being surrounded by one of the most remote and enchanting places on Earth.Heller also vividly portrays the six personalities of this elite kayaking group; in particular focusing on the intense displeasure that Lindgren has for Heller's book proposal. He also describes an intense standoff between the porters and the expedition members, where the porters demand, on threat of death, almost twice their originally contracted pay. (This hardball bargaining style seems to be a recurring theme on many Himalayan expeditions.)He also gives a brief history of the Tibetan people following the invasion and near-destruction of this Buddhist nation by the Chinese in the 1950s. After enduring a gigantic flood along the Tsangpo in 2000, many of these indigenous people are being relocated so that China can turn this rugged region into a national park.Overall this makes for excellent adventure reading. It's good to know there are still modern day heroes conquering unconquered rivers and coming home to tell about it."},{"Title":"Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River","review":"This is a detailed, unsentimental report on an amazing trek and high-risk journey. You don't need to know one thing about kayaking to enjoy this rough and tumble adventure. The cultural barriers are as fascinating as the plunges down skyscrapers of water. The description of the topography and the characters on this journey are wonderful, compelling. This \\"Into Thin Air\\" on a ribbon of churning foam and turbulence."},{"Title":"Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River","review":"Peter Heller will have you gripping your seat as he transports the reader into the Tsangpo Gorge. The story is told with beautifully crafted sentences which compensate for the lack of photos by filling your mind with exquisite word pictures. Of course the adventure itself is the main excitement, but the personalities of the kayakers present another layer of drama as the adventure roars down the river. These men are on a sort of exploration, true, but it is a mistake to imagine that they are heroes, since this kind of adrenaline- and testosterone-filled journey is by nature a very self-involved endeavor. For readers who love to mentally throw themselves over the edge without actually risking death, HELL OR HIGH WATER is a classic wild ride."},{"Title":"Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River","review":"I enjoy well written memoirs. My expectations were high. I was hoping that the writer himself would end up on the water for a little bit. Although I'm an open water kayaker, I was not familiar with the white water kayaking terms. Heller used words such as holes, which would have been helpful to have a little more description. The transition between events portrayed was awkward.The writer kept saying he was on a spiritual journey to find his soul. Well there was much ado about nothing. Did he ever have an epiphany? The ending was unceremonious and I found myself scanning just to finish the book.However there were good moments in the book, just not enough worth to read."},{"Title":"Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River","review":"Peter Heller is an adventure writer in the old style: thoroughly conversant when it comes to the main event, but careful also to place that central project in full context. For me, this was the great joy of reading \\"Hell or High Water.\\" The kayaking trip down the Tsangpo is so vividly, ingeniously described that at several points my toes curled at the risk, and it's a great, solid tale that sits properly at the center of this book. But the story of seven brave kayakers is offset by Heller's unique curiosity and humanity: along the route we get bits of Tibetan mythology and history, narratives of earlier conquest, a tutorial on river movement, a little Buddhism and natural-history arcana, plus a whole boatload of engaging stories. Heller is a generous writer who takes excellent command of his book's ambitious scope, and the result for readers is a chance to join a knowledgeable, companionable guide on a truly remarkable expedition."},{"Title":"Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River","review":"This is one of the great exploration books. Heller's book chronicles a modern-day 19th Century-style grand expedition through the Tsangpo Gorge. After years of preparation, seven kayakers, fundamentally alone despite a ground support team, modern communications gear and corporate sponsors, risk their lives to explore a river as wild as any, and more remote.It's an audacious story told with awe for the accomplishment of these seven men and respect for the strength of the leader, a hero of modern kayaking. Heller, an accomplished kayaker himself (he followed the expedition on the ground on assignment for an outdoor sports magazine), communicates for those of us who only wish we could be there what it was like in the Gorge and the frightening and magical sensation of sitting in a tiny kayak in the middle of a raging cataract. The kayaking scenes are as concretely realized as the rockclimbing sequence in Deliverance. The book is worth reading for that alone.There is more here, however. Heller has a poet's sensibility for structure and telling detail, and he uses that to place this expedition's story in a larger frame. The book opens and closes, appropriately, with the wind sweeping through the Gorge: \\"The only sound was wind rippling and snapping the prayer flags that ran down the riverbank and freezing the paddlers' hands as they zipped into drysuits. . . . The wind would whip the white flags and take their inked prayers, little by little, into the Gorge until they were washed clean.\\" In between, the adventure story unfolds and the book raises issues about why-even for men as able and brave as these-petty jealousies about the ownership of something no one can own creep into our most heroic moments. These issues aren't plainly told in most books detailing former expeditions; I wonder if that's a result of how we've changed (this is, after all, the age of movie rights and the blog from base camp) or the fact that few reports from the field as thoughtful as this one have been written."},{"Title":"Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River","review":"a terrific book that gives a real feel for the inside workings of a difficult and dangerous expedition. the white water descriptions are right on and make you feel as if you were there. a great book for the arm chair traveler."},{"Title":"Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River","review":"Disappointing. This book is not particularly well-written. Heller waxes majestically about the scenery and topography he sees, but I still can't visualize it. And he shifts his voice several times throughout the book, sometimes writing as if he were delivering sacred text, other times casually reaching out and attempting to speak to the reader one-on-one. It's hard to get a feel for the story he's trying to tell. Add that to the fact that there is not a single compelling character in the book and it makes it a little tough to slog through. I find that I just don't care what happens to these people. And this may sound silly, but an adventure book without pictures of the location is a bad idea. I hate to sound like I'm in 4th grade, but it would have been really helpful to have some visual aids to understand the geography they were in and the effect of the water on their kayaking. No photos.

His emphasis on pre-purchase analysis to assure positive cash flow was good, and reminded me of the principle that Robert Kiyosaki teaches about having an asset buy another asset.

The author is clearly talented and years ago these designs would have wowed the crowds at weddings, conventions and awards banquets. But that day has passed. It is as if the book made the rounds of publishers and after being rejected by many, finally, 40 years later, was accepted.But it was too late. For our time, these designs are too formal, too contrived and just over the top. The author opens with 9 \\"Rules to Garnish By,\\" but forgot to consider rule number 6 in most of his projects: \\"Over decorating is as bad as no decoration.\\" \\"Garnish\\" is not the same as \\"garish.\\"The garnishes in this book appear to be directed at events, buffets and banquets. There is nothing in this book as casual as floating a tiny bundle of julienned vegetables on a cup of soup, or using sauces or colorful bits of food as background on the plate.John Gargone is a talented food artist. While this should not be your only book on decorative food carving, it would fit well into a personal library on food decoration. Techniques don't go out of style, and if you master the detailed, photographically illustrated step-by-step instructions here, you can bring your own artistic flair and produce beautiful results.Whatever John Gargone's talents, he was poorly served by his publisher, who did not give him good editing, good typography or good photos.This book is not well designed. The fonts are strange. Descenders on the headings blunder into the text below. Many of the headings switch from blue to yellow to green in mid-word.Reproduction of the photographs reminds me of 4-color food photos published in recipe books 50 years ago. But there was never an era, even then, when this photography would have been considered state of the art, or even professional. Today, with a copyright date as recent as 2004, these photos must be judged abominable.It saddens me to write such a harsh review for the work of a well-respected, hard-working and successful chef such as John Gargone.

Arronax departs with his friend and servant Conseil on a journey to kill a \\"narwhal\\" that has been sinking ships across the globe. They travel on a boat called the Abraham Lincoln, which is sailed by Captain Farragut. There they meet Ned Land, a master harpooner. The Abraham Lincoln is hit, and Ned, M. Arronax and Conseil are launched into the sea. Ned surprisingly lands on the supposed narwhal, hence discovering is made of iron and therefore is a submarine vessel. The three men are taken aboard, only to find that they are prisoners there. Yet M. Arronax and Conseil find it pleasant to see a submarine world. But even they yearn for freedom. Swim with them in this watery book!Opinions:1. This amazing book tells a tale of adventure with a subsurface of mystery. There are ocean bottoms hit and secrets kept, poles reached and mysteries left unsolved. What really kept me going while reading this book was the sheer anticipation of what was yet to come. It is wonderful material for people like me to get their hands on. I like to learn a little bit about the world while still reading a book that is fictionous and fun to read. For example, it talked about the main characters going inside an extinct volcano while describing the chamber of the volcano in explicit detail.2. The book tells the reader a bit about what life was like 1866 while still being an adventure-themed and fun to read book. It described many daring actions and risks, while still giving facts on geography I never even knew about. It told me about how a boat was run back then and also spoke about some species of fish through Conseil's classification.3. Jules Verne never explained why the title mentioned 20,000 leagues. The Nautilus never went farther than 4000 leagues down under the waves.4. I believe that this book is meant for people ages 10+ because some of the things in there might not be comprehensible to a person aged 9 or lower.RecommendationI would recommend this book to people wanting to be oceanographers because it talks about some things you may not have known about the sea.

There is something to be said about his incredible imagination and his grasp of scientific principles that were well ahead of his time. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is the voyage of Prof. Arronax, along with his companions Ned and Conseil, who have found themselves on board the Nautilus, an incredible submarine designed by the mysterious Captain Nemo. The Nautilus crew lives esclusively in the oceans and seas, surfacing only to replenish oxygen. Throughout the journey, they experience breath-taking sights, heart-pounding adventures, and perilous obstacles. Jules Verne does a beautiful job constructing this submarine world, even inventing new sea creatures to fit into his story. Scarcely a chapter goes by without some new or legendary creature sneaking in to liven up the seascape. However, I think where this story falls short is in its flow. I understand that the story is written from Prof. Arronax's point of view, which is that of a scientist, but each chapter contains several paragraphs of virtually useless information, be it readings from the nautical instruments or long lists of aquatic animals (including their class, genus, and species). This detracts from the overall flow of the story and I believe could have been left out. However, at four stars, this book is still very much worth reading!"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Sheer adventure narrative for the aquatic zoology and oceanography nerd.

This is viewable on \\"LOOK INSIDE!\\" with Amazon.All of the other myriad editions seem to be re-issues or adaptations of the first English translation done in 1872 by Lewis Page Mercer (who cut about 20% of Verne's original text and made hundreds of translation errors).The choice between the translations by Frederick Paul Walter and William Butcher might well come down to a matter of style - rather than accuracy in translation - or a preference for a hardcover over a paperback edition. I own the Naval Institute Press edition. I have only seen the other editions on \\"LOOK INSIDE!\\".Frederick Paul Walter's Evertype hardback edition (ISBN 978-1904808282) is typeset in \\"Fournier MT\\" which gives the text something of a nineteenth century appearance. There are also black-and-white illustrations - as there are in William Butcher's OUP edition (ISBN 978-0199539277) - which are of the period (but not necessarily thereby of great artistic merit). The dustcover of the Evertype edition shows - for some inextricable reason - a modern photograph of a stingray (where a squid, at least, might have had more relevance to the book).If I were just interested in reading the story I would probably buy the OUP edition which - like my copy of OUP's \\"Around the World in Eighty Days\\" (also translated by William Butcher) - could be expected to brown-up within a year or two as it's printed on cheap paper (the same as the Penguins of old). If I were buying it as a gift I would probably be tempted to select the Evertype hardcover translation by Frederick Paul Walters (even though I don't know what quality of paper it's printed on or whether the pages are sewn together in quires or just glued together like a cheap paperback)."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This is actually my favorite book of all time next to Ivanhoe, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Man in the Iron Mask, and The War of the Worlds. I read this book in fourth grade and absolutely loved it. Now that I'm 3 years older, I appreciate it even more. Though there were some hard words, I loved the dialogue. There is even humor when Professor Aronnax explains how pearls are made and says, &quot;Yes, my boy, oysters can produce many sharks&quot; because he is scared to go shark hunting. Captain Nemo is a mysterious yet interesting character. My favorite parts are when they are at the sunken ship in the Mediterranean Sea, when they fight the giant squid, and when they are at Ceylon. Some of their other travels take them to the lost continent of Atlantis, a tunnel under the Suez Canal, and through the Great Ice Barrier. This is my favorite Jules Verne book, though it has some competition from Around the Moon and Journey to the Center of the Earth. This book is a must-have for science lovers. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure and the ocean. Trust me, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I thought that the book had one of the best plot lines I've ever seen, reguardless of the fact that there is only slight building up to the climax. The only thing that I didn't think was that good about the book was that about every other page, Jules Verne would go into a paragraph description of the animals. For example, he would say something like: I just saw a tuna. But not the normal tuna, it was yellow-bellied, had dorsal fins that went at a downward angle, etc.\\" Otherwise, I thought it was a great read and well worth the money. I will be purchasing more of Jules Verne's books very soon. I highly suggest for you to read this book. Another thing, if you enjoyed watching the 1954 \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea Film,\\" I highly suggest the book because the movie only gives a small picture of what actually occurred during their submarine venture and the book tells you everything, and the occurrences are just amazing."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"It's a great story, no question.

Not only is it a riveting novel with a brilliant plot it is also an accurate prediction of the future. I have never read a book that is so flawlessly combines the disparate worlds of science and story telling. Verne's writing style grabbed me from the get go, yet he never sacrifices any detail. Verne pulls you into another reality and where you never know what is going to happen next. Even in its most technical moments Verne's masterpiece demands your attention. Most people know the gist of the story. Three men are held captive in an extraordinary submarine vessel, the Nautilus, led by the Captain Nemo, a man who has left the human world to live under the sea. If you read the book you will find that there is much more to this story than you originally believed. Verne is also very accurate in predicting how a submarine would work. His Nautilus uses many of the same devices as the real submarines of the future!Five Stars!"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"In English speaking countries, 20,000 is considered a classic boy's book, but in France, it is considered a work of literature. The two translators of this version have gone back to the original French, and made a new translation. Turns out, the common translation that we are used to is full of mistranslations and ommissions of anti-English sentiments. Frankly, I didn't think the new translation adds that much more to the story, but I really enjoyed the footnotes and annotations. The translators take a boyish glee when they find and error or ommission that, to me, added a bit to the story. I'd recommend this version over the older translation. If you've read this story before, I think you will enjoy the annotations most."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Jules Verne wrote this book in 1870. It has startling technological references (even in the concept of the submarine) but even more stunning was the Nuclear Reactor on board.I feel that some episodes of Star Trek (the original series) are models on Jules Verne, because behind the backdrop of the technology and adventure, there exists the social evils of slavery, colonialism and nihilism as well as genocide.The story is about Captain Nemo who is epic, driven and something good that is so strongly polar he is actually lead into a path of destruction - and his crew. The story is told through the eyes of Professor Aronnax. The usage of an observant intellectual to explain the dark pathos of a main character was rather popular in that era (think Watson and Holmes).In this instance it is important because Nemo destroys a vessel with all hands and then bows before a picture of his wife and children. The implication is that his family where kidnapped (or killed) as slaves.At anyrate, if you love steampunk culture, Star Trek social complexity, and classical literature you will love 20000 Leagues Under the Sea."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"For some reason, even after reading this book, my brain still translates \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" to mean 20000 leagues DOWN instead of a DISTANCE. What's wrong with me?Anyway, this book was a treasure. Jules Verne, the grandfather of science fiction, again shows that his is much more than a scientific mind. Verne is a grand storyteller, and this novel is his masterwork.Our heroes, Professor Arronax, his faithful compatriot Conseil, and the salty sailor Ned Land find themselves together in a hunt for a giant, mysterious undersea creature which has been causing havoc among shipping lines as well as towns along the coastline. Setting out to sea on top-of-the-line sailing vessel, the three men and the crew encounter the creature, only to have it sink their ship like so many others. However, as you probably know, this is no creature at all, but the most spectacular vehicle ever created by man. It is the Nautilus, a gigantic submarine, and the proud creation of the enigmatic Captain Nemo.Captain Nemo holds the three as his prisoner. They are instructed that they may never leave the Nautilus, yet will be treated with hospitality and respect by Nemo and his crew. The Captain keeps his word, and treats the Professor and his fellows to all the wonders of the ocean depths. Captain Nemo has made the sea his home, vowing never to return to the distasteful world on land. The Nautilus has everything you would need to live and prosper; infinite supplies of water through its seawater processing machines, and an abundance of exotic seafood dredged up from the deep.Captain Nemo himself is as mystifying and brilliant as his creations. He is one of the greatest villains ever put on paper, and Verne's skill as a storyteller brings him to life. Nemo's motivations are clouded in mystery. I can't stress enough how excellent this character is, and the sly way Verne allows for Nemo's true motivations to remain as unfathomable at the end of the novel as it was at the beginning.The Professor doesn't want to leave the Nautilus. He is enthralled by the sea life and the wonders of Nemo's brilliant submarine. Conseil goes where the Professor goes, and is pleased to assist him in their adventure. Ned feels like a prisoner. He longs to walk on firm ground again, and considers his imprisonment as a violation.The action is blended well alongside the exploration and discovery. This book reads and feels like a grand adventure in ways few books can equal. The language is crisp and clear and so is the humor, which is a unusual for a novel written well over 100 years ago. It flows perfectly in English as a result of a superb translation. If I were to single out one thing I disliked about it, it would be the detailed discussions of sea life in the undersea world. I still found Verne's descriptions of multitudes of ocean species fascinating, but some readers may not. What helps alleviate the (possible) boredom is to remember that readers back in the 1800 had NO TV and few had any way of experiencing the wonders of the sea as Verne describes them.\\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" can be read by all ages. Most of Verne's books are recommended to younger readers, but there is no indication that they were WRITTEN for the young crowd. You certainly never feel like you're reading a children's book, not by a long shot. Anyone with a sense of wonder and appreciates the fantastic would enjoy the ride. I know I did."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This is Verne's classic novel about Captain Nemo and his submarine Nautilus. What really fascinated me when reading this story and other Verne novels was not only Verne's contributions to the science fiction genre, but his founding of a whole new genre, one that, as far as I know, he has never been given credit. I think Verne was one of the first to write the techno-novel, a work that is filled with technical details ala Tom Clancy. For this novel, Verne did considerable research to describe what was known as accurately as possible. Professor Arronax and his servant Conseil board a U. S. ship that is searching for a monster that has sunk a number of other ships. They discover that it isn't a monster at all but a submarine, captained by a mysterious man known only as Nemo (Verne will present readers with Nemo once again in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;). Arronax, Conseil, and an American harpooner named Ned Land travel with Nemo and see many wonderous things and have many adventures. Verne's &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; has gotten some very poor reviews over the decades since it first appeared in 1869. In many cases, it was because of the translation and not because of Verne. A number of the early translators inserted their own sections with their own ideas and opinions and deleted much of Verne's own words. So, readers should be aware of the translator. I read an excellent translation by Walter James Miller that was also annotated. Such an annotated volume can prove to be very helpful to teenagers getting acquainted with Nemo and his submarine."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This is one of the most famous novels by Verne, and justifiedly so. A strange thing is happening in the seas of the world: a gigantic sea monster is terrorizing and sometimes sinking ships. The US government assembles a team of experts and sails around the world to discover the monster and catch it. Among them are two French scientists, Prof. Arronax and his assistant Conseil, and a Canadian harpooner, Ned Land. One day they fall to the sea while chasing the thing, and then are astonished when the monster rescues them. Alas, it turns out it's not a monster, but a machine that can travel under the surface of the waters. That is, a submarine, nonexistent at the time the book was written. So the three men become the prisoners of the enigmatic Captain Nemo and his crew. The \\"Nautilus\\" is a self-supporting device, lavishly decorated and the work of a genius, a strange one. The central question throughout the book remains: Why have Nemo and his people rejected all contact with their fellow human beings? What happened to him and to them to escape the world and become lonely travellers of the underseas? Mystery. During many months, our heroes travel around the globe, and in the way they discover Atlantida, hunt in submerged forests, rescue a pearl-gatherer, rest in a submerged volcano, and fight aborigines and giant squids. Prof. Arronax classifies and describes every creature they encounter, which slows down the reading between adventures.I took one star out of the book because it lacks a central feature of any great work of literary art: character development. To reach the highest literary glory, Verne lacks psychological depth, the exploration of human beings' motivations. I would have loved to know Nemo's story, his reasons for doing what he does. But it doesn't matter much. To read Verne is to come back home, to turn back the time and be a kid again, flying to that moment when one discovers the infinite possibilities of literature, chief among them the chance to live other lives and see the world anew. Verne and his characters have a unique charm, and in this book the fascination od the ocean is added."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"For some reason, a few of Verne's many works have become famous in the English speaking world and have even gained some kind of \\"classic\\" status. Unfortunately, these are in my opinion his more superficial and uninteresting novels. 20000 Leagues Under the Sea is a perfect example.Most people would have heard of the idea through some part of culture - the story of Captain Nemo in his submarine (Verne's alleged prophetic vision) and how one outsider is forced through circumstance to join Nemo and his crew on a host of adventures across the seas. This is fine, and that's what the book is. BUT, unlike many better Verne novels, this is ALL it is. It's an adventure story mixed with a description of the various wonders of the udnerwater world (including Atlantis). Don't get me wrong, Verne is good at describing all these things and it's interesting and certainly makes you think about worlds other than your own.What I love about Verne's works such as the Mysterious Island and the 500 Millions of the Beguma is that this is used as a vehicle for some deeper or more interesting messages. Here, the main \\"deeper\\" message is the study of Nemo as a recluse from society - a kind of conscienscious objector (or even hater of humanity if you will), surrounded by his cold machine-like submarine and the predator-like amoral underwater world. In the hands of most writers, this would be sci-fi schlock and it is only Verne that makes it into a good book - but this should not be the work he is renowned for.This book is actually the 2nd in a trilogy, the 1st being In Search of the Castaways and the 3rd being Mysterious Island and I reckon they get progressively better so read the third one!"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This book is about a man who finds an underwater secret boat.

To be frank, I wavered for about 4 minutes on how to rate this book. Was it a 3 or 4? In the end, I chose the 4 star rating. This book had a wonderful story line, the characters, and the setting where also both wonderful. The things that really drug this book down where Verne's consistent descriptions of things that really, in actuality, could have been left out. He goes on and on classifying fish and giving very, very detailed descriptions of the submarine (The Nautilus), the way it worked, and the things on board. I guess I can understand this, I guess Verne was just trying to give a believable and complete description of the things the characters saw on their journeyIf you could, somehow, get an abridged version, I would reccomend it. This book is great and truth be told, it was worth my time reading it. I just think that unless you're a marine biologist or are just, for some reason, very interest in the classification of oceanic plant and animal life, that 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea would be best read, and probally more enjoyable with some of the 'unimportant to the story' detailed descriptions of the above-mentioned things ...in frank, LEFT OUT. Now, this is not to say that you shouldn't read this book, you should. I'm just forewarning the prospective reader that they will find some parts of the book to be 'boring' with VERY in depth classifications and descriptions. On the other hand, the story is one of great splendor and excitement. Try to remain focused on the story line and keep a clear mind that the descriptions are just Verne's way of trying to give the reader the most in-depth and detailed assessment of the voyage. Now, I know that what I have written so far is not a 'review'. I'm just trying to let people know what kind of a read they will be in for, if they so choose to read the book. Now, as for a real 'review' on what happens in this book? ...Nahhh, read it yourself. I will say this, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea takes you to places,in your mind,betterthan any book I've ever read. You will become attatched to the characters every move and sit in anxiety, with great with anticipation, eager to find out what will happen next in this Sci-Fi classic. So, with all the above information on how the book will lag a bit at times ...I finish with this, Verne's descriptive writting leads many modern day readers into boredom and complaint. If you really open your eyes and embrace Verne's descriptive style, you will learn to enjoy this work, and have an admiration for this classic story and classic storyteller almost unequaled in all of literature.

Outside of the three captives, no other characters were well-developed. I would have liked to have gotten to know Captain Nemo a lot better, and what happened in his past that led him to isolate himself from humanity. Since his character is never developed, Captain Nemo ends up being a one-dimensional character with an inexplicable aversion to civilization. The ending is a big cop-out, where no explanation is given in how the characters arrived where they end up. In addition, since the book was originally written in French, it was difficult to read at some points because the text is not well translated, and reads awkwardly. I expected a little more from a book that is regarded as a classic."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This is by far Jules Verne's best book. It is a lot better than some of his other famous works (Journey To The Center of the Earth and Around The World In 80 Days for example).

Also, who could forget the classic squid sequence? A must read."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I first read this book when I was in the 5th grade. I am a big reader so I like challenging books. The beginning was a little slow and dull, but after the men were captured by the Nautilus it became MUCH more interesting.Life abord the Nautilus was quite interesting. Instead of meat (which they could not get) they ate many kinds of fish and sea plants, which, unless you were told, were indistiguishable from land- raised meat and vegetables. Thoguh they were prisoners, the doctor and his friends were treated like guests. They had many great adventures before finaly escaping.All in all, very good. I reccomend this to anyone who likes a bit of adventure."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Book Review by Spencer LantosI read 2000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne. What this book is about is people who go under the sea to make discoveries. In the book they face some chalanges such as bad weather being attacked by sea monsters and being attacked by Indians. In the end of the book they find what their looking for but I can't give that away.My opinion on this book was it was good. It had lots of action and if you like adventure books I think you would enjoy this book. Their aren't very many boring parts of this book, and it almost never annoying. Whenever a good part of the book is over a new one starts and that is what I like about it.I would recommend this book because I liked it a lot. The reason I liked I said before It has a lot of action which I enjoyed so if you like science fiction books about traveling under water and fighting sea creatures I would recommend this book. If you don't then this book isn't for you."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"ok its a good book with a plot that a 3rd grader can understand i know this because i read it in second grade so a 3rd grader should have an easier time. and as far as the word that someone complained about you need to read context clue plus they are not that hard. this is a good book and show the predictions that Verne made. like scuba diving and nuclear power in the 1860's. and btw thats scuba diving with tanks of oxygen and thin wet suits to keep you warm truely he was a genious. i would buy this book read the whole book 3 times during the year but only when i am boged down or i have trouble with my studies."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This book is, by far, one of the best books I have read in the last year. It proves that classics are still the best books to read. In this undersea adventure, two unique characters travel 20,000 leagues facing everything from giant squids to themselves. This book is a must read for anyone whether you like science fiction to drama. You will enjoy it no matter what. I know I did.The book is truly unique. Jules Verne brings the wonders of science and drama to this book. If you are smart, you will read this book because it will make you smart. It is awesome, a must read, unbelievable. Highly recomend."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Confusing Title: My husband and I were talking the other night about the Jules Verne novel 20,000 Under the Sea and we both admited to having been confused by the title at one time. 20,000 leagues (60,000 miles or 111,120 kilometers) is 8.5 thousand times deeper than the deepest point on the ocean. 20,000 leagues is the distance the two men traveled on the Nautilus.Obsession Worse than Nemo: I remember in 6th grade a group of boys did a huge series of blue prints for the Nautilus based on the book. I thought it was a waste of time back then and still do but apparently lots of folks don't. The blue prints of the Nautilus feature in Clive Cussler's book Valhalla Rising. And there's an entire website devoted to blue prints and 3D models.Closing thoughts: I much prefer the sequel to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. If you get a chance, read The Mysterious Island."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Jules Vernes captures our imaginations in his tale of adventure and science. The narrator, Dr. Arronax, is a French naturalist who goes on an expedition to hunt down a mysterious sea creature spotted by many sailors. However, in an interesting turn of events, he finds out that the enigma that roamed the oceans is in fact a futuristic submarine (the Nautilus) built by Captain Nemo. Dr. Annonax, along with his Flemish companion Conseil and Canadian harpooner Ned Land, are held hostage on the Nautilus and through their time aboard they experience the great wonders of the seas. Giant squids, ice caps, pearl hunts, close calls with Papuan natives, are only a fraction of the exciting events they experience.Using Arronax as the narrator, Verne gives us a look into the mysteries of the deep seas. While Arronax often gets carried away labeling and categorizing sea life, it makes the narrative seem more authentic. I felt a little cheated about not learning the life story of the brilliant and enigmatic Captain Nemo. We learn that he is driven by revenge, yet we don't know exactly why and who is his unfortunate target. However, this lack of revelation allows the reader to create his/her own theories, which can be quite fun.This book may not be for action junkies, as shown by previous reviews. However, I recommend this book to readers who are curious about the unknown with an interest in science. It is an interesting and very creative read, and should not be missed!"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Jules Verne is one of the most captivating and poetic writers ever in existence. All of his novels are complete masterpieces, but this novel is the best one I have ever read. Its intricate plot line and complicated writing style make the novel seem both romantic and adventerous. Although for some the writing style may be too round-a-bout, I find it completely matches the story-line.

Aronnax, Consiel, and Ned Land partake in were vividly portrayed in the book. Also the Nautilus was really amazing, in two ways. First in how powerful the ship was, and second how Verne could have created the idea for such a vessel for the period of time he wrote the book.From the underwater forests of Crespo, to the Manaar Bank, then to Atlantis and the South Pole, the book made it feel as if I was traveling along with them. In addition to the locales, the Nautilus itself was amazing, with it's speed, strength and technology. On top of that, there was also, the walks on the bottom of the ocean which were described with amazing detail.Capitan Nemo was the most complex character I've read about in a long time. Throughout their time on the ship, Aronnax, Consiel, and Land never see much of Nemo, and when they do, he's not a man of many words. He is, however a man of great intelligence, skill, and wealth, who decided to sevre all ties with civilization, for reasons that appear unknown to us.Professor Aronnax began thinking some monsterous narwhal type beast is destroying ships in the ocean at the beginning of the story, so himself, Consiel, and Ned Land set out to discover what it really is, and find themselves amidst something completely different.This book was a treat to read with all it's adverture and exploring. It's story was crisp and fresh. Along with a ending that I feel fit justly.

This new translation based on the original French texts is amazing, it moves quickly and I discovered things that I had never read in other English versions. You get more of Verne's politics here than in earlier translations including such memeorable phrases as: \\"The world needs no new continents, it needs new people.\\"The characters are well developed and you can indentify with all of them and how they view their effective captivity aboard the Nautilus. Captain Nemo is a wonderful character and Verne gives the reader just enough information about him to keep you enthralled but not enough to remove the mystery. The intro relates that Nemo was supposed to be a Polish aristocrat, getting back at the world for the the atrocities the Russians had commited against his family. But when Hetzel his publisher balked at the idea because of the new Franco Russian alliance Verne decided to remove any trace of nationality.What else can be said? The English is not archaic!! This restored and annotated version, is a VAST improvement over previous English editions.

Even today, the story is as fresh and thought provoking as in the era it was written. A true visionary, Jules Verne sensed the intrinsic evil of unbridled science, and the natural tendency to adopt technology for military applications, or in this adaptation, a scientist's disdain for the use of weapons for military conquests.

It was an amazing trip through the globe I have taken in several day. But the book has an ending that's leaving too many questions unanswered, which I would rather it have given me much more explainations. And the book seems to be too plain, old, because it was written such a long time ago, and the author had no intention of making the lines exciting in a way we accept today, and which is also a result of too many unrelated stories been piled together without a common base, basically, the book has pretty much no plot. That's a reason you might consider not buying the book.But I liked the book a lot, I can not understand how can the author write one story after another that just get more and more surprising, and the way he brings out each story.

The last thing that was good, was when the crew of the Natulius had to fight the giant squid, they are called something else in the book, but I didn't pay attention. Those are the ONLY good factors about this book. The author spends more time on description of the water than the action of the book. I found that very dull and boring.

Bad translations have cut and mangled Verne's writing, often making his style seem arthritic, his plots disjointed, and his thematic content insipid. Therefore my reviews of Verne's novels usually are concerned with a particular edition of Verne.This is a review of the 1962 Bantam Classic edition of _20,000 Leagues Under the Sea_ (1870). It contains an introduction by Ray Bradbury comparing Captains Nemo and Ahab. (Nemo is mad north-by-northwest, but Ahab is _really_ crazy.) The translation is by Anthony Bonner, which is generally rated as \\"above average\\" by Verne scholars. Bonner does maintain some errors from the older (and much inferior) Mercier Lewis translation. For example, Nemo still says that the steel plates on the _Nautilus_ have a density of .7 to .8 that of water. If this were true, the steel would be lighter than water! What Nemo actually says in the original text is that the specific gravity of the steel plates is 7.8. What a difference a few decimal places can make!But on the balance, the Bonner translation does very well in allowing Verne to exercise his scientific knowledge without cutting or mangling it. The discussion by Professor Aronnax of sea pressure and the type of creature that would have to withstand it, the details of the electrical system of the _Nautilus_, the shipbuilding figures for constructing the submarine, the calculations of the formidable Black Stream... all are detailed and concrete. (Though admittedly, there is electronic information that is withheld from us.) And there are underwater sights such as these:The sun's rays struck the surface at a rather oblique angle, and, refracted by this contact as if passing through a prism, they tinted the edges of rocks, plants, shells and corals with the seven colors of the solar spectrum. It was a marvelous feast for the eyes; colors criss-crossed one another in a veritable kaleidoscope of green, yellow, orange, violet, indigo, and blue-- the entire palette of an enthusiastic colorist! (113)And again, during an undersea funeral near a coral forest:The light [from our lamps] produced a thousand charming effects as it played about these brightly colored branches. I thought I could see these tissuelike cylindrical tubes tremble beneath the wavy motion of the water. Small, fast fish would would dart past like flocks of birds. I was tempted to pick the coral's fresh flowers and delicate tentacles, some of which had just blossomed and others scarcely yet opened. But if my hand drew near these living, sensitive flowers, an alarm would spread throughout the colony. The white blossoms would dart inside their red cases and vanish from sight; the shrub would change into a block of stony bulges. (175)The enigmatic Captain Nemo (sometimes vindictive and villainous, sometimes noble and heroic) promises his three involuntary guests: \\"You will travel through a land of marvels. Your mind will be in a continual state of astonishment and stupefaction. It will be difficult to get bored with the continual spectacle that will pass before your eyes\\" (71). And do you know, the Captain is right. The voyage of the _Nautilus_ is truly a grand adventure-- almost the archtypical extraordinary voyage-- from the undersea hunting party, to the encounter with the giant clam, to the visit to Atlantis, to the battle with the squid, to the use of Nemo's thunderbolts.Some modern readers grumble over the length and detail of Verne's descriptive passages. But remember: Jules Verne wasn't writing for an audience that had seen dozens of underwater movies. His task was to get people who had _never_ seen such a sight \\"to enter a new element\\" (71) and experience it for the very first time. He did this. And if you give Verne half a chance, he will do it again."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Almost twenty years ago, I took hold of this book and remember reading it in a day (though we all know how memory can trick you). I didn't recall much more of a narrative other than a general knowledge when I took it again, but I remember avidly my childhood experience and feelings which went hand in hand with this book. It was all about mysteries, about adventure, about submerging into the unknown depths on a strange vessel accompanied with a mysterious figure of Captain Nemo. I recall reading, after lengthy search, sequel of this novel, trying to fulfill the urge for finishing of the tale, and being astonished with events on mystery island that summed up the story. Verne was one of my first authors and first guide to the fantastic world of science fiction. Much has changed since those days. In part, I blame it all to growing-up, other parts would be too lengthy to mention. I picked this book again about a month or so, hearing the praise of this translation of Naval institute press, wanting to remember some of the experiences I had as a child. Effect was quite opposite. I was bored to death. And I saw too much. Somehow, when you're innocent in reading, when your voyage through world of books is only at its beginning, world seems much simpler and you take your story for granted. You're easily marveled by plot, by gadgets, by effects, by sheer promise of something unknown that unravels in front of you, failing to notice all of the work that lies somewhere behind. When you loose your virginity, when you spend countless hours studying the mechanism of narration, the idea of fiction and storytelling, those hidden things come before your eyes. And you start to see faults and errors, bad phrases and filler paragraphs, you begin to see colonialism, glorification of science, problems of liberty and equality and rhythm of the text and somehow it all falls apart. Instead of the wondrous book that you remember from childhood, you hold before yourself gigantic block of text without almost any kind of value other than historical one. Reader that exists today, one that grew distant from childhood innocence, keeps noticing the cramped language, keeps comparing Verne to other authors of the period and finding him outmatched, keeps noticing hasty structure with uneven tempo and failing rhythm, keeps noticing typified characterization and obsessiveness about scientific detail which painfully slows narration and cannot avert his gaze from all of that. It existed before, for sure, but being unaware of it, made \\"20 000 leagues under the sea\\" a fond memory. Today, it stands for concept of bad literature. I am aware that many of the Verne's fans out there could debate me on numerous points here but I do not wish to start a debate here. This text talks more about me as a reader than about the book in question, but in a way it is accounting of an experience and personal voyage through concepts of literature. If your views are similar to mine, it is likely that you will also be disappointed with this book. Maybe this should come with a stamp - not suitable for those above 14.

They have the dubious misfortune to come to the attention of Captain Nemo and his highly advanced submarine, Nautilus. While this prevents them from drowning, they do get caught up with some of the odd Captain's other pursuits.

I lived for two days in a world of fantasy and mystery inside the submarine Nautilus where The Captain Memo dwelled with his friends and after, in the company of an unexpected party.My imagination flew away to the depths of the sea, as never it had done it before, living the adventures of the voyage of the Nautilus to wherever it went, even to the frizzed lands of The South Pole or to the mystic and lost Atlantic.Jules Verne, the pioneer of the Science Fiction had done a magnificent job in this book that I value as his masterwork and his most visionary point of view of the world's technology of that time since in that moments submarines didn't exist, and he created one.I really enjoyed reading this and I strongly recommend it to anyone, especially kids, that want to read a good Science Fiction book and also a classic of all the times. I'm sure that they will fell the same emotions than I and will love it."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I read it when I was in 8th grade and saw the movie (1954 version with Kirk Douglas and incomperable James Mason as Captain Nemo) when I was about 8 years old.THIS WILL BE THE GREATEST READ OF YOUR LIFE! TRUST ME!"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This book is pretty exciting from start to finish. If you have read other Verne and not this one, then it is highly recommended. The only beef I have is that Verne gets too descriptive with the fish in each sea. It almost becomes redundant and the picture for me always seems to look the same. A lot of action and its a lot of fun trying to figure out the mystery behind Captain Nemo."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"If you like adventure books, struggle through this one. It's a must-read for anyone who enjoys the classics.I will admit there were some times when it dragged, and some times when it dragged quite a bit, especially when he endlessly described the flora and fauna of undersea life (you almost have to read \\"The Origin of Species\\" along with it) but it really was interesting."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"If you have second thoughts about buying or reading this book, it's a must for all children interested. If you've seen the movie, it's completely different, but the characters are almost the same. But what they do is TOTALLY different from that of the movie's version.

The men who run this ship seem to talk a foreign language that no one can quite dechipher. The only man they communicate on board is the Captain. On the submarine they have fantastic adventures and travel to places where they are the first people to set foot. They try to escape many times but always fail.

These books are very colorful, with lots of illustrations and photos of genuine artifacts, maps, and people from the era in which the story is set. Side panel text gives background information about the author, pictures and story. These &quot;additions&quot; (which do not detract from, but only enhance the story) help the young reader (and the adult too!) put the story into context. It is like getting both a classic and a pictorial history book rolled into one! The text is easy to read. My daughter is now 9, and reading the books on her own. Not only has she developed an appreciation for classic literature, but for history as well. These are great books for parents to read with their children. I highly recommend them!"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I loved this book and I would recommend this book to anyone. I think you should read this book before you leave High School. On a scale of one to five, one being the worst and five being the best. I would give it a five. I really enjoyed this book. The characters were very realistic and had life and emotion so you could relate to the characters their fear their joy and their sadness. They are three-dimensional characters. Not some flat two-dimensional characters who not feel and just act. It's easy to see why it's a classic. The book has a lot of action and adventure and even some mystery and lots of suspense. If you love any of these things, you should read this book. I found the way Conseil talks strange. Talking always in the third person I mean. Who actually goes around calling themselves by their first name? Looking up all the different animal and plant names that appear in this story must have taken forever as well as knowing where all these places were. He amazing he can fit all this information into one book an make it interesting. From reading this book, it refreshed my memory of the places in the world. The time from they were captured until they escaped only lasted six months. It seems to see all that they did see would have taken over a year. They did travel 60,000 miles. 1 leauge = 3 miles.

Can't go wrong."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This is Verne's classic novel about Captain Nemo and his submarine Nautilus. What really fascinated me when reading this story and other Verne novels was not only Verne's contributions to the science fiction genre, but his founding of a whole new genre, one that, as far as I know, he has never been given credit. I think Verne was the first to write the techno-novel, a work that is filled with technical details ala Tom Clancy. For this novel, Verne did considerable research to describe what was known as accurately as possible. Professor Arronax and his servant Conseil board a U. S. ship that is searching for a monster that has sunk a number of other ships. They discover that it isn't a monster at all but a submarine, captained by a mysterious man known only as Nemo (Verne will present readers with Nemo once again in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;). Arronax, Conseil, and an American harpooner named Ned Land travel with Nemo and see many wonderous things and have many adventures. Verne's &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; has gotten some very poor reviews over the decades since it first appeared in 1869. In many cases, it was because of the translation and not because of Verne. A number of the early translators inserted their own sections with their own ideas and opinions and deleted much of Verne's own words. So, readers should be aware of the translator. I read an excellent translation by Walter James Miller that was also annotated. Such an annotated volume can prove to be very helpful to teenagers getting acquainted with Nemo and his submarine."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"My first Kindle e-book (see also free book) and I loved it.

I found the book interesting reading until it delved into the detailed sea creatures found all over the globe.

And with the pulps consul Not Ned land were caught up"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Jules Verne indeed had quite an imagination. But, of all his novels, the most wondrous, the most well known, the most popular and the best is 20,000 Leagues under the Sea.The book's plot is pretty well known to the literature world: Captain Nemo has built an underwater ship called the Nautilus. Three people land on the ship and are taken aboard: French Professor M. Aronnax, a famous French scientist, Conseil, his servant and Ned Land, a Canadian Harpooner. Some of the highlights of their incredible adventure include getting trapped under ice in the South Pole, battling giant squid, exploring lost shipwrecks as well as the lost city of Atlantis and encountering the undersea forests of Crespo.What is most amazing is that Verne's predicted how subs would work years later. Also, the U.S.S Nautilus went under the South Pole almost a century after Verne's Nautilus. The book is however not problem proof. It takes a while to develop. The Nautilus is originally mistaken for a sea monster. So a few are spent looking for this \\"Sea Monster\\". But this is forgivable. For can you name one great book that doesn't spend time developing its plot?"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This book is a great joy to read. It's a wonderful exercise in imagination and visualizing everything inside my head. So many things in popular culture today have been influenced by what's in this book. Before I ever read this book, I was was primarily familiar with it because of the part with the giant squid. So imagine my surprise to find out that that part of the book was just a few pages long! But that's perfectly OK, because the rest of the book has plenty of things going for it. Jules Verne had a very good imagination. His depiction of the submarine turned out to be quite accurate with regards to what actually was turned into reality during the 20th century. This book is a lot of fun, and if you like it then I strongly recommend that you also read its sequel MYSTERIOUS ISLAND."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"&quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; is,I must say, one of the best novels written by Jules Verne. begins to wreck ships.

The author dived into the action pretty quickly, and it took me just a few pages to get to the excitement. By the way, I'm reading the unabridged version, so correct me if I'm wrong. I would have preferred more action-packed scenes and adventure in the book cos' on the whole, it was pretty stale........."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I agree with most of the other reviews in the sense that there are four or five scenes in this book that get your heart-pumping. Unfortunately that accounts for about a quarter of the book. The rest is full of detailed descriptions of sea life that would appeal to the most passionate environmentalist. The story was interesting, but you have to plow through a lot of boring text. Have a pot of coffee ready!"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I am not commenting on Jules Verne's writing, but rather the format of this particular edition. From the outside, this edition is very nice; as other reviewers have noted, it's great to have the map on the front cover. However, the print inside the book is VERY small. I'm not sure what the publisher was thinking; I've never seen a published book with type this tiny before. The pages are also larger than the average paperback, and the combination of big pages and tiny type gives me an instant headache.

But my main disappointment with this book is the lack of development or progression. It's just a travelogue. You could scramble the order of most of the chapters, and it would still read the same. And how dare Verne take us to Atlantis and spend less than two pages there? None of the characters is any different by the end of the book, and we never really find out what it is that makes Captain Nemo the way he is.That said, the nineteenth century science fiction is wonderful. Verne's visions of technology and even geography are fascinating. Will modern science fiction be so accurate in 100 years?"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Sure the language has changed since it was written, and it was translated from French. But the ideas hold up great, the plot is cool, and the characters are entertaining. A great read, entertaining to see what J.V. predicted correctly and what was totally off. The introduction was pretty cr*ppy. It tried to make J.V. seem like a futurist without peer. One example - he predicted the escape velocity of a rocket.

I found the policy of our heroes attempting to kill any animal they possibly could more than a little disturbing: when the book mentioned dolphins and sea otters the thought that flashed through my head was &quot;talking stag&quot;. Not only that, but the book's bloody boring! It consists of many vague, unfocused, and quite unconnected episodes that never evoked any interest whatsoever.

Although they are in a sense prisoners, they are allowed to use all the facilities aboard the submarine. This submarine, powered by nuclear energy and christened the Nautilus, is one of Verne's many brilliant predictions of modern life made throughout many of his works. This like may others was correct. Through out the book, the reader gains a vast knowledge of marine life, and the lives of people in distant lands.The book begins when Professor Pierre Aronnax, the narrator of the story, boards an American frigate commissioned to investigate a rash of attacks on international shipping by what is thought to be an amphibious monster. The supposed sea creature, which is actually the submarine Nautilus, sinks Aronnax's vessel and imprisons him along with his devoted servant Conseil and Ned Land, a temperamental harpooner. When they are returned to their senses, the find themselves inside a dark, gloomy, desolate, endless, predicament. They are locked in a cell. However they soon meet Captain Nemo who agrees to let them move about the ship freely on one condition. They must remain aboard the Nautilus. So begins a great adventure of a truly fantastic voyage from the pearl-laden waters of Ceylon to the icy dangers of the South Pole, as Captain Nemo, one of the greatest villains ever created, takes his revenge on all society.The detail that Verne pours into this book is amazing. This is one of the few books that are capable of making the readers feel that they are actually there. His descriptions of how the Nautilus operates, how Nemo's crew harvests food and his account of hunting on Hawaii are excellent, and the plot never falters. The characters are wonderfully scripted; each one having their own unique personality, and they are weaved flawlessly into the awe filled spectacle.This is the book that predicted that there would be submarines, and that submarines would eventually go to the South Pole. It predicted the development of the SCUBA suit; it even predicted nuclear powered ships. The technology used in this book makes it easy to understand even today. This book is widely recognized as a classic- in my view, correctly."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Submarines as we know them didn't exist in 1869. But Jules Verne had an almost eerily prophetic knack for knowing what technology would be used in the future -- and he put it to work in \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea,\\" a slow-moving adventure tale with plenty of proto-steampunk and almost fantastical undersea life.Ships in the middle of the ocean are suddenly seeing -- and being attacked by -- \\"a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.\\"Eventually the US government sends out a ship to capture the object, and during a sea battle Professor Aronnax, his manservant Conseil and harpooner Ned Land go overboard. Soon they're picked up by the Nautilus, the vast submarine that has been causing all this trouble, and introduced to Captain Nemo -- an intelligent, charismatic man who belongs to no nation.Aronnax becomes fascinated by Nemo, his ship and his library -- as well as the amazing underwater adventures that Nemo introduces them to, like pearl-hunting and fighting a giant squid. But the captain's free, lawless life has its dark side, and the three men begin to realize that they must get away from the Nautilus no matter what.It's actually rather amazing that Jules Verne not only dreamed up the idea of a semi-modern submarine long before they existed, but thought out the applications, the stealth, and the vast size. And since nothing like the Nautilus existed at the time, there's a slightly fantastical, steampunk flavor to \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\\"And as usual, Verne painstakingly studies everything about his imagined world, filling it with science (although he obviously didn't know about water/air pressure) and lovely descriptions of the Nautilus and the eerie underwater world (giant oysters, forests, Atlantis). The only flaw is that he tends to ramble on about exact measurements and travel details; there are boring patches here and there.But Captain Nemo is probably one of Verne's most fascinating characters -- a charismatic, embittered man who is a sort of noble sea pirate. He does some stuff that is totally unacceptable (sinking a random warship), but he also has little spurts of kindness and generosity towards poor and powerless peoples of the world. He's scary but fascinating.Giant submarines, charismatic pirates and an undersea world just waiting to be explored -- \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea\\" is a fascinating sci-fi classic, if you can get past the dull patches."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"this is William Robson's translation, which was published around 1853. I spot-checked it against a few contemporary translations, as well as Richard Pevear's 2006 version, and it looks like it's pretty accurate--which is to say, not absurdly bowdlerized."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This is one of Verne's best books. It is full of scientific and technical/technological details (I had to use several encyclopedias/dictionaries to find some words' meaning), historical references - no doubt Verne researched the topics thoroughly. It is also humorous in places but certainly entertaining and serious on every page. As the story progresses you will discover Verne's view on society in sentences like &quot;The world needs no new continents, it needs new people.&quot; As for the storyline, you will never guess what happens next. Every intelligent person with an open mind will find this book a must read."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Jules Verne's, &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; is one of the best books I have ever read, possibly the best. The book is so easy to follow and read. The book seems to just flow as you are reading, for there are many stopping points in the book; unlike some books which contain 30 paged chapters. This book has a total of 46 chapters, none of them being more than fifteen pages long. I enjoy these kinds if books because it lets you read 5 or 6 chapters at a time, and not make you go so into extreme detail so you do not get bored. The main character, Professer Aronnax, tells the book. He is a very intelligent individual who is a Professor of Natural History in Paris during the late 1800's. He and his faithful servant, Conseil, are assigned to an expedition with many other chosen men by the French Government, including a Canadian Harpooner named Ned Land, to rid the seas of a little known and terrifying sea monster. However, the &quot;monster&quot; turns out to be a giant submarine, Nautilus, commanded by the mysterious Captain Nemo, who later captivates professor Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned Land. So begins a great adventure of a truly fantastic voyage from Atlantis to the South Pole."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"If you are interested in Sci-Fiction, you will enjoy thisbook. I think it is a good book for people who want to take the timeand explore an underwater adventure. The author explains every situation in detail. It helps the reader understand what is happening. The reader can picture this adventure happening as if it actually happened. The climax of the book will keep you turning the pages. That is the best thing going for this book. The worst thing about the book is the length/number of pages. It contains 371 pages and if one is wanting to read something quickly this is definitely a book that will take some time. So plan ahead and take an exciting adventure."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"The hardcover version of the Sterling edition is bound and printed nicely. Jules Verne's story is enthralling and full of detail. However, the translation in the Sterling edition is very old and can be rather tongue-twisting when read aloud. The word ordering in the sentences often reflects the original French a bit too much. Likewise, the numereous names of various flora and fauna are rendered in Latin form, rather than the more common names I'm familiar with. I've found Frederick Paul Walter's newer (and also unabridged) translation to be much easier to read:Amazing Journeys: Journey to the Center of the Earth, From the Earth to the Moon, Circling the Moon, 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas, and Around the World in 80 Days."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Regular readers of [...] won't be surprised to learn that the first book I read on the Kindle was 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. There's something so right about reading a century-old tale -- whose narrator is enthralled with the power of electricity -- on a device that's a pretty darn enthralling use of electricity.That said, in exploring how the image of technology and the future has changed over time, few books are as influential as this one. Some observations:1. Captain Nemo's built himself a utopia. Consider that he says the Nautilus is out of reach from tyrants and built so well that it can't be damaged by nature. Nemo says he's never been as free as when he put himself inside the sub. There's a library with nearly unlimited information. The ocean provides an unlimited amount of food. Everyone's healthy thanks to the constant temperature and fresh sea air. Electricity, described as providing light \\"more uniform and continuous than the sun\\" and behaving \\"more obedient than gas\\" provides an unlimited amount of power. Sounds like every other golden age longed for through time, but this one is all thanks to technology--and especially electricity.2. The constant use of extreme detail in the book, going on for pages and pages about what the fish look like and rattling off measurements, give the fantasy parts of the book much more credence. It's a lesson on the benefits of getting granular when selling a vision of the future.3. There's a great passage where, on behalf of science, Verne snobbily says, \\"It was Tasman who discovered this group in 1643, the year Torricelli invented the barometer and Louis XIV mounted the throne. I leave the reader to decide which of these events has been more useful to the human race.\\" This wasn't the first time an innovator scoffed at a politician, but it's certainly one of the sharpest. Food for thought for those innovation v. public policy debates that break out every so often."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I thought that the book had one of the best plot lines I've ever seen, reguardless of the fact that there is only slight building up to the climax. The only thing that I didn't think was that good about the book was that about every other page, Jules Verne would go into a paragraph description of the animals. For example, he would say something like: I just saw a tuna. But not the normal tuna, it was yellow-bellied, had dorsal fins that went at a downward angle, etc.\\" Otherwise, I thought it was a great read and well worth the money. I will be purchasing more of Jules Verne's books very soon. I highly suggest for you to read this book. Another thing, if you enjoyed watching the 1954 \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea Film,\\" I highly suggest the book because the movie only gives a small picture of what actually occurred during their submarine venture and the book tells you everything, and the occurrences are just amazing.The novel basically tells the story of Professor Arronax, Ned Land and Conseil who get taken aboard the Nautilus and experiences many adverntures, such as going to Atlantis, an underwater hunt, getting trapped in an ice block and much more."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I don't pretend to be a literary know-it-all. I know about as much about classic literature as I do about moose hunting...and that ain't much. For whatever reason, I thought it might make me a more cultured and enlightened person if I read some of the old school fiction. You know, the authors that nobody ever mentions unless you're in an English class. They may be crusty, but they're considered to have written some of the greatest novels ever.While my trek through the classics is still at its infancy, I decided to take that journey 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea that Jules Verne has been begging me to take ever since I was a wee lad. I've always noticed the various covers of this book over the years, often featuring a giant squid attacking either a submarine or some guy in an old-timey diving suit, or even both. Sometimes there's a treasure chest involved, too. It's no wonder that the book has always peaked my interest. How could you go wrong with such an inviting cover. It was about time that I figured out what was up with this Captain Nemo guy I'd always heard about.Through virtually the entire book, you have basically only four characters. Captain Nemo, of course, is the one everyone's heard of. He's the mysterious commander of an astonishing vehicle for its time, an electric submarine called The Nautilus. Professor Arronax, his servent Conseil, and Ned Land, a noted French-canadian harpooner, end up as captives aboard Nemo's strange vessel and are taken along for a voyage across the globe. The sights that they encounter are incredible. Creatures never imagined, lost treasure, undersea eruptions, and long-sunken vessels. The adventures are high ones, as they take the dangerous trip beneath the polar ice cap and even visit the lost city of Atlantis.I guess you could call it high adventure, but surprisingly, it's not all that exciting. The journey 20,000 Leagues Under the sea is a slow, plodding one. Sandwiched in between a fairly compelling beginning and ending is a wordy, overly explanatory middle filled with obscene amounts of nautical and technical jargon, yet devoid of much stimulating drama.I have no doubt that in the 1800s Jules Verne's descriptive prose awed readers to the wonders of the sea and underwater travel. In this day and age, however, the bar has been raised considerably and the story itself is very underwhelming for the modern read. The average person has been able to witness for themselves much of the stuff that Verne describes in such painstaking detail, either through television or trips to aquariums and the like. Much of the book simply isn't as extraordinary as it was 100 years ago. While the sea still holds great mystery, it's not near as foreign to us as it was back then.If you're not aroused by the technical workings of a submarine, or of the many food dishes that you can make out of sea life, there's not much else there for the average reader. The plot is more centered around situations conceived to further describe Captain Nemo's crazy contraption, The Nautilus, than it is to actually weave an interesting story. After the first few chapters, I was bored, save for a few bits here and there, until the last few chapters when it began to pick back up again.I trudged on, however, anxious to finish so I can get to the next book, hoping that it will be less yawn-inducing. If you're like me and wanting to tackle those classics, save 20,000 Leagues for the end. Pick up Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World or War of the Worlds instead. Both are far superior. Heck, I'd even rather read Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde, at least it was shorter. But like I said earlier, I'm no expert in the classics, maybe I just missed the boat, err...submarine, on this one."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"20,000 Leagues was very good. In my opinion, the book was very good from the first sighting of the huge &quot;monster&quot; to when there was the first sighting of the underwater submarine.

I certainly loved the book and intend on reading it again sometime. That is why I rate it a five star."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"A classic is a classic, but additional features in this edition make it a great choice.

This book was created for serialization and so comes across in a somewhat repetitive chapter formula. I read this in grade school and have yet to find anyone who truly disliked it. Journey To The Center Of The Earth is also a Classic, but I prefer this. Well written, with a unique story and good visuals throughout. The reader can clearly identify with the characters and their view of being on the Nautilus. Captain Nemo is an enigmatic person with many layers. In this one will see Man vs. man, and man vs. nature. For some the descriptions of various Marine life may seem over done. For me they gave context within a slide show of what truly made Captain Nemo tick.

The United States Government sends Professor Arronnax out to sea on the ship called the Abraham Lincoln to search for the monster. Professor Arronnax and his servant, Conseil, set out on the adventure.Professor Arronnax soon learns that the monster is really a steel-plated submarine, called the Nautilus. The Nautilus crashes into their ship and Professor Arronnax, Conseil and Ned, a harpooner, fall into the water and are captured by Captain Nemo. On the Nautilus, Professor Arronnax, Conseil and Ted watch Captain Nemo as he explores the under water world. On the Nautilus they visit many places including the lost continent of Atlantis, the South Pole and the Great Ice Barrier. They search for treasure and have fights with unfriendly sea creatures. Captain Nemo, however, rams the Nautilus into other ships when they get into his way. Nemo rams the Nautilus into a war ship one day because he believes the people on the ship are responsible for killing his family and taking everything away from him that he loves. Professor Arronnax realizes that Captian Nemo is crazy and that they must escape. Professor Arronnax, Conseil and Ted plan their escape only to learn that the Nautilus was caught up in the Maelstrom, the most violent whirlpool in the world. No ship had ever escaped the current of the Maelstrom! Do Professor Arronnax, Conseil and Ted escape the Nautilus and the violent whirlpool or do they drown in the whirlpool and sink to the bottom of the sea?I chose to read this book because I like adventure books and this certainly has adventure and excitement in it. I think that anyone who enjoys reading adventure stories should purchase this book because the characters go to many different places and always are in constant danger. I could not put the book down!

There was always action happening, for example, when the giant squid attacked the Nautilus. The characters were realistic and intriguing.

The adventure comes alive by not omitting the breadth and depth of Verne's aesthetic ability originally entrenched within this masterpiece."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This is the first book that I &quot;experienced&quot; from Jules Verne. He is certainly a master in mixing scientific facts with literary fiction. A true visionary. Although I have seen various movie versions, I was still surprised at some of the events in this story. The book seemed to move along well besides a relatively slow begining. It has everything a great story should have. Mystery, adventure, action, exotic locations and even a bit of romance, albeit it is with Nemo and the Sea.This particular version was an &quot;audio book&quot; performed by Harlan Ellison. His narration was inspired. I also enjoyed his voice characterizations, especially the impersonation of James Mason's Captain Nemo. It had a reminiscent quality. Music and sound effects would have been a nice touch as long as it wouldn't be distracting. For me, the book ended too quickly. I wanted to hear more of their adventures and would have also liked to have read more about Nemo's past. Although, Verne does tell us more in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;. Another book I shall look forward in taking up soon. I am sure it will be an equally pleasing experience."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"It's indeed ironic that great works of literature are censored, not only prior to publication, but also after the books hit the shelves. Depending on a period and country, even a incontroversial author like Jules Verne suffered from closed-mindedness. That totalitarian regimes see fit to burn books, or to actively block publication and distribution of some books, in hope that the nation will not see the uneasy point of view often expressed in books - that fact does not surprise anyone anymore nowadays. But that such practices have been utilized in the land of the free and the brave - makes us wonder how different these two systems are. What had poor Verne done to deserve censorship? \\"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\\" was censored prior to publication, and the original manuscript never saw the day during Verne's lifetime. Against his will the author had to cut the social commentary from his trilogy, of which this novel is the first volume. By today's standards, the punishment was incomparable to the guilt, but even then it was disturbing that a work of fiction, a splendid tale of adventure written for the purpose of entertainment and education of the reader, not a political pastiche, mind you, had to have been censored. In particular, the crucial part of the novel had been cut, one in which we learn what were the origins of Captain Nemo, his motivations and heritage. Only years later, after Verne's death, the original manuscript was published, to reveal that Verne originally intended Nemo to have been a Polish nobleman, who escaped his Vaterland after the failure of the 1863 uprising against the Russian Empire. Nemo decided to remove himself from the society, literally from human view - by constructing the famous Nautilus, a submarine, in which he cruised the tranquil abyss of the oceans, where no hand would touch him, and where he wouldn't have to stand the pettiness and cruelty of his fellow human beings.Thus, if you happened to have read the censored version, you would be genuinely puzzled as to the motivations of the Captain. Today, many abridged versions of Verne's novels appear in print, where most of the content is done away with, and what is left is the bare-bones action storyline. To mutilate the book in this way is to commit an unforgivable crime in general, and to hurt the author and readers in particular. \\"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\\" deserves to be widely read just as it had been intended by the author, with its wealth of scientific and prophetic information left untouched, with the commentaries and philosophical musings intact. Only then, within the grand context, the adventure makes sense, only then it is art. I have read this novel circa twenty times; I have admired Captain Nemo for years; I have held my breath in the depths of the Golfstr&ouml;m in the Norwegian Sea during the storm, and during many thrilling moments in the book, not to mention the unforgettable conclusion of the novel; I have tried to solve the mystery of the waterborne ship made of steel, with its many complicated instruments; I have followed the arguments hurled between the Captain and the involuntary passengers of the Nautilus; and finally, I was trembling all over whenever I reached the culmination of the adventure. Verne was a genius, and Captain Nemo was his most original character creation, one I am very fond of for personal reasons, as is I am sure the case with many other readers of the prophetic French author."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I read this after reading &#34;Mysterious Island&#34; just to get the background story.

The thing that I remember the most, from the first and last time I read it in the 3rd or 4th grade, is the food. In a world where submarines are a regular part of our lives, there was nothing unique for me in the idea of a sub. Yet, the food facsinated me, they were eating things that I've never heard of, and they seemed so exotic, that I still remember them: The sea Cucamber, the squid, the sea-weed, the fruites of the bread-tree.

However, buy it for him or her when they are still very young, before they are 'corrupted' by the TV and the idea that reading is \\"not-Cool\\". This book would also make, in my opinion, a great bed-time story for a kid that is old enough to understand complex and sometimes scary storylines, and yet young enough to be charmed by the wonders of technoogy and nature, and sit with mouth and eyes wide open when the giant squid is catching the Nautilus."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This book is one fantastic read!

When they landed and were cooking their meat a bunch of cannibals came and started to attack. When the group returned captain Nemo opened the hatch and kept it open.

I did enjoy all the action scenes and any scenes that had dialogue or interaction between Nemo and the Professor. There was just so much detail that I practically skimmed through those pages. I feel bad that I did not have interest in these subjects, but it was just too much and after some point, not very interesting."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"i thoght thisbook was okay it was a tad bit boring thogh it had its exciting parts but i feel it could have had more action and suspece."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Jules Verne has once again outdone himself in this classic novel entitled 20,000 leagues under the sea. Verne uses excellent description that enhances the reading pleasure. A second aspect of 20,000 leagues under the sea that makes it so interesting to read is the susupense. The tension created by the unknown realm of the seas is immense. The tension created by the characters as time drags on is also a positive aspect of the book. 20,000 leagues under the sea is a classic literary work and should be adored by many as I have enjoyed it myself. The memorable stories it tells, although all may not be true they will certainly live on in the hearts and minds of people everywhere, forever."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I found this book to be very difficult to get into.

You also get ten times the number of adventures seen in the movie. Heck, I was so involved in it, I finished it in only 2 1/2 days! Read this book."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I really enjoy books that revolve around science... especially when they were written during the 1800s and early 1900s. It is very entertaining to discover what these people believed and to compare their beliefs to ours in modern times. 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea is entertaining in this fashion. Jules Verne is suprisingly accurate in his depiction of a modern-day electric submarine and its workings... although he doesn't go into the minute details that I was hoping for. The ending of this book is a tremendous let-down with regards to the character of Captain Nemo. Throughout the entire book, the Captain's background is built up to be a giant mystery... which simply begs for resolution. I couldn't wait to reach the end of the book in order to find out why Captain Nemo was the way he was. This resolution never comes. Never. This left me with the opinion that Jules Verne simply wasn't a talented storyteller, and never bothered to fill out and completely think about the character of Captain Nemo. Anyone can think up fantastic situations and theories... but the real talent comes in explaining them in a plausible way to the reader. It's akin to watching a movie where lots of incredible things happen to the main characters, only to have them wake up stating that it was all a dream."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"At some times it was incredibly boring, with all this technology stuff, but at certain points it was interesting.

It's a fast read, too."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Verne was anachronous to his era. But, better that he was. Because the most amazing element of this work, more than the astounding genius and limitless creativity, was the fact it was penned in the latter stages of the 19th centruy. Some highlights: the undersea walks, Atlantis, and the attack of the cuttle-fish. There's many more, though; you could do worse than reading this book and discovering it's hidden treasures for yourself. There may be perhaps a bit too much of 'zoophytes' in it, but the book will hold it's own as a classic, regardless. For Verne's prowess was not how he told his stories, but WHEN. One final note: was Captain Nemo a villian, or simply a good guy who went too far? A megalomaniac, that Nemo."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"A scientist, his sidekick and a big strong sailor are going to have their lives changed forever when they are sent to capture a giant octopus. But, instead, they fall overboard and find out what they think is an octopus is really a giant submarine with a Captain Nimo and a crew that speaks their own language (which the trio calls &quot;the submarine language&quot;)! In this submarine, they go on millions of adventures like: tunneling through blocks of ice in the antartic, zooming through tunnels from sea to sea, and seeing every different kind of fish you could ever imagine. The only problem is the scientist's sidekick joins with the big sailor, Ned, and together they try to escape. They have many of their own adventures too, like when they try to escape the first time and they almost get caught by cannibals. The second time they escape and write a story which you will read if you want to read it and it's called, &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot;.

Lots of action in this book - blowing things up, great escapes, and. . . you can find out the rest for yourself!"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Despite the ravages of time, Jules Verne's oddysey sails proudly onwards.

The listener is swept, along with the narrator and his two companions, aboard the futuristic (but never improbable) submarine \\"Nautilus,\\" helmed by the mysterious (and ultimately tragic) Captain Nemo. The wonders of Verne's tale of adventure, as well as the tension and sheer terror contained therein, have never before been made so real in any performance of any adaptation of this novel. It becomes easy to empathize with the plight of the narrator, and, indeed, to share in his feelings and frustrations, save one -- the listener may not share the narrator's desire to end the adventure and go home. Ellison's vocal work is outstanding, and the direction of the adaptation is flawless. In an era where the science fiction market increasingly relies on the use of franchised characters, it is refreshing to hear this adaptation of a highly original (and ever relevant) work."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Beautiful descriptions, heroic adventure, and intellectual, that is how I describe the classic story &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; written by the infamous author Jules Verne. &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; is full of Adventure, vivid descriptions, and is well researched.

Is he the antithesis of a 19th century capitalist? Is he the result of capitalism, using technology to gain the liberty of a higher standard of living which it allows? Is he despot, savior, evil or compassionate?Nemo epitomizes a vision of humanity which is arrogantly attempting to create a peaceful world through technology. The battle is clearly in vain as the characters are hindered by the passions of their natures.Nemo is the rebel, the nationless man, who has turned away from the machine mentality, dollar diplomacy and imperialist expansionism of his age.Verne creates a self-contained world for Nemo, one in which there is no dependency on capitalism. All that Nemo needs is produced by the Nautilus.This freedom is decadent. The Nautilus produces no surplus value other than to provide for the whims of Nemo, a person dehumanized by the progress of the developing western world. A world he doesn't understand or is in touch with.Even in his act of political intervention against imperialism through the financing of the liberation movement of the Cretans from the Turks was decadent. The money came from the sea, it was put back into circulation, it wasn't the result of production or creativity. There is no net gain to society by this action. The people could have been better provided for by encouraging production and industry.Though Nemo was creative enough to produce the Nautilus to escape his world of torment, he's nothing more than a narcissist. Racing back and forth across the oceans is an act of conspicuous and selfish consumption.Nemo's goal is conquest of the sea, to make nature a possession, something no longer mysterious and otherworldly, but just a part of the humanized world, as if that's possible.Though Nemo suffers great loss, he blames the world, not himself. He sees himself as virtuous, as a victim of industry and progress. He is a paradox of the world.His is a world running from machines and science in a machine. A world free from governments and country in which he governs. A world free from captivity in which he holds others captive. A world from which he takes freely, but gives nothing to in return. Nemo is everything he disdains.All of this is lost to Nemo, an obscurity of self, hidden behind his anger and self exile. Reckless abandon seems to be his only motive. His disgust with society has robbed him of all virtue, all concern for others.In making his journey of discovery around the world, Nemo fails to make the most important discovry there is, what it means to be human."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This is my favorite book of all time.

The begining starts of slow but once you get into it, it gets pretty good. Well, everyone around the world is talking about this so called narwhale in the ocean destroying ships. It really isn't a narwhale, but I am not going to tell you because it ruins the story. Well the nautlis, is the submarine that goes underwater and explores the ocean underwater forests.

It is definitely not a fast read by modern standards. Not that TLUTS is not a great read, but it is hard work for an average reader and should not be required of the inexperienced reader.

I signed up for an adventure novel, not a Jacques Cousteau special. Oh well, when it works it works well and Verne will have you interested to the very end.

I love science fiction and classic novels so Verne should be perfect for me, right? Well... I can't say that Verne wasn't influential and his ideas are spectacular which is why so many movies have been based on his books but I have yet to read a Verne book that exceeded or even met my expectations.First, all his characters, despite different names and motivations, are all the same; perfect English gentlemen. This is not uncommon for writers from this era but when a Canadian harpooner like Ned Land uses phrases like \`By Jove' it rings false. Rudyard Kipling wrote Captains Courageous 27 years later and created sailors that felt absolutely authentic. Verne's characters seem to be created for a specific purpose. Captain Nemo is there to explain in detail the working of his Nautilus and other inventions while Professor Aronnax's role is to gush over Nemo's discoveries. I don't believe that any of the other members of Nemo's crew ever say a single word in the book and are simply window dressing.The second big problem is that Verne's science is often dubious. I'm not talking about science that was still questionable in Verne's time but established science and physical facts going way back. Verne seems completely unaware of things like encumbrance or the effects of high elevation. In this book Verne's consistently and often dramatically increases the size of sea life. Also, it can be somewhat dull reading constant facts and figures about the speed, depth, volume of air etc of the Nautilus. The book just goes on and on with Nemo relaying fact after fact while M. Aronnax listens in rapt attention. It also spends a near eternity describing all of the flora and fauna and without an actual plot to pin it to it gets very dull. The layout of the Nautilus is very unrealistic with no apparent attempt to maximize the usage of space. Nemo has a full size organ in his spacious cabin. Actual submarines are very constrained spaces.In order to create a compelling story Disney greatly expanded on Nemo's quest for revenge which is barely mentioned in the book. Disney also greatly expanded Ned Land's role to the improvement of the story and did a very nice bit of casting having him played by Kirk Douglas. The famous scene where the Nautilus is attacked by a giant squid (multiple squids in the book) only occupies a couple of pages. Mostly the book is just the Nautilus cruising all over the world occasionally getting stuck. That's about it. It's as if Verne couldn't come up with a plot to wrap around his idea of a mysterious captain and his incredible machine.I have read quite a few of Verne's novels but this one may have the most anemic plot of them all. 20,000 is leagues is much more serious than \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" and \`In Search of the Castaways' (which I really didn't enjoy) but it's not particularly compelling. This is a rare occasion where I think the famous movie version was an improvement over the book."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This book was TERRIBLE. I couldn't even get past part one. Yes, there are two parts, and I am certain that the second half is just as bad as the first. The whole story was just describing Professor Aronnax's daily life on the Nautilus, which was completely repetitive if you ask me. The only SOMEWHAT interesting parts of the story was when Professor Aronnax is in danger of being attacked by natives, but Jules Verne just HAS to say it in the most boring way. Jules Verne also spent entire pages describing totally boring conversations between Captain Nemo and Professor Aronnax. These conversations were not only boring but confusing. Jules Verne used way to many technical words, in my opinion. Don't get me wrong- I have a big vocabulary range, but that was ridiculous. And who cares about finding the Nautilus's exact location on a map using latitude and longitude lines? Why couldn't Jules Verne just say, &quot;IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN?&quot; If I were you, I would stay away from this book. Don't even THINK about reading it, because you'll just be bored to tears. I know you will, because I was. So just spare yourself from wasting days on end reading this book and take my advice."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I like the story and drama in it.

Verne's love of science and technology is a leading theme through out the book and one gets a lesson in the marine-life as it was known during his lifetime.

In this classic book he takes the reader through the unexplored depths of the ocean on a fantastic and breathtaking voyage fraught with excitement and danger.I have read several reviews of this book from a variety of sources. The biggest criticism that is offered by the reviewers is that throughout the book Verne, through the words of Professor Annorax, lists and describes a multitude of sea life, both flora and fauna. Many reviewers find this distracting and boring. My personal opinion is that the reason that many readers and reviewers criticize this is because they are comparing the book to the very poor Disney film interpretation and adaptation of the book.In truth, the book would suffer greatly without the detailed description of the flora and fauna observed by Professor Annorax. Why? I believe that many of the readers and reviewers misunderstand Verne's intention of who Professor Annorax is. Professor Annorax is a world renown naturalist and specialist in sea life. That is exactly what makes this story so wonderful. Verne takes the worlds foremost expert on sea flora and fauna and throws him into a world previously unknown to him. By observing the many life forms never before documented Annorax realizes just how much he does not know and becomes an even greater expert than before. The documentation of the many species is the natural response an expert naturalist would have to the sudden discovery of a whole new world of flora and fauna.Clearly, Verne had a vivid imagination by describing a functioning submarine well before the concept of a submarine had ever been dreamt of. The detailed explanations of how the submarine works and how it is able to produce electricity and power from nothing more than sea water is perhaps the best kind of science fiction, the kind that has a basis in fact. I have to believe that when the first submarines were being built that the inventors had to have made a serious study of Verne's Nautilus. To have come up with such an intricate, detailed, and scientifically sound description of a submarine in his time is absolutely astounding.Finally, the accuracy of the never before seen flora and fauna when coupled with the scientifically accurate description of the design and functioning of the Nautilus has to make one wonder if Captain Nemo and the Nautilus are really science fiction or if by some miracle they did actually exist and instead of fiction this story was a summary of a real experience Verne, as Professor Annorax, actually experienced."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was one of the best books of it's time and it's legacy still continues today. The author Jules Verne is able to create a world that is fantastic and believable at the same time. However there are moments in which the details become repetitive and rather insignificant.The main character Captain Nemo, it is never obvious if he is the protagonist or antagonist, has a personality that is quite paradoxical. He believes that mankind has wrecked the earth and has given up on the human race as so decides to escape it by traveling the seas in his submarine. However, he is compassionate towards his crew members. At most times he is emotionless, but it is his emotional trauma that bothers him more than anything else. He is a complex character who is interesting, mysterious, and quite interesting to analyze.The story line is intriguing and Verne's imagination adds to the impact of the plot. The story begins with a naturalist, his assistant, and a harpooner looking for a giant sea creature that has destroyed several ships. It turns out that this creature that they are looking for, and find, is Captain Nemo's submarine. Verne is also able to create a wonderful world full of different creature of the sea as well as the submarine it's self. At the time the book was written sea travel was common but submarines were unheard of. The description of the vessel and its ability must have wowed readers of the time.However, it's Verne's over usage of description and unnecessary plot that tends to ruin the pace of the story. For pages on end there is a constant rambling of encyclopedia-like information. Is it really necessary to know the name, size, origin, composition, weight (etc) of some random mineral that naturalist happens to find?Unfortunately these random occurrences make the book a little hard to follow, but in the end it is still a classic that everyone should end up reading."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Twenty Thousand Leagues under The Sea by Jules Verne is one of the bestscience fiction books. I would recommend the movie starring James Masonas Captain Nemo. It is well written as all of Jules Verne's books are.Danny Fleming, author of How to Prove The Collatz Conjecture."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Having chewed and digested \\"Around the World in Eighty Days\\", \\"Five Weeks in a Balloon\\" and \\"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\\", I set out to devour another chef d'oeuvre of Verne [the often overlooked \\"true\\" father of science fiction] with much relish. Sure, \\"20,000 Leagues\\" seemed bigger than the others I'd read, but I thought it would be the classic excitement and drama of Verne all the way. Well, I was nearly right.Professor Arronax leaves a \\"normal\\" life in France for the US, taking his assistant with him, to investigate the matter that has taken all the attention of the \\"modern\\" or \\"known\\" world. Joined by the egotistic harpooner, Ned Land, they seek adventure, and they find it.Again, I see Verne's classic touch of the dramatic as the threesome find the monster - the Nautilus - or rather, as the Nautilus finds them. They awaken to an interminable adventure under the sea. The Professor is fascinated, or perhaps, intoxicated with the endless wealth of life in the sea and spends hours, days and months observing and recording. The tireless taxonomist takes in all the eye can see and with the help of his assistant, classifies it all. This is where the tedium began for me as the reader. Pages upon pages of pure taxonomy.The accounts of the undersea explorations in specially designed suits offers some relief. The enigmatic Captain Nemo is in charge; incidents and never accidents. Everything about him is shrouded in mystery - pondering on the life of Captain Nemo offers some useful distraction and provides the fuel to consume more and more pages.However, you can never miss Verne's climactic scenes, where he brings drama and suspense to their peak. The almighty Nautilus is trapped inside a huge mass of ice at the South Pole, and for the first time, Captain Nemo shows signs of worry, however subtle. Yet, he goes on with a steely determination. Things are looking very desperate, but as usual, the day is saved. However, I found myself following every detail, sharing all their fears, their toil, their despair. Their ecstasy was mine when the Nautilus broke free. I was totally drawn in......The irritable Ned Land sparks the fire of escape. He's sick and tired of submarine life as Nemo shows no signs of releasing his charges. The adventure ends with the escape of the threesome back to terra firma, or does it? I guess it continued with Captain Nemo and his longsuffering crew until his death, burying years of useful knowledge and resources under the sea. Or did he live forever?A highly challenging but rewarding read for the discerning reader or Verne fanatic."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Oh my gosh, this book is so cool! And so very important in understanding Verne's place in literary and scientific history. This large format book is an annotated version of the most widely circulated English translation of t he Verne classic. And because of the annotations, we learn how HORRIBLY Verne's work was translated from the original French. A great example comes near the beginning of the book when the delightfully detailed annotation in the margin points out that the common edition translation talks of the narrator returning from the \\"disagreeable territory of Nebraska.\\" We learn from the annotation that this is a huge distortion of the narrator's personality and experience. Verne's original writing spoke of the \\"badlands of Nebraska\\" and actually had a favorable attitude toward the region. We learn from the annotations that there were dozens of such awful, misleading mistranslations throughout the common edition that so many people have read, with the author often criticized for errors the he should not be held accountable for. Some of the mistranslations are comical in retrospect. For example we learn in this edition that the common edition includes the phrase \\"at the expense of my loins\\" when, in fact, a more accurate translation would be \\"hurting my back.\\"Verne's book is so filled with cutting edge science of his day and the annotations enlighten us so much about them. Thus this annotated version makes Verne's story an even more interesting and multi-dimentional reading experience."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne is a mysterious adventure book about four voyagers pioneering the unknown depths of the sea. The main characters of this book are Pierre Aronnax, Counseil, Ned Land, and Captain Nemo. Pierre Aronnax is an assistant professor at a natural history museum and Counseil is Aronnax's 30 year old servant. Ned Land is an expert Canadian harpooner with an instinct to kill. Finally, Captain Nemo the mystifying captain of the ship takes them in and does not release them. The French narrator of this story, Pierre Aronnax, while intrigued by Captain Nemo and their many underwater excursions knows that he is still a captive and is planning to escape.Pierre Aronnax, his servant Conseil, and Ned Land were all summoned to the Abraham Lincoln a ship designed to pursue the monster who was tormenting voyagers on the seas. They encounter a large and swift object in the sea and all three of them are thrown over board. The three men find out later that it was a submarine that attacked them and the commander of this submarine Captain Nemo brings them aboard his vessel. Nemo gives them a grand tour of the vessel. He still treats them like captives but grants them some mobility. Their first adventure with Captain Nemo is the Pearl Fields. The Pearl Fields are fields filled with pearl oysters but Nemo doesn't stop for any of them. He takes them into a huge cave and eventually leads them to a 7-foot long oyster with a pearl the size of a coconut. Nemo does not take the oyster but leaves it to grow. The next encounter is with a gigantic shark. The shark is preying on a helpless fisherman when Nemo jumps in to stab it in the belly. The shark overthrows Nemo but Ned Land is quick to defend him by spearing the shark through the head. The waters are foggy with blood but Nemo manages to bring the fisherman back to his boat and revive him. While these men are thrown together by chance they still show devotion to each other and acts of bravery and humanity. Still Arronax continues to want to escape. The last adventure these men have together is just off the American Coast when seven giant sea monsters that resemble squid attack their submarine. Just as they open the hatch a giant tentacle swirls down into the ship and grabs a hold of a defenseless sailor. As the squid's arm is slinking down Nemo cuts it off with a hatchet. They all fiercely battle the monsters as Ned Land barely escapes the jaws of one squid with Nemo's help. They soon fight off all the enormous squid and are on their way again. They come upon a whirl pool and as they frantically try to escape, a life boat is ripped from the submarine and Pierre Aronnax's world goes dark. What becomes of Nemo and his crew, Ned Land, Aronnax and his humble servant Conseil is the last part of the book.I thought this book was a great read and kept me guessing all the way through. It is not all violence and gore most of the book is about these adventurers discovering nature and the sea. The characters are interesting and very different from each other. Nemo is the caring yet stern captain of the ship while Pierre is somewhat shy and curious. I like both of these characters equally but respect Nemo more because of his strength and convictions. Ned Land is a hostile maverick with the instinct to kill while Conseil is gentle and barely expresses his personality except for his devotion to Arronax. I think Ned Land is a dangerous person to be with but he could save your life if you run into trouble and I admire Conseil's unflinching loyalty to Aronnax. The discovery and respect for nature is an underlying theme throughout the book and I was fascinated by this point of view because it was written so long ago. I can't compare this book to any other book because it is unique but probably the closest book would be Journey to the Center of the Earth which is also an adventure book. Anyone who likes a creative book with lots of adventure, action and heroics would find this book extraordinary."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I want to read it again!

The story is still fresh and informative. To be sure, Verne got some of the technical things wrong, but considering how technology has advanced and more is known, he got it mostly right. I've wanted to read this since I was a kid, and I am sorry I waited until I retired. Some of the biological naming discussions get somewhat tedious, but as a whole the story is great! However, don't think it is quite like the Walt Disney movie version, because it is not. It starts out that way, but proceeds through the story in a somewhat different way, and ends differently.

It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder. Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning. If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller. That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint). Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues. This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This is without a doubt the best translation of Jules Verne's 1870 science fiction classic &quot;Vingt mille lieues sous les mers&quot; (&quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea&quot;). This translation by two Verne scholars, Walter James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter, takes all the knowledge available on the book and its author to not only make an accurate and readable complete text (early versions often omit a full quarter of the French original) that fixes the many errors of earlier translators, but also purges the text of many mistakes that were made by the original French compositors. The research and work that went into this translations is really quite stunning, and the result is a text that really lets Verne's genius shine: &quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea&quot; is not only a brilliant piece of scientific prophecy, but also a thrilling story with superb, subtle characterizations.The plot is familiar: Captain Nemo, an enigmatic figure who has withdrawn himself from the world, tours the oceans in his submarine called the Nautilus. We see this journey of 20,000 leagues (approx. 43,200 miles) through the eyes of Professor Pierre Aronnax, a scientist who is both Nemo's guest and prisoner. Also aboard with Aronnax are his manservant Conseil and a gruff ship's harpooner, Ned Land. The Nautilus encounters many wonders and obstacles on its long voyage: underwater forests, giant clams, attacks by huge squid, imprisonment in ice at the South Pole, monster storms, a war with a pack of sperm whales, and the discovery of the lost continent of Atlantis. But as something deep and destructive gnaws away at Captain Nemo, his prisoners seek a way to escape from the miracle ship.In the English-speaking world Jules Verne has rarely received in the praise he truly deserves as a writer. People applaud his scientific foresight (while criticizing him for errors that were usually the fault of the translators), but shrug off his writing as inconsequential, with cardboard characters and plotless stories. If only these critics would read this translation of Verne's best novel...they would have to re-think their position on the great French writer! His genius for blending adventure, comedy, and psychology burst through in this translation. The book does veer into lengthy descriptions of marine life in places, and modern readers are likely to skim these parts (Verne even provides clues in the text to indicate when he's about to digress), but as a whole the novel is absolutely engrossing, throwing one stupendous adventure after another at the characters, while developing a mystery around Captain Nemo and increasing tension onboard the Nautilus so that the many different incidents hold together as a single plot. Even though submarines are commonplace technology today, Verne infuses his story with such awe-inspiring wonder that you can't help but feel the same sense of amazement as Professor Aronnax when he finds himself cruising the depths of the world's oceans. Real wonder never gets stakes, and no one was better at creating wonder than Jules Verne.Aside from the excellent translation, this edition contains numerous extras (if this were a DVD, it would be labeled as a Special Edition Director's Cut). The lengthy introduction explains Verne's background, education, the development of the novel, the many things that Verne accurately predicted, the book's unsung literary qualities, the different French texts, and the problems with earlier translations. All the original illustrations from the original French edition are reproduced in the text, and generous footnotes give the reader a guide through Verne's more obscure references and shed light on the author's scientific genius. As a bonus at the end of the book, the editors include a new translation of the relevant passages from &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; that discuss Captain Nemo's background (just in case you're too impatient to go read &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; for yourself to solve the Captain Nemo mystery). There's also a table of the measurements used in the novel for those readers who really want to test the author's scientific accuracy.There really isn't any other choice when it comes to translations of the &quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea.&quot; Nothing comes close to this: it will appease hard science readers, and it will open people up to Jules Verne's overlooked literary talents. With the wealth of background information available, this edition does better by Jules Verne -- ANY Jules Verne -- than has ever been published in the English language."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Most of Jules Verne's works were hastily translated, with many &quot;improvements&quot; made in the process, such as deletion of scientific exposition, as well as deletion of many moments deemed by the translator as dull.This, the Restored and Annotated version of 20,000 leagues, is a VAST improvement over previous English editions. The translation is very well done, and the annotations explain what has been changed and what previous translations accomplished.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"If you want to read the novel itself rather than a &quot;version&quot; based upon it, I recommend the relatively inexpensive 'Bantam Classic' edition of 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. Although the foreword by Ray Bradbury is negligible, the Anthony Bonner translation is a graceful compromise between the 1870 French and modern American English, catching the flavor of the period without burying the reader in pseudo-Victorian turns of phrase.That said, readers who come to LEAGUES from either text, audio, or film adaptations of the novel are likely in for a shock, for the original novel is quite different. Some basics, however, remain the same: Professor Arronax, his valet Conseil, and harpooner Ned Land are coaxed into assisting the United States in a search for a sea monster said to be terrorizing shipping lanes--but the monster is not flesh and blood. The three soon find themselves in the hands of the mysterious Captain Nemo, who has created a machine that glides beneath the surface of the ocean: a submarine named Nautilus.But there the similarity ends. While there are very clear similarities between the novel and the various adaptations it has spawned, the Verne novel is less concerned with story, characters, and adventures than it is in creating a plausible vision of something that simply did not exist at the time Verne wrote: a fully functional submarine capable of navigating even the most treacherous waters. Consequently, the bulk of Verne's text is concerned with detailed descriptions of the Nautilus and the sealife it encounters.Many modern readers may find it uphill work, particularly when Professor Arronax determinedly notes the sealife he sees to the point of scientific classification. But even so, and while it may not reach the level of &quot;great art&quot; literature, LEAGUES is a fascinating novel to read--fascinating as much for itself as for what it tells us about the world of the 1870s and what was believed to be possible. The vision that Verne had would indeed come to pass: there would be submarines, and they would strong enough to brave the polar seas. It is an impressive accomplishment--and a tremendously fun read.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This is Jules Verne's classic tale of undersea adventure, as best I can tell based on the 1873 translation by Lewis Mercier. Since that's been the standard English translation for over a hundred years, it's probably the one you remember reading way back when, and the edition you'll be familiar with.Re-reading this as an adult, and an adult who's spent twenty-plus years since then reading science fiction, I did have to remind myself more than once how amazing the then-future technologies Verne describes, like electric rifles, undersea diving suits, electric motors, etc., would have been to his contemporary readers; the book was first published in 1869, a mere five years after the Confederate submarine Hunley became the first submarine to sink an enemy warship (and sank itself in the process). At times I found myself mentally substituting \\"outer space\\" for \\"under sea,\\" just to help me analogize the situation. Despite that, the plot and action were as riveting now as they were when I first read it twenty years ago. I did find myself, now as then, skimming over much of Verne's extensive scientific descriptions of undersea flora and fauna, etc., but that might be my own failing as a reader -- when I did take the time to read Verne's descriptions, I did sometimes catch the same sense of aquatic wonder I remember from watching films like _The Life Aquatic_.From what I've read, the Mercier translation this is based on contains a number of translation errors, cuts out about 20% of the text, etc. Corrected, completed, updated ebook editions of this classic are available on Amazon, but they cost money -- I've been unable to find an out-of-copyright, corrected, complete, and free edition. For readers on a budget, though, this is probably the version you remember, and if read in the right way -- keeping in mind the era in which it was written, and skimming whenever the science gets too dry or detailed for you -- it's still quite entertaining.Verne did write a sequel, _The Mysterious Island_, also available in the kindle free store; the better translation is available here:The Mysterious Island."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I could not believe this version of 20,000 leagues under the sea. I learned so much from this book. All the other movies and stories that I heard about Captain Nemo were not even close to all the adventures that he goes on in this book. When I think about the movie by Walt Disney and then remember the book I realize that the movie was about 1/4 of the books adventures.All the adventures that I never heard about before like the hunt on the sea floor with the electric bullets, the Arabian tunnel under the sea, Santorin Island the Grecian Archipelago, the volcanoes of the Mediterranean, the Bay of Vigo with all the treasures, the size of the mountains in Atlantis, the adventure at the South Pole, the fight with all the sperm whales, his home Island and the production of salt to run his electric engines.There is so much more to this story than what I have heard before and in this edition the foot notes are excellent. I especially like the story of Arachne and how the name of Arachnid came to mean spiders. The footnotes explain all the literary references which are helpful to understanding the characters. There is so much information here about the sea world in an adventure that makes each moment exciting.Verne must have done so much research for this book to get all the scientific information correct. I never thought they knew all those things about the sea at that time.I was surprised by the character of Nemo who never seemed to go after anyone unless he was attacked. The whole idea that he chased after all forms of warships was something made up in Hollywood. Nemo never seemed to want to even deal with people. The story of Nemo's life at the end of the book explains many of his behaviors.The description of all the types of food that they were constantly eating was interesting you never knew what they were going to catch in the Nautilus' nets.I thought the adventure at the South Pole was the best of all with the predicament that they got into. It was the most adventurous and had the most suspense.I do not know why a book like this is not required reading for high school kids they would learn so much as well as adults. There is so much science geography, ichthyology, astronomy practical uses of physics etc.I would recommend this book to everyone who likes science and adventure."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"One of the great problems with Jules Verne is that in the English speaking world he is relagated to the category of &quot;Boys' Own Adventures&quot;. On the Continent, however, he is considered a brilliant social commentator, and biting satirist, AND a man who predicted the future. This is a volume that helps set matters to the right.If you know of &quot;20,000 Leagues&quot; already, you will find little different at first. The plot is still the plot. Nemo is still Nemo, Prof. Aronnax is still pompous and fascinated by the Nautilus and Ned Land....Ned Land is a flaming socialist.This is one of the major shifts between the original French and the &quot;cleaned up&quot; English editions. Most of the science of the day was pulled out as a &quot;dull read&quot; and all the Socialism, anti-English remarks, and other commentaries of a &quot;questionable nature&quot; were excised. We Americans have unfortunately been until only very recently only able to find these poor early translations, or translations based on these poor translations. There is much more to Verne than submarines and diving suits. He is a man with a vision of his times, both scientific and political, and his books underline this strongly.English readers, demand your Verne well-translated! Do not allow yourself to be fobbed off with bowlderized versions! To be able to read as he wrote himself (well, in English, for those of us who don't read French...) is a greater pleasure than merely an amusing old science-fiction story from the 19th century. Reading this book, as Verne /meant/ it to be read, if a pleasure, but also a struggle to understand ourselves and our relationship to the oceans themselves."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This is Jules Verne at his best, creating the enigmatic character of Captain Nemo.The setting is the mid-nineteenth century. Deadly and mysterious calamities continue to befall ocean-going vessels, with wild reports by survivors that the culprit is a sea monster large enough to ram and sink ships. French professor M. Aronnax finds himself aboard the Abraham Lincoln, a ship charged with finding and destroying the beast. Accompanying him is his loyal servant, Conseil. The ship succeeds in locating the leviathan, but it, too, falls victim to a deadly attack. Aronnax, Conseil, and a Canadian harpooner named Ned Land are the sole survivors--rescued by none other than the \\"monster\\" itself, which turns out not to be flesh and bone, but the world's largest and most technically advanced submarine.They meet Captain Nemo, the owner, inventor, and sovereign leader of the flag-less ship, Nautilus. He explains that they're now his prisoners for life, though they will be treated well and are free to roam the ship. Thus begins an underwater tour of the planet, narrated by the fascinated Aronnax. With today's knowledge of the seas, some of the action is laughable, but at the time this was leading-edge science fiction. Verne's vision of submarine technology, the use of electricity, scuba operations, and various other things is uncanny and typical of great science fiction writers' ability to foretell the future. The ridiculous episodes include traversing an underwater tunnel beneath the Suez to the Mediterranean; a visit to Atlantis; and a trip to the South Pole under the ice, where they break through the surface for a look-see. This would be difficult, considering that the ice is more than a mile thick with a continent of solid rock below. But remember that when Verne wrote the book in 1869, Antarctica had not been explored and remained a virtual myth.The enduring lure of 20,000 Leagues, though, is Verne's Captain Nemo. It takes the entire book (and then some) to learn who this genius Nemo really is. What horrible ordeal has produced such a cynical man, one driven to build the self-sustaining Nautilus, to swear off all contact with the \\"civilized\\" world, never to touch land again, and to ruthlessly and brutally defend himself against any perceived threat? At one glance we see a maniacal scientist worthy of a James Bond thriller. But at closer inspection, Verne has captured the timeless personification of angst over the errors and excesses of Man's interminable war against Nature and himself. Aspects of this same character can today be found in political and environmental activism throughout the world. Actually, it strikes a cord with us all; everyone wants at some time to build what today would amount to a spaceship and shove off from this screwed up planet, saying, \\"Adios, idiots. It's your mess now.\\" --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Big Ice."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This is the &#34;classic&#34; old translation by Louis Mercier most of us read and loved.

It may be found in the Kindle store by typing: Vingt Mille Lieues Sous Les Mers English (or simply: Verne Vingt Mille English). The title is French but don't worry, the book is entirely in English with an informative introduction by Walter.

While the story itself is absorbing, it is the character of the enigmatic Captain Nemo that makes this novel so successful. Many of the characters we meet in Verne's fiction are one-dimensional; while eccentric, a man like Professor Lidenbrock in Journey to the Centre of the Earth is easy to understand, seemingly driven by science and nothing else. In contrast, Captain Nemo is an incredibly complex man whom neither the reader nor the protagonist is ever really able to understand. He has forsaken all of humanity and retreated beneath the sea, yet he shows great compassion to his crewmen and to the poor on earth; he is generally self-absorbed and emotionless, yet we see glimpses of an emotional trauma that constantly afflicts him and is capable of destroying him. He has suffered a great loss at some point in his life, and his sorrow is matched only by a drive for vengeance against his unnamed oppressors. Captain Nemo is one of the most interesting, delightfully mysterious characters in all of literature.As for the story, a naturalist, his assistant, and a harpooner join a party in search of a giant sea creature which has attacked a couple of ships. They are knocked overboard and find themselves saved by the monster, which turns out to be a submarine manned by a mysterious crew of sailors. Captain Nemo requires them to stay on board the Nautilus permanently because he wants to keep the existence of his submarine a secret from the world. The three men sail on the Nautilus for ten months, exploring the world's oceans and seas. They marvel at the animal life under the waves; explore underground forests, oyster beds, deep trenches; gaze with somber eyes at great numbers of sunken vessels; fight off giant squids and dangerous sharks; cast their eyes upon the sunken continent of Atlantis; and burrow underneath the polar ice caps to emerge at the South Pole. All the while, they hope to escape and return to their homelands, although the naturalist hesitates to leave his traveling laboratory until such a time as Captain Nemo's emotions become dangerously unbalanced.All in all, this is an incredibly rich, fascinating novel with a poignant yet powerful conclusion. Contemporary readers must have been overpowered by Verne's descriptions of this unknown sailing vessel and the exploits the sub was capable of. That magical element is missing from modern reader's reactions, but this does little to hinder the overall effect of the story. There is one negative aspect to the book--the naturalist and his assistant go out of their way to name and catalogue virtually every animal, mineral, and plant they discover. This is interesting to a point, but the plot often finds itself bogged down for a couple of pages while the reader is bombarded with a veritable encyclopedia of scientific names which are virtually unpronounceable and largely meaningless to his/her ears. These interludes are the only things slowing down the story, however. It is a joy to read the adventures these men have under the sea, and it is even more fascinating to ponder the mind of Captain Nemo. Even the unseen depths of the sea cannot offer the reader a mystery as deep and powerful as that of the Nautilus' exceptional captain."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"The original story is lush with great vocabulary and detailed description, a little work, but well worth it. I'm reading it aloud to my 10, 9, and 6 year olds. The DK illustrated abridgement is a good supplement too."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"It is really a shame that Amazon pushes so many editions together in the same group of reviews. This review is of the complete edition (not the bowdlerised children's version) and references the translation by Mendor T. Brunetti.This was a reread for me. I read most of the Verne books when I was quite young, and lately wanted to revisit some of my favorites. When I was younger, I was very much (like Captain Aronnax) taken with the catalogue of undersea marvels that Captain Nemo and his Nautilus enabled us to visit. Reading it this time around, I was quite struck with the political picture of Captain Nemo. As a man from an unknown country who has lost everything at the hands of men, Nemo becomes what we would today call a terrorist. He funds freedom fighters. He takes his revenge on the men from the countries who hurt him and his. The portraits on his wall: John Brown, Kosciusko, Daniel O'Connell. I think that I'm going to add The Mysterious Island to my list. I had never read the sequel in the past, and I understand that it provides more background about the mysterious captain.Readers who aren't familiar with this book are encouraged by this reviewer to rapidly amend this sad condition. I also have to say that I first read this when I was nine (the full version, not a children's edition) and I can't imagine what really needs to be cut to make it suitable for younger folks. I'd hand them the whole thing with a confident heart."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I loved this classic French novel by Jules Verne and found it to be very entertaining from start to finish! I was very surprised that I would enjoy this book as much as I did.... I figured \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\", like many classic novels, would be boring, but Jules Verne is a marvelous storyteller. He imbues this novel with lots of intrigue and mystery as you wonder how the story will unfold... There is lots of adventure and interesting predicaments, and of course, many unforgettable characters one comes to care about during the course of the novel. Also if you like science fiction then this is the novel for you! Jules Verne seems to be ahead of his time in terms of technology and creates quite a wonderful piece of classic literature that has stood the test of time.The attention to detail that Jules Verne used to capture the readers attention is marvelous... This book is written in the 1st person through the eyes of Assistant Professor Pierre Aronnax of the Paris Museum of Natural History. Professor Aronnax unfolds the story to the reader of this novel about several sightings of a mysterious object seen around the world by many different people.... Some believe it to be an island, others seem to think the object is a floating reef, a large whale or other large mammal and so on. It isn't until Professor Aronnax and his faithful Flemish assistant, Conseil, take part on an expedition aboard the Abraham Lincoln to seek out this unknown object once and for all. Eventually, it is discovered that this unknown object is a submarine named the Nautilus, on which Professor Aronnax, Conseil and Canadian harpooner, Ned Land, spend the remaining part of the novel sailing on the Nautilus through the various oceans of the world along with the crew of the Nautilus. What adventures they have while sailing on the Nautilus!! And the exquisite detail in which Jules Verne imparts is wonderful. One feels like they are truly reading the actually travel journal/diary of Professor Aronnax. Professor Aronnax writes from a scientific/natural history perspective as he is very much interested in the under water world of the worlds oceans.The only draw back I had with this novel was that some of the descriptions were a bit overdone or a bit too much to take in (like classification of animal species or various nautical terms).... These descriptions aren't overwhelming or occur that frequently, I'd just find myself skimming through these parts rather quickly."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"My husband bought this book for our son at a visit to an aquarium, even though I thought it was too advanced for him because he's only four and half. I was wrong - my son LOVES this book! I know the age range on it is 9 to 12 and I have no doubt those ages would also enjoy reading the book themselves, but my son is constantly wanting me to read this to him and is always begging for me to read one more chapter because we usually only read one or two at a time (I will admit, I tone down the scarier parts just a bit for him because he's only four). The illustrated pages help hold his attention while I read to him even though there is a significant amount of text per page, and even my two and half year old can manage to sit through a chapter most days. I love the combination of illustration and text that allows me to read my sons more involved and advanced stories without them becoming bored because there isn't enough to hold their attention to the story. My older son loves asking questions about the pictures, especially the ones in the inserts that have information related to different aspects of the story, and I have learned a lot from those too! I definitely recommend this book and am currently looking into buying my son some more books from the DK/Eyewitness Classics series."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"The Easton Press edition of Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is one case to judge a book by its cover. Two other Easton Press editions: From the Earth to the Moon and Around the Moon are two more examples of this rule. To me, Easton Press has outdone itself with these gorgeous Verne covers. To brass tacks on the 20,000 Leagues edition: the English translation is by Mercier Lewis with an introduction by Fletcher Pratt and illustrations by Edward A. Wilson. One may have wished for one of the more modern translations, but the cover IS stunning."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"If you have been hunting for books with sea adventures, then the book 20000 Leagues Under The Sea is the perfect book for you. It's a bookwith two main characters named Captain Nemo and professor Monsier Pierre Aronnax. The professor studies about underwater living. He finds a large submarine which he thought to be a whale. Captain Nemo named it The Nautilus. The captain has a strange vow not to put foot on land people have been on land people have been on. He also explains that he only uses things that are from the sea. For example, his bed was made of soft eelgrass. On the voyage, the professor learns to hunt for pearls and sea animals. This book is also suspenseful because it leaves you in one question is captain Nemo still alive?I really liked this book because it had a leveled amount of description even though it is first person narrative. I would recommend this book this book between ages of 7 and 11. This book is also suitable for people who like to read. You won't feel disappointed after you read this famous book"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Who would have thought that a major contribution to the world of literature would come out of the Naval Institute Press! Normally, they come out with things like \\"An Illustrated Design History of the United States Destroyer.\\" I'm not casting any aspersions on such a volume, and I may own a copy or two. But Jules Verne, is an a class by himself as one of the great inventive masters of literature. He stands up there with Homer and Chaucer and James M. Cain. And what a superb edition this is, the translation impeccable and the annotations which include technical and historical explanations of the text and are invaluable. I have to confess, it is one of the few times (not including Nabokov) I actually read all the footnotes in a novel (or any book) and found them to be supremely enjoyable. Anyway, treat yourself to this marvel!"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"The book, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, is both amazing and suspense holding. Just imagine you're on a ship trying to destroy a sea monster. When that exact sea monster has sunken huge ships, small ships, and even war ships. One second you are asking a question, the next thing you know people are screaming, the ship is flooding, and you're knocked overboard with the beast. Get ready for whirlwind of an adventure!Professor Arronax becomes famous from his studies, but he never tells anybody about Captain Nemo or what they call a sea monster, but is actually a submarine. The professor after a few days figured that he has to get off the monster seeing the captain is nearly insane, but he refuses to get off because it is his. Those are not the only characters. Others are Ned Land, Consiel, cannibals, Commander Farragut, and crew men.Three-fourths through the book, people are going crazy. Worst of all, Ned is going so insane; he wants to swim thousands of miles to shore. He feels he just has to get off the beast, even though he's being well supplied with food. As days go on Professor Arronax is seeing Captain Nemo acting weirder and weirder every day, until finally Captain Nemo resorts to yelling at the Professor for no reason.I would recommend this book for ages eight and up. If someone is reading 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea aloud, it would be exciting for any age. If you like drama, mystery, action, or creativity, this book is for you. In my conclusion, this book is amazing and suspense holding. I loved it and would rate it ***** (out of 5 stars). I hope one day you will imagine all the screaming people and the wonders of the sea."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I liked this book a lot.

It reminded me of when we first got my speedboat because in the begining they are sailing on a sailboat. One of the survival scenes when they crash into a submarine and are about to sink."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"The other reviewers have noted how the editors...both experts on Verne and the Victorian era science that guided him.. have gone back to the original French manuscripts, collated them to use the best, most reliable, paragraphs and phrases from each, and annotated the book to reflect on Verne's social, political and technical background as if affects the story.If all this sounds like the book is some kind of dull scholarly treatise, rest assured that the novel as STORY is not harmed, but actually improved by the editors' restorations and fix-ups.My own path to Nemo and the Nautilus was watching the Disney film version when I was 11, then getting the Classic Comics version, and finally going to the available butchered translation. Even that version captivated me, and sent me to the dictionary to decipher some of the hifalutin 19th century phrases.Now, as then, I gloss over the endless catalogues of marine biology classification --- Verne as well as Victorian science fans were captivated by the then new interest in categorizing flora and fauna into genus, species, sub-species, varieties, etc. This stuff can be skipped without losing the story.What interests me is the adventure under the sea, and the way in which these fellows are able to watch the wonders of the deep through the window of a plush 1860s salon. I am also interested in how Verne envisioned the workings of the sub. Interestingly, in 1904, just before his death, he wrote an article for Popular Mechanics in which he updated his thoughts on the future of the submarine, based on the Simon Lake and John Holland boats of that day. He had to explain to readers that he was NOT the inventor of the submarine, as popularly believed.All in all, the editors have done a wonderful service in bringing the real \\"20, 000 Leagues\\" to light. I hope it will attract the interest of many bright and curious young boys and girls of the 21st century when the Sea Wolf and Virginia class subs of the USN have finally equalled the performance of the Nautilus of 1870."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This new up to date translation was fantastic--I was sorry when I was finished-lots of interesting detail as well along the way--it was a lot of fun to read!"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Having seen the movie a couple times this was the first time I read the book and was surprised to see a significant number of unexpected differences. Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is arguably the first technical thriller, launching a genre which has since grown wildly in popularity and includes most of Michael Chricton's work. It is a very imaginative book, the story of the mysterious Captain Nemo -haunted by an implied but never explained past - who has built for himself and his crew the submarine Nautilus to be free of the laws of man and to live successfully and sustainably on the bounty of the world's oceans, which he intrepidly explores in all its wonders. Inevitably he is chased by the main characters, Ned the Harpooner, Mr. Arronax the professor and Conseil his man-servant, in the frigate USS Abraham Lincoln. Unlike the movie the story is told entirely by Mr. Arronax and Ned is more a minor character, and a stolid Canadian as opposed to the boisterous and fun loving American in the movie. Also unlike the movie the Nautilus does not sink the Lincoln, but in a duel vents it with steam that throws our three main characters overboard whom are then rescued after the Lincoln, ignorant to the fact they are no longer onboard, retreats from the scene.Thus begins a promising story of mystery and adventure, the possible drama of Captain Nemo being chased by worldly forces in his incredible Nautilus, the tension between the captives who are experiencing the amazing wonders of the ocean depths firsthand and their captor who cannot ever let them go without losing his own freedom, and the chance for exciting adventures. While all of these things are delivered in the book, they are done so very anachronistically (obviously), with the drama, tension and adventure being there - and being very creatively crafted - but also being very subdued and literally drowned in an ocean of Mr. Arronax describing the latin names of the sea life he sees outside the Nautilus's window. This captures the fascination of the age with Natural History versus today's focus on excitement and adventure in these types of novels. There are many times were the book gets very, very dry as the author rattles of names that you have no idea what they refer to, and even if you google them the only hits you will get are the passages in the book itself! Based on this, the fact that this translation cuts out some 20% of the book is probably not a bad thing.Nonetheless there are some great moments of natural beauty and adventure. Jules Verne showed some incredible predictive power in describing the structural design, diving operations and maneuverability, and life support systems of a submarine, being basically spot on before anything beyond the Turtle of Revolutionary War heritage had ever been put to sea. The myriad undersea \\"terrains\\" the characters experience are particularly cool and fun. Relative to the movie the giant squid attack is underwhelming, but a much better scene that never made it to the film is one where after discovering the south pole (something Verne got wrong obviously) the Nautilus is caught in between two icebergs and must dig itself out before its air supply runs out. But there are some drawbacks too. There are some shockingly dark moments for a book aimed towards younger men from the 1860's which seem to imply they are leading somewhere and could have been great plot tension builders, but they are never fully fleshed out, and neither is the character they are supposed to be windows into, the reclusive, tortured yet brilliant Captain Nemo. The book ends quickly and inconclusively, feeling like a great set up for a story that ends as more travel log than character story or adventure yarn. Nonetheless the book is short and relatively easy to read despite it's older grammatical style which can sound very strange today.The job the publisher did however is spotty. The cover design of the book is very well done, but the editing is poor with many glaring typos throughout the text.All in all the movie is much better as a movie than a direct adaptation of the book would have been, with Ned Land turned into a main character that an American audience can connect with (unlike the highly intellectual and uninspiring Mr. Arronax as main character of the book or the turgid Canadian version of Ned Land), Captain Nemo is more explained as a character and pitted more against Mr. Arronax as two opposing sides of a moral coin, and the movie has a more solid story and conclusion. But the book has it's own advantages and overall is worth reading, especially for its historical significance."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This one of the best Jules Verne books. It is a must read for everyone. Even my teenage daughter enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I thought that the book had one of the best plot lines I've ever seen, reguardless of the fact that there is only slight building up to the climax. The only thing that I didn't think was that good about the book was that about every other page, Jules Verne would go into a paragraph description of the animals. For example, he would say something like: I just saw a tuna. But not the normal tuna, it was yellow-bellied, had dorsal fins that went at a downward angle, etc.\\" Otherwise, I thought it was a great read and well worth the money. I will be purchasing more of Jules Verne's books very soon. I highly suggest for you to read this book. Another thing, if you enjoyed watching the 1954 \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea Film,\\" I highly suggest the book because the movie only gives a small picture of what actually occurred during their submarine venture and the book tells you everything, and the occurrences are just amazing.The novel basically tells the story of Professor Arronax, Ned Land and Conseil who get taken aboard the Nautilus and experiences many adverntures, such as going to Atlantis, an underwater hunt, getting trapped in an ice block and much more."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Verne is the original, there's no question about that. Frankly, Verne is science fiction for people who don't like science fiction.

Even though this book was filled with information about electricity, how it gets it from the sea, how much the \\"Nautilus\\" weighs in tonnes, how the \\"Nautilus\\" can reach the speed of 50 miles per hour etc. it still was a marvellous book. Jules Verne puts stacks of information into this book. But here's the amazing bit of this information. This book was first published in 1871. 1871?Why 1871?Nothing like electricity was invented in 1871. Or other stuff. Jules Verne imagined science when hardly any of it was invented. None of it. None of it at all. That's why, 20,000 leagues under the sea and other of his novels were amazing.Also, the characters in this novel are likeable. The nature and the stuff Captain Nemo, Pierre Arronax, Ned Land and Conseil see under the sea seem so real while reading this classic. The peculiar but wonderful character of Captain Nemo makes this book wonderful to read.This book appeals to children and adults.In 1866, a strange thing at sea captures everybody by surprise. It is some sort of peculiar monster or floating reef. The \\"Helvetia\\", \\"Columbus\\", \\"Scotia\\" and \\"Shannon\\" all spot this creature. People wonder what exactly is it. Pierre Arronax, Proffesor of the Museum of Paris is called by Captain Farragut of the \\"Abraham Lincoln\\" to capture this gigantic cetacean with all these harpooners, especially one called Ned Land. Ned Land is strong and full of uncommon skill. He is also a Canadian.

But Jules Verne had an almost eerily prophetic knack for knowing what technology would be used in the future -- and he put it to work in \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea,\\" a slow-moving adventure tale with plenty of proto-steampunk and almost fantastical undersea life.Ships in the middle of the ocean are suddenly seeing -- and being attacked by -- \\"a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.\\"Eventually the US government sends out a ship to capture the object, and during a sea battle Professor Aronnax, his manservant Conseil and harpooner Ned Land go overboard. Soon they're picked up by the Nautilus, the vast submarine that has been causing all this trouble, and introduced to Captain Nemo -- an intelligent, charismatic man who belongs to no nation.Aronnax becomes fascinated by Nemo, his ship and his library -- as well as the amazing underwater adventures that Nemo introduces them to, like pearl-hunting and fighting a giant squid. But the captain's free, lawless life has its dark side, and the three men begin to realize that they must get away from the Nautilus no matter what.It's actually rather amazing that Jules Verne not only dreamed up the idea of a semi-modern submarine long before they existed, but thought out the applications, the stealth, and the vast size. And since nothing like the Nautilus existed at the time, there's a slightly fantastical, steampunk flavor to \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\\"And as usual, Verne painstakingly studies everything about his imagined world, filling it with science (although he obviously didn't know about water/air pressure) and lovely descriptions of the Nautilus and the eerie underwater world (giant oysters, forests, Atlantis). The only flaw is that he tends to ramble on about exact measurements and travel details; there are boring patches here and there.But Captain Nemo is probably one of Verne's most fascinating characters -- a charismatic, embittered man who is a sort of noble sea pirate. He does some stuff that is totally unacceptable (sinking a random warship), but he also has little spurts of kindness and generosity towards poor and powerless peoples of the world. He's scary but fascinating.Giant submarines, charismatic pirates and an undersea world just waiting to be explored -- \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea\\" is a fascinating sci-fi classic, if you can get past the dull patches."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This book was an amazing book that I could not put down after I started reading it.

I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"The book in e-transfer format for Kindle is very fast and hassle free. The book is in very good condition and the contents are excellent to read. Worth possessing. ---thanks"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I was a kid when I first saw the movie and a teenager when I heard a discussion about it and so I knew going into the source material there was no woman and thus no hint of romance; which is fine by me.20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is interesting mix of excessive prose, \\"pages\\" worth, detailing underwater life forms and environments, real and - it is sci-fi so - imagined. If you are into marine biology you might appreciate the detailed descriptions of undersea creepy crawlies better than me but I still made my way through them.The other descriptions are rich in detail, it's been a while since I saw the movie so Verne's descriptions of the ship were in my mind's eye and I felt like I knew what it was like to be aboard the Nautilus, in the dormant volcano, walking through the ruins of Atlantis.When it comes to the action scenes they are also descriptive but they move quickly as the crew and passengers battle with various sea monsters and go through the wild maelstrom that may, or may not have, destroyed the beautiful, magical Nautilus."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I want to read it again! This is a awesome book. I like this better than Journey to the Center of the Earth. It's a little long but its worth the time it takes to read it. An exciting journey is waiting for you with in the pages of the wonderful classic book. My fave parts are when they; visit Atlantis, go hunting underwater, and go pearl diving. However, I still want to know more about Captain Nemo. The book didn't answer all my questions about him. God bless ya."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"'20,000 Leagues Under the Sea' is one of those classic stories by the wonderfully imaginative and clever Jules Verne that everyone has heard of but, alas, few have read ... at least here in America. I decided to give the book a try having just read (and enjoyed) the author's other classic 'The Time Machine'. '20,000 Leagues...' is a far more ambitious novel and, overall, even more enjoyable.The story is set in the late 1860s when the book was written. Due to unusual circumstance (..no spoilers here) three men (a naturalist, his manservant, and a whaler) are taken against their will onto a (then unheard of) submarine by the enigmatic Captain Nemo. For many months they circumnavigate the globe and cross all the oceans. Along the way the encounter the fantastic, some dramatic episodes, and even fleeting moments of comedy. The author goes into great detail of describing the wonders of the submarine. While of course much of the science he describes is a bit silly most of it is remarkably true to life. I am especially amazed at his foresight into electricity years before the lightbulb was invented. Monsieur Verne was truly a genius. And thankfully, he was a pretty good writer.But this book doesn't hit all the right notes. All the in-depth descriptions of amazing underwater flora and fauna gets rather repetitive. The middle third of the book is a bit of a tedious read. Thankfully the story tightens considerably towards the end, with a very surprising climax.Bottom line: an often overlooked classic that will probably bore younger readers but will enthrall adults. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Verne's prophetic masterpiece still thrills readers over 100 years after its publication. In this adventure, French naturalist Pierre Aronnax is taken aboard the Nautilus, a secret high-technology submarine capable of high speeds. Aronnax meets the enigmatic Captain Nemo, a renegade against society with a strong desire for revenge against the enemy that drove him under the sea. This novel is one of the first examples of modern science fiction. The world of science fiction owes Jules Verne a great debt.This edition is particularly valuable. Most people aren't aware that the standard English translation is filled with lots of translation errors which botch the science of Verne's masterpiece. Also, the standard version cuts about 25% of the original French novel. This translation fixes the errors, and returns 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea's scientific accuracy (for that time). Also, the cut parts have been restored, so we can now enjoy reading a complete version of Verne's novel.If you love classic books, and you're interested in reading about one of the greatest characters in science fiction, you have to read this. Also fans of science fiction should read this to understand where their genre came from. If you've read the old standard translation, you have to read this edition to see it the way it was meant to be."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"My (10 year old) daughter got interested in '20,000 leagues' after reading the \\"Wishbone\\" version (go ahead and laugh). I went searching for the real thing to read with her, and came across this edition. With all of the missing content recovered, plus the annotations to fill in all sorts of additional information, the result is fascinating for adult readers. If you read the usual (butchered) version as a kid, you really owe yourself this one. All of the critiques of Verne over the years that tried to belittle his knowledge of science turn out to have been based on translations that whacked out what Verne really said -- they thought it was too dry and boring. Reading what he really said, plus the extensive footnotes that describe the state of knowledge at the time, make Verne's brilliance all the more astonishing. Just consider that he wrote about the Nautilus at a time when the Hunley was the state of the art!"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I havent read many books in my lifetime but I'd have to say that this is the best one I' ve ever read. Jules Verne takes you on an amazing journey through the worlds oceans and to some places where man still hasn't been. I was sad when I had read the last page and the books was over. I found myself wanting to be on the Nautilis, meeting Captin Nemo, and see the ocean depths with my own eyes. The book defintly sparks your imagination; I guess that's why it has remained a classic for many years."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Jules Verne is widely recognized as the father of science fiction, and &quot;20000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; is his most famous work. This fantastic tale of the adventures of an under-sea craft (written BEFORE their actual invention) fires the imagination of readers young and old. Verne's genius was his ability to create incredible (in his time) machines, around which he'd write believable stories with admirable characters and meaningful morals. As with the submarine Nautilus, many of his machines have since become modern realities."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I can still remember reading 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA for the first time as a kid. I was fascinated by submarines and captivated by the story of this wonderful ship, capable of making all my dreams come true. I wanted to dive beneath the waves and accompany Professor Aronnax on his incredible journey. Reading it again after many years, I find that I am still impressed by the story. Not only is it quite prophetic for its day & age, the fact that the story is STILL captivating after all these years just goes to show that great literature is timeless. In what follows, my comments shall refer to the Bantam version of the novel, translated by Anthony Bonner. This translation (or another suitably modern translation) is critical to getting the most out of this novel, as I will touch upon later.There is something for everyone in this book. On the one hand, the reader is treated to a very scientific (at times, \\"too\\" scientific for many readers) tale of undersea exploration, mixed with a tale of adventure and intrigue. The Nautilus carries us to every ocean of the world, exploring the South Pole, the lost city of Atlantis, shipwrecks, a mysterious tunnel between the Arabian and Mediterranean seas, and so much more. On the other hand, Jules Verne has also managed to flesh out a human story, one focused on Captain Nemo and his mysterious past and hatred for Western civilization. While the \\"kid\\" in you will have your eyes fixed on the Nautilus's glass portal that reveals the wonders of the deep, the \\"adult\\" in you will be rapidly trying to figure out exactly \\"who\\" this captain is and why he has built this ship, capable of removing him permanently from society.Many have complained about Verne's tendency to lose the story for endless lists of scientific classification. It is not hard to see their point. Verne does go on and on about species of fish in a manner that loses the reader's interest after a short while. But there is nothing to prevent you from skimming over these passages and moving onto the story. That's what I do and I don't think I've sacrificed a thing in doing so. Moreover, I would recommend that you keep an atlas or wold map handy when you are reading. It is much more fun to read this novel if you can actually track where they are at each point in the novel.Those coming to this novel from the movies will either be happily impressed or disappointed. While the films borrow heavily from the novel, they tend to focus on certain elements of the story (enhancing the action) while forgetting about others. This is not the tale of a madman, destined to hunt and destroy ever ocean-going vessel he comes across. It is so much more than that. In fact, my only complaint (and I have similar complaints for many authors) is that Verne seems to have been at a loss for how to end the novel. Therefore, he hands us a \\"deus ex machine\\" ending, of gigantic proportions. However, despite this minor flaw, the novel still holds up to modern scrutiny and remains enjoyable throughout.While this translation is much, much better than the cheap translations you find from the \\"bargain\\" publishing houses, I have heard that the recent, fully-annotated version is even better. Make sure that, when searching for a copy, that you get one of the modern translations (like the Bonner) and stay away from \\"quick & dirty\\" versions that you can find for a couple of dollars. Many of these cheap translations omit a full quarter of the novel and contain numerous errors. Additionally, they render the French into archaic English, ensuring that you will not enjoy the novel as much as you could. So, my advice is to stay away from the \\"bargain\\" versions-they aren't a bargain at all. But do read 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. You'll be happy you did."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This is a story about three friends aboard the Nautilus, a cantankerous submarine-like vessel that is commandeered by Captain Nemo, an elusive figure with a mind of steel and a impenetrable purpose in life. Captain Nemo has long ago turned his back on the world, building this vessel with the intent of making it his home, staffing it with the most loyal of crews, and arming it as though it were a fortress. And a fortress it is. Captain Nemo and his crew live beneath the sea in this fascinating underwater vehicle as solid as stone. They never touch land, and are prepared to spend the rest of their days living underwater. The world has learned of this vessel, but rumors of its nature abound. Most think it is a sea monster of sorts, and the great ship the Abraham Lincoln sets out on a voyage to find and destroy the Nautilus. On board are Professor Aronnax, underwater expert, his loyal subject Conseil, and a Canadian whale harpooner named Ned Land. These unfortunate characters are tossed into the sea while heavily engaged in a confrontation with the mighty Nautilus. Hours later, they are picked up by the Nautilus, having been clinging to it's topside for safety. They are held prisoner within, but never have prisoners of war had such luxury and freedom. What follows is Monsieur Aronnax' account of the adventures that abound as he travels around the world underwater, seeing sights never before seen, engaging in activities he once only dreamed of, and enjoying times never meant to be had by man. When his companion, Ned Land, becomes restless and wishes to escape the Nautilus, the story heats up. Throughout, Captain Nemo is a mystery you will wish revealed. The story has many dull parts too, and many unfamiliar words and expressions that may bore you.

For many years \\"20,000 Leagues...\\" was available to us only in Louis Mercier's abridged version. It was not bad, but it was not as Verne intended it to be. But in recent times, we now have three wonderful modern and unabridged translations from which to choose: F.P. Walter's, Anthony Bonner's, and Mendor Brunetti's. Walter's is more readily accessible (both for free and for purchase) because at least one version of his translation is in the public domain. To read it go to the Kindle store and type in: Verne Vingt Mille English. The other two are both copyrighted and limited to their respective publishers which makes them more difficult to locate and definitely not free. Having said that, Brunetti's translation is particularly readable. The true Verne fan (as in fanatic) may wish to read all three to compare. Just don't expect major differences; they mostly differ in style of expression. I first encountered Bonner and liked his translation. But then I discovered Brunetti and later Walter, so now I really don't know which is best. But I can tell you that that Brunetti's is an excellent translation and you can't go wrong choosing to read it."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This book is completed destroyed by errors in printing.

Verne always wrote his novels with a tool that many novelists, especially scifi novelists, lack. That tool is knowledge. Verne was a scientist. his books are always grounds to teach, to learn, and to speculate. It's so facinating now, so many years in the future, to see how amazingly close to the truth Verne often was using the little information available to him and his great scientific mind.

But the sea creature turns out to be a submarine, the Nautilus, and they're joined by the harpooner Ned Land in being rescued/captured by its crew when their attack on it fails.I definitely encountered this book far too late to fully enjoy it. Like when I tried re-reading Tolkein a couple of years ago, I found I lacked the patience to read through pages and pages of interminable description. There were several times when I just couldn't stand it any longer and I'd put the book down and go do something else. Only sheer stubbornness made me finish it.The story itself was interesting, though the style of the times was a bit of an obstacle. The enigmatic Captain Nemo is never fully explained, nor are the professor and his two companions. It's left up to the reader to fill in the blanks. The professor's unconcern about his imprisonment on the submarine is partially explained by his fascination with the undersea worlds he encounters; the complacence of his assistant and Ned Land are less understandable. Ned Land does try to escape occasionally, but he's portrayed as narrow-mindedly violent because of that, which I found peculiar.I do see why films were made from this--condensing those descriptive passages into scenery would make the action and adventure parts of the story stand out more. I've never seen one, but I'm thinking of adding one to the Netflix queue. Any suggestions of which version to try?In short, I'm giving this 4 stars for the story, but 2 stars for the pain of reading it."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Unfortunately, \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" shows its age. While the story is, actually, quite good, the language is somewhat stilted and the book takes a while to really get going. I think many young readers will be puzzled by the vocabulary and will be bored. Eventually, the story picks up. However, I was bored in the 1950's and cannot imagine that today's youngsters will do much better. I think that the Walt Disney movie is a much better bet if you want to expose your child to a story that was a true classic.

Some of these sightings are far apart from one another. With no other logical answer, some fear that it might be a sea monster.An expedition is established under Captain Farragut, with the U.S. Naval frigate, Abraham Lincoln. They are firm in their resolve to find this monster.Professor Pierre Aronnax of the Museum of Paris had written articles about the phenomenon of a possible sea creature and he is asked to join the others, as is, his man, Conseil, and the Canadian harpooner, Ned Land.Once they are out to sea and have traveled far in their search, something is sighted. Ned, Pierre and Conseil take a small boat from the Abraham Lincoln with Ned's harpoon. Ned tries to harpoon the object but their boat is overturned and they are picked up by the submarine, the Nautilus under Captain Nemo.They are held in polite captivity as the Nautilus travels the world. Captain Nemo has constant proclamations of where they are and Pierre tells the reader the importance in history of what they are seeing, such as, a sunken ship with riches in it. The men are anxious to be free and have their escape at the earliest opportunity.The writing style is dry and without much emotional comment. The style is so different from much of today's literature that it is challenging to get into the story line and become involved with the story.It is interesting to see Jules Verne's ideas of deep sea diving equipment and his idea of 20,000 leagues under the sea-which is more than the circumference of the earth. It is also noteworthy to see where literature and adventure fiction has come to in the last one hundred years."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This review is for the Easton Press leather bound 1977 edition of the Mercier Lewis first english translation of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, by Jules Verne.Anil Menon notes in a 2006 examination of 'The Politics of Nemo' that, \\"Verne liked to place his human characters in enclosed, self-contained, unique spaces of one kind or the other-- heavier-than-air flying machines, isolated islands, floating cities, villages on tree-tops, the earth's core, cannon-balls to the moon, steel submarines 20,000 leagues under the sea-- and send them out for a spin. For the most part, his people are two-dimensional cross-hairs; their main role is keep track of places in the reader's mind.\\"Most English-speaking readers are familiar with the image of Captain Nemo as an escapee from human society driven by hatred to live a life separate from humanity in general. Verne appears to have endeavored to use his story as a vehicle for some sort of political message or commentary on the conditions of his era though. One quote in the book offers a glimpse of this dark motivation: , \\"I've witnessed the destruction of everything I loved, cherished, and venerated--homeland, wife, children, father, and mother! There lies everything I hate!\\"Due to the politics of his time in France, Nemo fails to properly identify precisely who inflicted the personal pain on him. It is speculated that Nemo originally intended to point the finger at Tsarist Russia for their victimization of the Polish people, but France was friendly with Russia at the time so Nemo chose to leave the identity of his victimizers to speculation. That is unfortunate, because it causes Nemo to be more of a 'stick-figure' for the story than might otherwise have been the case.Regardless of this, the story of Nemo and his submarine continues to this day to intrigue readers as it always has. The problem for us English speakers however, is that Verne wrote his original story in French and the numerous English translations differ widely in terms of how accurately they reflect Verne's original story. Unfortunately, Easton Press chose to use what is generally considered to be the worst possible English language rendition of this famous book; the Mercier Lewis translation.Mercier Lewis went after Verne's story with a scalpel, cutting and removing entire sections and altering the meaning of many French words and ultimately, the story itself. When he was done, Lewis had removed over 20% of Verne's manuscript, paying particular attention to the removal of any comments that might contradict the Christian Bible. The result is that the reader of this translation is far less likely to gain an accurate appreciation of the original novel.There are other, much more legitimate English translations available. One generally considered to be the best current English translation is the Walter James Miller & Frederick Paul Walter version completed in 1993 and published by the Naval Institute Press. Unfortunately, that version presently only seems to be available in paperback. The Easton Press leather-bound edition looks much nicer sitting on the bookshelf and that is the main reason many continue to purchase it. But if one is interested in genuinely exploring the world of Captain Nemo, the Navel Institute Press version by Miller & Walter is the way to go."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I loved it so much that I want to read it all over again!

The book's original title Vingt mille lieues sous les mers, the literal translation would be \\"Seas\\" which might imply the seven seas.The story is told from the view point of Professor Pierre Aronnax, a famous French marine biologist. The professor accepts an invitation to join an expedition to destroy a sea monster who is sinking ships. Along for the ride come Canadian harpoonist Ned Land and Conseil, the professor's servant.The expedition fails, the monster sinks it and the Professor, Ned Land and Conseil find themselves at the mercy of Captain Nemo, who commands The Nautilus, a submarine the likes of which have never been seen.I have read 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne in two languages and several versions. I have to say that this translation beats them all.The book shows Verne's genius which is tough to translate, the characters come alive on the pages and the adventures they go through are exciting. The comedic tone and even psychology show well in this wonderful translation.As in the previous versions I have read, there are many \\"lists\\" and descriptions of the ocean life. I have to say that I did skimmed through the lists but read the descriptive parts enthusiastically. With the exception of intricate scientific names, which lend credibility to this fantasy, I found the book absorbing and engrossing. I'm glad I read it again.While submarines today are common place and almost anyone of can go and visit one (there are several older submarines which one can go on), the fantastic voyages and imagination are inspiring today as they were in 1870.What I love about this book is that the translators took their time to write an excellent introduction and, best of all, wonderful footnotes which, as I said time and time again, make a translated book into a cultural experience and raises the level of enjoyment by multiple degrees.Not many people are aware, but almost a whole quarter of the book was literally lost in translation. This wonderful edition, translated by Water James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter, restores those pages as well asIf you ever wondered what the big hoopla is about Jules Verne, read this version and you'll find out."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"My exposure to science fiction is embarrassingly limited, so who better to remedy it than Verne? Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea was a groundbreaking work. It particularly established hard science fiction at a time when technology could not help but change the way we looked at the world.And therein lies much of my criticism. With its frequent calculations of the size of the submarine and what not, it sometimes reads like a math textbook. Sadly, I do not take the same interest in the science as Verne so obviously did and other readers may. The descriptions of life at the bottom of the sea, on the other hand, make me want to visit an aquarium post-haste. Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is very much the type of science fiction that revels in the \`science' part.That is not to say that Verne does take advantage of speculative fiction to use the \\"speculative\\" portion to explore human nature. Captain Nemo is as fertile ground as Captain Ahab for this. And our narrator has even less to say about his captain--he is consistently nave, to the point that the subtleties of Nemo can be at first lost. However, over the course of the novel it becomes apparent that all is not well. We are never told what great sin civilization has done Nemo, rather we must wrestle over whether any sin could justify his actions. The action is quite light and the plot slow-placed. Most of the book is devoted to a tour of the wonders of the deep, with Nemo's gradual, swirling decline in the background.The titular \\"twenty thousand leagues\\" refers to the distance covered by the Nautilus over the course of the book--well over twice the circumference of the earth--not the depth to which it sinks. There is no good reason to think the latter, but I was nonetheless confused on this point for years.Of course any book this old will not age evenly. Captain Nemo's conservation instincts are a bit off-base. Shortly after chastising the whaler Ned Land for seeking to hunt southern whales, which he describes as \\"inoffensive creature[s],\\" he gleefully slaughters a herd of \\"cruel, mischievous\\" sperm whales. Hardly sustainability at its best. But perhaps Verne too expected us to recoil with Land at the bloodbath (how odd it is to side with the whaler over the conservationist).Verne is as successful as any science fiction writer at his predictive science and technology. Sometimes it's incredibly accurate--Verne describes a light bulb a decade prior to its invention, the crew of the Nautilus communicate with an invented language a little under fifteen years before the invention of Esperanto, the South Pole is on a southern continent, and the Nautilus is largely built and operates like modern submarines (especially the double-hulled design). Other times, it's less so--a workable electric bullet has yet to be invented. Verne also repeats errors of his day--e.g., the misplaced notion that malaria was caused by \\"foul air.\\"Verne wrote at an exciting time. The south pole had not yet been reached and the first trans-Atlantic (telegraph) cable had recently been laid. We were just beginning to understand electricity. The ocean remained a great, unknown frontier.Verne frequently uses archaic or technical terms for the sea creatures encountered. Sperm whales are called cachalots, walruses are called morse, and sea horses are called hippocampi.I read the Kindle version of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea offered free through Amazon. There are a handful of typographical errors, but not enough to be overly distracting and none that cause confusion. Most bothersome is the degree symbol is replaced by a question mark throughout--a common error as the submarine's latitude is frequently given. It includes neither a foreword nor an afterword. I also own an old Educator Classic Library edition from 1968. It contains numerous added illustrations and helpful definitions and explanations throughout the text (directly next to the relevant text in the margin so they do not affect readability like a footnote or endnote would). These are particularly helpful for an older hard science fiction novel. It also contains a \\"backword\\" with helpful information about Verne and the history of the submarine."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"I did enjoy this book and I'm glad I read it but ... the introduction by Ray Bradbury was the best part of this book. If you are going to get a copy to read - get this one - specifically for the introduction. As for the book itself, well, the action parts and story line are great. The problem is that Verne seems to have felt that he needed to include every single bit of background research he did into the book. He didn't seem to waste anything he had found in in his research.. He goes on for several pages listing the types of fish that can be found in a particular area. Whenever we come across a sunken ship we are treated to several pages of the history of the ship and the ships that preceded it into whatever cove we are in along with who actually made it back to make the report. Some of this stuff is interesting, but mostly, it's unnecessary filler. I found myself skipping over the taxonomic lessons and skipping to the actual story line.The story line is great. Totally enjoyed it. Spoiler - they get attacked by 10 giant squids, not one. They also get trapped under the ice at the south pole and have lots of other adventures you don't see in the movies. All in all a worthwhile read, but it is a bit tedious because about half of the book is devoting to listing fish and their attributes (this one had a spotted tail with a blue underbelly, the next one had rings and a white belly and on and on and on.)Do I recommend it? Well ... yeah - good story, better then what they show in the movies, you just need to gloss over the endless filler."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Fantastic!!

It remains to be one of my all time favorite books."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Professor Pierre Aronnax does not travel to a depth of 20000 leagues under the sea aboard the Nautilus, if that's what you thought. What he does do is travel a distance of 20000 leagues while submerged under the sea inside the mysterious vessel.Boats and fishermen all over the globe have reported a leviathan attacking ships. Professor Aronnax accompanies a warship to attempt to destroy it, but falls overboard and ends up inside the sea animal. The \\"monster\\" turns out to be a secret submarine build by Captain Nemo. As a passenger aboard Captain Nemo's craft, Professor Aronnax is witness to the wonders hidden beneath the ocean waters.Written over a century ago, Jules Verne creates a fantastic setting that leaves even today's readers fascinated about Captain Nemo and his Nautilus. Detailed descriptions about underwater life fill a majority of the book and create a rich setting, but can drag on at times.Water makes up the majority of the earth. As humans, we have only a mere understanding of the creatures and life forms that dwell within the depths of the oceans, and Verne expands on this unknown realm to create a powerful and lasting tale.Maybe it's a coincidence that I've read a lot of novels with aquatic settings (Life of Pi, The Old Man and the Sea, Moby Dick), but 20000 Leagues Under the Sea is another watery classic worth reading.8/10 -> 4/5"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This is a very attractive edition of this book. The physical dimensions of the book itself, it's quite large, make it very easy to read. Additionally, the large plot-driven engravings found in the book are beautiful and the smaller engravings found at the top and bottom of each page are also very attractive. The fact that this book is Vernes' unabridged edition may turn some readers off, as he does go on ad nauseam, about the inner workings of the machine. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the detail he provided."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Submarines as we know them didn't exist in 1869. But Jules Verne had an almost eerily prophetic knack for knowing what technology would be used in the future -- and he put it to work in \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea,\\" a slow-moving adventure tale with plenty of proto-steampunk and almost fantastical undersea life.Ships in the middle of the ocean are suddenly seeing -- and being attacked by -- \\"a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.\\"Eventually the US government sends out a ship to capture the object, and during a sea battle Professor Aronnax, his manservant Conseil and harpooner Ned Land go overboard. Soon they're picked up by the Nautilus, the vast submarine that has been causing all this trouble, and introduced to Captain Nemo -- an intelligent, charismatic man who belongs to no nation.Aronnax becomes fascinated by Nemo, his ship and his library -- as well as the amazing underwater adventures that Nemo introduces them to, like pearl-hunting and fighting a giant squid. But the captain's free, lawless life has its dark side, and the three men begin to realize that they must get away from the Nautilus no matter what.It's actually rather amazing that Jules Verne not only dreamed up the idea of a semi-modern submarine long before they existed, but thought out the applications, the stealth, and the vast size. And since nothing like the Nautilus existed at the time, there's a slightly fantastical, steampunk flavor to \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\\"And as usual, Verne painstakingly studies everything about his imagined world, filling it with science (although he obviously didn't know about water/air pressure) and lovely descriptions of the Nautilus and the eerie underwater world (giant oysters, forests, Atlantis). The only flaw is that he tends to ramble on about exact measurements and travel details; there are boring patches here and there.But Captain Nemo is probably one of Verne's most fascinating characters -- a charismatic, embittered man who is a sort of noble sea pirate. He does some stuff that is totally unacceptable (sinking a random warship), but he also has little spurts of kindness and generosity towards poor and powerless peoples of the world. He's scary but fascinating.Giant submarines, charismatic pirates and an undersea world just waiting to be explored -- \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea\\" is a fascinating sci-fi classic, if you can get past the dull patches."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"A fantasy written long ago in 1887, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea started almost an entire genre of fantasy with submarines like the Tom Clancy novels. In this story ships all over the world claim to have seen a mysterious shifting black reef. Many thought it was just a rumor until it bore a hole into the hull of a steamer that had been able to make it back to shore. Pierre Arronax, a French biology expert, and his servant are invited on a ship going to hunt this creature. When the ship sunk, they found themselves captive on the creature that turned out to be a submarine, and it captain, Nemo, a genius who despised human society, showed them the wonders of the depths.Slow and plodding, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea does not match the excitement of more contemporary fantasy fiction. One reason that this book did not appeal to me is that, compared to the other fantasy book that I am reading, The Fires of Heaven by Robert Jordan, the characters and events are dull and boring. For example, a protagonist in The Fires of Heaven, Mat Cauthon, has two intriguing aspects. One is his incredible luck in games of chance. The other, most fascinating aspect, is that he has vivid memories of lives lived in the distant past. there is no character in the Jules Vern novel that can compare to such a riveting figure.Jules Vern's novel is flat and unimaginative in contrast to Robert Jordan's work. I was told it was a classic, but I was disappointed by its quality of creativity. I would not recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy fiction."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"okay i think this is a pretty good book but it's not that intresting.

I think many young readers will be puzzled by the vocabulary and will be bored. Eventually, the story picks up. However, I was bored in the 1950's and cannot imagine that today's youngsters will do much better.

He's a modern french biologist during this time period. The professor had somewhat of an understudy, an apprentice if you will, named Conseil. Conseil was just about as skilled as the professor as far as classification, and knowing so much information about just about everything. One day, the professor got a letter that invited him to go on a select trip to hunt the killer narwhal. Mysteriously, several ships had been rammed, and had a triangular shaped scar on the spot where the uncanny shipmates had decided that the narwhal hit. So Professor Arronax and Conseil went to examine the accidents.They get on the ship and meet a Canadian harpooner named Ned Land. He told them that he was the best at what he does, and that he was ready to take out the narwhal. After a while, they come across the infamous narwhal. They find it strange that the narwhal is about three times as long as the ship they're on, and that it glows. The professor's ship is attacked, and they are stranded in the ocean, they climb aboard the narwahal to find out that it is in actuality a submarine. They finally meet a strange man named Captain Nemo, who explains to them that it is his ship and that the professor, Conseil, and Ned Land can stay as long as they go with him on a trip around the world in his submarine, the Nautilus.

Somewhere near the middle its narrator captures the essence of the book with the following unintentionally prescient sentence: \\"To anyone but myself, who had a great love of the sea, the hours below must have seemed long and monotonous.\\" That's an excellent summation of Verne's story of the almost magical electric submarine The Nautilus, it's imperious and mysterious Captain Nemo, and the three outsiders who circumnavigate the globe in it. Basically, unless you have some kind of strong interest in marine biology, it is an incredibly tedious read. Granted, it is an impressive feat of imagination for its time (the 1860s), but the amazing technologies described don't pack any kind of punch for the modern reader, and the exotic locales are now the stuff of the Travel Channel.The story is very simple. There is some kind of large creature menacing sea traffic around the world, so an international expedition is launched to try and find it and capture or kill it. Among those joining this voyage are the famous French naturalist Professor Aronnax, his heroic servant Conseil, and legendary French-Canadian harpoonist Ned Land. When the American frigate leading the expedition finally encounters the beast, combat ensues and they are thrown into the water, only to wind up the prisoners of the Nautilus. Captain Nemo decides that having seen his vessel's interior, they must remain prisoners for life. Thus, they embark on a grand tour of ocean with this man who has forsaken mankind and its evil ways.Alas this tour turns out to be a barrage of naturalist classifications of everything they see, complete with Latin names and various characteristics. This is fairly evocative the first time, but by the third has gotten repetitive, and by the tenth just downright sleep-inducing. Not to mention a litany of latitudes and longitudes to mark their path, as if one were reading in one hand and following along with an atlas in the other. Which is not to say that stuff doesn't happen, it does--it's just not very interesting. They visit underwater forests, the South Pole, Atlantis, coral reefs, famous shipwrecks, encounter danger from a tricky passage, icebergs, giant octopi, and fierce island people, and yet none of it is particularly dramatic or well done.Matters aren't helped by stilted scenes where Professor Aronnax asks Nemo how some aspect of the submarine works and receives a lengthy lecture outlining the scientific basis and processes for how such and such works. There are far too many instances where Aronnax is simply playing the straight man to Nemo's genius: \\"Gosh, we're really in a jam now Captain Nemo, what are we going to do!\\" \\"My dear professor, yet again you underestimate the capabilities of the Nautilus, all I have to do is....\\" etc. In that sense, Verne's imagination is deployed in a relatively wooden manner which does little to make it compelling for the modern reader.Finally, the central conflict of the three captives versus their captor is lame. They're stuck, they can't do anything to escape, and that never changes until the merciful end, where they are whisked away yet again. Again, no tension or drama. The one really intriguing character is Captain Nemo, who rails misanthropically about mankind and refuses to divulge his nationality, and speaks to his crew in an unrecognizable language. Throughout, one keeps waiting for a revelation as who he is and why he hates the world of men, but other than brief allusion to his having had a wife and child who were killed, there's no payoff! This final straw is an infuriating end to a stultifying book. Sometimes the \\"classics\\" ain't what they used to be."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"So, nearly 150 years have passed since this book has been published... and much of it has become just boring.

The only thing that bothers me (and is somewhat minor) are the footnotes. The translator added footnotes throughout the book to explain some words, names, and cultural references from long ago. Some were useful, but others were so painfully obvious and still part of modern cultural memory that I wonder why the translator even took the time to footnote them. Also, the translator mentions in one footnote that he chose to omit a passage where Jules Verne explains in great detail the books which are in Nemo's library. In English classes I was always taught that one of the most interesting aspects of a book is what the author had the character(s) reading. It may have been a long and painful passage, but I would have rather had the choice as a reader to skim over an unending list of French titles from the 1800's rather than have the translator make that decision for me.Additionally, there are questions included for discussion at the end of the book. Without getting off on too much of a tangent, the questions remind me of all that is wrong with shallow and inane stock questions in books. I'm tempted to cut the last few pages out of my copy.Despite my views on the footnotes and questions, I love this book and thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I highly recommend it.---Alex"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"20,000 League Under the Sea begins with the world's seas being menaced by an unknown force. After several shipwrecks, the Abraham Lincoln is dispatched to kill what the world believes to be some kind of animal. After a battle with the \\"creature\\", the three main characters, Professor Aronnax, his servant/research assistant Conseil, and Canadian \\"King of the Harpooners\\" Ned Land are swept overboard. When they awake, they find that they are prisoners aboard the Nautilus, a submersible vessel under the command of the mysterious Captain Nemo and his equally enigmatic crew.Captain Nemo refuses to allow the three men to leave his ship, but otherwise treats them well. They are allowed the run of the ship and Professor Aronnax soon becomes quite taken with the research opportunities afforded to him by the submarine. His assistant Conseil is happy to do whatever his master wishes, but Ned Land becomes increasingly agitated and determined to escape as the story progresses. Dominating the tale is the figure of Captain Nemo, a man who has forsworn his allegiances to country and humanity to command his own destiny under the world's seas and oceans.The Nautilus takes the men on many strange and exciting adventures. Verne peppers the story with scientific detail. It's mostly fascinating, although the multiple listings of fish, fauna, and flora can become cumbersome at times. The novel is at its best when Aronnax is wrestling with the mystery of Captain Nemo and his motives, as well as his own conflicting desires to remain on the Nautilus and explore the reaches of the deep or to join Ned Land's quest for freedom.Stirring in places, the story of Captain Nemo and his amazing undersea vessel shouldn't be missed by any fan of science fiction/fantasy. After all, Verne helped create the genre. The version of the novel I purchased was the Signet Classic series translated by Mendor T. Brunetti, who also provides a foreword. Walter James Miller provides a fascinating afterward concerning the inaccuracies of previous translations."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This book is a classic. No question. That's why I chose to read it. When it came out in the 1860s, it was science fiction and gripped the imaginations of many. A ship that could travel under the water! But reading it in 2010, much of the novelty of the book has been realized. We have had submarines for nearly a century.But even aside from that, there is little plot to the novel. It reads as if it were written by a committee at National Geographic. It's a survey of all the unique items and places in the world's oceans. The little plot there is involves the protagonist trying to escape from the ship. And the ending (not to ruin it...) is a total cop-out and disappointing.I was hoping this book would stand the test of time, like The Time Machine or even Around the World in 80 Days.

In this book, the reader is taken on an unbelievable journey aboard the Nautilus, an ingeniously built submarine, venturing the mysterious waters of the world. Jules Verne chooses to describe marine life in incredible detail (or maybe even overboard in detail) in this fictional novel. One may wonder how much research Verne did on the ocean in order to write this story. I believe readers who find life under the sea interesting will best enjoy this book, but the rest may still be fascinated. Not only is this novel a great learning experience of the sea, it is also packed with surprises, which includes a visit to the legendary, sunken Atlantis. Verne even decides to include a bit of mystery in the story. During the sea-voyage, the submarine undergoes a mysterious collision that the captain refuses to tell. I found myself dreading to speed through the pages to complete the book, hoping the author would reveal the solution to this mystery towards the end. Even though I was greatly fascinated by this novel, I still admit that I was disappointed in some ways after completing it. After finishing the book, I had discovered that the title of this book might have been a little misleading. Instead of descending a total of twenty thousand leagues under the sea, the Nautilus actually travels a total of twenty thousand leagues submerged in the sea. One may even find the ending of the story a little too spontaneous and shortly written. As a conclusion, I must say that, even though I did encounter some disappointments, I enjoyed reading the book and I do not regret reading it."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"There has GOT to be a better translation out there than this!Here is an excerpt:\\"The cheaper journals replied keenly and with inexhaustible zest.

Also, it takes the book a whole page or more just to convey something as simple as \\"people were scared\\", and it uses obscure vocabulary to do so.

We follow him as he explores underwater forests, goes hunting dangerous sea monsters, takes from the sea what he and his men need to live, visits the South Pole and even shows us Atlantis.The problem is that about one third of the book is Jules Verne explaining EVERY tiny detail, from the family trees of fish and other sea creatures, to page after page on how the Nautilus works. The fight with the school of squid is only a few pages long.On the other hand, Nemo is not shown as a man trying to force mankind to improve as much as he is trying to live without contact with it (even when he helps some parts of it to fight back by giving rebels gold he finds on the seafloor). In the end, it is mankind who forces him to fight back, by hunting him down with warships.My book had an introduction by Ray Bradbury, which was very interesting, but did little to help the story itself.A good book for fans of Jules Verne, classic adventure stories and anybody interested in the sea."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"Who is Captain Nemo? Is he the antithesis of a 19th century capitalist? Is he the result of capitalism, using technology to gain the liberty of a higher standard of living, which it allows? Is he despot, savior, evil or compassionate?Nemo epitomizes a vision of humanity, which is arrogantly attempting to create a peaceful world through technology. The battle is clearly in vein as the characters are hindered by the passions of their natures.Nemo is the rebel, the nation-less man, who has turned away from the machine mentality, dollar diplomacy and imperialist expansionism of his age.Verne creates a self-contained world for Nemo, one in which there is no dependency on capitalism. The Nautilus produces all that Nemo needs.This freedom is decadent. The Nautilus produces no surplus value other than to provide for the whims of Nemo, a person dehumanized by the progress of the developing western world. A world he doesn't understand or is in touch with.Even in his act of political intervention against imperialism through the financing the liberation movement of the Cretans from the Turks was decadent. The money came from the sea, it was put back into circulation, and it was not the result of production or creativity. There is no net gain to society by this action. Encouraging production and industry could have better provided for the people.Though Nemo was creative enough to produce the Nautilus to escape his world of torment, he's nothing more that a narcissist!When Nemo brings the Professor on his trip, it becomes a conquest of the sea. Nature becomes a possession, no longer mysterious and otherworldly, but just a part of the humanized world.It is Ned alone who sees the vanity of the voyage, but to no avail. All aboard become trapped in the world of Nemo.A world running from machine and science in a machine. A world free from governments and country in which he governs. A world free from captivity in which he holds others captive. A world which he takes freely from, but gives nothing to in return. Nemo is everything he disdains.In making his journey of discovery around the world, Nemo fails to make the most important discovery that there is, what it means to be human!"},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"This book is not for everyone. If you do not like to read classics with everything that goes along with that (such as long-winded language that seems outdated to us today), then you should stay away.For lovers of classical and relatively easy to read literature, this is a good book. A lot of things are amazing, considering how long ago they were written and what overall level of scientific knowledge was at the time. Some of it just boggles my mind.At the same time, the book is long winded and in the end, not quite as much happens as one would expect. Dan Brown's DaVinci code has more things happening in the first 20 pages than Verne has in his entire book. But that is OK in a way, because when I read a classic, I do not expect to compare it to modern standards. The entertainment is due to different factors. In fact, the way the book is written is part of the entertainment and not just the story.I do not give this book 5 stars however, because I was disappointed in the end, since not enough of the story really comes to a conclusion. I do not want to spoil the book for you, but there are a lot of unanswered questions, and getting those answers really was what kept me reading. There is quite a bit of build-up, and then in some ways, the book just ends. (I noticed that style in many books of that time, where the narrator just says \\"here is what I know... but I do not know the whole story...\\").Also, to some extent, I agree with some of my fellow reviewers that gave a lower score, in that it is too much of a narration rather than a real story. I do not complain about some of it being like a log book, but I would have wished to get a bit more information about the daily life on board. I just do not buy that the 3 travelers just stayed in their room. They must have found out a bit more about other parts of the boat. Or at least attempted it, and that would have been interesting to read about, without breaking with the overall style of the book."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea was a very complex book. The authors word choice was what made it so complex, the author used words like \\"Vexed\\" \\"Zoophytes\\" and \\"Connoisseur.\\" The majority of these words were Old English, which added to the complexity of the book. The sentence structure was similar to the word choice, it was also very complex sentences, the sentences were usually not to long but not to short, at times they could be quite long though, and they were old an English style. The book itself is about Three Human beings chasing after a giant \\"Narwhal\\" as the author calls it. These three characters are known as Professor M. Arronax, a genius Professor from France whose passion is to study, Conseil, a teenage boy who devotes his life to serving the professor, and Ned Land, a Canadian Harpooner. Conseil and the Professor accept an invitation to the boat the Abram Lincoln, the goal of the voyage is to track down a giant Cetacean, or a sea creature. This creature has apparently been reeking havoc across the world causing all sorts of deeds, and so the 3 meet up at the boat. They pursue the creature for over a month, when they finally catch up with the lightning fast Cetacean they pursue it, however when the creature strikes back Ned Land, Conseil, and Professor Arronax are thrown into the ocean, and separated from their boat, they awake to find they are in the supposed cetacean, to find out that it is not at all a sea monster, but an amazing Submarine named the Nautilus led by Captain Nemo. They then learn of Captain Nemo's plans, and embark on a Submarine Hunt on the bottom of the Ocean, they Discover Atlantis, they venture to the south pole, and even fight among Poulps or Cuttlefish of enormous size, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea is full of adventure.In 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea The Brilliant minds of Captain Nemo and Professor Arronax save them in times of danger, Captain Nemo's knowledge of the sea allows him to guide his submarine across the world, confronting the sea's greatest beauties and threats. Jules Verne does a very good job of telling the story and making out every last inch of the amazing journeys taken place on board the Nautilus. In my opinion this was a very good book, there are times in the book were discussions between the captain and the professor take place that are extremely difficult to comprehend, but in the end I would say this book is definitely worth the money. However as I've said before almost every page has Old English in it and is hard to understand, the sentences are very difficult and there are some words which I'd never heard before in my life, so because of the books complexity I would have to say that only someone 13+ can read this, this would be great for adults even, but I don't think anyone below the 7th grade could fully understand it, a 6th grader could but not get the full detail of the book."},{"Title":"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","review":"In this book there are three main characters,Ned Land, Professor Aronnax, and Captain Nemo. The book Twenty thousand Leagues Under the Sea was veryinteresting. It is very suspensful and you are always thinkingthat the characters are going to die. Their are mant differentsurvival scenes. For example one scene captain Nemo sees anindian gets attacked by a shark so he he jumps in the water and tackels the shark. He almost gets killed but Ned Land throws hisharpoon and kills the shark.This book reminds me of the ocean because they are always traveling through the ocean in their submarine.

Once again these authors have the mark on their teaching. We like their style and content."},{"Title":"Rescue Your Love Life, Workbook","review":"Don't waste your money on this book. The only thing good about it is the table of contents and you can read that by downloading a sample on the Kindle. This book is your typical, dime-a-dozen, been-there-read-that, Christian marriage book. It is the standard, boring, churchy language, \\"Dr. Phil wanna-be\\" mixed with some psycho-babble and a few out of context scriptures added for supposed authenticity.The text is also written in such a way that the husband in the relationship is always at fault, never the wife. The guy is the idiot, the guy is the failure, the guy is insensitive, the guy needs to get his act together and the woman is the poor little victim trying to straighten out this horrible marriage. That's all these Christian marriage books are. They don't know how to deal with real love and in-depth issues they only know how to blame the guy. And they talk as if all you have to do is step 1-2-3 and presto, you have a happy marriage.Plus you have to sit through boring chapter after boring chapter reading about how Robert and Jill or Fred and Peggy or Nick and Janice faced such and such a problem in their marriage and here is the bland, boring, yawn, common sense advice that the author gave them. And now they are Cinderella and Prince Charming living in the happy castle. I wish I could get my money back.If you really want to study love, for less than a dollar you can download a book called THE GREATEST THING IN THE WORLD by Henry Drummand. He was a contemporary of Charles Spurgeon and he does a master job with 1 Corinthians 13. Read it and you will be moved. But these Christian marriage books are just a church scam to put money in the pockets of second rate counselors who don't want to work a real job, but want to sit as the guru giving everyone advice. I bought the book based on the table of contents. Obviously the author didn't know where to go after that."},{"Title":"Rescue Your Love Life, Workbook","review":"We recently got this book (and workbook)for my brother-in-law and his wife.

This is only natural when dealing with two unique individuals (and personalities) that need to work together as equal partners. This book definitely helps supplement the learning experience of how to best communicate with each other (learning best approach), be fair in compromising, set reasonable boundaries, respect the unique natures of you and your partner, work on solving things together, sharing feelings (without blaming) and complement one another as a \\"whole\\" (and not as two halves). It also addresses how to work on personal issues (or habits) that could reflect and harm your marriage.The approach is Christian, basing it's guidance through a Biblical understanding, yet isn't \\"preachy\\" and doesn't beat around the bush. The style is rather casual and laid back, but it's also straight forward and to the point...very well balanced. Neither gender is singled out or favored...both are approached uniquely but also equally as responsable partners. This is best shown and acknowledged through the \\"his\\" and \\"hers\\" CD's, especially if you listen to both.I'd highly recommend (if you are planning to use this program), to read the book AND listen to the CD's. The workbook is also good if you need more practice or activity in the program. I purchased both the book (with CD's) and the workbook. Both my husband and I enjoyed the program, but we didn't feel the need for the workbook.

This cogently-writtten volume presents a much more nuanced picture. Ghetto walls were an injustice, but also a refuge for many Jews from the tense environment around them. Oddly enough, this circumstance contributed to the relatively large number of conversions to Christianity in the liberal West after the Napoleonic liberations (in contrast to the shtetl Jews in Poland and Russia, who lived side-by-side with Gentile neighbors). Katz's discussions of of Jewish martyrs during the First Crusade and the flexibility of rabbinic responsa, among other topics, are also quite fascinating."},{"Title":"Exclusiveness and tolerance: Studies in Jewish-Gentile Relations in Medieval and Modern Times (Scripta Judaica)","review":"When thinking about interfaith relations in Europe in the Middle Ages, we almost always think about Christians not tolerating Jews. There is no doubt that medieval Christians didn't like Jews much and persecuted them. What's not often discussed is that medieval Jews didn't like Christians either. However, by the early 1800s, Jews tolerated Christians, and in some cases, they really liked them and emulated them.In this slender but dense book, Jacob Katz explains why.He begins by sketching out what Jewish law has to say about relations with non-Jews. (It was against such relations.) Not having anything to do with idolaters was fine in ancient Babylonia or ancient Palestine, where there were so many Jews, but it wasn't practical in medieval Europe, where the Jews were a small minority. So, Jewish legal scholars had to completely reinterpret the law on this point. Plus, when Christians confronted Jews with their anti-Christian theology (at disputations), the Jews had to come up with explanations for why many Talmudic concepts did not apply in medieval Europe. (I won't give away what they said.) Soon, the Jews began to believe their own rationalizations and actually did become more tolerant of Christians. Early modern ghettoization was accepted or even embraced by Jews, as it gave them their own space and reduced overt competition with Christian neighbors. Eventually, universalistic Enlightenment ideas influenced Jewish thinkers and Jewish thought on who would be \\"saved.\\" The end result: more toleration and even overt acceptance of Christians and Christianity.This book is an intellectual tour-de-force, but I give it 4 stars rather than 5 because it is not an easy read for someone unfamiliar with Jewish theology and history of religion. Most readers will find themselves looking up a lot of terms, from Aggadah to Zohar."},{"Title":"Exclusiveness and tolerance: Studies in Jewish-Gentile Relations in Medieval and Modern Times (Scripta Judaica)","review":"Jews and Christians each had stereotypical views of each other (p. xiv), and Jewish views of Christianity were just as unflattering as the reverse. Katz comments: \\"The biblical name of Edom was, in Talmudic times, applied to Rome. In medieval poetry, however, it is synonymous with Christianity.\\" (p. 16).Throughout history, Jews had tended to see Christians as idolaters. (e. g., p. 27, 53, 100). Following Talmudic law, this would've forbidden Jews from having business dealings with Christians. Consequently: \\"Practical considerations required the dissociation of Christianity from idolatry, and this was rationalized by means of halakhic casuistry. But this rationalization cannot be assumed to imply that, from a theological point of view, Christianity was no longer regarded as a \`pagan' religion.\\" (p. 162; see also p. 108). [Nowhere does Katz, or anyone he cites, correct the mistaken equation of the Trinity with polytheism or the mistaken equation of the veneration of relics and images with idolatry]. In recent centuries, according to Katz, some Jewish thinkers did genuinely reject the Christians-are-idolaters premise--in part because Christians believed in creatio ex nihilo. (pp. 163-166, 191).Put in broader context, Jewish goodwill towards gentiles, according to Katz (p. 58, 101-102), was motivated in part by expediency (e. g., avoid giving all Jews a bad name), and in part by genuine adherence to moral principles. Commensurate with both tendencies, the Talmud teaches loving-kindness to all human beings, helping the poor and sick, etc. (pp. 59-60).But what of the Talmudic verses that allow Jews to cheat gentiles, etc.? (p. 107). Katz replies: \\"The disputants claimed that all disparaging references to Gentiles in Talmudic sources applied only to those \`seven nations' which are mentioned in the Bible as the aboriginal inhabitants of the Land of Israel, and remnants of which survived as late as Talmudic times. But this statement is no more than an ad hoc device used in the course of controversy. There is no indication in the Talmud or in the later halakhic sources that such a view was ever held, or even proposed, by any individual halakhist. In fact, evidence to the contrary exists.\\" (p. 110). [Modern claims that the offending verses had been \\"mistranslated\\", etc., are equally ad hoc and unconvincing.]The 16th-century seminal Jewish thinker Maharal (Rabbi Judah Loeb of Prague), according to Katz, thought that: \\"However, his criticism [of Jews] did not affect his basic conception that Jews were, essentially, of a superior religious and moral caliber to others. Their inadequacies were incidental only, and attributable to the trials of the Exile; at a different level, Jewish deficiencies had a direct relationship to the Jews' superior spiritual nature.\\" (p. 141).Until the 11th century, and sometimes later, Jews could own slaves. (p. 41). As for usury, both Christians and Jews employed a double standard. Christianity forbade usury among Christians, but regarded Jewish conduct as outside its jurisdiction. For its part, Judaism forbade Jew-on-Jew usury, but allowed Jew-on-gentile usury. (p. 57).Since time immemorial, Jews had preferred to live among their own kind. Compulsory ghettoization came much later. Katz comments: \\"But contrary to what might be expected, the institution of the closed Jewish quarter was not in itself resented by Jews. It was accepted as a provision appropriate to a group of their status, and as corresponding to their social and religious needs; moreover, it provided a measure of security. Jews were content to be recognized as a socio-religious unit, distinct from the general population.\\" (pp. 132-133)."},{"Title":"Physics of Glaciers","review":"This is the 3rd edition of a classical university textbook.

Some of the stories are obviously complete fiction, made up to pad this collection out to book-size. (Sometimes one of the problems with sequels is lack of material.)

(Were sailing ships really called 'wind wagons'?)Instead of a fog-bound hellpit of drowned sailors, the book reminds me of a nautically-themed carnival sideshow, where like the amazing mermaid with the stitched-on fish tail, the supernatural is stitched onto a bit of local history:* Read about the general store that is haunted by the sound of squeaky bedsprings!* Read about the St. Ignace Island Lighthouse of Doom!* Read about the clock that was thrown into a swamp and reappeared in its familiar spot on the wall two days later!* Read about the Crawling Ghost of Calvary Cemetery!If you like your ghost stories funky, eccentric, and cheerful--rather like a Benny Hill episode with ghosts, \\"Haunted Lakes II\\" is a fun book to read."},{"Title":"Haunted Lakes II: More Great Lakes Ghost Stories","review":"This book is an okay book, and has it's fair share of interesting stories, such as Seul Choix Lighthouse, or Tawas Lighthouse.

Actually the greatest US maritime disaster took place on the Mississippi River in the early morning hours of April 27, 1865, the week President Lincoln was assassinated.

It is an admirable source of information on Brazil's history, social structure and institutions, the economy, the government, the military, and on Brazil's efforts in science and technology. It cannot substitute for more specialized works, but I use it as my first stop when looking for information on anything about Brazil that I have no personal knowledge of and no detailed reference works on. It should be the first book on Brazil acquired by anyone with any serious interest in any topic concerning Brazil.This being said, I do have some criticisms; the book is not perfect. Most important, although some sections have been completely rewritten since the 4th Edition, others have not, and there is no indication of which ones have and which ones haven't. This can seriously mislead a reader who assumes that a specific item of information is accurate as of the 5th Edition publication date of 1998,if it happens to be an obsolete item from ten or fifteen years earlier. As an example, in the discussion of Brazil's exports, there isn't a hint that by the time of publication of the 5th Edition, the largest single export of Brazil was commercial passenger airliners produced by EMBRAER, which has become one of the world's four largest manufacturers of passenger airliners, below Airbus and Boeing, but competing nose-to-nose with Bombardier, and encroaching on the low end of Boeing's market so severely that Boeing recently discontinued the 717 because it can't compete effectively against the EMB-170 and EMB-190 of EMBRAER. This striking omission is due entirely to the fact that the section on exports was not updated for the 5th Edition. I could cite various other such examples, but this one will suffice to indicate the way in which a reader might be misled.A less serious but still significant problem is that the bibliographies at the end of each chapter refer almost exclusively to works in English. To be sure, most casual readers about Brazil will not know enough Portuguese to tackle serious publications in Portuguese, but many serious readers will be comfortable reading Portuguese, and most of the most important source works were written in Portuguese by Brazilians and have not yet been translated into English (although some have). The chapter authors themselves have clearly drawn heavily on documents in Portuguese, and the editors should have done readers the courtesy to cite in the bibliographies the most important of these.Finally, to my great surprise, the book does not seem to have been reviewed by knowledgeable reviewers, although it did get editorial review. This omission is undoubtedly responsible for many of the minor errors and omissions that mar the work; I recommend that a reader who needs to depend on any specific statement of fact in this book check it agains other sources. Some of the errors are just hilarious; for example, on page 94 I find the assertion that the Ucayali river, a Peruvian tributary of the Amazon, is 6,762 kilometers long. A moment's thought reveals the implausibility of Peru, whose longest dimension is just over 2000 kilometers, containg a river 6,762 kilometers long. The Ucayali is indeed a large and important river, but its actual length is slightly less than 1500 kilometers. Unfortunately, many of the other minor errors are less obvious, unless one has lived in Brazil, has friends there, and keeps up with events and changes in the country.Despite these caveats, though, the book is first rate overall, and an excellent starting point for learning."},{"Title":"Precision Marketing: The New Rules for Attracting, Retaining, and Leveraging Profitable Customers","review":"In a 234-page book:--the first 85 pages rehash industry studies and other marketing-related statistics--pages 85-106 present the Precision Marketing Cycle, which is nothing new--the next 100 pages go over common topics like predictive modeling, lifetime customer value and privacy challenges--the final 25 pages present their views of the futureIn sum, there's just nothing new."},{"Title":"Precision Marketing: The New Rules for Attracting, Retaining, and Leveraging Profitable Customers","review":"What Zabin does best is to transform dry business material into organic, interesting prose.

Sally Chappell, who writes for the Travel Section of the New York Times, tells a fascinationg story of a sophisticated ancient culture and empire that thrived along the Mississippi valley between 1100 and 1500, at the same time that the Aztecs were coming into power in Meso-America and the Incas in South America. Cahokia was the major city of this empire, and in 1200 its population exceeded that of London in Europe. Chappell tells the story of this historic site near St. Louis, with its fabulous monumental architecture, relgious traditions, and trading networks. But Chappell takes it well beyond the story of the Native Americans. She explores how the site evolved over time, was influenced by French explorers, was used during the Civil War, and what became of the site in the 20th century. An amazing story of both a place and &quot;place.&quot;"},{"Title":"Cahokia: Mirror of the Cosmos","review":"North America has at least one ancient pyramid. A dirt one. Situated within a very fertile region known as the American Bottom, the extent of its base overshadows even the Great Pyramid at Giza. And though some today might dismiss it as a weathered lump of soil - the elements have taken their toll - it once towered over North America's greatest medieval city. Known as \\"Monk's Mound,\\" because a group of early 19th century monks set up shop there, the structure rises some 100 feet over the southwestern Illinois wetlands. Photographs can't capture its ominous girth. Nor can they convey the anti-gravitational energy required to ascend to the summit from which the St. Louis Arch is visible. The panoramic view from on top, a modern rural landscape punctuated with human-made dollops, belies a metropolis that once rivaled London and Rome in population. Between 900 and 1550, an estimated 100,000 - 150,000 people lived in this city now known as \\"Cahokia.\\" But sometime in the mid-16th century, just before pointy French hats infiltrated Illinois, it was abandoned. Mystery shrouds Cahokia and its people. They left no known written or verbal records. To add to the mystique, no North American city equalled Cahokia in size until Philadelphia overtook it in the early 19th century. As a shadowy symbol of its former strength, North America's Great Pyramid still stands, miraculously, where it was built over a thousand years ago.\\"Cahokia: Mirror of the Cosmos\\" provides a historical survey of the land and the mystery surrounding Monk's Mound from the Big Bang to approximately 2002. Why the author reached back to the nanosecond of creation remains a little obscure, but that tiny section leads to an interesting discussion of the topographical and geological formation of the American bottom. Thanks to many natural forces the ancient Cahokians, or \\"Mississippians,\\" found rich fertile soil in the center of North America. They settled there sometime before 900 and fed their burgeoning populace from gifts deposited by glaciers millennia before. What happened at Cahokia afterwards remains, as said above, subject to speculation. Regardless, an entire chapter explores what might have happened based on the meager evidence archeologists have uncovered. Evidence exists for a stratfied society with social classes, an elite, and a worker class. Pottery and artifacts found at the site demonstrate sophisticated artistic skill. They played a game called \\"chunkey.\\" Some evidence exists that Cahokians used mathematics to design their city, set up an astrological calendar, named \\"woodhenge,\\" and fortify the inner city with a bastion-lined stockade. The book also explores theories for why Cahokia was abandoned. Everything from climate change, resource depletion, wars, and nutritional or sanitational problems receives at least a cursory analysis. In addition, the book cites the uncommon theory that the Cahokians simply \\"moved on.\\" Maybe no tragedy occurred? Maybe they willingly abandoned their city?The book's last four chapters discuss the evolution of the land known as Cahokia from the arrival of French explorers to the building of the Cahokia Mounds State Park's impressive six million dollar interpretive center. More than once either environmental or industrialization factors threatened Cahokia's survival. Voluminous sketches and photographs depict the changing landscape, and the names and stories of those who helped preserve the mounds receive adequate coverage. Railroad developers, airports, x-rated drive-in theaters, housing developments. All of these elements encroached on the dormant medieval city. How the mounds survived the political and cultural tensions of the last three centuries stands as a near miracle of vigilance. The book tells the whole story.Though Cahokia was designated an international UNESCO site in 1982, it remains a relatively obscure North American attraction. Archaeologists seem more interested in the site than historians. And they haven't hesistated to dig. Some amazing things were unearthed at Mound 72, including possible evidence of human sacrifice. The book has the details. Plus, inexplicable stones were detected inside of Monk's Mound while extracting core samples. Theories abound. But even considering those hordes, archaeologists think they have unearthed only one percent of the information that Cahokia holds. Perhaps as more discoveries unfold, Cahokia will finally enter the American historical annals and history books as the first known great North American city. Until then, it remains somewhat of a secret to those not living in the St. Louis area. \\"Cahokia: Mirror of the Cosmos\\" provides an easy to read non-technical introduction to an exceedingly important North American landmark.

Understanding the philosophy of a writer as profound and as prolific as Plato is as difficult as it is important, but reading all of Plato's written work just isn't practical for non-scholars, so Brian Prifitt's text offers the reader the alternative of an overview of Plato, and does so without the technical language typically used in philosophy texts. Brian Proffitt's introductory text isn't designed for scholars and isn't intended to summarize Plato's 650,000 word career, but it is a good text for those taking the &quot;First Step&quot; in understanding Plato.In five chapters the book offers a biography, an overview of Plato's philosophy, and highlights some central themes.

Ellery Queen, a recent college graduate, often assists his father, the highly respected Inspector Richard Queen of the New York City Police Department, with particularly difficult investigations. This arrangement gives Ellery access to crime scenes and confidential information not available to the general public.In the late 1920s men still wore top hats for formal affairs. A death occurs in the Roman Theater and inexplicably, the murder victim's top hat is missing. The Roman Hat Mystery is structured as a logical, deductive challenge to the reader. A list of characters and a floor plan of the Roman Theater are provided. Prior to the final chapter, the reader is informed that Ellery has solved the mystery, and the alert reader should have noted the critical clues. I was not particularly successful. Queen's detailed explanation is about twenty pages; the logic is convincing.An earlier reviewer stated that readers new to Ellery Queen should first read some of the later stories like The French Powder Mystery, The Spanish Cape Mystery, or The Greek Coffin Mystery. I am more ambivalent. Certainly, there is no need to read the Ellery Queen mysteries chronologically. The best approach may be to start with the first Ellery Queen mystery (with Ellery Queen as the major character) that you can find. They are all quite good.Two cousins, Manfred B. Lee and Frederic Dannay, won first place for The Roman Hat Mystery in a writing contest, sponsored jointly by Frederick A. Stokes Company, a book publisher, and McClure's Magazine. Lee and Dannay used a pseudonym, Ellery Queen. This choice has led to endless confusion as Ellery Queen is also the name of their fictional detective.The Roman Hat Mystery proved to be quite successful and within a few years the Ellery Queen stories had become immensely popular. The Ellery Queen mysteries stayed in print for at least five decades. I recently had the good fortune to find a discount copy of a beautiful, leather bound, Franklin Library fifty-year commemorative edition of The Roman Hat Mystery. This edition is more costly, but it would make a good gift, possibly to yourself."},{"Title":"The Roman hat mystery","review":"This is the first in the long series of Ellery Queen stories- it's quaint, very dated, and enjoyable, and mostly significant for its place in the history of the genre- old school mystery.

Postulating that the lesbian feminist movement of the 1970's was unfortunately incorporated and overwhelmed by the gay male agenda of \\"queer politics\\", Unpacking Queer Politics denounces the \\"queer politics\\" tenets of sadomasochism, cutting and piercing, and female-to-male transsexual surgery as forms of self-harm. Author Sheila Jeffreys then centers upon the importance of committing oneself to equality in all relationships regardless of sex; as well as heralds lesbian feminist ideals as necessary for social change for the better. A shrewdly written and well-presented viewpoint, Unpacking Queer Politics is highly recommended reading, both for academia and the non-specialist general reader with an interest in gender politics."},{"Title":"UNPACKING QUEER POLITICS","review":"Some books change the way you see the world and the way you want the future to be. Unpacking Queer Politics is such a book.For two decades, Queer has dominated Western ideas about lesbian and gay life. It has also affected heterosexual relations because many leading figures Queer politics are heterosexual and bisexual. It has directed women towards an appreciation of any kind of sex, in the name of liberating us from restrictions on our right to choose sexuality. And yet as the new century approached, I began to hear whispers of discontent among women; that this sexual freedom we all wanted had not quite arrived in the way we had dreamed it would. Queer politics had become a kind of commercial playground dominated by gay male and heterosexual money and interests. The only lesbians on the Queer scene seemed to be sadomasochists, masculine worshippers, or butch-femme revivalists. But as Sheila Jeffreys reveals, we really should have seen it coming. As she charts us through the 1970s and into the beginnings of Queer, it's suddenly clear that it couldn't have turned out any other way. But this book may just be powerful enough to change the course of women's sexual future away from Queer and towards a far more exciting shore.Jeffreys goes where most of us fear to tread. She travels through the backrooms of sex bars, into the studios of gay porn, onto the agendas of sadomasochists, and into the rooms where lesbian women and gay men women are now cutting, beating and branding themselves and each other in the name of Queer liberation. She never departs from her love of women and her commitment to our freedom. Yet she does something quite unexpected in these pages; she reaches out to gay men as well as lesbians by recognising that Queer capitalises on our dual alienation from the heterosexist world. It is this form of sex capitalism that she claims must be challenged and overthrown if we are to move once more towards creating a world in which women can become truly liberated.It is through the recognition of Queer politics as strongly heterosexist and therefore conservative that Jeffreys is able to offer us insight into why it has become so successful. Her research is thorough and because of this, she is able to create a convincing case for the argument that Queer promotes practices which violate the most basic human rights of women and men. It is a retrograde and homophobic politics, she argues, particularly in its support for the genital mutilation of allegedly 'masculine' women and 'feminine' men in transgender surgery. This, Jeffreys claims, is a gross violation of human rights and should be challenged as such. But as Chapter 6 reveals, some governments are now offering money for allegedly incorrect women and men to be 'corrected' under the knife. Jeffreys asks quite simply, 'why don't we do away with gender altogether?' I asked myself shortly afterwards 'how could I have studied gender and feminism for a decade and never come across that question?'But this is the beauty of Unpacking Queer Politics; it is simple in the way that you only find in the work of a writer who understands the whole environment in which their subject has developed - in this case, the evolution of Queer from an idea into a dominant politics and practice.This is a serious and very readable book. Even if you don't agree with the author's politics, this is a history of Queer that should be on the shelves of all those interested in human rights, sexual relations, human behaviour, feminism, sexual subcultures, legal approaches to lesbian or gay and transgender rights, revolutionary politics, pornography, legal concepts of privacy rights, political science, and social change.The late anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko said (and I paraphrase from memory), 'the greatest weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed'. I believe that Unpacking Queer Politics may just succeed in disarming Queer. It may lift from women's minds the shackles laid down by a sexual liberation movement gone terribly male. And maybe for us twenty somethings, some of the optimism of the last chapter will give us the belief that we can go up against sexual exploitation, and we can win."},{"Title":"UNPACKING QUEER POLITICS","review":"This is a book that had to be written. It is intellectually first-rate, courageous and powerful. I applaud the author's gutsy and flawless analysis of the \\"sex as abuse as subversion as fun\\" farce that is now, sadly, the norm in so much lesbian and gay writing. By saying what has to be said, Jeffreys gives all those silenced by the ignorance of those who \\"have fun\\" at the expense of others a voice with which to say no. A must read for anyone who cares about justice and equality."},{"Title":"UNPACKING QUEER POLITICS","review":"As a crusty old, bisexual liberal I raise a toast every year to celebrate Reagan's death and when this woman departs the earth I will do the same...for exactly the same reasons. I don't especially like hateful, bigoted, conservative people who are a menace to individual freedom.Even for her this is a trans/homo/bi-phobic, simplistic, asexual, joy-killing tome and that is saying something. She's like Cotton Mather with an extra X chromosome.P.S. It's really not OK for any feminist old enough to remember gay and bisexual men dying in the plague of the early AIDS epidemic (including pioneers for the rights of all LGBT people like Stephen Donaldson) to be homophobic."},{"Title":"UNPACKING QUEER POLITICS","review":"Jeffreys' polemical approach eclipses some of her more valid points about the failings of queer politics. True, queer politics and theory have often been dominated by white male perspectives. True, lesbian specificity ought to be a consideration in gender and sexuality studies.That said, if I could have given this book a lower rating I would have.Why, you ask? \\"Unpacking Queer Politics\\" is, at root, an amateurish yet vicious attack on transexuality (particularly FTM trans people), S/M, and various other practices and people which Ms Jeffreys deems to be in opposition to her lesbian-feminist project. This project seems to be devoted to reinstating some idea of a natural female body, a pure sexuality, and a deeply identity-based politics.Frankly, reading even a few pages of this book made me sick to my stomach. After having read the whole thing, however, I curled up into a ball and cried. The brute disgust and hateful rhetoric which Jeffreys deploys against trans people is illogical at best. This book has the dubious honor of being the worst I've read in recent memory."},{"Title":"Her Ideal Husband (Harlequin Romance, No 3652)","review":"This woman really knows where the key to my heart is when it comes to writing romance.

B. has provided a fine read with graceful and interesting phrasing. Her descriptions are easy and vivid, and having a minimap at the start of each chapter is just plain clever..and useful. She invites us to come with her and follow Paul on his journeys; she points out events with enough space to allow the reader into the situations; she offers up without lecturing. What more could you want? No verbosity-no bombastics-but an emotionally rich telling of a fabulously interesting and crucial time and transition in human existence. The book is a brilliant rendering to match the subject she set out to cover. I liked it most of all for its loving manner corresponding to the loving communication of Paul. Highly recommended, and a book you can easily finish in a short time but may want to reread/refer back to. Not a text on the subject, however."},{"Title":"Paul,: A man who changed the world","review":"I received this book as a gift and just finished it.This book about the early Christian leader, writer, and preacher takes a different approach than most biographies, leaning much more to a narrative-style glimpse of Paul: The Man. In many ways this produces a much more readable biography. For instance, the author writes \\"Paul came to Ephesus with the fall rains,\\" instead of couching her phrasing with \\"probably\\" or \\"it is thought that...\\" This makes the book much better for those who either know little about Paul to begin with, or those who would rather not wrestle with a dry, scholarly book on Paul which is easy to put down.Of course, when adopting a narrative style such as Buckmaster has done, one opens up oneself to criticism that the work is full of misstatements and speculation. We have no idea what Paul might have been feeling or what he was thinking about at various points in his life, and some of Buckmaster's prose does seem to plant ideas or concepts which, while plausible, are clearly speculative. In addition to this difficulty, the list of scholarly sources on which Buckmaster relies are probably outdated (pre-1962). While I'm no Bible scholar, I would venture to guess there are sources written since then which shed new light on this subject.Prospective readers should be also be aware that while the author is not evangelical at all, it is clear that the book is written from a Christian perspective. I don't expect this to ruffle any feathers (it is about Paul, after all), but perhaps readers should know that this book is not chronicling the Paul of history, but the Paul of Faith.I think this book is good, especially for readers who want to know more about Paul without wanting to pore over a boring, stale biography, and are willing to accept a little Christian speculation."},{"Title":"Piano playing, with Piano questions answered","review":"This book, originally published as two separate volumes in 1906 and 1907, is a collection of articles Hofmann wrote as a regular feature of the LADIES HOME JOURNAL. Although Josef Hofmann was himself a phenominal talent, he offers thoughtful answers to the simplest of piano questions, and guides the reader with a practical, common sense approach. Most of the advise in this little book is timeless, and the pictures of Hofmann himself demonstrating correct and incorrect positions of the hand and body make this a pedagogical gem that his admirers will cherish."},{"Title":"Piano playing, with Piano questions answered","review":"I can't begin to tell you how many people make a poor attempt at learning very difficult piano pieces just so they can say &quot;I can play this, and I can play that&quot;. However, if they're serious about piano, they will come to a point where they realize that, sure, they can &quot;get through&quot; the piece, but they can't actually &quot;play&quot; it. There is so much more to the piano that so many people are missing out on these days. Technique, dynamics, tempo, and even simple things such as how you are seated at the bench. Most teachers skip over teaching these key aspects of music because most students just want to be able to play what they want as fast as they want. This book covers all the things that many have missed out on. It covers nearly everything you need to know on how to be a great piano player. Combine this book with natural talent, and a desire to bring the piano to life, and you're set. Theres even over 160 pages of frequently asked questions that amatures sent to Hoffman over the years (and answers of couse).If you're serious about playing the piano, get this book before your poor playing habbits are implanted in your head even further. If you're not serious, or just like to mess around... then skip it. It would be a waste of your money."},{"Title":"Piano playing, with Piano questions answered","review":"Probably the greatest pianist of our time telling us the secret of his success: how one should approach the piano and music, how Rubinstein taught him, what music to start with, the advantage and disadvantage of having a perfect pitch... a lot more. Most amusing as well as informative. It deserves more than 5 stars.However, note that more often than not, a child prodigy wouldn't be able too tell you very much how he got there. And I dare say Mozart's father would be able to tell you more about it than himself.Say, for instance, how would it be possible to avoid all but really good concerts as suggested by Hofmann? Without the benefit of both, how would we be able to differentiate the two? However, at a certain point of time this is so correct! Hofmann's insistence on the cleanliness of the keyboard, I suppose would carry different meaning for different pianists too. Likewise, soaking one's hands in warm water to warm them up may or may not work for all. And having a terrific memory, Hofmann is celebrated for his ability to learn, like Mozart, a piece by listening to it instead of sightreading any music. As such, Dohnanyi (the pianist), Richter, Gulda or even Nelson Freire might be in a better position to tell anything substantial about it...All in all, this book is nothing like an anti-biotic that can cure your ailments within virtually a couple of days, but just some very general guidelines or principles which would, nevertheless, takes you years if not months of practice to accomplish, if at all. Nonetheless, there are some good suggestions that would lead you and guide you through some turning points, without which you may get easily lost or else need much more time to unlearn."},{"Title":"Piano playing, with Piano questions answered","review":"I was slightly disappointed in this book. I did not feel that I learned very much that I didn't already know. There were a fewanswers to some problems that I have been experiencing on the piano, however, for the most part the answers to the questions were rather simple and common sense.I also felt that this book, written in the early 1900's, was outdated. I did get a good chuckle though from some of the advice.I felt that a beginner may have gleaned more usefull information from this book than I did.If you are looking for in depth answers, and advice on piano playing, etc. this didn't do it for me."},{"Title":"Piano playing, with Piano questions answered","review":"When buying a french cookbook, one can choose from wonderful derivative sources (for example, an American popularist of french cooking such as Julia Childs, or a Betty Crocker clone) or visit with a text written by a master native-born French chef for those who wish to learn how to cook authentic French cuisine from one of the top chefs in France. Interestingly, the same phenenomena exists with books on piano-playing. There are certainly Betty Crocker-style books written by marginally talented pianists who tailor their texts to aficionados who don't wish to think too much about piano-playing theories and methods. Then there are the books written by the real \\"chefs\\" or \\"chiefs\\" of piano-playing, like Josef Hofmann, who along with Rachmaninoff and a few others, ranked as the superlative pianists of the 20th Century. What Liszt was to the 19th Century, Hofmann was in the 20th Century. In Piano Playing the reader is treated to high-level advice on many of the most important aspects of piano playing. To be sure, unless the reader has had a high level teacher who has provided him/her a legitimately good foundation in piano-playing and piano knowledge, the book may feel less useful. But that's true only if the reader reads too hastily, and with an eye at being entertained instead of educated. Serious, that is \\"real\\" pianists, would not want to miss owning and reading this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Piano playing, with Piano questions answered","review":"I have both Nook and Kindle edition for this book since my piano teacher recommended it. It is a wonderful book and I like the Q and A part very much.The only pity for the Kindle edition is no photos/pictures so I feel like losing some important parts. I ended up up downloading this book with Nooksince I want to read the pictures.It is very detail and it shows a pianist with small hands how to prepare for playing the octave. It also tells me how to memorize a piece.Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"Piano playing, with Piano questions answered","review":"I must concur with those other reviewers here who have objected to the superficialities of commentary in Hofmann's little book. Only occasionally here does he home in on a truly insightful point about piano playing in general or about how he in particular achieved his own highly singular tone colors and mechanism. These essays and questions and answers were drawn from the Ladies Home Journal, wherein Hofmann had to water down and generalize his responses somewhat to address the context of his audience. Here and there he betrays a flash of his brilliance and quirkiness or clarifies a startling mechanical detail, but these are exceptions, not consistently maintained through the platitudinous narrative.This volume is less disclosing of an artist's piano secrets than other volumes in the Dover series by Gieseking, Lhevinne, etc. More's the pity because the truly fascinating inside story of Hofmann's life, career, and unique pianism is being held hostage by a self-professed scholar who has puffed smoke rings for thirty or more years about writing Hofmann's biography but has never actually done so, sitting on archival materials no one else has access to. The truly relevant information has to do with Hofmann's double life as a scientific inventor and physics and chemistry experimenter and how Hofmann's other identity inextricably informed his music making-- how Hofmann the mechanical engineer and acoustician made mechanical alterations to his pianos and to his manipulations of the piano that created the unique Hofmann sound. Until this material sees the light of day, the pianophile must resign himself to the tantalizing but inadequate glimpses of a unique artist stingily provided by this paltry volume."},{"Title":"Piano playing, with Piano questions answered","review":"I have to be honest. I do not like this book. I don't even think I got through the first chapter. I am a real nut about piano playing and piano theory, so if there is something good in the book I guess I just missed it.

Same characters are involved again in this story, with some added characters.Bascially, a military space shuttle has been shot down, and has crashed somewhere in southwest Asia. It is carrying a top secret item, and apparently a lot of the countries in and around the crash site know it. So, there is a race to get to the site of the crash, which is assumed to be located somewhere near the border of Kyrgyzstan and China, in a region called the Paswar. In one word, a no man's land. Involved countries are: the Chopper Ops group from the U.S., China, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, India, and a few elements from the Taliban of Afghanistan. A small war ensues as all of these small forces converge on a large volcanic crater in the Paswar, trying to get to the shuttle which is lodged in the snow and ice. Lots of bloodshed for nothing.Meanwhile, Smitz is sent on a wild goose chase by the CIA to find who is behind the stealing of a Soda-Can shaped blimp. This chase eventually leads him to Pakistan. Also, Ricco and Gillis go into training in the Nevada desert on extracting a vehicle stuck in a crater, which eventually leads them overseas to help out the other Chopper Ops crew.Behind this all is the terrorist mastermind, that supposedly, is worse than Osama, and Saddam, named Zim. He has his own troops out to retrieve this shuttle and its precious cargo.So, who gets to space shuttle first is the way this whole things plays out, with a twist.Likes: Action, plot twist toward the end, geographically descriptive.Dislikes: Although it is fiction, it basically is far fetched, especially a 600 pound terrorsit mastermind. Maloney tends to delve into sci-fi with his novels, like the direction he took the Wingman series in, with Starhawk, causing me to end with the last Wingman book. The prior in this series is much better, called Zero Red.Finally, make sure you read the first two before reading this, to understand the characters and their backgrounds. This book was published in Dec. 2000, and the way the ending is, this could be the last in the series, but Maloney has been known to take a few years off from writing on one series."},{"Title":"Chopper Ops 3: Shuttle Down","review":"The only thing going for this book is its action. At times the author attempts to introduce characters to the story, but he often either forgets to revisit them or utterly fails to develop them in any depth. The descriptions of action sequences are also devoid of detail. And then there are the odd phrases. Read this book for classics like: &quot;It was the guy who flew the super-duper secret plane,&quot; and &quot;Osama bin Laden looked like a Boy Scout [...] compared to the Great Zim.&quot;In short, I gave this one two stars only because I'm reserving the one star rating just in case one of the previous two books in the series deserves it more."},{"Title":"Chopper Ops 3: Shuttle Down","review":"Let me begin by saying that I wasn't the biggest fan of Chopper Ops, which I thought was a poor third to Wingman and the Colonel Ryder Long mini-series. But, Shuttle Down is fantastic! The story is plausible and the chick-count is manageable.The plot has a secret space shuttle program going awry after terrorist bring down a vehicle. But, it's not the shuttle per se that the the Chopper Ops group is after. The twists in the story are many and sharp.Maloney has taken his knack of intertwining characters that began in War Heaven - who was that hot-shot pilot flying the F-16XL? - and taken it to a new level in this, the third of the Chopper Ops series. For those of us in on the gags, it's a riot! For you newbies to Mack/Brian, you'll get the picture real fast.Too bad, so many of these earlier gems are out of print."},{"Title":"Chopper Ops 3: Shuttle Down","review":"Shuttle Down - Chopper Ops is the third book in the Mack Maloney series of the same tittle. It, as all of author Maloney's works, is a stand alone opus. But if you enjoy the combination of military action and covert operations then this series and book is for you. One incredible part of this book is the expansion of the aerial dog fight to the combat rotary wing aircraft world. Once only written as the near exclusive domain of the jet fighter (see Mack Maloney's WINGMAN Series if you enjoy aerial combat in fighter type aircraft), it is now being explored in the world of combat helicopters and vertical takeoff-landing aircraft. A fine series of examples are scenes described in Shuttle Down - Chopper Ops. As a military aviator, I rate his efforts of describing the difficulties behind planning and executing these wild missions as outstanding and very accurate to parts of real missions. His scenes play from the minds of characters, to their interaction with other characters, and the remote &quot;God's eye&quot; view in extremly well crafted form. The final point that I always look for in military action works is relating the sense and feelings of the combat flying or actions. Mack Maloney paints pictures with his words and prose in your mind, making the description more of an experience. It is a feature that brings this military pilot back for more. The other noteable part of the Chopper Ops series is the tie in to Mack Maloneys earlier work: War Heaven (I would rate this book as 5 stars). The beauty of his writing is that you can read it after the Chopper Ops series or before and gain insights to the overall themes of both books and series. The story hits you in many ways; mission, actions, locations, personal interactions, and continuous stream of triumphs and defeats. Read this book and strap in for the mission."},{"Title":"Chopper Ops 3: Shuttle Down","review":"The book Chopper Ops is about a group of military specialists that fly helicopters. All the characters have known each other for a long time and are good friends. They are assigned a mission to retrieve a crashed military space shuttle with cargo so valuble, the military would blow it up if it was not retrieved before the enemys got their. There are many surprises in this book and it is jam-packed full of action.This is the third book in the chopper ops series. You do not have to read them in order because they all explain the characters and previous events in the beggining. I know from experience because I read the second book first and did not know until I looked on the internet for the third. I liked the book and I liked the suspense that it gave throughout the book.If you like such authers as Tom Clancy, Stephen Hunter, and Stephen Coonts, you will enjoy this book. It covers arial action, bloody ground battles, and even comedy. Even though I liked it very much, I still liked the second book better. It is called Chopper Ops: Zero Red and I recommend that very much. If you do not like intense, graphic action I do not reccomend you read this book. For you travelers, it's a great book to read on a plane.

There is an Osprey involved, and some beautiful girls in the plot -- or at least one. The action is like non-stop, lots of flying and stuff going on between Norton and Slick and a race against the clock that ends very weirdly. But there is a big surprise for any of Mack's readers of his novel &quot;War Heaven&quot; a few years back. I won't blow it for you. You'll have to read it yourself.

Ms. Duggan is very detailed in the information she conveys (which perhaps if done in an otherwise and unprofessional manner, might have been embarrassing). She very matter-of-factly and scientifically teaches and relates her experiences, starting with her first job giving colonics (a registered RN, something she had never done previously) and culminating in her wealth of experience and knowledge. We feel like we are actually learning with her. And it is a subject with should be more of a priority with us. Proper colon care can be directly relative to diet, back pain, health, high blood pressure, indigestion and a host of other things. I can't imagine anyone NOT benefiting greatly from reading this book."},{"Title":"Tucker Over the Top","review":"This book is a colorful,fun filled tale that sparks a child's imagination and encourages youngsters to read.

As this book moved into the Post Modernists I detached myself a bit and then started to get warm fuzzy feelings about the theory and how I was using it in my day to day life and how well all this verbosity and inference was going to and has served me well in my current classes. Months later I find myself digging through it and my class work to find some Foucault for references. With a mix of Anthropologists and many social scientists I think I might be inspired to take on a few units for a minor in Sociology.If you are using this as a school text.

I found it very hard to find good books on this specific subject. The books I have found are either too easy or too complicated. This book fills the need for electricians who have basic electrical theory but are taking the next step to learn how compilcated control circuits work and come together. The book also covers basic functions or relays, contacters, motor starters, various other control devices. I highly recomend this book if you are trying to learn any the above.

The first ninety-seven pages look at thirties fashion, jewelry and the art movements that created such a vibrant look to pendants, bracelets, earrings and brooches. Clearly Christine Weber-Stober has done a lot of research into European Art Deco jewelry and the items made by Bengel from Galalith (from the Greek 'gala', milk and 'lithos', stone)It was made from milk protein and formaldehyde and was one of the new synthetic products developed in the middle and latter part of the nineteenth century. The beauty of it was that it could be made cheaply, was heat resistant and easy to color, so makers of buttons, belt-buckles, knitting needles and similar small items were able to churn them out by the millions. It did have one drawback though: it couldn't be cast like later plastic but was made in slabs, tubes and rods then cut and worked into whatever simple shape was required.The various new materials developed in the early years of the twentieth century were ideally suited to designers and creative folk influenced by the new 'isms' of the age: cubism, futurism, vorticism and especially modernism via the Bauhaus. The second part of the book has 253 photos of mass produced jewelry from the Bengel company. Their expertise in metalwork combined with the simple colorful shapes of Galalith makes all of these pieces look quite stunning. Strangely, despite the author's research, there seems to be no real explanation as to why this German metal working factory made such remarkable work. None of it was stamped with the company name, their Galalith jewelry output went to wholesalers who sold it on to retailers who added their brand names.The book's production is as gorgeous as the jewelry. Printed on matt art paper with a 175 screen, the elegant layout throws up the excellent photography. The text is in German and English but the designers have avoided any potential reader confusion by splitting the text pages horizontally with German occupying the top section. In comparison the books for collectors from the main American publishers in this sector look bland and visually uninspiring (expensive, too).Art Deco Jewelry is a beautiful celebration of past jewelry style that still looks fresh and lively today.***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover."},{"Title":"Art Dco Schmuck / Art Dco Jewelry","review":"Probably the dawn of art deco fashion jewelry was the 16-28 May 1927 machine-age exposition in New York. This exposition showed how modern technology could be fused with the arts, bringing German bauhaus design to America's attention.The prior year, 1926, saw the release of the silent film \\"Metropolis,\\" Fritz Lang's anxious vision of a world demanding conformity in which \\"the masses\\" are controlled by machines and their owners. This film's art direction makes use of many art deco design elements which find their way into mainstream costume jewelry design. Geometric shapes and simplicity dominate costume jewelry in which new, inexpensive materials, such as bakelite and corolite could be incorporated, adding translucent and opaque color.Fashion jewelry components in the 1930's were manufactured primarily in Bohemia so, when Jewish owners lost their factories in 1938, art deco costume jewelry also vanished from the fashion scene. This book gathers -- and preserves in photographs -- much of art deco jewelry's beauty within its pages."},{"Title":"The soul and body of an army,","review":"\\"The Soul and Body of an Army\\" [1921] by General Sir Ian Hamilton is a literal treasure-trove of leadership DNA.

Kertzer is Paul Dupee, Jr. University Professor of Social Science at Brown University and is the author of ten books on various aspects of Italian 19th- and 20th-century history. Two of his books, \\"The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara\\" and \\"The Popes Against the Jews,\\" treat relationships between Italian Catholics and Jews in the 19th and 20th centuries. This work, \\"Prisoner of the Vatican,\\" recounts the acrimonious relationship between the Holy See and the newly unified kingdom of Italy during the period from Italy's annexation of the Papal States in 1870 until the two adversaries settled their differences in Mussolini's Lateran Treaty of 1929, establishing Vatican City as an independent state.Contrary to the popular conception of history, the Middle Ages didn't end with the Renaissance in Italy. They lasted until September 20, 1870, when according to Professor Kertzer \\"Europe's last theocratic government was ended.\\" Kertzer writes that \\"Modern Italy was founded... over the dead body of Pope Pius IX.\\"Much has been written of Italian history but very little has been accessible in English dealing with the history of the Italian state. Professor Kertzer, given entry to freshly opened Vatican archives, tells a riveting tale of the political intrigues, international back-room deals, skullduggery and corrupt characters operating on both sides of the conflict.\\"Prisoner of the Vatican,\\" based on a copious amount of support documentation, is an historian's account of the Roman Catholic Church's covert attempts to subvert the unification of Italy and retain control of its medieval fiefdom known as the \\"Papal States,\\" not in ancient times but in the final decades of the nineteenth century. For the fifty years following the seizure of Rome and its adjacent territories (that is, nearly all of central Italy as far north as Bologna) by the newborn Italian state, the Supreme Pontiff was a self-sequestered prisoner within the malarial fog of Vatican City, planning to flee Italy and with foreign military help return as the restored ruler of a full third of the Italian peninsula.During this time, a fragile Kingdom of Italy was besieged from within and without. At the same time Italian, European and Church history changed forever when the pope had himself declared infallible by a Vatican Council. \\"Prisoner of the Vatican\\" takes a penetrating look deep into the workings of the Church in its final failure to reestablish the pope's territorial authority.In 1870, recognizing the pivotal role played by Catholicism in Italian life and anxious to reach an honorable accommodation with the pontiff, Victor Emmanuel II sought an agreement with Pius IX in which the pope would rule the Tiber's right bank (\\"the Leonine City\\") while the king would govern the left bank from what was to become the Italian capital. When the senile, power-mad and apparently manic-depressive pope rejected this arrangement, Italian troops seized power in Rome and Pius IX sought refuge in the Vatican palaces, declaring himself a prisoner. Led by Giuseppe Garibaldi and his army of \\"Red Shirts\\" and aided by France, the nationalists finally gained complete control in 1878.Pius IX repeatedly and publicly advertised his hatred for democracy, free speech and a free press, religious pluralism and other modernizing political forces sweeping Europe in the mid-19th century, and for good reason: a united secular Italy, the dream of Garibaldi and his legions, could only witness the end of papal power and Pius counted as a great blasphemy the modern notion that \\"Church and state should be separate.\\" A Vatican-inspired and funded campaign of intrigues, assassination attempts on opposing leaders, and soliciting the intervention of France and Austria against the Italian government was initiated and even as such attempts invariably failed, the Vatican promulgated a new doctrine, one that in the end would contribute to its political undoing: that of \\"papal infallibility.\\"Vatican scheming against the Italian state continued well after Pius's death, and it was not until after the first World War that a pope lifted the ban against Catholics' serving in Italy's parliament or even voting: The animosity between the pope and the state continued until 1929, when Mussolini and the Vatican signed the Lateran Treaty in which the Vatican recognized the legitimacy of the fascist Italian state and was in turn granted the rights of sovereignty and the stipulation that Catholicism be Italy's sole and official religion.Professor Kertzer sweeps readers along with a riveting, revelatory and very readable tale. No one who reads \\"Prisoner of the Vatican\\" will ever think of Italy, or the Vatican, in quite the same way again.If the book has any fault at all, it is in the deprecating of the role of Giuseppe Garibaldi and his \\"Red Shirt\\" legions as agents of change. In Kertzer's view, the battle for Rome was a trifurcated one, with the sides comprising the King and government of Italy, the pope and his retinue led by a truly fiendish Cardinal Antonelli, and an unpredictable Garibaldi and his followers constituting a \\"loose cannon\\" on the field of battle. This reviewer would also liked to have seen more attention given to the role played by Italy's Freemasonry movement - which was very considerable - in the demise of papal dictatorship and the birth of the new unified Italian state. Moreover, Professor Kertzer ends his book with a peculiar couple of paragraphs so anomalous in light of the pattern of facts presented as to seem quite an odd and unreasonable conclusion.Nonetheless, \\"Prisoner of the Vatican\\" is an excellent book, beautifully and engagingly written and very complete in both scope and depth. I strongly recommend it to all students of Italian and Catholic Church history."},{"Title":"Prisoner of the Vatican: The Popes' Secret Plot to Capture Rome from the New Italian State","review":"Italian history other than the Roman Empire is almost unknown in the US and what is known is mostly taught in Catholic schools by adherents of the Roman Catholic faith. This book is an eye-opener concerning how Italy came to be unified literally over the dead body of Pius IX who stated that his temporal dominion of the Papal States was absolutely necessary for him to be secure in his position and to provide vital funds to the Roman Catholic Church. The author continues into the 20th century and Pius IX's successors made major efforts to split Italy into three parts, a southern Kingdom like the former Kingdom of Naples or the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, a northern Kingdom for the Piedmontese, and the Papal Sates in between and including Rome with the Pope holding on the central and dominant power in Italy. Although this might seem medieval today to readers in the English-speaking world, one must remember that the critical events took place from 1859 to 1914.Italian reunification was by no means a foregone conclusion in the face of Papal opposition. Italian was not an universal language on the peninsula, and heart of Italy was the last part to be brought into the Kingdom of Italy under Victor Emmanuel, King of Sardinia. The primary force for the creation of a modern Italian States came from the Freemasons, most notably the Freemason Garibaldi who already had been a prime actor in South American revolutions. (One tends to forget or minimize the Freemason influence in the construction of democracies starting with the US as not being politically correct.) For some reason Garibaldi and the Freemasons are treated lightly by the author, perhaps because he desires to focus on the Papacy instead, although he does record that the plebisites were solidly for unification. Nonetheless, the dictotomy should be emphasized: to be a Freemason requires the belief in a separation of church and state (but not strictly a secular state in which religion plays no part), while the Popes to the present day oppose such separation.The author also makes the point abundantly clear that Pius IX ruled like an autocrat in his Papal States, suppressing individual liberties, freedom of speech and of the press, and opposed democracy in any form. Even today Italian schoolbooks and Church propaganda mention the liberation of Rome by Italian troops, thus uniting the country and setting the stage for Rome to be the capital, but do not mention what forces the Italians fought against. The answer, of course, is the Pope's troops. Pius also sought the assistance of France, Spain, Belgium, Austria and Germany to fight against the Italians, but by 1870 France was embroiled in the Franco-Prussian War, Austria had already been humbled by Prussia, Spain was barely hanging on as a power, and Germany under Bismarck was polite but not friendly. The days of the Papacy obtaining large armies from foreign nations to do its fighting for it were over.A key initiative by Pius when faced with the loss of his temporal dominion was his strong-arm bullying of the Vatican Council into creating the official dogma that the Pope was infallible in 1870. Most people today, even Roman Catholics, think this element of Church doctrine originated in medieval or earlier times, but it was demanded by Pius for his use against those who would oppose him politically. It actually had the opposite effect as many Catholic politicians in France and elsewhere saw through this tactic and felt such a doctrine placed undue pressure on the faithful in the Papacy versus democracy conflict. Pius IX himself, came to believe that France withheld troop support from him in revenge for his becoming infallible.The title of the book comes from Pius IX's statement that he \\"was being held prisoner by the Italian state in the Vatican\\" after the conquest of Rome in 1870. Yet, his confinement to the Vatican was of his own doing -- a policy that was also maintained by Leo XIII and Pius X. It was not until 1914 under Benedict XV that the Papacy began to change its attitude and attempt to make peace with democracy. A result of this refusal to accommodate democracy led to Mussolini and ultimately the situation after World War II when many Italian cities featured a Roman Catholic cardinal and a communist mayor. In many respects, Italy's national weakness in the 20th and 21st centuries stems from the Papacy's stance that Rome is a holy city to be administered by the Pope and should not be the capital of some other temporal nation.Author Kertzer (a pen name) offers up his scholarship in a wonderful writing style that is almost exciting to read. His portraits of the King Victor Emmanuel, Pius IX, and the other main actors in his drama made the book worth reading regardless of his presentation of a history that should be known by everyone today. One must remember the West is now facing a new push for theocratic states from Islam, and there are likely to be severe religious battles in our future. One needs to understand the Roman Catholic Church's stance on democracy and its insistance on its position as the world's one true religion. This volume explains the modern origins of many current attitudes of the Church and is an extremely important work.Highly recommended to all."},{"Title":"Prisoner of the Vatican: The Popes' Secret Plot to Capture Rome from the New Italian State","review":"The subtitle of this book is a bit misleading: there didn't appear to be a \\"secret plan\\" to recapture Rome from the new Italian state. Most of what happened was rather straightforward, and done by diplomatic means. In any event, this is an extremely interesting book about a little-known subject. Of course, everyone knows the basic story of the taking of Rome from the Pope by the new Italian state, but after that, nothing. This book very well fills in the knowledge gap by showing how the new state \\"bent over backwards\\" to try and mollify the Papal folks, only to be rebuffed at every turn. From the vantage of more than 125 years of Italian sovereignty over Rome, we can see how foolish the fears of the Pope actually were, but hindsight is the best sight. At the time, the Pope felt he was protecting the sovereignty and independence of the Papacy by having a temporal land under his control. This is fascinating history at its best, and I strongly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Prisoner of the Vatican: The Popes' Secret Plot to Capture Rome from the New Italian State","review":"Today in the afterglow of the papacy of John Paul II, few think of that time when the pope was the wager of wars, commander of armies, the temporal king of vast portions of Italy, an international political leader afforded equal status with of the King of England or the Emperor of Austria-Hungary, a worldly Prince on the Thrown of St. Peter. But, before 1860 that is just what he was. This is a disquieting vision today and that is the reason for the obscurity of this tale, the reason it is rarely told even in Italy where it is the very fountainhead of nationhood.But this book is not just another in a long list of Catholic bashers. It is the direct result of the honesty and foresight of John Paul II who flung open the doors to the Vatican library allowing historical researchers access to huge hordes of information hitherto only available to Church academics.The author, Professor D. I. Kertzer is the provost of Brown University where he holds a distinguished chair in Social Sciences. He is one of the best English speaking authorities on Italian studies today. His initial renowned sprang from his book \\"The Kidnapping of Edguardo Mortara.\\" Edguardo Mortara was the Elian Gonzales his day and the kidnapping of this 7 year old boy from his Jewish parents by officials of the Papal States in 1858 sparked an international incident, turned many against pope Pius IX and helped embolden the forces for Italian unity. This incident is mentioned only briefly in \\"Prisoner of the Vatican\\" but this latter book is obviously an ambitious extension of the former.The book begins in the 1850s with what I think is far too little explanation of the political ferment that lead to Italian political and territorial unity, but perhaps such social analysis is beyond its scope. It then describes the intersticine conflict of pope Pius IX's Vatican Council (Vatican I) over papal infallibility, King Victor Immanuel's conquest of the Papal States following his unification of the rest of Italy, mostly through popular uprising, and then the military conquest of Rome itself in that year of war, 1870. It describes in great detail how Pius IX then holed-up in the Vatican and portrayed himself to the world as a prisoner despite sincere assurances of safety from Victor Immanuel. The book describes in detail the complex political dance of the major powers of Europe, particularly Austria, France and Germany, around the papal isolation. These powers cared little to liberate the pope from the center of this dance but cared greatly to advance their own position. The result 44 years later was World War I.Much of the book is long quotes from letters, notes, newspaper articles and decrees of the time; it is very well researched and chronologically organized. Knowing the sensitivity of the subject, Professor Kertzer appears to have kept his interpretation intentionally sparse, allowing the people actually involved to tell the story. This makes the book a bit dry; it is a work for those few eager for doer, date, and detail. The style is straightforward with understated drama, little flourish and a freshman vocabulary. The ending is sudden and somewhat unsatisfying but the story had to stop somewhen.One cannot understand the second half of the 19th century, the unification of Italy and Germany, pre-World War I France or the evolution of socialist and anarchist movements in Europe without understanding the significance of the pope's unsuccessful attempt to maintain temporal power in Europe. It would be difficult to find a better starting point for inquiry into this complex and until now obscure story than \\"Prisoner of the Vatican.\\""},{"Title":"Prisoner of the Vatican: The Popes' Secret Plot to Capture Rome from the New Italian State","review":"David Kertzer provides a detailed account of the Vatican's attempts to return the Pope to his temporal throne, reigning over the former Papal States, for many years following the successful unification of Italy. Exercising one of the very freedoms that the Vatican had vowed to suppress if returned to temporal power, Kertzer uses his freedom of expression to give us a fair, honest, and balanced treatment of events. His history does not come off as being anti-Catholic, but it deals (factually) with issues that others might wish to avoid in order not to appear being so. It is, therefore, a rich source, taking us behind the scenes to experience the very human side of the Vatican. If it is a rule that all governments engage in disinformation and spin, then David Kertzer shows us that the Vatican is no exception. He also reveals the tightrope that the new nation of Italy straddled in its first years, governing a people who were, for the most part, faithful Catholics who did not always know how to make distinctions between loyalty to faith and nation while also working with the rulers of other European nations whose citizens were struggling with those distinctions. One comes away we a new respect for those early leaders of Italy who held on when challenged from within and from without to their newfound freedom and newly founded republic. I highly recommend this and Kertzer's other books."},{"Title":"Prisoner of the Vatican: The Popes' Secret Plot to Capture Rome from the New Italian State","review":"Documents buried in Vatican archives have only recently been made available to some historians, and David Kertzer's access to some of these records lend a lively touch to his political and religious history PRISONER OF THE VATICAN: THE POPES, THE KINGS, AND GARIBALDI'S REBELS IN THE STRUGGLE TO RULE MODERN ITALY. In 1870 Pope Pius IX and his successor decided to go into exile secretly to attract support among the faithful for the papal cause: to conspire against Garibaldi and the king of Italy to control the Italian state. It was a brilliant move: popes became prisoners of the Vatican for sixty years and even considered moving it outside Italy. A riveting true story of religion and a political scheme which changed the world."},{"Title":"Prisoner of the Vatican: The Popes' Secret Plot to Capture Rome from the New Italian State","review":"Hidden here and there within the history of the Roman Catholic church must be dozens, even hundreds of stories that would surpass the best fictional writing. Here is one of them.We view Italy (and Germany for that matter) as countries, countries with a history going back for thousands of years. But this isn't true. These two countries came together as countries in the middle 1800's. Before that they were a loose collection of city states, small kingdoms I'd guess you call them.This is one such story. Victor Emmanuel II, the king of an Italy finally united wanted to make Rome/The Vatican a part of Italy. The pope, at that time Pius IX, didn't recognize Emmanuel or for that matter Italy. Thus began this story.The Pope retreated into the walls of the Vatican, and they remained at impasse until Mussolini finally came to an agreement that stands today where the church recognizes Italy, and Italy agreed that the Vatican was a soverign state.This is a fascinating and little known story based on recently opened archives.Now if the author could go back to the Vatican and get the archives on Galileo."},{"Title":"Prisoner of the Vatican: The Popes' Secret Plot to Capture Rome from the New Italian State","review":"I've been a fan of David Kertzer's books ever since I first read his meticulously researched \\"The Popes against the Jews\\". In that book, David Kertzer proved himself to be an eminently qualified historian as well as a riveting narrator of history.\\"Prisoner of the Vatican,\\" is another compelling historical narrative and is based on a copious amount of supporting documentation.Despite the fact that Italian Monarchy gave the Pope and his Bishops the freedom to travel across Italy as they wished, the Pope lived in a self-imposed exile inside the Vatican and childishly refused to acknowledge that Europe was changing. Much like a child who stubbornly refuses to grow up, the Pope refused to acknowledge that the new Italian state (where Jews and Protestants now had freedoms in lands where they used to be oppressed by the Catholic Church) was an improvement over the oppression of the old Papal Estates. He wouldn't even refer to Victor Emmanuel as the King of Italy, but rather the King of Piedmont, insisting that the formation of the Italian state was illegitimate and wouldn't last long. He remained hidden in the Vatican Palaces and declared himself a \\"prisoner\\" and published newspapers where he painted himself as a victim and painted the Jews, the Freemasons, the Italian King and the Italian government as agents of the Devil who were sadistically tormenting him, mocking God and oppressing Catholics all over the world.Pope Pius IX can only be viewed as power-mad, authoritarian and dictatorial. He repeatedly and publicly advertised his hatred for democracy, free speech and a free press, religious pluralism and other modernizing political forces sweeping Europe in the mid-19th century. And with an attitude that that is strongly at odds with modern sensibilities in Europe and America, Pope Pius IX declared the modern notion that \\"Church and state should be separate\\" as a great blasphemy.On multiple occasions Pope Pius excommunicated the Italian King and all of his government ministers and constantly attempted to find foreign allies to invade Italy and overthrow the Italian monarchy as well as ways to cause chaos, panic and instability within Italy itself, so as to weaken and destroy Italy from the inside. David Kertzer does an excellent job of documenting all of these things.David Kertzer does his readers a great service in describing and documenting how Giuseppe Garibaldi, Garibaldi's Red Shirts, Victor Emmanuel and other Italian forces fought against the Pope's troops and united Italy. Sadly, many modern schoolbooks (and of course the propaganda of the Catholic Church) do not mention the Church's role in opposing the unification of Italy.David Kertzer also does an excellent job of explaining why Giuseppe Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel were such enemies and could not get along with each other. When I was in school I had asked my history professor why these two men (who both had the goal of uniting Italy) would hate each other. He was never able to give me an answer. However David Kertzer does a quite excellent job of explaining the differences between these two men and why they could never trust each other.Because of the excellent job David Kertzer does in explaining all of this, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Prisoner of the Vatican: The Popes' Secret Plot to Capture Rome from the New Italian State","review":"Very detailed and a little repetitive.

Volume I concentrates on mechanics, radiation, and heat; Volume II on electromagnetism and matter; and Volume III on quantum mechanics.Volume I: the first three chapters (\\"Atoms in Motion,\\" \\"Basic Physics,\\" and \\"The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences\\") were meant by Feynman to outline the relationship of physics to other sciences, and other sciences to each other, and to discuss the overall meaning of \`Science.' Here in the introduction to Volume I, Feynman iterates one of his most-quoted ideas on science: \\"If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generation of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis...that \`all things are made of atoms--little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.'\\"There are 52 chapters in Volume I, from \\"Atoms in Motion\\" to \\"Symmetry in Physical Laws.\\" It would be well to remember that this book and its fellows are not meant to be read in isolation. Rather the lectures were connected with a series of experiments and demonstrations. As Feynman puts it: \\"The principle of science, the definition, almost, is the following: \`The test of all knowledge is experiment.'\\"Volume II: the first two-thirds of this series of lectures is devoted to a reasonably inclusive treatment of the physics of electricity and magnetism. This volume's \`Foreward' by Matthew Sands states: \\"We hoped, first, to give the students a complete view of one of the great chapters of physics--from the early gropings of Franklin, through the great synthesis of Maxwell, on to the Lorentz electron theory of material properties, and ending with the still unsolved dilemmas of the electromagnetic self-energy.\\"There are 42 chapters in Volume II, with the last four chapters devoted to elasticity and fluid flow.Volume III: Richard P. Feynman won a Nobel Prize for his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, and this series of lectures was the first real attempt to ground physics students in the theory of quantum mechanics. By its nature, quantum mechanics is a mathematical theory, so these lectures are absolutely chock-full of calculus and physics equations. But, as Feynman himself once said, \\"Do not take the lecture [on quantum mechanics] too seriously...just relax and enjoy it. I am going to tell you what nature behaves like. If you will simply admit that maybe she does behave like this, you will find her a delightful, entrancing thing. Do not keep saying to yourself \`But how can it be like that?' because you will get...into a blind alley from which nobody has yet escaped. Nobody knows how it can be like that.\\"There are 21 chapters in Volume III, from \\"Quantum Behavior\\" to \\"The Schr&ouml;dinger Equation in a Classical Context: A Seminar on Superconductivity.\\"If the math in Volume III really depresses you, there now exist many good popular-science books on quantum mechanics, such as \\"In Search of Schr&ouml;dinger's Cat: Quantum Physics and Reality\\" by John Gribbin, \\"The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question?\\" by Leon Lederman, or Bruce Schumm's book on elementary particle physics, \\"Deep Down Things: The Breathtaking Beauty of Particle Physics.\\"These lectures by Richard P. Feynman were meant for physics students, as opposed to the general public. Those readers who have no background in physics, calculus, statistics and probability might find these books tough going. However, any of us might struggle through certain sections with no loss of self-worth, if we remember that one of America's most brilliant scientists gave two years of his knowledge and intellectual energy in order to present us with a solid understanding of his physicist's universe. Feynman says in his epilogue to these lectures: \\"Finally, may I add that the main purpose of my teaching has not been to prepare you for some examination...I wanted most to give you some appreciation of the wonderful world and the physicist's way of looking at it, which, I believe, is a major part of the true culture of modern times.\\""},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics (3 Volumes)","review":"Just a quick note on the Millennium edition of the Feynman lectures box set: It does not contain Tips on physics, however, they are working on a revised edition of Tips on physics with over 900 extra pages that should be done by the end of 2011.

I am most familiar with the first volume, only because I haven't found the time to spend on the other two.Though there are more exact and rigorous formal treatments of virtual every topic Feynman treats, these are found in more advance texts, and/or scattered through many different books, no other single collection of physics books, that I know of, presents so much material in such a compelling and accessible form at the \\"introductory\\" level.I recently purchased the New Millennium Edition, boxed set. The manufacturing quality is, in general, high. The books are solidly and attractively bound. I agree with another reviewer who found the font to be a bit on the light side; and combined with the glossiness of the pages, it is a bit of strain on my aging eyes. (Reading glasses help.) Nonetheless, the electronically formatted text, especially when it comes to the mathematical expressions is truly beautiful. All of the figures have also been converted to electronic format which makes them more crisp and clear. The conversion was a huge undertaking, executed deftly. I am genuinely impressed and grateful to the people who accomplished it.Feynman was great at what he did, loved what he was doing and had fun doing it.

The books are very informal and light but comprehensive and littered with physics insights that always seem to be missing from other introductory physics books. Although some of the text simply reflects the times when it was written (you can safely take most of the particle discussions with a grain or two of salt), Feynman treats each subject from the ground up, and assumes that the student is willing to put the effort into understanding concepts. Unlike (say) Halliday and Resnick, this is not a set of books where the reader finds thousands of exercises to practise. Instead, this is a supplement to a standard first and second year course, but will be a set of books that you will continue to learn from years after your introductory books have been relegated to the back shelf in your library. Feynman in many ways is very terse, assuming that the student understands many applications of each concept that was explained only a single time. This would leave the average student far behind in the dust, but it does cut down on the redundancy of information for those on the higher end of the learning bell curve.He does say early in the first book that the series is intended for those who make a career out of physics and that he is intending to get as much into those students as possible. Unfortunately, it also means that for more casual readers, this is probably not the book series for them.The mathematics in the book are very straightforward, and little is assumed of the reader's mathematical background. In fact, that is one area that does come through clearly in spots, is Feynman's disdain for mathematics and mathematicians. However, if you are willing to overlook this aspect of the lectures, this is a fantastic series that both introductory physics students and lifelong learners will benefit from."},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics (3 Volumes)","review":"This is definitely the BEST physics books collection.

But I'm surprised at how fact-based it is. By that I mean the author isn't just giving opinions about our current President, he's citing actual documents and official sources in illustrating the many liberties taken by the Bush administration.It's amazing just how much George W has gotten away with, going back to when he transferred all his papers as the Governor of Texas to his daddy's Presidential Library, away from public view...To giving himself more control over his White House papers than any President before...To allowing the identity of a CIA agent to be leaked after the agent's husband was slightly critical of Bush's administration. That's just a small tip of the iceberg. I haven't even mentioned Iraq! The rest is for you to read.BUSHED! is actually quite a pleasant read. You can use it almost like a reference tool, especially considering it's extensive table of contents.

Elaine Mar for her hard work, her achievements of acculturation and academic study. It's a long way from the crowded apartments of Hong Kong to the halls of Harvard. She is young, and it's perhaps a little too early for her to attempt a memoir. Let's hear more later! Her elementary school years are given to us in vivid detail, and the humiliation she endured is still fresh and stinging. One can only hope that teachers are more proactive these days, intervening and preventing cruelties, than they seem to be in the '70s. My city has an enormous tide of immigration from Asia, and I tried to ensure that my own children were friendly and welcoming to these latest Americans. I told them that, except for the native tribes, we are ALL immigrants, whether our ancestors came on the Mayflower or on a TWA flight from Manila. I wish that M. Elaine, as a young child, could have known more children with this attitude. The tales from her teenage years are also fresh---too fresh for her to be objective about them. I wonder if she realizes that \\"re-inventing yourself\\", chiefly by dissociating from your parents, is a common phenomonon of American life. Of course, her dissociation had to be more radical than most; and it is still too recent. How can I put this kindly----sometimes, her arrogance and self-centeredness are altogether too much on display, as when she tosses out all the lovely clothes a kind friend had given her to take to college; no second-hand outfits and no condescension for her! Didn't she stop to think that maybe some other girl, not so stiffbacked and proud, would delight in having those clothes? Why put them into the trash?I hope that eventually, in maturity, M.Elaine will reunite her with her parents and her extended family, and the riches of an ancient and honorable culture. I hope that she will begin to know in her heart, the courage, sacrifice, and guidance of her intelligent parents (does she think she \\"re-invented\\" her own mental gifts?)

I finished the book wanting to know what happened next? What is the sequel? Her documentation of working poor struggles is as potent as her experience of ethnic differences. In the end, this class perspective may be the book's most important contribution. Because the author has not yet fully come to terms with her family's class perspective, it makes the book all the more revealing, honest and painful. I highly recommend reading A Paper Daughter and await the author's next book!"},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"Paper Daughter is a memoir that makes you think.

I do hope this author continues to write as she is a superb and unforgettable storyteller."},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"Although much of the focus of Elaine Mar's memoir could be written by anyone who experienced childhood teasing, discrimination, loneliness, poverty, low self-esteem; it is important to find the core of her plight, a battle with parents resisting a change into their new country. But even that story can be retold by many.Two countries in one household.Elaine was very young upon arriving from Hong Kong with her mother to join her father. The parents didn't accommodate to the U.S. well. They didn't learn English or customary ways. Her mother was mentally and physically abusive and spoke to her daughter in a degrading manner, and often repeated to the daughter that it was a waste of their time raising her.I didn't feel what she had to say was any different that what many people experience as children. But then, I understood the conflict being raised as an American, but challenged by Hong Kong parents with their strong ties to that culture and beliefs.Money vs no money.That she could not buy the right clothes to fit in was moreso, poverty vs. money rather than a cultural aspect. And many Americans are forced to work in the family business their entire youth; it is not just a Hong Kong thing.Unanswered QuestionsI was left with questions unanswered. Her parents worked in a restaurant with relatives, and a feud caused them to leave the home (basement) and the father to be out of work. She never elaborates on what caused this feud that forced them to make changes and how did the feud end, since there was a reunion.Also, aside from some typographical errors, toward the end, there is a chapter titled \\"When Father Lived in Wichita\\", but it has nothing to do with the content. The father lived there before she came to the U.S. Another chapter regarding college life is titled TASPS, but nowhere do we get an explanation what this stands for.Graphic Detail - the sexual experience.We learn of her sexual experience with a white boy from the restaurant, and I do say; we learn this through graphic detail for several pages.....several. A page would have done for me.Well-written, holding my interest, living in Denver, and, my fascination with a different look at how two cultures collided.One has to admire her tenacity to get where she did! .....Rizzo"},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"After I read this book, I feel really shock. The author show no respect to her family especially her parents.I understand her difficult of live (poverty) but its doesn't mean she can judge her parents and show no respect to them."},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"Not only did I find the book an amazingly accurate account of Chinese values, but I admire it greatly as well. When I picked up this book I read it twice in a row. It takes a lot of strength to go back to your past - not only to reconstruct the thoughts you had, but to be true to yourself in the process of writing for the eyes of others. I feel Mar's memoir is accurate because many of the feelings she recounted I myself have felt. Being only 23, things are fresher in my mind, and it is somewhat easier for me to truthfully admit at least to myself that I had such anger towards my parents. But I also remember that underpinning all our conflicts is a great, great love. THIS IS WHAT MAR WRITES.Another reviewer of this book said: &quot;I hope the author is not expecting any sympathy or respect for this book, since she obviously lacks any for her own family. I was offended at the way she exposes her family's privacy with little thanks or appreciation for their struggle.&quot; This reviewer is missing the point somewhat, as if he/she read only the parts that were shockingly angry. First of all, it can't be denied that Mar has committed no &quot;sin&quot; in writing frankly about her family, flaws and all. Would it be a real memoir if she had not?Second, and more importantly I think, is that Mar's book says much MORE than just &quot;I hate my embarassing family.&quot; Her memoir does rare work: it documents how psychologically American culture (with its comparatively disbanded family structure) requires us to traumatically break from our families (our mothers, especially). The fact of this break is most significant in Mar because her mother did not learn that this is what Americans do, instead, Mar was so traumatized by her youth (surrounded by racists and classists) that she actively sought to buy into American culture and all its discontents. This book speaks volumes about American culture because Mar has the point of view of an outsider choosing to come in."},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"Elaine's story is so honest and so well written it becomes almost universal---although she definately describes a certain place, time and situation very clearly. Anyone who has felt what it was like to go to a school where you didn't feel you fit in, didn't feel you had the right clothes or a home you could bring friend home to, or the parents with the right job, can find comfort here, in knowing that someday like Elaine, you will find a place you do fit in.

Nothing ties it all together, so to speak. And the ending is abrupt.This book was about a year's work from being done.I would encourage Ms. Mar to keep writing.On a personal note...as an immigrant who came to the U.S. the same year and at the same age as Ms. Mar, I hope she has come to a place of acceptance, forgiveness, and love with her parents.I felt very sorry for her, and more so for her family at the end of the memoir. The way it was written made it almost seem like it was her family and not just college she had graduated from.I hope she has found a way to incorporate her family into her life.I did learn a lot about Chinese-American culture and found it edifying to read her experience."},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"This has to be one of the best books I have ever read.

I was so impressed with the amount of knowledge I gained from reading this novel, and seriously affected by each family member portrayed.

I was also touched by the somtimes painful but detailed stories of the author's childhood, such as the school Meenie T shirt she wanted so badly but could not get, but I was a little disappointed at her overall tone of the story. It seems that all she could remember and write down were the negative side of life. Perhaps that's the way she felt all along, but as a reader I just want a little more fresh air. Overall, it is a well-structured book of personal struggle and growth and is worth a read, but it is just not one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"I had to choose a book off of a list for my graduate cross and chose this one. Best pick ever. The author draws you into her story about her immigration into America from Hong Kong and I was able to relate to her experiences in so many ways, despite being born an American. I love her writing and details and how she incorporates her first language and culture seamlessly with her story, without making it a history or course lesson. I laughed and cried and wished I could speak with her today, that's how amazing I found the book. I love to read, and have to read often for school and because I'm a teacher. I recommend this book to everyone because of how powerful the story is, no matter what your background or reason for reading."},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"This is such a good book and it gives one a different perspective on living in the united states. it is so nice how the author describes her life and it feels so real."},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"Seriously the cheapest book i've found on here and in the best conditions. it looked hardly used.! it was great.!"},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"I love this book and have been recommending it to all of my friends.

There are other ways to &quot;see&quot; things...Look for my family's restaurant history in a book coming soon! It's the &quot;...glass is half full&quot; account!

There was nothing exceptional or interesting about her childhood, I had a lot of the same problems and experiences, only I am white and not an immigrant so my story isnt worth publishing.Also, that Harvard Scholarship went to her not because she is so brilliant but because she was a foreign national, Asian immigrant,Americans who are poor and white are passed over by the Ivy league schools, because we don't add to their diversity quotient. Her scholarship should have gone to a poor kid from Kentucky.As a story , it was boring and by the way, I worked in a real chinese restaurant as a waitress,where the owner, a chinese immigrant from Taiwan made slaves out of his workers and the cook's wife hung herself in Bellevue Washington.So I know about egg foo young and had friends who were Chinese immigrants and still her story is boring.If you're going to right a story about a hard luck childhood, at least make it interesting. The Liar's Club and The Glass Castle are examples of stories that are really interesting and without self-pity and guess what they didn't use the immigrant card. !!I am sure she married a really successful white male and completed her climb to the top of the heap."},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"When I first started this book, it was incredibly captivating, because there were experiences Elaine had to which I can relate -the familial obligation, the confusion, the language barriers, the financial problems, etc. I was thrilled that an Asian American woman author chose to write about a deeply personal experience.As I neared the end of the book, I started getting confused. Mar seemed to be making a chronological list of things that have happened to her, but she offers very little insight into her particular experiences. I frequently asked myself, &quot;What did she learn from this?&quot; I felt as if Mar was spiraling downward, instead of trying to get something positive out of the pain and abuse of her childhood. It seems like she could have learned so much from her negative experience; instead, she kept running and running.In addition, I was confused about several other things, like the missing chunk of time between her elementary and high school years. Too little happened during that time for her to eloborate on? And what about the conclusion? Her story seemed to end abruptly, and she was running away again.Mar's childhood seems to have endless potential to provide her with the oppportunity to grow, but we don't anything learn about this. That was what stuck out the most, that she didn't seem to grow. I was especially curious to learn about her life in college - though she didn't write about that - because she was away from home and there were probably myriad revelations and self-discoveries.If she writes another book, I would definitely read it, because although I didn't enjoy Paper Daughter a lot, I think that Mar is heading in the right direction in writing about her experiences as an Asian American. I think all she needs is a little push."},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"Paper Daughter is a rich memoir of cultures crossing, as many reviewers have noted. It is also a valuable addition to the literature of class in America. But I find it has stayed with me most of all as a story about family, and especially about the terrible love that connects so many of us with our parents.Mar's rendering of her early childhood in Hong Kong is beautiful, capturing the satisfaction of a child who feels safe, known, and well-cared-for; she describes her family's meager resources with care and no rancor, making clear that for her, the world was rich and complete. One of my favorite images in a long time is of little Man Yee arriving at school asleep, snuggled up against her mother's back for the walk there. And if there is one moment of plain peace in this novel, it is when Mar, having completed with her mother the arduous and anxious journey from Hong Kong, is reunited with her father at the airport. Nuzzling against him as heart contracted and released. This was my father, and he remembered me.&quot;What felt to a little girl like an idyll for her family, one room in a crowded walk-up with uncertain plumbing, was of course not really tenable, and her parents were compelled to make the choices they did. And surely even if Mar's American acculturation had not divided her so painfully from her parents, something else would have. Who among us has not, at some time, looked around at her family, no matter how valued, and felt herself a stranger in a strange land? (After a recent reading from Paper Daughter, Elaine Mar told the audience that she believes that when she and her mother speak Chinese, she understands almost 100 percent of what her mother says, but her mother only understands about 70 percent of what Elaine says. Thinking of myself and my own mother, I thought &quot;yep, that's about right,&quot; even though both my mother and I are native English speakers.)Mar's is a classically American story, of upward class mobility and the distance it puts between a young woman and her immigrant parents. But in spite of its honest treatment of an isolation so overpowering it sometimes made her nearly suicidal, Paper Daughter is nevertheless a novel infused with loyalty, love, and humor. Mar's appreciation for detail, and especially for the contours of the heart's many hungers, helps her paint a picture in which every face holds beauty and sorrow.There is no love more intense than the one that ties us to the parents who raise us, and there is no chasm deeper than the one that opens up between those parents and ourselves. We fight with each other desperately, perhaps just to keep from letting go altogether. In Mar's family, poverty, fear, and displacement added intolerable stress to the mix, as they do for too many families. Her parents feel she can never appreciate their sacrifices, and truly it seems that they can't understand her suffering either. Yet from this impasse Elaine Mar has created a book that honors both."},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"The book opens with a sensuous description of a Hong Kong child eating chicken bones, crushing them between her teeth to release the clotted marrow within. The author later contrasts this earthy and primal experience with the manner in which Americans eat fried chicken, delicately nibbling away from the bone, oblivious to the rich marrow within. I found this broad metaphor thought-provoking, contrasting the sterility of American suburban life with the riotous, crowded Hong Kong environs where the author lived her earliest years.I was very impressed with the sensual detail in the book, the descriptions of textures and scents hinting of mystery, such as the jars of dried mushrooms and spices that her mother stored in the tiny room that was the author's first home.The criticism that many reviewers have expressed is that the memoir fails to be reflective. I did not find that to be the case. I prefer to have the author use metaphor and selectiveness of memory to present her view, as she deftly does, than to read pages of exposition detailing why she felt her mother treated her coldly. I believe the author is trusting to the intelligence of the reader to puzzle out the motivations of each character. It would be less than artful to be as obvious as some readers apparently wish.That said, I did not always sympathize with the author, especially as she grew into adolescence and became increasingly disrespectful of her parents. However, it took courage for the author to sometimes portray herself in a less than attractive manner. One was left to wonder if her adolescent angst would have been similar if she had never left Hong Kong.I felt the memoir's legitimate focus was her childhood and formative years. Some have expressed the wish that the author would have continued, describing her college years in greater detail. I disagree, as that would have moved the story away from the focus on family. Family is used to define the author throughout the memoir; as she seperates from her family, the story ends. Therefore, I found the break logical.My one criticism would be that it is slightly facile to believe that a Harvard education somehow has elevated the author beyond her family. The first severing was one of language. Education was secondary. I disliked the implication that the education she strove for somehow delivered her from an intolerable life. The author seemed to be overly impressed with herself for being accepted into Harvard, as if this were the grandest achievement attainable. She also failed to criticize, or if she did, it was too subtle for my tastes, the adolescent mentalities and delusions of genius, which were apparently common amongst the students at the Cornell summer program she attended. Nor could I tell if she felt the psychiatrist who interviewed her for the program was rather pompous and shallow, as I did. My assumption, though, is that the author has chosen to leave this unsaid and that this scene was yet another instance of her trying to fit into one sub-group or another, posing as an intellectual rather than as a typical American teenager.The author progresses from dutiful Chinese daughter, to bewildered immigrant, to essential interlocutor for her family, to sullen teenager, to burgeoning \\"intellectual\\". I felt that most of these transitions were beautifully described and that the varying experiences and motivations of the different family members contributed greatly to the richness of the story. I was a little off-put by her eventual move to Cambridge and Harvard, because I felt that the author's motivations were more about belonging to an \\"elite\\" group and progressing socially than any educational goals. However, my opinion is belied by the elegant and moving memoir that she later wrote, which implies that her maturity has progressed greatly beyond the last stage described in the book, that of a self-centered teenager eager to break from her family.Overall, I found this memoir to be very worthwhile reading."},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"Like M. Elaine Mar, my parents are from the Toishan region of China, I live in the Denver area (though only for the last 2 years), and we were born 10 days apart, so I was very anxious to read what it was like to grow up with such similar circumstances.Mar does a great job conveying the frustration of being first generation Chinese-American in a predominately American city. I grew up in Portland and also went to an inner city high school and my parents worked in a restaurant, too. The family conflicts and peer jealousies are well described. It is hard to not be able to communicate what I learned in school and what I do at work to my parents because of my limited Toishanese. I was disappointed to read about the persistent verbal abuse from her parents. Not all Toishanese are as short on praise.Mar describes vividly her grade school experiences, but I was left longing for more detail about her high school and college years. How did she become a brilliant poet and philosopher? Who shaped her writing career? What kinds of relationships did she have in high school? Perhaps this was the fault of her editors, who wanted to focus on the family relationships more than the personal triumphs of independence. There are enough other books that describe the immigrant experience. The interesting and inspirational storyline here would have been to describe how she independently forged her education and career without any external help.I can't help but recommend this, mostly because it mirrors my life so much. It captures the essence of what it was like to grow up the children of Chinese immigrants."},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"From the first page, this moving memoir captures the essence of the transplanted life of a jook-kok, a Chinese-American child born in the old country. Born in Hong Kong, Elaine (her &quot;American&quot; name) immigrates to the United States when she is five years old. All her early childhood memories, the safety of a poor but well-ordered life are based on the identity and acceptance of her Hong Kong relatives.In America, Elaine's nuclear family lives with her father's sister and her family in Denver, Colorado. Most of this extended family works long, ardous hours in the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant, preparing &quot;Chinese&quot; food and washing dishes. With the adults engaged in economic survival, Elaine and her young cousin, San, spend many hours supervised by Elaine's non-English speaking mother.The most painful hours of Elaine's life are spent in school. She enters first grade with few language skills, unable to express herself adequately. Unable, as well, to defend herself against the taunts of the children, who call her &quot;chink&quot; and &quot;slant-eyes&quot;. Gradually, as her command of language improves, as well as comprehension of American social nuances, Elaine begins to blend in with her classmates. With the longing of a child's heart, she is thrust daily into the fractured world of Chinese vs American. In spite of the painful solitude Elaine endures, she retains a strong sense of self, blindly reaching to make her life tolerable. Her mother will never comprehend the daughter's suffering, she has her own pain, and there are no Chinese words for what the child is experiencing.This is a heartbreaking story of culture shock and self-survival. Elaine's acceptance in America depends upon her ability to adapt, to read the signs of her environment. Ultimately, her life is split in half, between Chinese and American. She makes difficult choices, at the cost of her Chinese heart. She has written this memoir to reclaim that heart, and to tell her family she has not forgotten. But they cannot read English words and she is forever outside the embrace of her two cultures. In the last sentence, M. Elaine Mar tells us, &quot;Like my grandfather, I'd immigrated, with no way to send for my family.&quot;"},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"This is a book for everyone.Richly descriptive, bravely revealing, and intensely engaging, M. Elaine Mar's writing has the remarkable effect of bringing the reader right inside her own feelings and senses, as if to experience her story firsthand.Its touching vignettes from a family life so infused with both love and pain; its thoughtful depiction of the experience of a working-poor, first-generation immigrant family in modern U.S. society; and its revealing account of a young girl's struggle for identity in world filled with contradictions, are what make this book worth reading.While I might agree that Ms. Mar doesn't bring everything to a tidy resolution at the end, I'm compelled to point out that this is a memoir, not fiction. Who among us does have everything resolved in life? This book - - as with life - - is more about the journey than the destination.I enjoyed Paper Daughter tremendously, I wholeheartedly recommend it, and I look forward to more from this author."},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"I was truely skeptical about getting this book as I roamed around the book store for something to read on the train but after reading the first chapter, I found myself in tears. Nothing that I've read in the past has truely affected me as the way this book has. Being an American Born Chinese girl made me see the trials and turbulantions one goes through in order to forfill the american dream. It was like a mirror reflection of the relationship with my parents only they understood what I wanted in life and was by my side for it. What was shocking is that she mentioned her father having a glass of hennessey and a smoke during his days after work. Once I read that, I actually was in a gasp because that's what my father still does to this day after a long day of work in a restaurant as well. You will definitely sympathize the pain she has written in the book and you'll never let this book down once you pick it up. And once you're on the final chapter, you'll find yourself flipping through the &quot;acknowledgements&quot; and you'll really know why she's thanking these people in her life. I must say, as a Chinese American reader reading this book, you would definitely need a tissue. Now that I live in another state far away from my parents, this book really made me more aware of what I have, and that is my loving family. This book really reassures you about your roots. Elaine Mar, thank you for writing this book, you have truely gave me the experience of what it's really being a Chinese person in America."},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"M. Elaine Mar's Paper Daughter is an accomplishment. Mar gives a real and sometimes painful depiction of her life growing up as an immigrant to this country. Although often describing the sadness, anger, and other hardships her family faces, she also writes about the truly positive and special times she experiences with family members. I was so moved by her closeness with her father and his unfailing pride in her - even when he outwardly showed other feelings about his daughter. As a close friend of Mar, I gained a great deal of insight into her from reading her story. I highly recommend Paper Daughter, and look forward to reading more from Elaine!"},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"Too many people from our generation do not appreciate the hardships and sacrifices endured by our ancestors (and parents). We take too much for granted, we complain, and we are ungrateful.I was saddened by the lack of respect Ms. Mar pays to her parents and her extended family for sacrificing their own &quot;dreams&quot;, financially scraping by, and struggling with language in order to give her a better life and more opportunities. Ms. Mar focuses on the abuses and the negative, failing to depict the positive influences on her life. If she has never had a source of nurturing then this is truly a miraculous underdog story. It makes you wonder if she would have been able to achieve the same or greater if her family never immigrated from Hong Kong.I don't deny that she had a difficult life, but I find it repulsive that she is embarrassed by her family and feels the need to &quot;lie&quot; about her background. . .rather than be proud of how far she has come and what she has accomplished. I have pity for Ms. Mar; not for the struggles she's been through, but for the fact that she has denied her family and the respect they deserve.It is fortunate that her parents, her Aunt Becky and older members of the Chinese community do not read english, for this story would be devastating to them. In the future, I hope she is more sensitive about slurring names of people in the Chinese community without substantial evidence."},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"Come experience two worlds that never really meld into one.

Mar does not use hindsight to explain things that confused her in her childhood, such as the significance of speaking Toisan instead of proper Cantonese. Her childhood experiences are not so different from those of American-born Chinese, or frankly of smart children in general. Her experience with the joy of being around other smart kids is more closely tied with the &quot;smart&quot; experience than the &quot;immigrant&quot; experience. And her tango with anorexia, along the same vein, has more to do with the &quot;type-A female&quot; experience then with the immigrant experience. Overall, this book is a good memoir of one woman's life, but there are too many ideosyncratic facets for this to tout itself as a good representation of the modern Chinese immigrant experience in America."},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"Some people who've posted reviews here feel this book is not significant but I think we can all relate to being teased at school and trying to get by as a child.

I didn't learn much about her high school experience, which is one of the most crucial times in your early life, and I had no idea what had gone on past eighth grade. Furthermore, I'd love to know how she was treated in Harvard, as she grew more and more detached from her family.The author has an easy - going writing style which makes this book a good read, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in reading an autobiography about a nonsuperfluous, unpretentious, normal human being."},{"Title":"Paper Daughter: A Memoir","review":"E.

I came away from this memoir thinking that America is truly a wonderful place to live with many opportunities.

Be forwarned; it is not a real easy read but if you want to find out about what makes people tick, how to know the true personality of another and how to help others overcome basic emotional problems, this is the book to read. Once you study this book, you will realize that all the \\"experts\\" on the mind out there really have no clue. I mean they are not even in the same universe. I guarantee that if you read this book, look up any and all words you do not understand (there is a good glossary in the back), you will be truly enlightened about human behavior and the human spirit. There is real truth in there. You will gain so much just from reading and duplicating the data in Science Of Survival."},{"Title":"Science of survival: Prediction of human behavior","review":"Helps to have a rudimentary understanding of Dianetics prior to reading it, so this book can follow either Dianetics: Modern Science of Mental Health or Dianetics: Original Thesis or Dianetics: Evolution of a Science.This is an absorbing read, full of extremely useful observations and classifications of human behavior, and many valuable insights and solutions to relationship problems. Anyone who has had difficulties dealing with a co-worker, a spouse, or with children, friends, etc., could likely find the reason and the handling right here in one of the chapters. I have used this book (and its accompanying chart of human evaluation) time after time to learn how to get along with others, to prevent upsets and crises in relationships, and to quite simply listen and communicate better. If you love your friends, value your family, want to keep your job, this book has got what it takes to really understand and nurture those relationships.Super-helpful glossary in the back defines not just the specialized terminology but also many of the English words used in the book."},{"Title":"Science of survival: Prediction of human behavior","review":"This book reads like a novel even though it is fact. I have applied the data from this book to life and found the information to work all the time. The first part of the book is devoted to prediction of behavior through observation of the individual in question. As an example; by seeing how a person behaves toward one aspect of life one can surley say how he or she will function in the other areas of life. This is the ultimate guide on &quot; How to choose your people &quot; Find out how to choose a mate, an employee, a babysitter etc; You will not be sorry!

It absolutely blew me away! It helped me in so many ways, it's hard to write them down. One of the biggest things this book helped me with is the ability to really understand people and what they go through and how to predict what people will do. It is the most amazing guide to predicting behavior! I would occassionally run into someone who would tear me down or tear others down but in a way that wasn't obvious so it was hard to see; I'd just feel bad about myself after being around people who would do that. This book helped me to understand why someone would do that but more importantly, predict who would do that so I wouldn't get blindsided when it happened. I'm so much happier and more secure since I discovered this book!"},{"Title":"Science of survival: Prediction of human behavior","review":"Edition 2007 is the complete, full version as the author, intended. Complete with a comprehensive yet simple glossary! The Human Evaluation Chart fold out is a visual addition to add application of these data. The columns therein illustrate: What a person usually talks about, how they listen, WHAT they DO with your conversation, their attitude toward sex, marriage, children, work ethics, sense of artistry, etc... I gained insight to myself more than others... It opened my eyes and was truly an education to the human condition and ALL ITS MANIFESTATIONS. For years I had struggled with, pondered over and lost my wits because I was too trusting and could not in many cases determine who my REAL friends were.. Who to trust with a confidence or my most treasured aspirations. What does a friend look like and what determines his/her worth (not in terms of money but of loyalties and values) Why some \\"friends\\" seem to leave you feeling, well not so good or feeling that somehow your dreams and projects just didn't seem that valuable after all were totally answered.. I tested Hubbard's discoveries contained herein and found them to be true and workable. That was the big test for me. As I read, I realized this author did not give in to what was popular, rather he stayed true as a researcher. I also realized the principles and points therein were not his opinions... This book, layer by layer opened my eyes to myself and others as I encountered them in life.Basic summary: I learned more about myself. How to be a friend to another. For single men or women..

We had a fellow interested in doing business with us, and as the result of my study of this book, I knew he was going to be bad news. We avoided a lot of trouble - his business was investigated for fraud and, simply because of this book, I was able to steer clear of THAT mess entirely!If you have ever found yourself unsure of who to trust, then this book will help!I also recommend \\"The Tone Scale in Full\\" and \\"A Special Course in Human Evaluation.\\""},{"Title":"Science of survival: Prediction of human behavior","review":"Until the \\"Power Vs Force\\" series from Dr. David R Hawkins this was my favorite book of all time. Prior to this book I envisioned science and religion as diametrically opposed with \\"irreconcilable differences\\". This book actually moved me off the atheist viewpoint by logically illustrating that spirituality can exist and the most obvious and demonstrable place to \\"prove\\" this to oneself is by observing one's fellow man.I'm a very visual person and to have a scale to plot out various areas of human behavior in order to predict behavior in other areas is extremely appealing, whether or not it's true - the idea simply rocks! This book is spot on and 100% accurate. I have seen it demonstrated as true time and time again even when I was blinding myself because of emotional attachment to people and situations - the information contained in this book, if followed, will definately prevent much heartache and upset!!This author, whether devil or saint; maligned or benefactor, has the observational geniuse of Galileo, et al. To be able to observe life and the very things that all of us are exposed to for our entire sentient lives and then be able to make sense of things with utter clarity leaves me in awe. How many times have people observed an apple falling and it took Newton to actually make sense of things or Galileo timing pendulum swings with his pulse when all I would see is a swinging chandelier - that is the type of clarity of vision that this book brings to interpersonal relationships.After this book I started to rethink my studies in theology, philosophy, psychology, etc. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts!! Very uplifting and revealing - you'll definately leave this work less confused and with clarity instead of with a furrowed brow."},{"Title":"Science of survival: Prediction of human behavior","review":"I just finished reading Science of Survival, cover to cover and really got my wits around it's content. I had some familiarity with it over the last thirty years (being a student of both Dianetics and Scientology) but I never really grasped it the way I did this time.I've noticed that some people have an almost magical quality to make things happen, while others, no matter how well founded the intent or how great the intellect, seem to struggle. This book not only addresses this issue but also provides insight into what is behind this and what can be done to improve one's journey through life, especially in dealing with both the good and the bad intentioned individuals that we all can come across.Give it a shot. I hope you get as much out of it as I did.By the way, after reading it I suggest you listen to the Science of Survival lectures that were delivered by Mr. Hubbard.

It's a must when looking to hire someone or start a relationship of any kind. There is an easy to understand chart of human behavior that makes this so easy to apply to real life situations!"},{"Title":"Science of survival: Prediction of human behavior","review":"Let's speak of the audio book first since this does not concern the content but the form of this product. The reading is too fast for any one who is not really alert in this theoretical approach. It is also totally inexpressive, in fact flat and monotonous, to the limit of humdrum and some will say sleep-inductive. We do not have any time left for breathing. Strangely enough it is the tone used by H.G. Wells in his 1936 film \\"Things To Come\\" for his futuristic messiah John Cabal in this scientific utopia in which two fathers can sacrifice their children for the scientific future to come. But at least this one is J.C. and may believe he is the voice of the supreme being that science is predicted to become soon.But that is a side remark.The whole book centers on a big chart that defines the various tone levels of an individual in 43 columns. This scale of tones goes under 0, which is death. I will neglect this beyond death situation. And it goes beyond 4.0 into levels that are said as having never been asserted or witnessed. I will neglect these states too, just as the author does practically all the time. The scale goes from 0 to 4.0, from the lowest possible tone to the highest possible tone. The higher the tone the better the subject can survive and live in our society. The median position is declared the limit between those who can live in society without endangering it over 2.0 and those who endanger themselves and society under 2.0.This is a model built by the author on the basis of absolutely no material element since the world, the real world, the one in which we live, like it or not, does not know numbers not numbered scales. That world experiences duration (but we cannot say what this world knows of itself since that world has no real mind that we know of), distances, variations in cold and heat but that world does not know seconds, minutes, hours, miles, feet, kilometres, Fahrenheit or Celsius degrees, nor as for that the angular or circular degrees. These are human inventions and have no direct reality in the real world. Anyone of course has the right to build a mental or scientific or spiritual model of that reality, that real world, but this model has no reality in itself (except in its own terms), certainly no reality in the real world. The decimal system was invented in the 17th century and the metric system was invented at the end of the 18th century. These are obvious recent inventions.If we take that tone scale as what it is, a model, then we can wonder what it represents. But beyond this question the main question concerns that 2.0 limit and the treatment of those under 2.0 repeatedly suggested, proposed or decided by the author. Psychotics are rejected as non-unenturbulatable in chapter 6. \\"Such people should be taken from society as rapidly as possible and uniformly institutionalized for here is the level of the contagion of immorality and the destruction of ethics.\\" (part 1, chapter 13) \\"Once again below 2.0 should be limited in their freedom in society. Any person from 2.0 down on the tone scale should not have in any thinking society any civil rights of any kind because by abusing those rights they bring into being arduous and strenuous laws which are oppressive to those who need no such restraints. None should be used as witnesses or jurors in courts of law since their position as regards ethics is such as to nullify the validity of any testimony they might assay or any verdict they might offer.\\" (part 1, chapter 21)I may run the risk of being called a literal man and since in part 1 chapter 26 \\"the literalness is a sign of the amount of enturbulance\\" I may be declared as being under 2.0, but I am willing to run that risk (\\"He should be shot at once.\\" Part 1, chapter 25) and I ask the question that seems obvious to any human rights defender: who decides who is under 2.0? How is that decided? When is it decided, when the subject is a child, a teenager or an adult? What appeal to what Supreme Court do such classified and rejected people have? How many people would be thrown under 2.0 and would have to be institutionalized? That's A Brave New World revisited. All the 2.0 should be sent to a locked up reservation as being unredeemable. That's eugenics or eugenism in its clearest and most absolute form. And not only physical eugenics: \\"The slime of society, the sex criminals, the political subversives, the people whose apparently rational activities are yet but the devious writhing of secret hate.\\" (part 1, chapter 13)The next remark I will make here is the heavy and repeated reference to god, or the supreme being, or to other beings of the same batch. The four dynamic of Dianetics are multiplied here to eight and the eighth one is the dynamic of \\"the supreme being, the creator, god\\" (part 1, chapter 6), The minions of the devil and the devil and his dark angels are descriptions of persons engaged on 2.0 and down activities. (part 1, chapter 24) And you should check the glossary for these supernatural beings. The fourth \\"automatic goal inherent in the plans of life\\" is \\"the supreme being.\\" (part 2, chapter 8) And this god is used to justify the eugenism in my previous remark: \\"All men are created with equal rights under the law but all men are not created with equal potential value to their fellows.\\" (part 1, chapter 20) And that encounters this other assertion: \\"The laws of man have never been able to do much to suppress the laws of God.\\" (part 1, chapter 12) Hence the conclusion that \\"man's chances of reaching god are not that good.\\" (part 2, chapter 18)Then we can start to understand what kind of metaphysics Hubbard advocates.First his definition of reality is simple: \\" The internal reality of his own existence and past and the external reality of his present time environment... to these must be added of course his future reality.\\" This reality has nothing to do with the real world, except maybe that it is a mental representation of it. That leads him to the stating that an individual has to \\"search for different viewpoints to broaden his own reality... [to] change reality.\\" A viewpoint has little to do with the real world except that it is a point from which I am looking at the real world, but the viewpoint that I build from this point of viewing is nothing but a perception, a perceptive construct and since Hubbard never wonders about what happens between the receiving of stimuli by the five senses (Hubbard states 26 channels by which a perception can be received) and the building up of the perception itself which is a mental image of what has been received and then perceived, we cannot know what the relation between the real world and the mind can be for him. In the same way he never specifies what the other two operations beyond perception, computation and imagination, really are and how they function.Second his definition of life as being the association of a theta and a MEST is not clear at all. What is a theta? It is \\"thought\\", an entity that has no material substance not any dimension of any sort. It is the exact mathematical definition of a point in geometry. This theta that is thought (but who is thinking that thought?) is associated to the material organism Matter-Energy-Space-Time to become a living organism, an organism endowed with life. MEST is of course mysterious and anyway a human construct that contains two dimensions at least that are human concepts, space and time, and even energy could be questioned, though probably less because we can easily conceive that dimension of matter that burns in the sun, that is contained in the heart of the earth and makes it liquid, that is used by plants to grow and animal organism to develop. Matter can easily be accepted though many would disagree on how to define it. That was the basic question asked by Descartes in the 17th century and after him by all scientists and philosophers. It is easy to conceive the material dimension of a piece of rock. But what is the material dimension of a religion that inspired ancient civilizations to build temples, cathedrals, synagogues, mosques, not to speak of all other monuments, pyramids and cities or great walls. These religious or other abstract thoughts were so material for the men who believed in them that they made them build monumental artefacts that are still standing. And what about the material dimension of virtual reality?But the last remark I will make for the time being and in this note is that in spite of his suggesting that everything has to be seen as a gradient, a continuous movement from one point to another, he most of the time transforms this gradient into a bipolar system of two antagonistic elements like theta and entheta, MEST and en-MEST, and so many other antagonistic pairs. His hurdy gurdy system would be interesting if it were really the taking into account of the total personalities and influences anyone around an individual may have at any time. But in fact he at once reduces it to Father and Mother. The ternary Affinity-Reality-Communication of the father and that of the mother are at once reduced to the binary opposition of enforcing it or inhibiting it, giving two types of father, dominating and nullifying. And exactly the same thing for the mother. The point is that he does not see the continuity between the authority each adult may have over the child, the love each adult may express towards the child and the nurturing each adult may assume to satisfy the wants and the needs of the child. These have nothing to do with the sex or the blood relation of the adult, especially for children who are raised and nurtured by more than two adults, a father and a mother. In fact Hubbard falls into the trap of a theory of personality, and never considers the growing pains and joys of a child from his traumatic birth to his adult age.And of course, the whole discourse is invested in language, the whole auditing procedure is invested in and performed with language, the whole conception of the human being is founded on the triad affinity-reality-communication and for human beings communication is primarily linguistic, but never Hubbard analyzes the way language works and the way language both informs and inspires the human mind. It is true that his conception of the mind, analytical or reactive, is nothing but a bank, a place in the psyche of the person where things are sorted out and classified by type and time and managed by a file clerk. The term computation is never explored. That is a lot of non-specified nor explored domains.I will overlook the grossly anti-communist discourse that is only paralleled by the rejection of all subversives, and you will be happy to know that the fascists like Hitler are only one notch higher than these, but all under 2.0. This is typical Cold War rhetoric and today that has no value whatsoever anymore.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Science of survival: Prediction of human behavior","review":"I have never ordered anything online from this website before.

Thanks for quality service, which is greatly lacking now a days."},{"Title":"Science of survival: Prediction of human behavior","review":"I actually read this book for the first time many years ago. In fact - it was when my daughter was very young - so say 22 years ago. I liked it - and remember getting some good information from it; but before reading it again recently I had no idea just how much I got out of it!I bring up my daughter because I'm very proud of her --- she never went through things like the \\"Terrible Twos\\" - and those horrible moments I've heard and seen so much of --- the \\"generation gap\\" where it seems like parents and kids speak different languages and tend to simply fight a lot. Then there are the infamous \\"rebellion years\\" that \\"all kids go through\\". My daughter never had any of those periods that drove some of my friends crazy - and worse, having their kids end up on drugs - or worse. I just put it off to - who knows..... she was special? I did something right maybe?Well - what I realized when I reread the book was that as she was growing up I used a LOT of the information I got from Science of Survival. Believe me, I didn't get the whole book when I first read it. But, one of the key factors I got was that you never, never, never try to get through to someone or have a sane conversation with anyone who's \\"dramatizing\\" and as you'll read in the book - low on the Tone Scale. If a person is upset -- (simple rule of thumb) you won't get anywhere! So, I actually talked to my daughter only when she was herself - not running around, screaming, throwing tantrums, etc. It's obvious you're not talking to her --- she's too wrapped up in some upset. Those things did happen of course. But once I started using this data, it was very rare - and then there were none. She knew from our conversations when she was herself that nothing good comes of trying to have a conversation when either one of us is upset or mad or crying or whatever. So, if that happened I'd remind her of that and let her know I was there for her when she came out of it. It was miraculous!Also - a very simple but very powerful thing I also learned from this book is that you never never never validate those times when a child (or adult for that matter!!) is upset. Why? because then becoming upset means you'll get validation - or candy - or an OK to watch TV - or a new bike --- whatever! My daughter knew that she wouldn't get anything if she threw a tantrum or even \\"demanded\\" it in some misemotional way. But, man she was well rewarded when she would sit down with me and just talk about whatver it was she wanted. Was our relationship all a bed of roses??? No - but I'm telling you, I couldn't ask or hope for a better relationship with my daughter.So - long story; but when you find some bit of information that's that simple, and that powerful - you have to tell others. Do I recommend the book? Absolutely! But one thing -- there's a LOT of information in the book. I tend to just grab a few points of things that make sense to me and then use them. Boy did I get the right points - and somehow used them correctly."},{"Title":"Science of survival: Prediction of human behavior","review":"As there is so much misinformation about Scientology (read the one and two star reviews for a real laugh) I wanted to write a brief book review. Unlike other low star reviewers who complain about the author, I will actually use the book:First off, this new edition now has larger print and brighter paper for us old guys who need to read with bifocals. And the glossary and defined words are all in the back rather than as footnotes, which reduces the clutter. Good job on that.What's not changed is the original premise of Hubbard's self-help books: that something can be done about the human mind and that anyone can use these data without a psych degree. In fact the book is subtitled The Prediction of Human Behavior and it certainly does that.The acknowledgement page was sobering: \\"To 50,000 years of thinking men, without whose work Dianetics could never have been formulated -- the credit is theirs, not mine -- LRH\\".The book is divided into two \\"Books\\". Book One The Dynamics of Behavior is based on a fold-out chart.Each chapter summarizes and expands on the info on each column of this chart. Example: Column P \\"Sexual Behavior and Attitude Toward's Children\\" is then followed with a Chapter of the same name. What makes kids tick? How is your emotional reaction to sex talk an indicator of future behavior?Column W, \\"Persistence on a Given Course\\" is followed with the chapter of the same name. Are you persistent or do you give up on your goals easily? Especially useful for me was the chapter \\"Method Used by Subject to Handle Others\\".Book Two gets into handling people who want help with Dianetics, what a practicioner needs to watch for and so on. Book Two is especially useful to those who have already read the Dianetics book and want more info on helping others.Even here, you can glean data that helps you with employees, friends, smart guys, shy girls, etc., etc.An expanded index, glossary and appendix section rounds out its 679 Pages!You could read the whole book or jump around to areas where you may need help or are simply curious.

The success is ongoing. Its success can be seen in every one who has read this book; how are their interaction as theta with MEST, the command over their environment and how do they handle another individual. The Hubbard Chart of Human Evaluation provided a complete description of the behavior patterns of an individual at any given emotion. By knowing a few characteristics of a person, I have learned to know their entire personality, behavioral pattern and character.This book has taught me the dynamics of human behavior I may have never learned in my entire life. It clearly teaches the prediction of human behavior that is beneficial for survival for my self and others. The Tone Scale in The Hubbard Chart of Human Evaluation is a great tool not only for auditors but for individuals in the position of power of hiring personnel, in relationships, in schools dealing with scholars from kindergarten to college, a tool that helps me or any single person for that matter choose a lover by knowing their tone level and many, many more fields of life. It has helped me in dealing with my family and friends in my personal life by understanding their Tone Level and lowering or increasing mine. Nothing in my previous scholastic studies compares to knowing the human behavior as in The Tone Scale of the Chart of Human Evaluation. A world of thanks to LRH is not even sufficient. This is just Book One.Book Two covers Dianetic Processing and again how much time do I have to write what I have learned about Dianetic Processing. Before my course on Science of Survival I had completed Dianetics and now I feel I am complete. Put together, Dianetics and Science of Survival now makes sense. IT MAKES SENSE TO ME.What can I say about Dianetic Processing?After learning new types of processing such as Straight Memory and Lock Scanning in this book, I ask my self, where is the end of auditing in Dianetics? There is an end I think if one is Clear. However, that would not be an absolute end of processing. As per LRH, there are no absolutes in Dianetic Processing, i.e., infinity-valued logic, I feel there is no absolute end to the success for survival for any human being, just success and greater success, all to conquer, nothing to lose. What more do we want? Do we want to become a millionaire but live a life with full of enturbulated theta and not know Dianetics? That is not success, but accessorized success only in the eyes of another enturbulated theta.After the completion of Science of Survival course, I have had to kick myself in my head to jump start my goals. I have not worked as hard as I should have on goals when I completed Dianetics. My goal is to advocate the \\"miracles of LRH technology\\" as I personally can witness these miracles and to free as many thetas as possible for total spiritual freedom.I am hoping to post a blog on the internet and write a review on this book on Amazom.com and Google.What can I say about my completion on the course Science of Survival? This page only summarized my 15 percent of my success.

Also, written at a time when he was exceptionally lucid and sane, it actually makes sense! The tone scale is something that Hubbard developed which I think is a useful and informative way of understanding human behavior - it's not the only tool I use but to ignore the information in this book because of its associations would be a shame.(I'd read it with a dictionary though, merely because L.

A book really worth reading on this subject."},{"Title":"Collie's Captivity in the Monarchy of the Kingdom's Realm","review":"\\"Collie's Captivity\\" is an ambitious novel. Like many an ambitious novel, it has flaws but still very readable.The plot is rather Kafka-esque; Collie, a young girl, is being held in a mysterious Realm, held for a crime she did not do. The Realm has its own customs and rules, completely foreign to an American. Collie is given prisoner-of-war treatment --but not of the Geneva Convention variety. Her treatment is coldly calculated to break down her personality by deprivation and depersonalization.The flaws with the novel are there is a shift in point of view between what Collie sees and the voice that watches the action over the people deciding Collie's fate. When you are with Collie in her cell, it's like reading Kafka; with the people of the Realm or the President, it's like reading a different author. The story is ambitious in that it definitely will take place over a number of volumes. O'Loughlin has a lot of ideas and this story is clearly bigger than one novel can contain. If this is to become a trilogy or tetrology of books, the ideas can be treated with space and leisure to develop. This is more than one book can handle, right now.I think most readers would find this a very engaging and readable story. I was hoping for a more subtle exposition of the Realm but this may reflect my own taste in literature. If you liked Margaret Atwood's \\"A Handmaid's Tale\\" you might really enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Collie's Captivity in the Monarchy of the Kingdom's Realm","review":"As a husband and wife reading team, we don't always agree on how to rate the books we read, but this one was a no-brainer: It's five stars all the way.We usually take turns reading a chapter or two a night; it's our way of relaxing after hard days at DMV where we work ... and you all know what a hectic place the Dept. of Motor Vehicles in California is like!Anyway, this book was so captivating that we found ourselves reading five or six chapters a night; hurrying through dinner to do so. We couldn't wait to see the evolution of Collie's mind processes and how she handled this very difficult situaiton she's placed in.What a girl! What a book! This is one you just gotta read!"},{"Title":"Collie's Captivity in the Monarchy of the Kingdom's Realm","review":"Unique means \\"one of a kind\\" and that's what this book is. I've never read anything like it. The plot and the characters are all captivating originals.This is the hardest review I've ever written, so my best solution is to keep it simple and let professional reviewers like Erica Sorocco (review below) do all the necessary brainwork to do justice to this book. One of the reasons it's hard for me to review is that I was determined to give it a four-star because of a few formatting and other minor errors, but it had so many other redeeming qualities, it became five-star before I ended the first chapter.John Michael O'Loughlin's story is very creative and the way he masters the storytelling art to capture young Collie's emotions, her resiliancy in the face of death, and the manipulative brainwashing forced on her is amazing. I'm in awe of the young heroine's strength and wisdom. At first I thought she was too good to be true (for her age), but the perfection with which this author paces her journey (and thought processes) through the ordeal made her every thought and action believable.Reading COLLIE'S CAPTIVITY is an intense journey where many characters change along the way and the twists and turns can never be anticipated. Great!I was a bit let down by the ending, but then I realized this paves the way for a sequel. ... THIS BOOK SCREAMS FOR A SEQUEL and I can't wait to read it.Many people say certain books would make great movies, and I say the same, but the psychological depth of this book would make a magnificent Oscar-winning movie. I can picture someone with the acting skills of Dakota Fanning playing the part of 15-year-old Collie, and Dakota would be about the right age when this could premiere as a movie).If any of Amazon reviewers or friends have Hollywood connections, please point this book out to them. I'm certain if the right person reads it, they'll recognize HIGH CONCEPT when they see it. (And NO, I do not know the author, but I'm grateful to him for finding me on the Internet and sending me a copy of this profound book; otherwise I would have missed a reading adventure of a lifetime. Thanks, Mr. O'Loughlin.)"},{"Title":"Collie's Captivity in the Monarchy of the Kingdom's Realm","review":"Colleen Lee \\"Collie\\" Knight, thought that she was on a glamorous, foreign land vacation that would bring her romance, and possibly a few new trinkets to bring home to her friends and family. The last thing she expects is to be framed by enemies of the United States for a crime that she didn't commit. But that's exactly what happens during this overseas adventure, and suddenly the young high school student is on trial in a foreign land, and there's nothing she can do to stop it. Now, if she's found guilty of said crime, Collie will be blindfolded, and left to stand in front of the military firing squad of the Monarchy of The Kingdom's Realm - a nightmare for an adult, let alone a teenage girl. The only thing that Collie can hope for is that her friends, family, and the President of the United States - Virginia Watker - can rally up enough support, and save Collie from her tragic demise. Otherwise, the Monarchy of the Kingdom's Realm will win, and leave America void of one more innocent.John Michael O'Loughlin is a creative writer, for he combines fantastical elements mixed with a brief mystery, as well as otherworld storylines. The characters he creates are likable, and easy to feel for, while the tyrants weaved into the story are easy to despise. The fact that O'Loughlin brings out so much raw emotion in the reader, regarding his characters, is a very important quality, and makes the novel that much more interesting. A combination of the Kate Beckinsale/Claire Danes flick \\"Brokedown Palace\\" and Salinger's THE CATCHER IN THE RYE.

It delighted me when she turned out to be quite resourceful on her own.Excellent, creative plot! Fine writer! I hope he writes more ... and soon."},{"Title":"Collie's Captivity in the Monarchy of the Kingdom's Realm","review":"Do you remember that episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation where Wesley Crusher was sentenced to die for some comical offense (I think it was walking on the grass) on some alien planet? This novel is sort of like that, except this time around you actually want the life of the \\"criminal\\" to be spared (oh, how I begged and pleaded for Wesley's execution). Collie is a fifteen year old girl studying in a foreign country (the Monarchy of the Realm) who makes the youthful mistake of accompanying her boyfriend onto the palace grounds to snap a few pictures of the royal family. She knew it was wrong, but she did it anyway. What she didn't know is that this mistake would win her an appointment with a firing squad in nine months time. At 15, Collie is an adult in the eyes of the Realm. Still, the head of the Grand Council seems willing to overlook the most serious charge and simply exile Collie from the realm - until, that is, Colonel Douglas Ira inserts himself into the proceedings. The vehemently anti-American colonel sees Collie as a pawn he can exploit to shatter any hope of a future Realm-American alliance and boost his own career at the same time. Lost and alone in this foreign land, with no lawyer to guide her, Collie quickly finds herself sentenced to the worst of fates.Even with a furious American public decrying the Realm's barbarity and the American President desperately pursuing any and all courses to secure Collie's release, Collie's Captivity in the Monarchy of the Realm is no political thriller. John Michael O'Loughlin speaks principally to the heart and soul of the reader, as he explores America's attempts to understand the foreign Realm culture, Collie's attempts to come to terms with her unfortunate and completely unexpected place in life, and the reaction of Realm society to Collie's experience in captivity. As events progress, the dichotomy between right and wrong (good and evil) - the lines of which were drawn emphatically in the beginning - become blurred as Collie proves her inner strength and fortitude in the face of torturous conditions, wins over the hearts of those responsible for her care in prison, and begins to actually embrace aspects of Realm culture. Privately, she begins to come to terms with her impending death, drawing on a number of wonderful memories of her family and friends and seeking forgiveness for the wrongs she has done. As her conditions radically change for the better, she finds a great deal of happiness and sheds herself of all regrets.Even though she is happy and no longer alone, she is still fated to die - and that only makes things even more confusing to the American administration working to win her release. With the help of an expert on the Realm, the American President and her advisors are given an intensive course on intercultural relations. While no one outside Realm culture could truly understand its many facets, we all begin to see how these very different peoples can view and interpret something so very differently than we can - and that this does not make them bad people. As the power conclave in the Oval Office offers up different strategies for saving Collie's life, it becomes clear that the only hope for the solution everyone wants is the establishment of some kind of productive dialogue between two cultures that distrust one another because no bridge of understanding has ever been forged between them.I was really quite captivated by this novel. While it does tend to be over-written in places and is more than a tad melodramatic and idyllic, the story truly touches your heart on numerous occasions. Collie could not be a more lovable young lady, and the thought of her looming execution is too tragic to even contemplate. The story begs all kinds of important questions: When is the individual more valuable than the group? Is one human life worth going to war over? How can two cultures who see life so differently come together to find common ground? Additionally, the reader can't help but put himself in Collie's place, wondering if he could have shown even an ounce of the fortitude and moral wisdom of Collie if put in her extremely difficult situation. As O'Loughlin shows us, one person can make a huge difference in the world.Readers should be aware going in that this is the first book in a series, so you won't find ultimate closure in the final pages of this first entry. You will, however, find much food for thought and get to know a truly inspiring young lady whose incredible aura of love and goodness cannot help but affect you and your own viewpoint on life."},{"Title":"Collie's Captivity in the Monarchy of the Kingdom's Realm","review":"Fifteen year old Colleen Leah Knight and her boyfriend have journeyed to the Kingdom of the Realm with their school to learn about this fascinating country and gain respect for its history and traditions. However, their joyous sojourn soon turns into a dreadful dirge as Colleen commits a misdemeanor according to Realm law and is sentenced to die within a few months before a firing squad. Judged as an adult by Realm standards, Americans are outraged since they still consider Collie to be a child and feel that her crime is minor and certainly not worthy of the weighty penalty assigned to it. Will America be able to save her wayward child? Will Collie be able to withstand the mental anguish inflicted by the hateful Colonel Ira, the man who wishes to break her spirit before the entire world? Will she remain strong and independent and thus through her honorable conduct teach those of the Realm to respect American culture? Or will she, as the Colonel hopes, crumble before his mental assault and reveal her repelling weakness to the world?Although I am a highly finicky person, especially when it comes to literary qualities, I was unable to find even one fault in this beautiful tale. I don't often call a novel beautiful; to be quite honest few deserve the title. So, it is not lightly that I complement this work. This is not, like so many modern titles, junk food fiction. Although there are so many wondrous aspects of this tale, including good characterization and a strong solid plot, the main quality that grasped my attention and endowed this novel with a \\"beautiful\\" aura was the sheer magnitude of poignancy and deep contemplation of those things which truly matter. Through Collie's struggles and emotional dilemmas the author reveals to us, in relatively simple words, such profound and life altering decisions as to impart the reader with a deeper appreciation for God and man. This is truly one of those extremely rare novels that changes the reader for the good. Often, as I read of Collie's difficulties, and her decisions, I found myself admiring her good qualities and trying to incorporate them into my life. The values that the author elevated were all noble and righteous and bestowed on the entranced reader an aura of contentment and the continual effort to improve upon one's weakness and do good not for the benefit of self but for others and for God. After having indulged, and continuing to indulge in overtly bilious and generally depressing horror novels, I found this tale to be enjoyably light hearted and cheerful in that the author praised good values, yet suitably serious and heart wrenching at the same time. I am amazed at such talent to be able to impart such dire circumstances and yet breathe hope into the tale simultaneously. This aspect alone elevates this novel to the level of the classics.The characters are truly memorable and their epic emotions and inner struggles were revealed so thoroughly that I could practically feel their emotions flowing off the pages and into my heart. I wept with Collie and rejoiced alongside her. The author was able to truly capture the essence of his character and bring that character to life. I never felt as though an entertaining story were being presented for my satisfaction. Rather, I felt as though Collie were sitting across the table from me, relating her story from her heart, revealing to me the very essence of her being. Not only was this achieved with Collie, the main character, but every character was thoroughly brought to life. Their emotions were real and their personalities dynamic. Even the cruel hearted villain, Colonel Ira, was well detailed and his emotions and decisions fully revealed to the reader.The plot was highly original and distinctly appealing. I was mesmerized by the Realm and its fascinating culture. Each element of the tale wove together to create a flawless plot that never proved predictable. The originality, combined with the relevant themes and expert characterization, enabled me to maintain my unfaltering interest in the tale. Throughout the unfolding drama, the plot gained creativity, depth, and complexity, elevating this far above regular modern novels into the category of a classic.The tale concludes before the date of Collie's execution with the female president, Virginia Watker, making a special visit to the Realm to plead for her comrade Collie's reprieve. The outcome of this essential meeting concerning whether or not Collie shall be spared from death is not revealed in the conclusion of this novel. Rather, the tale ends leaving the reader breathless, desperately wanting more. Originally I was disappointed since I desperately wanted to discover what fate would befall Collie and whether Virginia Watker's debate with the Realm would reach any significant conclusion. However, my despair was soon turned to joy when I discovered that a sequel will be published in the winter of 2008. Although this is an awfully long time to keep the reader in suspense, I feel confidant that I shall still remember Collie and her predicament despite the passage of time; her character and story left such an indelible mark on my mind that I am certain I shall never forget her. Until the winter of 2008, I will eagerly await the conclusion of the tale and be certain to grab a copy the minute one is available.The writing style was simple, yet elegant as it effortlessly divulged epic emotions and profound wisdom. Collie's voice transcended the barriers of imagination and spoke directly to the heart in her forthright honest way. The only problem I detected was several misspellings and a few grammar errors that I would have expected an editor, or any spell check program, to have corrected. Still, this complaint is minute and will only prove irritating to the highly finicky.To conclude, having indulged in copious piles of books over the year of 2006, I remember few of them. Some, are shadowy memories, some I discover laying about the house, recognize the cover and remember having read it but can gain no insight as to what the story was about, others I have a lingering memory of being interested in but the feeling invoked remains neutral. Few from this pile of books, even those I still remember in-depth, have effected a personality change or even made me think deeply. This novel, however, is the shinning paragon that easily elevates itself above the other novels, forever lingering in my memory and leaving an essence of something special. The characters are not fictitious inventions to me rather, they live on, even after the story has concluded bestowing their wisdom and benevolence on me. Truly, I shall never forget this novel. I feel that this is a story that should be read by everyone for not only is it a perfect example of literature at its finest, but its lessons are truly beautiful and profound.To all my readers, goodbye from Ravenova and have a wonderful 2007.-------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"Collie's Captivity in the Monarchy of the Kingdom's Realm","review":"This was an interesting book with an ending I would not have predicted. In reading it at a time an American and Italian are wrongly imprisoned in Italy, and many are imprisoned in Iran, this story struck my emotions in a deep way. It makes one re-think travel to other countries where justice systems and cultures differ, and drives home the idea that any traveler's worst nightmare would be dealing with a justice system in a foreign country, particularly when one is innocent."},{"Title":"Collie's Captivity in the Monarchy of the Kingdom's Realm","review":"Colleen Lee \\"Collie\\" Knight was thrilled to have been accepted as a ninth-grade high school student by an international school in a land far across the ocean. The first few months were exciting for her and her friends as they explored this new unfamiliar land of unusual customs and traditions. However, when Collie trespasses on the Royal Family's Palace Grounds so she can get a good photo of the handsome young Crown Prince of the Realm, she suddenly finds herself under arrest and facing trumped-up charges of spying, cleverly framed by enemies of America who hope to turn her harmless offense into a reason to drive a wedge between their Kingdom and the USA.On trial for spying and facing a sentence of death by firing squad if convicted, Collie fears for her future and what her fate will be in captivity, where so many hands seem to be against her and she feels so alone and vulnerable. Her family and friends back in America join forces with all those well-wishers who are familiar with their fifteen year old girl's plight and want her freed from her unjust imprisonment. United as seldom before, American citizens stand solidly behind their nation's first woman President as she weighs all available options in freeing this innocent young American teen locked up abroad and at risk of never being allowed to return to her home and family in Texas.Published in 2004, \\"Collie's Captivity in the Monarchy of the Kingdom's Realm\\" foreshadows many of the elements in several recent true-life incidents involving the unjust arrest, trial, and captivity of young American foreign exchange students overseas.CAUTION: \\"Collie's Captivity....\\" contains mature subject matter written for teens and young adults. It is far too intense for most readers under thirteen years of age."},{"Title":"Collie's Captivity in the Monarchy of the Kingdom's Realm","review":"This book is brilliant.It is not like any other novel I've ever read.Do not misjudge or underestimate repetitive phrases which seem, at first look, to be children's eternal mantras, \\"... always and always and forever and ever.\\"The sensitivity and emotional expansiveness in this novel could almost be called entrapment (meant in a complimentary way here).In parts, the narrative was so involving and captivating it became unsettling. Yet, each time I began to edge away, needing to escape the depth of the book, feeling it was almost going too far into a type of fanaticism, author John Michael O'Loughlin brought an artfully induced intensity into an unexpected, uncannily perfect catharsis. Each time my life routine necessities caused a halt to reading, I found that I very much wanted to move onward in the story, at my next opportunity. Wide-eyed, sometimes after a necessary pause for a psyche regrouping, I continued my return to the captivity in the pages of Collie's story in the Realm.The style of composition of this novel gave a molasses-rich, slow and sensual evolution of characters and plot, exposing either a confidence in the author of the natural intrigue in the nuances of the contrasting cultures he was etching; or exposing a flow sourcing from so deeply within his soul, his writing was compelled through him from a state of living the story as it wrote itself through, of, and for him.As in the case of choosing either Chocolate or Vanilla, possibly this is a case of choosing both and \\"having it all,\\" the satisfying marbling of dark and light.As I burrowed through this book, I began to reserve judgment, to stop the normal habit of attempting to peg philosophical underpinnings or to categorize. This was an original. Yet, it was not like the \\"original\\" or avant-garde offerings of \\"literary masters\\" who were obviously trying to do something \\"experimental\\" (in which case they too often bored or depressed the heck out of sane readers). This novel was naturally, unadulteratedly original, which is something rarely found these days.I would say it took great courage to write this book in this style. Yet, I sense that the author was soul driven to such a degree that he couldn't have avoided writing this work exactly as he did. So, in a sense, the motivation should probably be termed an expression of pure passion, rather than a culmination of courage. Yet, to realize, as O'Laughlin must have, how unique and deeply sensitive this book was, and to go ahead and put it out to the public himself, to allow it to draw whatever it would draw from our often cruel varieties of human cultures, in this time and space ... That may have been soul driven, but it also took a special type of courage, which might require daily renewal.From the first page, I was able to easily get into the story, which is the most important requirement of fiction for me. O'Loughlin created immediate sympathy for Collie at the opening of her trial, especially with her stance, and the long hairs in front of her bowed face. She endeared herself further when she asked for a chair, then for rest and food, impressing both the Leader of the Grand Council (and the reader) with her natural wisdom.The first scene involving the female US president was engrossing, with the discussion of the gravity of Collie's situation, and the interesting cultural differences between a future version of our good ole USA, and The \\"Realm.\\"Collie's responses were creative in a natural way, as well as believable. It amazed me that a male author in his 50's could see and feel so well through a 15-year-old girl's eyes, one who would be a good example for any young person who reads this book.I enjoyed the fact that this story delved more deeply into the feelings and responses of the main character, Collie, than many \\"quick fix\\" types of novels. Understandably, some professionals in the industry are leery of that type of style. For me, and I believe for a large majority of other readers who regularly buy books, this intensity of emotional insight is mesmerizing when done right, which O'Loughlin did. This being a mesmerizing tale with lots of food for thought, the thoughtful pacing fit. This is one of those stories with so much depth one almost feels as if it were actually happening ... somewhere.The narrative style was unique, and it worked. The syntax had its own flow. This story was not simple. It was a deceivingly complex, sophisticated tale with nearly uncanny depth.O'Loughlin used an Omniscient Narrator point-of-view (as opposed to First Person Narrative or a Limited Third Person Observer). In the Omniscient style the author allows the reader into the minds/thoughts of more than one character, to relative degrees (in the more commonly used Limited Observer only the mind of one of the characters is exposed to the reader through the narrator).It appeared to me that the author was writing a psychological analysis of Good and Evil as either develops, grows, and is fed in the mind through each choice which we make during the course of each day of our lives. Of course, in Collie's position, the choices were elevated to a trial by fire level. I was impressed with the use of past memories in Collie's mind as a way to deal with her death sentence.Colonel Douglas Ira was definitely a villain of the first water. I was interested in the realistic way Frank's senses of him fluctuated in their scene. And the scene of the colonel \\"talking\\" to Frank after Frank was gone was eerily insightful.This was an intriguing book on a psychological level, as well as philosophical and cultural. As I continued reading, I sensed that this could \\"fill the bill\\" of a literary work for a sophisticated adult readership, as well as a book which young adults could enjoy and benefit from. The author may have originally written this book for a teen audience, but it might market even better in adult fiction.After reading into chapter 4 (and having recalled that O'Loughlin earned a degree in history) I became curious about how he inserted two countries into \\"our\\" history which didn't and do not exist... Made me wonder if the author had an alternate reality thing going. Prior to ch 4, I thought the Realm might have been a projected new name for the UK in 2019, and that the Totalitarian Rule was symbolic for countries which have that type of government. O'Loughlin's knowledge of history plotted into a future-based story was well done, yet not over detailed for those readers (like me) who don't have an extensive \\"front\\" memory of volumes of historic fact.The plot evolved into political machinations of various styles of government, which were made very interesting. The scene of Colonel Ira's family interaction was telling. He grew more and more into a fascinating fictional character, a seemingly putrid person with a twisted soul, due partially if not wholly to high-handed, sadly ignorant prejudice.Half through the book I began feeling that dreaded concern that when I finished it, it would be one of those rare novels which causes a grieving process at its conclusion. It became clear at about that half-way point, that the uncommonly used Omniscient Observer technique was necessary for what O'Loughlin was attempting (consciously or not). I could especially see this after I read the scene \\"inside\\" the dog, Lady's, mind as she was letting go of her life.I was surprised at first that Lady could \\"smell\\" a spirit, and the way the author described Lady's perception of smell felt amazingly realistic. Like many others, I've been very close to animals and pets, enough to believe I can sense their unique perspective, feelings, and thoughts. What surprised me about the concept of a dog being able to smell a spirit was that, as a parapsychologist, I sense \\"Spirit\\" presence here to be more based in pure, unseen light, rather than energy or matter based, which would mean that smell wouldn't exist in their \\"patterns.\\" Yet, the more I thought about it, the way O'Loughlin described that scene was effective, sensitive, touching, and felt absolutely right for this story.As I read, the emotional essence surged from the opening scene continued to become more and more engaging. The style was satisfyingly multifaceted, giving multiple perspectives and a variety of deep, rich moods. As I continued, I began feeling more like I was melting into the words instead of \\"merely\\" reading.John Michael O'Loughlin is definitely a highly unique, storyteller artist.Sometimes when authors \\"try\\" to be unique or experimental in technique when writing a novel, I feel, as a reader, like I'm trying to get into the mental chaos of an insane mind. Painful. Not fun. Definitely not entertaining. Probably not enlightening either, in many cases.James Joyce's Ulysses felt that way to me. I could never get past the first few sentences. They just made no sense. However, one day I might mature to the point of realizing that my prejudice there was off base and I missed something great. Bless you, Mr. Joyce! And, forgive me for I may have sinned! I don't like to misjudge or underestimate, so one day I will try Joyce's Ulysses again.It's clear that O'Loughlin was not \\"trying\\" to do anything. He was flowing with his source of creativity, which to me is a Right-Brain-based process, and which is something authors seem to me to do to varying degrees. This man is definitely a master at it. Yet, its also appears that he \\"planed\\" (Left Brain, more conscious, logical processes, and not a bad thing, either) some of the thematic essence and overall direction and machination.It felt almost a crime to attempt to analyze this work, since it was so naturally cohesive and emotionally potent.It was surprising to me that the author was able to include long scenes of prayer without seeming to be preaching or selling religion, which would put off many readers, me included. Those scenes merely seemed to be a natural, non-agenda, non-generic type of description of how many, if not most people pray privately, from whatever religious or non-religious backgrounds.This is a powerful winner of a book. O'Loughlin was actually able to make bearable the very difficult situation of Collie in her \\"new\\" cell of dungeon proportions, and Col. Ira's hellish visits. Ultimately this situation transformed as cathartic and strength inducing. The \\"use\\" of Ira's young daughter and son, Ariel and Andrew, though it seemed genuinely simple and direct, also felt subtly complex, sophisticated, and warmly effectively.The redemption factors in this novel were brilliant and wholly believable, and the Imprinting concepts were fascinating as explained by the Realm specialist, Dr. Adrian Everly to the president's group. O'Loughlin has accomplished so much in this work, and the coming sequels will be awaited by many with deep anticipation.At the end of this first novel in a likely long and prosperous series, you'll will have transported beyond fandom, into the realm of O'Loughlin's family spirit.If a very wise editor at a major NYC publishing house were to read through this novel slowly, thoughtfully, and thoroughly, without preconceived notions, without prejudice, without jumping to conclusions or too quickly trying to \\"peg\\" or \\"package\\" it; he/she would see what it is and that it doesn't need internal editing. Nor is it \\"just a...\\"In Awe,Linda G. ShelnuttP.S. Added 6/27/06: I had meant to compliment the other reviewers on this page, including the author himself, who gave a perfect synopsis. Betty Dravis wonderful review posted 6/27/06 reminded me of my manners. Yes, Erika Sorocco's reviews are very professional, as are those fom Ms. Dravis, and Billie Jean's was especially endearing to me. I enjoyed and agreed with every rave review on this novel so far. It's heart warming to see a worthy author receive this kind of support. I also do not know this author, and received his book from his sending it to me based on the types of books I've reviewed (though I'm not a professional reviewer). May you receive many more raves, Mr. O'Loughlin!"},{"Title":"Values Matter Most: How Republicans, or Democrats, or a Third Party Can Win and Renew the American Way of Life","review":"Wattenberg - a proud conservative Democrat and often independent centrist - believes that his party must &quot;come home&quot; to the responsibility era. I agree with him on this issue, but on some, he is dead wrong. He overstates the size of the &quot;welfare state&quot; we have - in fact, it is rather small when compared to those of other nations. He bashes Affirmative Action a little too much. He often sides with the GOP in some of the &quot;culture wars&quot; over immigrants and other issues.Yet, to his credit, the author sounds the tone of the conservative Reagan Democrats rather well.Wattenberg did a good job here in that area, despite the fact that I may disagree with him on some issues, as a die hard New Deal Democrat. Yet, regardless, this book is a great read for anyone."},{"Title":"Values Matter Most: How Republicans, or Democrats, or a Third Party Can Win and Renew the American Way of Life","review":"Values has the dominant role in public debate in the way that government management of the economy once did. While the debate over national planning has largely been settled (less is more), the debate over national values is in many ways just beginning. It is here that Mr. Wattenberg takes a fresh an intriguing perspective. For many years, the Democrats have been popularly potrayed by their critics as the party that condones immoral behavior, whether that be Hollywood violence or single moms or open homosexuality. This doesn't appeal to most Americans but what has kept them politically vialable has been their second image as the party that's on the side of working class dads and soccer moms; the party that in the words of Al Gore &quot;fights for them.&quot; The Republicans, it would seem, would have an opening on the values front since most Americans like their stance on such issues as crime, welfare, and affirmative action. But their popularity on these issues is tempered by a deep suspicion front most swing voters. They see the GOP as either a trojan horse for race-baiting and wrath-of-God conservatives or a money machine for selfish businessmen. In this sense, the party of Lincoln suffers a severe credibility gap. Wattenberg understands what each party is doing wrong in the values debate and offers practical solutions to getting the debate on the side of the American electorate. The 2000 election will offer a clue to which party can win the first round of the values fight."},{"Title":"Values Matter Most: How Republicans, or Democrats, or a Third Party Can Win and Renew the American Way of Life","review":"Looking for some good empirical data on the meaning of values in leadership led me to \\"Values matter most.\\" This is an excellent analysis of what is \\"right\\" about America, and follows on Wattenberg's very good earlier work, \\"The good news is that the bad news is wrong.\\" That earlier title is self-explanatory and sets the stage for \\"Values\\".Wattenberg, a Johnson staffer turned Reagan Democrat, hosts a PBS show, often geared to this basic theme. And his premise is this: Look beneath the conventional wisdom, the punditry, and the media hype and find that America works pretty well if not very well. While many people think that America is declining in status, prosperity, or value, the underlying conditions, trends and facts are much more positive. Yes, some social behaviors and standards are declining, but these are areas where \\"values matter most\\" and attention to values first, money or politics second, can drive a positive agenda for any political party. Key aspects of America's welfare -- education, crime, health, family and income support -- require attention, but not necessarily (significant) infusions of cash. \\"Family\\" values -- stable marriage, a working parent, supervised and loved children, parental support of education, safe streets, and some sense of discipline and duty -- are an integral part of the analysis. Attend to and enhance the social fabric.Wattenberg blends a smooth, witty style with substantial and substantive data to make his point, without being preachy, even if he does at times come across as a bit \\"grandfatherly\\". Grant him that and check out this book."},{"Title":"Murder for Halloween: Tales of Suspense","review":"This is a really good anthology filled with both ghost and vampire stories for the horror buffs as well asmurder mystery stories for the detective buffs, all centered around Halloween.Being a student of classical mythology, my favorite story in the book was The Lemures by Steven Saylor, a verycool ghost story set in ancient Rome.The Adventures of the Dead Cat by Ellery Queen and Theft of the Halloween Pumpkin by Ed Hoch are both light-hearted, amusing non-supernatural tales that give you a decent, Halloween-flavored laugh.The Odstock Curse by Peter Lovesey is a great dark, gothic tale. And of course, The Black Cat by Poe andWalpurgis Night (also called Dracula's Guest) by Bram Stoker are classic gothic spook tales.Deceptions by Marcia Muller is a modern atmospheric murder mystery.The Cloak by Robert Bloch and Yesterday's Witch by Gahan Wilson are both decent little supernatural stories,the first about a cursed costume and the second about the little old lady at the end of the block that allthe kids are scared of. Is she really a Witch?Night of the Goblin by Talmage Powell is a decent story of revenge with candy.I am not usually a fan of evil children stories, but Trick or Treat by Judith Garner was a disturbing shockerthat will have you thinking twice about denying children their treat.The book also includes a novelette by Peter Sraub called Pork Pie Hat, about the boyhood adventures of a jazzmusician, which although set during the Halloween season, is more about racism than ghosts. It's a bitconfusing, but overall, has some spooky scenes.The entire book is well worth the price. If you love a good mystery story, or even if you just love Halloween,get it."},{"Title":"Murder for Halloween: Tales of Suspense","review":"A GREAT COLLECTION WITH GREAT WRITERS AND OUTSTANDING STORIES, IF YOU LIKE CLASSIC STRAUB OR KING YOU WILL LOVE THIS ONE, A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!A+A+A+A+A+A+ 5 STARS"},{"Title":"The Girl with the Golden Bouffant: An Original Jane Bond Parody","review":"I am a huge Mabel Maney fan, but I was disappointed in this book. There's no light hearted romance in this book--just endless inventories of horrible 1950s pop culture items, and tiresome characters beating each other up. Jane spends the entire book in drag with a glued-on unibrow. Way too much of the book is about Cedric and his unappealing love interest. I kept waiting to be entertained and charmed, as I inevitably am by Maney, and instead I felt just slightly ill. Read the Nancy Clue books or the original Jane Bond parody, but borrow this one from someone who will take it back."},{"Title":"The Girl with the Golden Bouffant: An Original Jane Bond Parody","review":"Mabel Maney is in cahoots with her reader and trusts them to get the jokes, and this James Bond parody abounds with them. She's a hugely intelligent writer, but don't let that stop you. There's a gem lurking in every sentence--her writing bears close inspection. Maney's sly social commentary sneaks up on you, and her own sense of laughter is infectious. Wonderful foolishness combined with a keenly observed sense of the world we live in."},{"Title":"The Girl with the Golden Bouffant: An Original Jane Bond Parody","review":"This is a wonderful, wonderful book. I read all of Mabel Maney's Nancy Drew parodies, and the James Bond parody before this one. This one is also James (Jane) Bond, but it brings us back to American sixties kitsch, which is Maney's strong suit. There's just so much to make fun of, from the hokey FBI schtick to the &quot;Dorothy Duncan Defrost-Off&quot; competition. The funniest bit is the scene where the spy girls are doing a make-over of the spoiled wife of Sammy Martini (read &quot;famous dissolute lounge act whose name had to be changed in order to avoid legal, or mob, action&quot;) and you're not sure whether they are going to fix her hair or carry out a hit. But there's a ton of classic Americana in here. I never want to eat frozen food again.

The research it must have taken her to get this parody oh-so-right boggles the mind. I no longer wish I were around in the sixties to see Vegas in its heyday because Maney has recreated the scene(s) to such hilarious perfection and detail that I don't need to taste the fondue to know it was disgusting.As for Maney, all her books are a fun romp filled with joy, silliness, and chutzpah, and Girl With The Golden Bouffant is another notch in her lipstick case."},{"Title":"The Girl with the Golden Bouffant: An Original Jane Bond Parody","review":"Mabel Maney, yeah, YOU! Keep writing PLEASE! And do a tv show or a cartoon or something! Or how about a video game, breakfast cereal, or a school snack? This is just another marvelous Mabel Maney masterpiece!

Without her extra eyes, I would be robbed of some sights I could not have found without her. For instance, in one of her poems, she writes:\\"Awed by her splendorStars near the lovelymoon cover their ownbright faceswhen sheis roundest and lightsearth with her silver\\"Not only is there beauty. There is a straightforwardness and frankness to the poems of Sappho. It is a clear distillation of the poet's vision confronts the readers of these pages.There is also wisdom and humor. As when she writes:\\"Experience shows usWealth unchaperonedby Virtue is neveran innocuous neighbor\\"Mary Barnard is to be praised for these clear, unvarnished translations. Likewise, the introduction is very useful in dispelling so much of the myth that has sprung up around the legacy of this great poet. I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Sappho: A New Translation","review":"Bernard's translation of Sappho is a translation of a poet who is down-to-earth, who pays attention to the detail.Some of the fragments are so brief that you are reminded of haiku: &quot;The nightengale's / The soft-spoken / announcer of / Spring's presence&quot;Other poems speak specifically of feminine concerns - the lost of the maiden-head, the color of ribbon that fits best in her daughter's yellow hair.I read a great deal of poetry in translation. In other translations I have not found Sappho to my liking. This translation appears to me to be truer to the author's earthliness and less concerned with making Sappho fit into preconceptions. In short, I highly recommend this translation."},{"Title":"Sappho: A New Translation","review":"I hate to say it, but this book made me somewhat regret studying Ancient Greek. I was given a copy by a friend and utterly adored it. It lived in my purse. I found the poems graceful in their simplicity, the imagery beautiful. Then I was asked to translate some Sapphic poetry for class and attempted to use this book as a reference by which to check my work. I unfortunately found that many of the translations had words and lines missing and added (including the title-like fist lines of each translation) and some were so different from the original poems that I had a hard time even finding a correlation between the two. If you want a lovely book of poetry then I highly recommend this book, if you want a brilliant translation of the Greek then I would suggest you do it yourself, as I have, as of yet, been unable to find a competent translation."},{"Title":"Sappho: A New Translation","review":"Sappho's poetry, long the most famous of ancient literature, is rendered superbly in this translation by Mary Barnard.Although as a child and young adult I never read literature seriously, various factors have made me curious about Sappho's writings and this small volume is an ideal pocket book or gift. The poems are not easy to get into because it takes the reader quite some time to see what is being written about, but the fact that they are mere fragments actually serves to a limited extent as an offsetting factor. The tone is wonderfully passionate - it is no wonder these poems are known to have been sung to musical accompaniment because even when one reads them they can move the emotions even of a reader like me who is never naturally moved to tears. However, because this emotion is only visible when one reads the lines as Barnard translates them, it is no wonder a casual reader may not realise what passion Sappho possessed.Although Sappho is known for her sensual focus, many of these fragments have an almost spiritual tone to them, as in \\"the indistinct dead/in Hell's palace\\". The beautiful lines about the sweet flavours of the natural world stir the reader's imagination even more, however, and are almost unrivalled among poetry or music.Whilst the detail in the introduction is not as good as in the alternative translationThe Love Songs of Sappho, it is still adequate for the uninitiated."},{"Title":"Sappho: A New Translation","review":"Because Sappho was a Lesbian who wrote about lesbian love, her poetry was banned at times throughout the ages, and therefore to this day there are only surviving fragments of her work and almost no complete poems. But of the fragments there is more than enough to ensure her place as one of the great female poets of all time. She wrote mainly love poems about things like passion, jealousy, and hostility towards her enemies. This book includes all of her surviving verse in a very readable and enjoyable translation.David Rehakauthor of &quot;Poems From My Bleeding Heart&quot;"},{"Title":"Indonesian Accents: Architecture, Interior Design, Art","review":"For anyone who is intrigued with the marriage of art and architecture in the design of living spaces, you should surely enjoy the works of this Indonesian design firm. They have impressed me with a creative sensitivity that is not normally considered nor enacted in the business of design and beyond all they show a very real design trademark that can be seen in all of their works. The book is very well written, giving the reader a educational tour supplemented with a good variety of well composed and detailed photographs. I really like the fact that the photographs are not the oft-expected tourist-like shots or the professional studio-like shots so prevalent in books of art and architecture. It appears to me that a lot of time and effort was put into this book. I am aware of the fact that the author is in fact an architect and for that reason he has a specific photographic sensitivity that makes his book even more interesting. I have learned more about Indonesian art and architecture, including a very informative section on building materials than I would have ever expected. This book is by far one of the best productions about the works of a design firm, anywhere on this planet."},{"Title":"Directory of Essential Oils","review":"This is one of my favorite and most referenced handbooks for essential oils. It is designed for one who knows at least a little about aromatherapy, and plans to be working with the oils. Warning: the drawings on some of the pages may be offensive to some, depicting a witch with an herb popularly used by witches at one time, and people not fully dressed on others. I value the book for it's wealth of information, and ignore some of the illustrations.Two pages are devoted to each of the essential oils, which are in alphabetical order. Near the title of each oil there is a chart listing the plant/part (plant as in \\"tree\\", and part as in \\"leaves\\" or \\"fruit\\"), Latin name, family, note (top, middle or base), planet, and means of extraction. There are several categories that describe each oil. Aroma describes the kind of fragrance; \\"features\\" tell about physical characteristics of the plant, and where it is grown, and such. A section called \\"History and Myth\\" tells about how the oil was used historically, and any myths associated with it. The chemical constituents, oil properties, and any precautions are listed. Three sections are devoted to telling how each oil may effect the mind (as in being a sedative), body (as in helping to regulate women's cycles), and skin (as in reactions to say, oily or sensitive skin). The last heading on each page is \\"blends\\" which lists other essential oils which blend well with the one under discussion.There are several helpful resources in the back of the book. A glossary gives a short definition of oil properties, and lists the oils with each property. A blending chart is included, categorizing the oils by what they are (trees, flowers, spices, etc.) and telling what commonly works well together. Another chart lists the oils under which skin types for which they would be most helpful."},{"Title":"Directory of Essential Oils","review":"This book is definately a must for anyone studying or wants to know more about essential oils. I used this book as a bible during my Diploma of Aromatherapy course, and I still find it a valuable tool for this modality, as it covers everything from where the plant originates from, its chemical properities, effects on the mind, body, skin, blending. I highly recommend this book for any aromatherapy enthusiast. A must on the bookshelf."},{"Title":"Directory of Essential Oils","review":"I am very happy with this book.

I really love that Sellar doesn't validate more wild claims as being facts, like other books do. She makes cautious suggestions, making it clear when something can't be documented or attributed.

The overall recommendation would be \\"read it\\", and in doing so, you will learn something new about water, the most basic of commodities, and yet at the same time the most precious.First there are pages on the physical properties of the substance. This also encompasses the chemical properties, and the wonderful story of the discovery of oxygen, with the colourful figures of Cavendish, Priestley and finally Lavoisier. It is one of the quirks of the history of science that what Ball describes as a lonely chemist (Jean Marat) was responsible for sending a prized savant to a death embraced by Madame La Guillotine \\"because the Republic has no use for savants\\".Amongst this part there are facts and figures that remind readers of the wonders of nature, and how \\"lucky\\" we are that there is such an abundance of both water, and variety of life forms on our green planet. Three quarters of the world's fresh water is held as ice, yet this comprises only 2% of the Earth's surface water, because of the enormity of the oceans. It is also astonishing that ice has 20 to 30 times less frictional resistance than other solids. Ball brings a sense of wonder and excitement at the natural history all around us, describing how fish and frogs survive at extremely low temperatures (some frogs even freezing), and how plants adapt to cold. The production of abcisic acid in autumn can mean that some plants can survive down to -30 Celsius, yet would have been killed-off by only 0 Celsius months earlier.The middle part of the book for me was the most challenging, describing in detail how water is joined together by hydrogen bonds. There WERE better sections to this portion, but it was at times hard going, and to have a section that can be described as DRY in a book about water is ironic. That said, it was a revelation that ice can exist in many different forms, including where the temperature is at 100 Celsius (albeit at very great pressure). There are also philosophical questions about water: if water is the medium in which life began, the fact that water has a destructive impact on amino acids is a problem.The final part is the most interesting, discussing the nature of what constitutes \`good' and \`bad' science, whilst discussing ultimately erroneous (as at the current tine) theories in the broad area of water. Ball is at pain not to use the judgemental terms \`good' and \`bad', but that is what he is describing. His refusal to use these terms is thus rather artificial. He makes the point that science derives much of its formidable strength from the ability to make and live with mistakes. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage mistakes, if they lead in the direction of greater knowledge. He quotes John Madox's view that in science, the concept of heresy is meaningless. Heresy is an opinion contrary to generally accepted beliefs. Therefore, most scientific revolutions start with heresy. However if there are extreme claims, these require extreme evidence. This was the stance taken by \`Nature' (of which John Madox was the editor) when faced by one of these possible scientific explanations (cold nuclear fusion - the others being anomalous water, and the idea that \`water has memory')The subject of \`water' seems to be a small subject, yet Ball has written a wide-ranging work. It is not a book to go for to get answers, more to go to when you want questions. Along the way there are good side-discussions (including homeopathy, water conservation, global warming and possible future water wars). I am left with a better understanding of what science is (a battle between conservatism, or scepticism of new ideas, and innovation). Let us conclude with the sentiments of Ball: Only a fool would deny that water would hold [as yet] unguessed secrets and wonders in its molecular structure. But it is not so magical so as to escape the laws of physics.Peter Morgan, Bath, UK [...]"},{"Title":"Immensee (German Language)","review":"A beautiful story, but the translation from the original language (german) is unbelievably poor."},{"Title":"Immensee (German Language)","review":"The only part of the book I read was Immensee, but it was enough - what a beautiful story.

Simmonds' &quot;The Gentile Comes to Cache Valley&quot; is not going to have widespread appeal, but for those interested in early Utah history, especially LDS history, this little book is a worthwhile gem.Simmonds chronicles some early settlers in Cache Valley, Utah who split with the Mormon church for three main reasons, including the cooperative movement which spelled the end of private business for some of the LDS faithful in the 1870s. Simmonds does an admirable job reconstructing the events that led to the apostasy and also traces the early non-Mormon outgrowth of other denominations.While this book is certainly not exhaustive, it is a good start and has great bibliographic references. Again, this book probably won't pick up a far-reaching audience , but it is a must for anyone interested in how and why early pioneers left the LDS church."},{"Title":"Rural Growth in Western States: Economic Development and Environmental Protection","review":"I'm proud to say that I read William P.

It's an invaluable aid for current students and anyone wanting to brush up on their French.Once you &quot;get&quot; French verbs, you're 90% of the way towards fluency. This book clearly and systematically explains how the French verb system works, providing numerous and varied exercises to practice each point.There are also countless mastery and review exercises throughout.Just a fabulous text -- very logically put together and very thorough. It has helped my understanding and mastery of French to increase by leaps and bounds."},{"Title":"French Verb Drills","review":"If you're trying to teach yourself French, you may find the numerous verb tenses intimidating. This book will help you to overcome many of those fears. While the French use verbs in a more complex way than we Anglophones, they generally do so in a logical and orderly fashion. Once you've learned the future tense or the conditional tense, for instance, you'll find that it applies to most verbs.De Sales helps you to understand those basic building blocks; the lessons are clear and basic, and if you follow them you will be well on your way to mastering French. The only nit I might pick is this: perhaps he could give the definition of a verb *before* using it in a sentence. There are cases when he will ask for a conjugation of a verb that has not yet been introduced... or a translation. You will definitely need another text or two along with this one... but if you use this you'll find the Mystery of French Verb Conjugation to be much less mysterious."},{"Title":"French Verb Drills","review":"There are too many erros in the given solutions, too few examples of how to use verbs in context, and too little explanation.Spend an extra 3 bucks and buy the superb Ultimate French Verb Review and Practice."},{"Title":"French Verb Drills","review":"As a book for verb drills, this book is alright. It has a nice glossary in the back, and it has complete conjugations of many irregular verbs. It's set up so that it deals with all of the tenses first in their regular forms, and then later there are exercises for irregular verbs, which quiz you on all tenses/moods at once. Personally, I think it would be better for the book to have longer sections about each tense/mood, which deal with irregular and regular verbs at the same time.In other words, I would rather practice one tense at a time, rather than, as the second section is set up, practice irregular verbs one at a time in all of their different tenses/moods. Most classes (high school or college) are set up so that you deal with one tense at a time (regular and irregular at the same time) as you eventually learn all of the tenses, and unfortunately this book isn't set up that way. That's my personal preference, and, perhaps, once I have learned all of the tenses, this book will be more useful for me.I would really recommend this book instead, for it presents the verbs by their tense, and it provides lessons about prepositions and useful verb expressions (ex. faire la cuisine, avoir de la chance) as an added bonus.Check out this book:The Ultimate French Verb Review and PracticeAlso, by the same authors, but it covers all of French grammar, not just verbs:The Ultimate French Review and Practice: Mastering French Grammar for Confident Communication"},{"Title":"French Verb Drills","review":"This book is great the layout is simple and direct and the exercises are terrific reinforcement.

Taoist alchemy differs dramatically from its Western counterpart, in goals but especially in means. Not a search for gold, it is seeks only enlightenment and immortality.These texts are cryptic for a variety of reasons. One is that the alchemical tradition draws on many other fields of esoterica including chemistry, geomancy and numerology. It also draws on astrology in use of dates tied to the lunar calendar and tangential reference to retrograde motion of celestial bodies (p.126). Above all, it draws on the ideas of vital force that appear in Chinese traditional medicine, and meditative and yogic practices. These last may be individual exercises for control of the body, or the \\"paired way\\" that harvests generative force from sex between the mystic and a consort.Part of the difficulty in reading this text is the ambiguity between analogies and literal fact. The adepts discuss lead and mercury, and implicitly the amalgam of the two metals, but also use that as an analogy for combining the forces of the two partners. The texts also use fertilization and the fetus in an allegorical sense, but echo the metaphysical meaning in physical coition.Part of the difficulty is intentional. \\"The names dragon, tiger, lead, and mercury were used by the immortals and sages to hide the true meanings from unethical practitioners,\\" (p.63) and possibly to shield novices from the risks of advanced practices. Although the last author asserts that the Tao is inherently beyond abuse, the tradition works hard to withold its knowledge from outsiders.There is only a little commentary on the texts, but some of that leaves me wondering whether modern revisionism crept into the translation. Wong asserts that an adept's consort may be of opposite or same sex, an idea attractive to today's readers. I have no doubt that homosexual experiences offer the full intensity of heterosexual practice, and that yin and yang refer to forces beyond mere biology. The texts use procreation as a central analogy, however, and offer no clear distinction between metaphor and action. Whatever its potency, same-sex sex is not procreative. Would the old masters have seen a piece missing from their formulas? I wonder.Reading this book is a mysterious experience. It describes mysteries in an allusive, elusive way. More importantly, the whole world view behind it, the many traditions that feed into it are foreign to a Western reader. I found myself reading it with a sense that I saw only the exterior of something, when it's the interior that matters. I also found myself wondering how these lines of though descended from Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu - perhaps the descent is part of the mystery.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"HTML: Your visual blueprint for designing effective Web pages","review":"I have been working with HTML for nearly four years, but to teach it to a beginner is often mind boggling for it is like learning another language - worse, it is code and tags not words for people to relate to, for it is often intimidating to people wanting to learn but are floored when they first start.This is THE book for people starting out.

The chronicle is divided into five &quot;sketches&quot;: the first discusses the move east and calls upon a few anecdotes to introduce the very fiery-tempered but (we are assured) good-hearted character of Stepan; the second recounts the marriage of Stepan's beloved ward Parasha at the age of 15 to a brutal scoundrel and recalls Stepan's heroic rescue of Parasha from near death at her husband's hands; and the last three discuss the meeting, wedding, and early married years of Sergei's parents, especially emphasizing the difficulties both had in gaining acceptance by their respective in-laws.Aksakov refers to himself not as a novelist but as a &quot;chronicler of oral tradition,&quot; and the book very strongly retains that feel throughout, bringing us more intimately into the concerns and struggles within the family than an author who only had recourse to his or her imagination realistically could. While most of the characters are fairly well-drawn, the two most memorable ones are Stepan and Aksakov's mother (named Marya in real life and Sofya in the book), the latter of whom shows a great deal of both familial devotion and intelligence without ever seeming to be unrealistically glorified.The portrayal of Stepan (the &quot;Russian Gentleman&quot; whom translator J.D. Duff chose to recast as the title character) seems a little more suspect, which is unsurprising since Stepan died when Sergei was five years old, so that Sergei had to rely almost exclusively on questionably-accurate oral accounts of Stepan's doings many years after the fact in order to get a sense of his character. Throughout the work, pretty much all of Stepan's attributes are carried to at-times implausible extremes. Early on, Aksakov portrays Stepan during his angry spells as nothing less than a madman who obliges his whole family to hide from him for days on end, but at the same time as a brilliant judge of character (which Sergei seems to extrapolate merely from the fact that Stepan was the only member of the household to disapprove of Parasha's husband and to approve of Sofya). In the last sketch, Stepan doesn't even care whether his granddaughters live or die but dreams constantly of a grandson; while Stepan was surely eager to have his &quot;noble and ancient name&quot; carried on, one gets the sense that the picture painted in the book is more a reflection of the vanity of the author (who was Stepan's first grandson) than of Stepan's actual feelings (at least, one hopes so).All the same, part of the charm of oral tradition lies in the exaggeration that comes along with it, and the particular items which get exaggerated can tell us a good deal about the psychology of the storyteller and the values of the culture. As such, A Russian Gentleman gives us an enjoyable and informative glimpse at life among the traditional middling gentry in Imperial Russia at a pivotal point in that country's history."},{"Title":"A Russian gentleman,","review":"Those who think the &quot;Russian classics&quot; are huge books should take a look at this very enjoyable book, a combination of fiction and memoir. The shift from the &quot;heroic&quot; age of the Russian patriarch to the domestic and more feminine world of his successors is interesting. Dostoevsky is urban; try this as one of the depictions of the Russian countryside. A keeper."},{"Title":"A Russian gentleman,","review":"\\"A Russian Gentleman\\" is a great novel. The author tells his family stories with such vigor that it makes you want to keep reading. Plus it is a good way to learn about Russian culture. Russian culture is demonstrated throughout the story."},{"Title":"A Russian gentleman,","review":"Aksakov's book belongs in the rich tradition of memoirs. It is the kind of book in which the author tries to &quot;recover&quot; those days of learning and growing up, which made us be what we are. Sincerity and honesty are crucial to accomplish the task, and in this book, Aksakov gets the upper hand. The style is dry, but not boring; the images are beautiful, both in moments of joy and of sorrow. Inevitably, Aksakov's voice is nostalgic: he longs to be there once again, trodding the streets and rural roads he used to walk with people long gone. His style is practical and direct, and there is not an excess of ornamentation or digressions. Besides, it is an interesting glimpse into life in Russia during the Nineteenth century, full of memorable moments and images."},{"Title":"A Russian gentleman,","review":"I read this book as part of a Russian history class I took in college. The book was assigned reading because of its portrayal of life in the Russian countryside for those who were not strictly peasants. The book's title refers to Stepan, a Russian gentleman, landowner, who is also a patriarch of a family, one of whom is his grandson, the book's author. The book examines Russian culture and family life, potraying the pride, illiteracy, and male chauvinism that dominated it. The story itself is somewhat boring, and I only found it interesting due its portrayal of a society few Americans have any idea about."},{"Title":"The history and life of the Reverend Doctor John Tauler of Strasbourg: With twenty-five of his sermons (temp. 1340)","review":"My hands are bad, so I'm unable to type much. Overall, it was an enjoyable read. I'm bible college and seminary trained (in a mainline protestant tradition), yet I found the book historically interesting and very passionate. I would definitely recommend to non-Catholics interested in the historical side of the Christian faith, for understanding the times, people's lives and struggles, as well as to those drawn to learning more of God's interesting works and His ways. I acquired the book because of Tauler's influence on Luther, and an affection I've gained for some involved with early European Pietism."},{"Title":"The history and life of the Reverend Doctor John Tauler of Strasbourg: With twenty-five of his sermons (temp. 1340)","review":"The 27 sermons reproduced in this book are most valuable. The translations (by Susanna Winkworth) seem to be excellent, though, of course, the reader has little possibility of checking the final product with the original text. Nevertheless, having these texts available to an English-speaking readership has been very considerate and selfless.I think it is a pity that the volume includes an old (1905) version of the history and life of Tauler. This long history (occupying almost half the whole tome) is interesting in itself from an historical point of view, in the sense that it reflects the mentality and the readership demands of its time. On the other hand, however, it might not cater for the modern reader or take into consideration what a modern reader would like to know about Tauler. Unfortunately, to have this one must seek it out in other books. The history, to put it short, is a bit archaic, and perhaps a new, freshly-made study of the life and times of Tauler might have been more appropriate.Tauler, of course, is basic for anyone interested in Western spirituality and mysticism. This book continues to provide further material, together with other equally excellent publications, about the man and his mind. Indeed, most of the sermons provided here are not to be found in other publications, and this in itself makes this book helpful and be beneficial."},{"Title":"A London Family Between the Wars (Oxford Paperbacks)","review":"In internal chronological order, this is the fourth volume of Molly Hughes' autobiographical reminiscences, though I believe it was actually the second to be written. The first volume, \\"A London Child of the 1870's\\" was published in 1934, and was very successful. This volume was published in 1940, and covers the years from 1919, when Molly Hughes' husband died, up to the outbreak of the Second World War. The other two volumes, \\"A London Girl of the 1880's\\" and \\"A London Home of the 1890's\\" were published in 1946.It's a charming and friendly book, easy to read and casually informative about life in a small village in the twenties and thirties. The Hughes family lived in Cuffley, near Potters Bar; back then it was an isolated village on the fringes of London, though now it is unpleasantly close to the M25. There are stories of neighbours, visitors, relatives, pets, children, gardening, and so forth. The arrival of the telephone and the wireless, and the first car that the family owned, are all major events. The book has nothing like a plot; it is just a more or less chronological set of memories.This is not as absorbing a read as \\"London Child\\" and \\"London Girl\\". It hops around too much to have any real cohesion, though Hughes has to some degree kept thematically related material together. However, it's pleasant enough, and if you have read and enjoyed the earlier books I can certainly recommend this. Fans of the earlier volumes will feel like friends of the Hughes family, and this book will at least give you the pleasure of finding out more about the lives of the characters you've grown to like."},{"Title":"Strategic Six Sigma: Best Practices from the Executive Suite","review":"Unless you are the CEO of a company and have total control over implementing a Six Sigma program, I wouldn't recommend this book. It doesn't go much into the meat of Six Sigma, but is focused around developing a Six Sigma culture within your organization. It is also very redundant, repeating the same themes over and over throughout the book. A good editor could have reduced this book to 50 pages. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Strategic Six Sigma: Best Practices from the Executive Suite","review":"A lot of the Six Sigma books and articles I have read appear to assume you greatly miss your college statistics class. This book focuses on issues, ideas and examples relevant to senior management, while referencing some of the tools and techniques that will be essential to execute successfully. Let's face it -- senior executives need examples to create the sense of urgency and &quot;what can be&quot; through Six Sigma; there are plenty of books, consultants and training firms who can take you from that commitment through execution. I highly recommend this book for managers who want to understand why they should seriously consider Six Sigma or similar approaches (TQM, CQI, etc.) to improve their company's or business unit's effectiveness in meeting their customer's needs and efficiency vs. competitors."},{"Title":"Strategic Six Sigma: Best Practices from the Executive Suite","review":"Thanks to endorsements from managerial heavyweights like Jack Welch, most people in business are by now familiar with Six Sigma as a process for measuring and reducing product defects. In Strategic Six Sigma, however, Dick Smith, Jerry Blakeslee and Richard Koonce demonstrate that the Six Sigma methodology can and should be applied to the highest levels of strategic planning. Simply put, the authors illustrate how the rigors of Six Sigma can improve your performance in terms of overall strategy, growth and customer satisfaction in the same way that it streamlines operations on a production floor. We...strongly recommend this book to business leaders, executives and managers, all of whom will benefit from its hands-on advice for integrating the tenets of Six Sigma into corporate strategy."},{"Title":"Strategic Six Sigma: Best Practices from the Executive Suite","review":"This book provides a valuable strategic framework with which to implement Six Sigma within a company today. Unlike most books on Six Sigma, which focus on the granular details of six sigma implementation, this book focuses on implementation from a strategic perspective; in other words, on how a company's top leadership team must be intimately involved in making Six Sigma work by creating an internal &quot;climate of alignment&quot; to make Six Sigma initiatives suceed. From my perspective, a critical resource for today's CEOs and their top leadership teams!"},{"Title":"Strategic Six Sigma: Best Practices from the Executive Suite","review":"Well written from the strategic view of Six Sigma and where it fits into your existing corporate methodologies, process efforts and strategic initiatives.

I think one of the hardest things is getting the right learning tools. I really tried (and bought) so many!!! Just a small overview here...I started with the Japanese for Busy People 1 textbook. This was a great book to start with. But I soon found out that it was no good for me at all. There are quite some mistakes in it, and I didn't like it that it was in Kana only. Furthermore it especially irritated me when I arrived at the -te form usage. Instead of explaining, you just have to learn the -Te form for every other verb by head. (the 2nd book is a lot better by the way). That's when I started using Genki. This was such a relief (but you can read all the reviews there, and they tell you everything about how great these textbooks are).Then I came across this learning method in a Japanese bookstore. It seemed attractive to me, and so,shopaholic as I am, I bought these books. It is called 90 days of Japanese (and not to by the way) and consists of three parts. Don't expect however that you'll learn Japanese in 90 days, as there is way too much information in it.Every part consist of two books. One is the textbook and is totally in Japanese, and the other one consists of vocabulary, translations of text and in-depth grammar explanations.One thing I must note here is that the textbook is completely in Japanese script, you must be good at Kana before starting.Every textbook consist of 6 parts consisting 5 lessons each. So in total there are 90 lessons, hence the title. Every lesson starts with new vocabulary. It is in Japanese only and is supported by pictures. If you after all can't find out the meaning you can go to the english manual. Then there are few texts, which you can all find on the CD that comes with the textbook. Next part is a grammar explanation in Japanese. They show you the form and some examples only, so it's quite easy to understand. For indepth information again look at the english manual. The fourth part is are excercises and a few are also recorded on the CD.In the english manual, you can find all vocabulary coming out of the textbook, but what is really usefull, there are lots of reference vocabulary sections. This is a real advantage above other books, where you can only find the standard vocab.Then there is the grammar section, and this is the best I've seen this far. It is a lot though, but it explains every item very clear. For example, book 2 of Genki is quite short in the grammar about transitivity. It is not really clear, and certainly not complete at all. The explanation in this book was so much more helpfull.Finally there is this Kanji book, that teaches you 450 basic Kanji. It's quite usefull and comparable to books like Basic Kanji by Chieko Kano. There are many usefull excercises, and the textbook forces you to learn Kanji, as furigana attached to the Kanji is gradually left away. This makes it hard, but is again very very usefull. It forces you to really think about the Kanji. Furigana is usefull for unknown Kanji, but makes you a little lazy later on.After all I think using this book next to Genki (or as a learning tool on it self) might be the best way to study elemantary Japanese. And after finishing the three books, you shouldn't have to much difficulty with starting to learn intermediate Japanese (JLPT 2kyuu). With most other books, there is quite a large gap to cross."},{"Title":"Escape from Kyburg Castle","review":"Going by two different titles, this compelling story of a young lady is bound to captivate any reader. Regina is unsettled in her heart as she watches good friends being imprisoned or disappearing from the country, because of their religious beliefs. Switzerland's government is one with the church during these turbulent early 1500's, and the Anbaptist teaching against infant baptism is thus against the government. Persecution is implemented in attempt to squelch this new doctrine, yet many people knowingly choose to become Anabaptist. Regina prays for the truth, which promises peace to her heart, and is worth any price. Suspense, adventure and romance mark this story as Regina also finds true love from a young man, demonstrated by his willingness to die for her, in her search for the Truth. This would not be a first choice as a read-aloud book, but great reading on infant-baptism versus adult-baptism-upon-confession, for teens or adults. This book is inspirational, challenging any serious Christian to examine their own convictions and their own willingness to endure any persecution to hold onto the Truth as God has revealed it to them. It challenges any reader to desire Truth above anything else."},{"Title":"Educational Psychology (Classics in Soviet Psychology Series)","review":"Educational Psychology was one of Vygotsky's first published, but last translated books. He wrote this book while at Gomel's Teachers College in 1921-23. It was translated into English in 1997. Many believed that Vygotsky wrote this book as an introductory psychology text.It has been said that Vygotsky was a man way before his time. Many of the ideas that Vygotsky formulates are the same issues we are dealing with today. Vygotsky talks about inclusive classrooms, social education, multicultural education, moral education, etc. I found it remarkable that a man in the 1920's was thinking about issues that we are struggling with today.I think this book is a good introduction into Vygotsky and psychology in general. Some parts of the book focus on aspects about psychology that are no longer pertinent today, but I found the history lesson worth while."},{"Title":"Educational Psychology (Classics in Soviet Psychology Series)","review":"Vygotsky wrote very little about moral development. The primary reason for this is probably largely due to the fact that he viewed moral and ethical learning as utilizing processes similar to more general cognitive growth. For those interested in moral development and character education, \\"Educational Psychology\\" is a rare and singular treat. Within this book, Vygotsky devotes an entire chapter to the subject of moral development. It is surprising that this text is not cited far more often. This book is a gold mine for those wanting to understand the history and depth of Vygotskian thought."},{"Title":"Eros, Magic and the Murder of Professor Culianu","review":"The shot that killed professor Ioan Culianu while he was sitting in a stall in the men's room came from a small Beretta: a .25 caliber gun, fired at leat 18 inches away from his head, for there were no gunpowder traces around the entry wound. It was the work of an expert, a person who stood on the toilet seat of the adjoining stall, and fired downward and into the back of his head; probably the shot of a left hander. Why only one shot? Why such a small caliber gun? Professionals are more heavy handed, more redundant, more brutal. This was exquisitely done, with minimal fuss and no traceable clues.It was May, 1991, a little after one in the afternoon, at the University of Chicago Divinity School. Prof Culianu, a handsome man in his 40's had three books in press, was about to get married, was loved and respected by students and faculty, and was at the peak of his profession as a historian of religion. His work was recognized internationally, and he could look forward to the honors and comforts of a successful academic career.Ted Anton presents the true tale of Prof. Culianu with deftness and care. It is a story that to this day continues to reverberate in academia and law enforcement because it has never been solved. Far more exciting than fiction, the story of this professor takes turns and dips that keep the reader on edge and breathless.Culianu was an expert not only on the traditional aspects of religions, but had an interest in the occult arts that formed part of the ancient rituals and practices. He was an expert in divination through geomancy, and was about to teach a course in this practice. He gravitated towards the occult. He knew about near death experiences and about the transmigration of souls; and at the same time he maintained his status as a legitimate scholar and teacher in one of America's prestigious universities.Fictional stories about crimes and police work are very enjoyable, but reading a book like this renders the others insignificant by comparison. Of course truth is stranger than fiction, but it is also more exciting, more interesting, and finally...more scary."},{"Title":"Eros, Magic and the Murder of Professor Culianu","review":"If you enjoyed Umberto Eco's _Foucault's Pendulum_, you will undoubtedly enjoy this true life tale of magic, European politics, and murder. The book gives an accounting of the life of Ioan Culianu, a professor of comparative religion at the University of Chicago, from his birth in Romania to his untimely murder. Professor Culianu provided astounding insights into the world of magic and attempted to explain its occurrences through complexity. He published many books on magic, comparative religion, shamanism, and gnosticism. Like Mircea Eliade, a fellow Romanian and his mentor before him, Culianu contributed a great deal to our understanding of religion and magic. He also wrote several novels along with his fiancee Hillary Wiesner. This book provides a look into not only the worlds of Eliade and Culianu, but also a disturbing examination of far-right politics in Romania. Culianu's murder remains unsolved despite its obvious link to his outspoken views on the Romanian revolution which occurred just prior to his murder. However, many disturbing coincidences abound regarding this event."},{"Title":"Eros, Magic and the Murder of Professor Culianu","review":"Culiano taught religious studies at the Divinity School of the University of Chicago--the hand-picked successor to the great Mircea Eliade. Culiano specialized in magic, dualistic heresies and mystical experiences. He practiced what he studied as well, entertaining students and aggravating colleagues. But he also wrote political articles and fiction for a Romanian journal. These got him in trouble with the Romanian secret police; his murder has never been solved.Blending religious studies, occult phenomena, political analysis, and true crime journalism, this book is also an entertaining and intriguing look at Culiano, academics in America, Romanian intellectual traditions. I hope many people read and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Eros, Magic and the Murder of Professor Culianu","review":"This is not a murder account. This is not a book on a college professor. This is not a political treatise. It is all of these and more. I have to admit that the only reason this doesn't get five stars from me is that for some reason I found Anton's partially objective stance a little too distanced and artificial. But the story itself is fascinating. Culiano was a brilliant new mind, so brilliant that he was reversing the skeptical prejudices about magic, divination and other mystic arts not by trying to embrace a pixyish New Age philosophy but by showing through huge amounts of scholarship the fact that there are different magisteria for such things as rational thought and on the other hand these forms of intuitive symbolic thinking. Culiano was a major scholar outside the US and the inheritor of Mircea Eliade's scholastic dominion. He was also a Romanian and though he tried to stay out of it, he was drawn into a web of surveillance and other hidden pressures as \\"occult\\" in the true meaning of the word as anything he studied. There should be more here, but even the hint of the story and the truth is intriguing."},{"Title":"Eros, Magic and the Murder of Professor Culianu","review":"This is an insightful look at the life and work of a brilliant Romanian scholar and exile, and at the frightening overseas activities of the Romanian secret police in the post-communist years. Written in a clear, elegant style, with plenty of references to Culianu's writings and glimpses at his complicated personal interactions, this book is a great read. As the author concludes, Culianu \\"left a legacy of the dangers of a life of the mind.\\" Without this biography, his undeserved fate may well be forgotten."},{"Title":"Eros, Magic and the Murder of Professor Culianu","review":"Normally, when I see a title such as this, I'm a little nervious. It's easy to associate the very worst in yellow journalism with so-called &quot;true crime&quot; novels. So, it was with a bit of apprehension that I picked up _Eros, Magic, &amp; the Murder of Professor Culianu.The adage, &quot;never judge a book by its cover,&quot; can be legitimately applied to this book. From the beginning, I was fascinated by Culianu and his relationships to Mircea Eliade and Romania. Comparative religion is one of my fields of interest, and here is the tragic story of a man who made an incredible impact on that field.But it's not just the story of one man. Anton skillfully weaves Culianu's ideas throughout, leaving the reader with a feel for Culianu's ideas as well as his life. This is no mean feat. Anton's prose is clean and spare, granting us a clearer view of an incredible thinker."},{"Title":"Eros, Magic and the Murder of Professor Culianu","review":"I first heard of the murder of Professor Culianu when I was an undergrad at the University of Chicago. I was immediately drawn to find more about the man who allegedly believed in the magic he studied. After reading \\"Eros and Magic\\" and \\"Out of this World\\", I thought that this biography might shed some additional light on the man, his scholarship, and his occult dabblings.I must admit I was somewhat disappointed. The book is very dry and factually oriented. The facts themselves appear to be well-researched, but are simply presented without much else. Mr. Anton tells us where Prof. Culianu was born, where he studied, what books he wrote, but seldom goes deeper than that.Ironically, given the themes in Culianu's work and life, Mr. Anton fails to realize the importance of evoking the imagination in telling the story, to bring the facts to life in a meaningful, interesting way.There are only the slightest hints of the exciting ideas that motivated Prof. Culianu's scholarship and personal life.It is said that Prof. Culianu took a personal interest interest in the ideas he was studying, actually practicing divination and teaching a course on it. But rather than exploring in any depth either Prof. Culianu's professional ideas or personal interests, these facts are simply used as \\"hooks\\" to carry the reader along.If you are interested in the ideas of Prof. Culianu and/or his interest in occult scholarship, this book will probably disappoint you. If you are looking for a lot of biographical facts about Prof. Culianu, then this book may be for you."},{"Title":"Eros, Magic and the Murder of Professor Culianu","review":"Thought the title may be misleading, Anton's book about the never-ending quest for knowlage of a very intellectual Prof. Culianu is quite extential.

I'm not sure about this \\"last gasp\\" claim yet - *The Wrong Side of Paris*, Balzac's last novel (recently republished!) is on my reading list - but they certainly are great in and of themselves, *Bette* more than *Pons*, in my opinion. Not to degenerate this work in the slightest: being within the shadow of a masterpiece is close enough for posterity.'Poor Relations' tackles the subject of the individual and its family; but where in *Bette* the poor relation was the spinster cousin, surrounded and revered by her family while she secretly schemed to destroy them, in this novel Pons is the outcast and victim, humiliated by his wealthy relations for his eccentric behavior and mooching ways. For Pons loves food - sumptuous feasts, where he can indulge the demands of his gastronomical addiction - and when his lack of social grace irritates his relatives to the point of banishment, he always wheedles his way back into their hearts with exquisite presents: Pons' monomania extends to collecting the great masterpieces of art, hoarding them away in his private salon where he can bask in the glory of oil and gold. After a scheme intended to permanently set his place at the dinner-table goes awry, however, the old man finds himself an exile, snubbed and refused at the homes of his relatives. The heartbreak - and the stomach-ache - drives the poor man to his deathbed, one hounded by prospective vultures seeking to profit on his jealously-kept collection.*Cousin Pons*, on reflection, is perhaps one of Balzac's bitterest and unrelentingly tragic novels, sharing similarities to *Pere Goirot* in its plot, structure and sharp denouncement of the materialistic bourgeois society that had come in fashion after the July Revolution. Greed, avarice, selfishness, poisonous coveting (literally), corruption, hypocrisy and blackmail all raise their heads in this novel, a gaggle of vipers ranging from the highest of society (the infuriating Presidente) to the lowest dregs (the despicable La Cibot), and all those that scheme in between (the ghoulish Fraisier). Pons and his roommate Schmucke, gentle failures in the game of life, haven't a chance among these beasts: and it is heartache to see the villainous deeds done to these two men for the glitter of lucre and the whiff of prestige. Balzac was never much of one for happily-ever-after, but most of his tragedies have some sort of uplifting resolution, some cosmic vengeance dealt upon at least a few of the miscreants (and *Bette* was probably the most satisfying in this regard); *Pons* refutes this technique, leaving the reader shaken and upset at the circumstances of the conclusion...at the _reality_ of it.This volume is not quite within Balzac's creative pantheon: it's too slim (!), lacking the complexity and the captivating digressions of a *Lost Illusions*; but man o man does that ending work - for the novel, and as a conclusion to one of the most ambitious artistic statements of the past two centuries.Four and a half stars, rounded down."},{"Title":"Cousin Pons: Part two of Poor relations; (The Penguin classics, L205)","review":"This work, like all of Balzac's works, possesses his style, namely his perceptive insights into a Parisian's sole and the fabric of society during that time. Had these observations been relevent only to Paris of that time (the book takes place 1844-46) this book would not have the impact it does. I can almost imagine any one of these characters existing today, and wouldn't be surprised to open up the newspaper and reading a column with a similar story as this book.It's a great look at what moves people to get ahead and step over other's who are more vulnerable. It is as if Balzac is saying that society is an extension of the apt phrase \\"survival of the fittest\\". The characters that ultimately succeed in this novel are the one's not with the most talent, but with the drive to get ahead in society. There are limits however, as a character who oversteps the laws of society is ultimately punished.It is a painful novel to read as the characters who are the most sensitive and least versed in the ways of society suffer the most . Even a relatively minor character who is noble becomes withdrawn and pessimistic as a result of his inability to be charitable.

Now he gives private lessons and conducts a theatrical orchestra, and barely gets by.Pons is dominated by two very different manias. The first is collecting small works of \\"bric-a-brac,\\" which includes such masterpieces as a fan created by Watteau for Mme Pompadour, which Pons manages to acquire for ten francs (it is worth thousands). His private museum contains 2,000 wonderful works of art, probably worth a million francs all told --- although he would never dream of selling them. His second mania, alas, is gourmet dining. He has learned, and learned well, what truly fine food and wine taste like, and he's addicted. He became addicted when he was a popular young musician during the Empire, but now he has fallen to the status of a mere parasite, a \\"hanger-on,\\" a poor relation. At the time the story opens, he is barely tolerated --- almost openly mocked --- at the homes where he appears \\"just at suppertime.\\"Like many Balzac novels, this one does not keep you in the dark about exactly how much money each character has, in property and income, and the eternal Parisian struggle for more money and higher status. Suffice it to say that Pons' richie relatives look upon him as a fool until a crisis puts him at death's door, and the richies learn about his magnificent art collection. Understanding nothing of art whatsoever, these ignorant clods understand a million francs perfectly, and so the last days of Sylvain Pons must be devoted to defending his property against those richie relatives, who reveal themselves as unscrupulous thieves.It's not cheerful reading, but tragedies rarely are. \\"Cousin Pons\\" will leave you shivering with horror, and asking yourself, \\"Is this really what mankind amounts to?\\"If you enjoy this, there is a lot more excellent stuff where this came from!"},{"Title":"Cousin Pons: Part two of Poor relations; (The Penguin classics, L205)","review":"I just downloaded this to my Kindle.

Instead, it puts the reader in the middle of a clash of cultures, one that is repeated daily around the world to this day. Lopez y Fuentes moves readers to scream, 'How can they DO that?' or 'Why don't they just TALK to each other?' As we know, however, resolving cultural misunderstandings is never that easy despite the tragedies that fall out of faulty assumptions about what constitutes 'civilization' and 'progress,' as well as what happens when -- consciously or not -- people simply choose not to communicate. The deep backdrop is the time circa the Mexican Revolution, but Lopez y Fuentes suggests that the more things change for indigenous peoples in the modern world, the more they stay the same. Some specific historical background may be helpful, but it is not necessary. Since Lopez y Fuentes uses no character names or place names, one could read 'El Indio' as a generic story of a people and what happens to that people as a result of centuries of subjugation, racism, ethnocentrism, basic cultural assumptions, and a general disagreement about the 'nature' part of 'human nature.' Thoughful readers will use Lopez y Fuentes' account as a departure point to look at their own culture and cultural assumptions about 'backward' peoples around the world. A bonus: Full-page and cover illustrations by famous Mexican artist Diego Rivera."},{"Title":"El Indio","review":"A great little book that captures the simplicity of a culture caught up in the upheavals of modern civilization and it's encroaching values. Although the Indios described are from Mexico the theme of indigenous people and the clash between civilzations is universal and continues to this day. The suggested time frame is pre-conquest to the present(1937) and the language is one that reflects a simpler place in time. Not one character is named in this outstanding novel but the identification still exists with all those unnamed individuals. Along with Mariano Azuela's &quot;Los de Abajo&quot; (&quot;The Underdogs&quot;), this short novel is considered one of the best in Mexican literature. Without lavish and extravagant language the images are portrayed magnificently, quite possibly the simplicity of language is used to drive home the point. One of the most interesting aspects of this book is the inclusion of Nahuatl to describe certain cultural activities or aspects of the civilization. This works quite well with the inclusion of footnotes and adds a dimension of realism and authenticity to the novel that would probably be lost if they were not included. In this regard the book both educates and entertains. Of particular interest is the introduction of the closest thing to a character when the author describes The Nahual, or the supernatural being who can transform himself to any animal at will. Anyone interested in Mexican history, indigenous culture or the perspective of the Indio lifestyle and the inherent conflict created by European values would enjoy this book. As mentioned by another reviewer, an addional bonus are the numerous Diego Rivera illustrations throughout the book. The drawings have a cartoon coloring book style from early on in the master Mexican muralists career. I would also recommend this book for educators from the middle school level on especially if they are teaching something relating to Mexican life. This is a very entertaining book that can be read quite quickly."},{"Title":"El Indio","review":"This novel is a fictional account of true events. Every crime mentioned really happened. Lopez y Fuentes writes this book as a &quot;composite novel&quot; -- the time and location of the events, as well as names of individuals, are not named. Accompanied by illustrations by Diego Rivera, one of Mexico's most prestigious artists, this novel presents several years in the life of the descendents of the Aztecs."},{"Title":"You Don't Have to Be a Perfect Girl","review":"This book would have been a smoother and more entertaining read if Liz had been a gymnast from the start of the story or had gotten into the sport earlier than she did. I endured the first third of the book reading about irrelevant activities such as furniture refinishing, Human Relations term papers, the Table of Truth, and girl get-togethers before gymnastics even came into play.Liz's mother's and sister's attitudes about her gymnastics were annoying. Her sister, who claimed that gymnastics would ruin her love life, had boys on the brain. Her mother, who claimed that gymnastics was an unfeminine sport for social recluses, needed a reality check. But it was gratifying to see them come around at the end of the story.A gymnast's life is realistically depicted, from the excitement of learning new skills to the less pleasant aspects such as twisted ankles and lacerated palms. I recomment it to all gymnastics aficionados or competitive gymnasts."},{"Title":"Blue Beard","review":"A very enjoyable read.

This is an excellent work for anyone who cares about the quality of organizational life and the ability to do great things at work. Larry and Don do an outstanding job of showing how a number of important firms, including UPS, 3M and HP, take the matter of social capital very seriously and make investments in building and nurturing it.I would suggest this book as a bit of &quot;contrarian&quot; reading for KM emthusiasts, thinkers and practitioners who favor a more technocentric approach. In Good Company digs into the profoundly social aspects of work, knowledge sharing and learning and offers a heavy dose of reality in its discussion of &quot;the challenge of virtuality.&quot; After reading In Good Company, my hope is that it will help all of us build our understanding of what individual, collective and organizational success truly looks like and requires of us in these extraordinary times!"},{"Title":"In Good Company: How Social Capital Makes Organizations Work","review":"If I could inflict one book on business executives this year, this would be it. In arguing that social capital within organisations has a value, and that there are ways to encourage it, the authors will not surprise most corporate infantry. But they draw together the human strands of this topic - trust, networking, the office environment, gossip - in an elegant and compelling way, and turn an insightful lens towards everyday facets of employee interaction. While the approach is scholarly, there's enough case study and anecdote to give their case a grounded authenticity. It's extremely well written, and the ideas it brings together beg for enlargement and further research."},{"Title":"In Good Company: How Social Capital Makes Organizations Work","review":"This is a good and helpful read. While Cohen and Prusak do tend to say a lot of things that one has a gut feeling of but has never read or heard someone say aloud about working relationships, some of it was really fascinating. They have a particularly interesting chapter on chat and storytelling and the functions those activities serve at work. The theme of the book is that organizations should invest in social capital the way they invest in other kinds of capital, but that such investments can't be faked. Workers know when the love is real, so to speak.The writers address particularly cogent trends of telecommuting and volatile industries and how those can cause stress in organizations because they lower social capital. They had some interesting points. One thing I particularly responded to was the chapter on trust. They wrote that when someone says their organization is particularly political, what they are saying isthat there is very low trust. Another thing they wrote that really interested me is that the virtual office isn't going to succeed - and hasn't as predicted - because work is an inherently social activity. That's one of the reasons people like it and are dedicated to it. Not that many people are ever going to want to work at home in their pajamas - every single day. They also suggest that money isn't the only effective lure for new talent or retainer of current employees. They write that if talent can just be bought, it will be, but if you create high social capital in your organizations, money alone won't be able to suck the talented people from your offices.[The book made me want to read more by Chris Argyris, who is an organizational pyschologist at Harvard, and the book \\"The Social Life of Information.\\"]"},{"Title":"In Good Company: How Social Capital Makes Organizations Work","review":"The Information Age has put a premium on ideas and intellectual capital is more valuable today than ever. Knowledge has always resided within organizations, therefore the very sought after intellectual capital is a critical resource that resides within the employees of a company. Although these employees possess intellectual capital, with the emergence of technology, globalization, and the rise of free agency, another resource has emerged: social capital. This social capital is made-up of human connections, such as trust, networks, and a sense of community. In this book the authors share how to:Recognize social capital for what it is and what it is not. Understand that social capital is not about everyone liking everyone else, nor accepting everyone. It is not about being nice, or being forced to share tales of their personal lives. It is important to stay focused on what is truly social capital.Develop a sense of trust among employees and build trust between the employees and the firm. Learn how all social capital starts from a sense of trust.Allow networks and communities to develop naturally. Within networks, the authors show that social capital is strongest. Allow employees the space and time to connect.Encourage talk and storytelling. This is the voice of social capital. The art of conversation is discussed at some length by the authors.Meet the challenge of an increasing virtual world. The authors stress the importance of balancing both the virtual and real world experiences."},{"Title":"In Good Company: How Social Capital Makes Organizations Work","review":"The industrial revolution brought a mechanistic view of organizations where workers were treated as interchangeable parts. The contemporary view of organizations is as an organic structure where recognition of the importance of social capital has been increasing. Authors Don Cohen and Laurence Prusak warn that firms attempting to take advantage of communication technology may be reverting to an electronic equivalent of the old mechanistic view that undervalues and erodes social capital. Their book, In Good Company, also criticizes, in passing, agency theory that disregards social capital by emphasizing the free agency of employees who act in the interests of the organization only to the extent it is in their financial interests.The book is short and light reading, using largely anecdotes to support its arguments. For managers considering telecommuting, hoteling, the reduction of business travel or other efforts to gain efficiency should must this book. The authors conclude by stating that whatever the form of future organizations, they will require the nurture of \\"trust, community, connection, conversation and loyalty\\" to work effectively."},{"Title":"In Good Company: How Social Capital Makes Organizations Work","review":"\\"Social capital consists of the stock of active connections among people, the trust, mutual understanding, and shared values and behaviors that bind the members of human networks and communities and make cooperative action possible.\\" What is new about this book is that it applies this sociological concept to business enterprises.As the authors point out, having more social capital inside an organization is good, but it is not sufficient to create a successful enterprise. Digital Equipment is used as an example of this point. Also, organizations can have social capital and be serving harmful ends (the Nazis are used as an example).The authors feel that there are important limits to what free agency, telecommuting, virtual organizations, and hoteling offices can accomplish because their basis in social capital will be weaker.On the positive side, they argue for hiring and encouraging people who fit the values and culture of the organization, and creating an environment in which social capital will build. To do this, companies should actively take steps that build trust, networks and communication through making appropriate spaces and time available, and help people learn through effective story telling.The benefits of this approach will be better knowledge sharing, lower transaction costs, lower turnover of key employees, better coherence of action due to organizational stability and more shared understanding. You may also see more creativity if people are allowed to experience the intrinsic pleasures of making the future.I thought that the best part of this book was in the detailed look at the various kinds of stories that organizations tell and what their purposes are. This book extended my understanding of that subject, which is an important one for communications.The main drawback of the book is that it does not address social capital in terms of the connections between the individuals in the organization and most stakeholders (like customers, suppliers, partners, owners, lenders, and the communities the company serves). These connections are more important in those dimensions discussed in the book than the equivalent connections within the company. So this omission is a pretty significant limitation of the book.The major secondary drawback of the book is that those who work in organizations like the ones described here with lots of social capital (UPS, SAS Institute, and J &amp; J) will probably find little that is new. For those who are insensitive to the importance of social connections, this book will seem too amorphous and nonquantitative to change minds. If the target is to make those with low emotional intelligence become more effective and supportive, this book won't make the grade. It's preaching to the choir, without enough discipline in defining its prescriptions. For example, the book argues that cubicles with lots of sight lines are great for improving communications. But those who need quiet time and places to work for extended periods will tell you that cubicles drive them up the wall and reduce certain kinds of productivity. What's the best way to encourage both more communications and quiet thinking time when it's needed?If you are interested in seeing lots of case histories on these subjects, you would probably enjoy the parts of The Dance of Change that focus on improving communication, trust, and connection.After you finish this book, think about where your organization needs more trust, where you need more connections within and without the company, and how you can create a more cohesive creativity on the significant opportunities that face you.Be open to the positive potential of the new, and help others to see it also!"},{"Title":"In Good Company: How Social Capital Makes Organizations Work","review":"Why do new CEOs staff the company with their men?Why are women under-represented un the business world?Why could some succeed in launching and establishing new enterprises while other couldn&iexcl;t manage do so?Why are the MBA degree craved, while there is no link between MBA results and future salary?Social capital is supposed to be the answer to these questions. Social capital is widely exploited to emphasize the social nature of work: the work is the social process. Previously, corporate culture is used to point out such a nature. Organization&iexcl;s culture means the set of rites and rituals that give it its unique character. Culture is the &iexcl;way things are done around here.&iexcl; The HP way, for example, the open-plan, walkabout management style laid down in the 1950s, by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, a style that still imbues the company today. But culture is a elusive concept. It&iexcl;s too soft to be managed. One executive asserted that &iexcl;the only culture round here is in the yoghurts in the canteen.&iexcl; Nevertheless, though too soft to grasp, it&iexcl;s very real one. So many M&As; have been botched for clashes between corporate cultures. It&iexcl;s real but too elusive to manage and grasp. Social capital is introduced to ground it on tangible material base. Then what is social capital? Social capital refers attributes like trust, commitment, attachment and so forth which belongs to active connections among people, in other word, network and community.When the God decided to put a stop to human-being&iexcl;s first great collective enterprise, he confused their language so they could no longer understand one another, and could not carry out the joint project, Tower of Babel. Carry a heavy stone could be done without words. The real problem was the loss of understanding that cannot be mimed or diagrammed. Without common speech, the tower&iexcl;s planners could not have inspired others to join the project, workers could not have learned to trust each other&iexcl;s judgment, resolve unexpected problems together, or count on each other&iexcl;s help in dangerous situations. In other words, what they lost was not just common language, but the social capital which was probably more critical than the failure of information exchange.Some schools in economics of organization characterized the firm as the flow of information. It&iexcl;s hard to deny. In this regard, however, corporate culture is no more than each company&iexcl;s idiosyncratic frame to each processing info: the firm is no more than a cybernetic system. But the firm is a social process built on community and network. Culture is what resides in community and network within personnel.Moreover, organization&iexcl;s knowledge and capabilities lies not in official hierarchy but in unofficial community of practice. Most job training occurs after workers join a firm. They learn by dong on the shop floor. There is always a manual that describes how to operate a particular machine or conduct a job. As times passes, however, workers are apt to devise better ways to do the job and surpass the manual. And this is the collective process. As they work together, knowledge slowly moves from person to person. Network and community are not only the repository of corporate knowledge and capacities, but also the incubator of collaboration, especially voluntary collaboration that does not rely on external incentives. They help create and sustain our personal identities, the intrinsic satisfactions of praise, respect, and gratitude from fellow members. Those have more meaning and power than little prizes or even monetary rewards.Now, I think, you&iexcl;ve got what is social capital. Above, I followed the style of the book which does not burden the reader with abstract concepts, but illustrate the picture of social capital with real world examples, to enlighten readers to the practical meaning of social capital in their own workplace. With closing the last page. I bet you get the crux and import of social capital."},{"Title":"The Official College Guide. 1999: Soccer (Official Guides to College Sports and College Scholarships) (Annual)","review":"My daughter is now playing at a Division II program thanks to this book.

This book by Randy Skretvedt is the BEST book on this subject. Hands down. No contest. Easily. It is a magical time capsule that takes you INSIDE the creation of the greatest film comedies ever made. You'll have a first hand sense of what happened at the Hal Roach Studios in the 1930's so compelling that you'll actually feel like you were there, standing by, watching The Boys shoot their movies. Skretvedt doesn't pull critical punches either. This is an honest look at how these films were made, what worked, what didn't and how they evolved. If you love these movies, Laurel And Hardy The Magic Behind The Movies is absolutely ESSENTIAL for your library. You will read it and re-read it until you'll need a second copy!

Having been weaned on the books of Prof. John McCabe (including his seminal work, \\"Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy\\"), I actually believed that everything that could be said about those two funny gentlemen had already been written. Simply put, I was wrong. Author Randy Skretvedt had personally interviewed dozens of Hal Roach employees and provided a much deeper insight into the working conditions of the legendary \\"Lot of Fun\\" (as the Roach Studio was affectionately known during the late-silent and early-sound eras). My favorite chapter in the book is \\"The Method of the Madness,\\" which includes a highly evocative description of what it was like to work on a Laurel and Hardy movie. It is thrilling to read. Following that is a detailed examination of each of the team's films, from 1927 to 1950. The information was a revelation to me, and, remember, I had been a student of the Laurel and Hardy films for twenty-five years! Fifteen additional years have passed since this book made its first favorable impression on me, and it remains the definitive volume on Laurel and Hardy's creative process.

Carole Seddon is fairly recently retired, divorced, and introspective. Carole is careful in everything she does, including the impressions she makes. Her fairly new neighbor, Jude, is just the opposite. Jude (a woman her age who avoids using her last name . . . of which she has had at least two) has a mysterious background that seem to include lots of different men and a variety of alternative healing skills. Carole is good at bringing order to Jude's life, and Jude brings some excitement into Carole's existence. In four past books, they've teamed up in successful solutions to murders.In The Hanging in the Hotel, Jude is pressed into service as a waitress for a catered event at her friend's hotel, Hopwicke Country House Hotel. Suzy Longthorne, the hotel's owner, is Jude's age, but Suzy has kept the looks that once made her face and figure a regular feature in the tabloids. Suzy has however fallen on hard times. She's divorced and all of her money is tied up in the hotel. Her once-exclusive place for the rich, famous, and affluent wannabes now has to scramble for crumbs . . . which is what it's like to host the Pillars of Sussex, an unusually misogynistic group of local male movers and shakers. As the men drink too much and say obnoxious things, Suzy and Jude just grin and bear it.Jude is jolted however when the happy young man she helped into bed turns up dead by hanging the next morning. Everyone is quickly convinced it's suicide, except Jude. A cover-up also seems in the works, along with continual pressure on Jude to change her mind. Carole Seddon is brought into Jude's investigation, and the two are soon off turning rocks over.Carole's life is also turned a bit upside down by the news that her only child is engaged and wants Carole to meet his fianc&eacute;e. This development also adds new windows onto the development of Carole as a character in the series.A lot of the humor in the book is extremely heavy handed. But it's still in good fun as you see people go to great lengths to secure small advantages for themselves. But behind the humor, there's the dark face of evil. Simon Brett does a good job of hinting at the evil and letting you use your imagination. If you think about what's hinted here, the ham-handed humor will remind you of how Shakespeare used clowns and fools to lighten his darkest tragedies.I thought that the implied evil was the best part of the book.

The focus should be less on the cleverness of the form of the poem or the word choice. Good poetry should be beautiful, effortless, entertaining. This isn't.I am not trying to sound mean here. This is just my opinion."},{"Title":"1 hundred hiccups","review":"This 8 1/2 x 8 1/2 book is thick, built like a large novella as opposed to a book of poetry. The handsomely designed blue charcoal cover has a sliced image of five shining slivers of reprinted film negatives-the book looks \`artsy.' And within the stripes of film are two reproduced window frame pictures, aglow with a shade hanging dutifully. After reading this book of poems and looking at the cover, I can only imagine the poet inside one of these windows, sitting at type-writer, with his cigarettes and scotch next to him, pining over this \`Courtney\\" for whom the dedication reads.Mike Kadela's first book of poems, 1 hundred hiccups, is brilliantly written. Simply stated, he is writing in a manner that no other poet is paying attention to. He replaces the boring rhetoric of the first person, free-verse, \\"anything-goes-look-at-my-pain\\", with a deliberately crafted meter. As a result, Kadela comes across as a modern day Shakespeare trapped with the wit of Hunter S. Thompson: \\"whereabout the heart hopskotches/blocks by blocks/and loutishly trips/o'er the furious locks/of your impossible hair/pardon my stare/but my eyes have a notion...which is manymuch/your lips.\\" .... Borrowing from the path that often ignored poets like ee cumming and John Berryman have presented before him, he engages the reader with his obsessive lingering for love. Fulfilling his poet role, Kadela as poet stands where few of us go, stating that \\"if I can't have her, I can't have my heart\\". He is a romantic.

They don't seem like real critiques. It really is not a very good read. He's an OK performer; a bit on the pretentious side. The only thing I liked about this is the cover. My friend also liked the cover, but little of what was inside. Sorry if this sounds harsh, but it's true.

He was the \\"feature\\" for the night and lived up to the name beautifully. The incredible wordplay found in his book is only further enhanced by his impassioned performance.He chooses to write his poems in a style that few modern poets have the courage to attempt. With this solid foundation he creates lyrical gems that both delight and provoke. I cannot recommend this poet enough. He's fantastic on the page and powerful in person."},{"Title":"1 hundred hiccups","review":"This 8 1/2 x 8 1/2 book is thick, built like a large novella as opposed to a book of poetry. The handsomely designed blue charcoal cover has a sliced image of five shining slivers of reprinted film negatives-the book looks \`artsy.' And within the stripes of film are two reproduced window frame pictures, aglow with a shade hanging dutifully. After reading this book of poems and looking at the cover, I can only imagine the poet inside one of these windows, sitting at type-writer, with his cigarettes and scotch next to him, pining over this \`Courtney\\" for whom the dedication reads.Mike Kadela's first book of poems, 1 hundred hiccups, is brilliantly written. Simply stated, he is writing in a manner that no other poet is paying attention to. He replaces the boring rhetoric of the first person, free-verse, \\"anything-goes-look-at-my-pain\\", with a deliberately crafted meter. As a result, Kadela comes across as a modern day Shakespeare trapped with the wit of Hunter S. Thompson: \\"whereabout the heart hopskotches/blocks by blocks/and loutishly trips/o'er the furious locks/of your impossible hair/pardon my stare/but my eyes have a notion...which is manymuch/your lips.\\" ....

I bought this book after having the privilege of meeting (and later performing with) Mike Kadela, thanks to my connections with his publisher Mark Eleveld. I really can't say enough good things about Kadela's work; it's such a rare gem in modernist poetry. Even if you can't relate to Kadela's &quot;hopeless Romantic&quot; themes, read this book just for the sheer joy of language. Watch the way assonance hides on every line; look for the laundry lists of forms (iambic octameter is one of my personal favorites), the rhyme schemes, the amazing diction. I find myself reading it aloud just because the words feel so damn good when they roll off the tongue.If you are a poet or just like poetry, pick up this book; you will not be disappointed.

Chart's seemingly perfect life is suddenly shattered by the death of his wife in an automobile accident, for which cannot help but feel guilty.When his wife passes away, Chart decides to run away to Europe, in an effort to reconstruct his life. He winds up in Florence, where most of the novel takes place. He has realized that all that he is, is a good architect, and apart from that his life is very empty. He had thought of himself as a well cultured person, only to realize that on the contrary, he is quite ignorant. His circle of friends in Colorado consists of a group of superficial characters, from which he must run away. He makes up his mind to become a european history scholar, which he sees as a way to live a better life.In his process to relive his life, he meets Olivia, a cold hearted Italian history professor, with whom he falls deeply in love with.While in Italy, he develops a relationship with the American colony, which is also filled with a set of pretty superficial characters.The plot flows with much ease, and the 200+ pages are both involving and easy to read.Chart, Olivia, and a few of the secondary characters are extremely well developed, humanized and extremely believable characters.I would not consider the book to be a page turner, but none the less, it is definitely a novel worth reading.Chart's effort to rebuild his life, his being exposed to real love for the first time, and his effort to survive in a new world, quite different from his own, provide for a few hours of entertainment. He never becomes a historian, but he is able to turn his life around."},{"Title":"World So Wide;","review":"Sinclair Lewis died in Florence, Italy January 10, 1951. His last novel, published shortly after his death, is set in Florence and portrays a segment, generally unlovely, of Florence's expatriate communities, mainly American.WORLD TOO WIDE is the story of young, recently widowed ex-Army major and architect Hayden Chart. He strives mightily to find personal meaning in Florence. Beautiful fellow American Dr Olivia Lomond is a budding scholar who tempts him to make his mind grow in appreciation of art and history. But earthy, honest Roxanna Eldritch,home town girl and reporter sent to Europe to cover the 1950 Holy Year in Rome, improbably wins Chart's heart in the end.Apart from its utility as a tourist guide to Florence, WORLD TOO WIDE is Sinclair Lewis's last chance to skewer pretentiousness and hypocrisy. His instrument for ferreting out lies among the expatriates is red-headed American reporter Roxanna (Roxy) Eldritch. She had been a friend of Hayden's recently deceased wife back in their native Newlife, Colorado. Towards novel's end Roxy punctures the facades of two expatriates.First is young, proto-fascist pseudo-intellectual American Lorenzo Lundsgard who is preparing a series of lectures supported by films and shoddy research designed to prove that history teaches that great men have always ruled the world through their innate gifts of leadership. Roxy's contacts as a journalist allow her to confront him with his lies about his real Christian name, Oley. He had, moreover, been married twice and was twice messily divorced, despite his claims never to have wed. Lundsgard is a favorite of and financially dependent on the next phony that Roxanna skewers.With Lorenzo, Roxy was just warming up for Sir Henry Belfont, an English gentleman's English gentleman, a snob with infinite contempt for all things American. Roxy's sources have revealed Sir Henry's true past: he was born in Ohio; his grandfather had made a fortune selling shoddy goods to both sides in the Civil War; Lundsgard never saw England until age 14, later bought a seat in Parliament and a title. The enraged Belfont turns on Lundsgard, cuts off his funding for research, lectures and documentary films and, somehow, some way, drives our hero Hayden Chart definitively into the arms of the spunky, honest, all American Roxy Eldritch. Lundsgard then inexplicably lands a cushy foreign service job in South America and Olivia Lomond seems disposed to go there with him at the curtain.In 1914 Sinclair Lewis's first novel OUR MR. WRENN began outside the Nickelorion movie house in New York City. 1951's WORLD TOO WIDE, Lewis's final novel, endedwith the hero and his new bride happily in a bar in Ravenna, Italy. The world of SInclair Lewis was not often deep but it was always wide. He traveled through it ever restless to end in drink, dissipation and loneliness. R.I.P.-OOO-"},{"Title":"World So Wide;","review":"We all know that a World So Wide was Mr. Lewis's last novel. There have been many biographies on Lewis. A number of them dismiss a World So Wide as just another version of Dodsworth. Yes, there are similarities, but grouping both stories together is misunderstanding what Sinclair Lewis was trying to get at in his last novel. In Dodsworth, Lewis was writing from his brother, Claude's, perspective. In a World So Wide, we get a more personal reflection into Sinclair himself. This last book may be his most personal. . . & final chapter of his life."},{"Title":"World So Wide;","review":"World So Wide is about a man named Hayden Chart from Colorado. His wife was killed in an automobile accident. He takes a trip to Italy for the year. While there he meets a woman named Olivia Lomond, Hayden falls in love with her, but another man starts to take Olivia away form him. Hayden trys very hard through out the book to blend in with the Italian society by learning their language and culture.As you read through the book it has very well developed characters, a well developed plot, and it shows you what Italy's culture is like and how they react to tourist. Thought the book it had parts that jump around a little bit and get confusing at times but other than that it is a very good book and flows very nicely."},{"Title":"The Wally Weet Stories: Catholic School Boys Don't Just Fight After School","review":"Bill Bruehl's title character-alter ego doesn't discuss winter sports, but in most of his adventures, from pre-school to newly married, Wally skates on thin ice. Bruehl draws on his long experience as actor-director-playwright to produce dramatic scenes:*being in constant conflict with nuns, priest, and fellow students at Catholic schools*looking for his lucky break on Broadway in his mid-teens without help from parents or high school drama coach*riding ninety miles an hour on a double date on prom night with a buddy who has just that day gotten his driver's license*having his sexual initiation as a teenager with a thirtysomething woman who may also be his father's mistress*losing blood after walking out of a hospital the day following throat surgery and striking off to another town to begin work as assistant manager of a Woolworth's store*\\"borrowing\\" from the Woolworth's tax-money boxes when his personal finances run short*facing multiple risks of court martial when he falsifies his military documents and later engages in a black market scheme with goods from the PX*theatening to drive off and leave his wife of one year after they quarrel over whether the back window in their car should be open or shut as they rideThe sub-title, \\"Catholic School Boys Don't Just Fight After School,\\" pertains to a signifcant aspect of Wally-Bill's life, although -- as noted -- these memoirs cover a much broader span of life than parochial school. Against his wishes, Wally's parents push him to fight back against physical assaults from school mates, but the elder Weets disapprove when he fights against intellectual and spiritual assaults on his person by the faculty. After running away from fights, Wally comes out on top, physically and metaphorically, when he finally is forced to fight and pulverizes the class bully and gains grudging respect from other boys on the playground. His misgivings about church dogma are solidified in a senior apologetics class (intended to turn teenage Catholics into defenders of the faith) which has a boomerang effect. When the priest-teacher belittles Wally's questioning, this is the culmination of twelve years of \\"don't ask-don't think\\" schooling. Wally is driven to agnosticism.Wally's derring-do, which leads him to skate on thin ice, also helps him develop life skills, as he works alongside his never-quite-successful restaurant owner father in renovating dilapidated buildings and reconstructing a caved-in parking lot; and as he works long hours learning the ropes with managing the five-and-dime."},{"Title":"The Wally Weet Stories: Catholic School Boys Don't Just Fight After School","review":"Through the stories of Wally Weet, author Bill Bruehl skillfully draws readers into a sense of place and love of family amidst a gathering storm of emotions and conflict. For those who grew up in the age of \\"genteel poverty\\" during the depression and WWII, the true-to-life stories will strike a familiar chord. For those who come from a strict Irish Catholic background, readers will reflect, sometimes with a smile, sometimes with a shudder, \\"Yes! That's the way it was.\\"Wally learns the value of hard work at an early age from his father, Big Brian, who believes fiercely in The American Dream. But Wally never learns to conform. His intelligence, his innate talent for drama, spawned by a need to be noticed and accepted among his peers in an all boys Catholic School keeps him in a constant state of rebellion, often on the brink of self-destruction. Crucial losses at a young age turn pain into rage.A chapter entitled \\"Prom Date\\" portrays a poignant picture of a dream come true as Wally schemes and works his way through a maze of hurdles for an unforgettable high school prom night with his girlfriend.With dreams of drama and adventure, Wally careens toward adulthood, sexual encounters, threats of expulsion from school, a stint in the army, and a passion for literature. There seems no middle ground among the highs and lows of Wally's life. Thus, as Wally passes the threshold of adulthood, it is easy to guess that he is destined to embrace the protests of the 1960s.Ultimately, Wally meets his match with the cool assurance of his beautiful wife, Marnie. In an unforgettable scene, Wally senses a major shift within himself - sort of an epiphany leaving us with a beautiful ending."},{"Title":"The Wally Weet Stories: Catholic School Boys Don't Just Fight After School","review":"Amusing, poignant, insightful are words that come to mind upon readingthe madcap adventures of Wally Weet. Wally's experiences, such as hisearly introduction to prejudice (you have to be taught to beprejudiced), his bouncing through family foibles, and his stumblingthrough first sexual awakenings trip the reader into reminiscences ofhis/her own.However, for those of us who went through public school education, weget to see a parallel universe in Wally's catholic school education.This repressed environment, in which a lid is placed on a natural boy'sexuberance, can only result in acting out; some of which is describedby Wally's humorous planned revolt in 8th grade, some of which is stillcontinuing into adulthood portrayed in the disproportionate surprisingrage in the closing story.The episodes of Wally's Army career show play writer and author BillBruehl's inclination to use wit and drama to polish a good yarn.\\"The Wally Weet Stories: Catholic School Boys Don't Just Fight AfterSchool\\" is both light and delightful reading."},{"Title":"The Wally Weet Stories: Catholic School Boys Don't Just Fight After School","review":"A good read !

It is written in something of a \\"heroes of science and industry\\" tone that itself helps to convey the straightforward sense of urgency and righteousness that drove the development of the Bomb, and it completely captivated me and began for me a lifelong fascination with the Manhattan Project.

The challenges that faced the Nobel Laureates, scientists, engineers, managers of American's largest corporations, and military were beyond imagination. Groueff does an excellent job developing character profiles of people involved in the Project -- all in brief sketches.You will especially enjoy this account if you have ever visited or traveled through Oak Ridge, TN, Hanford, WA, Los Alamos, NM, the University of Chicago, the old Woolworth Building in New York, DuPont Chemical Company, the American Chicle Company chewing gum factory in New York... well, maybe you get the idea how varied the real story is."},{"Title":"Manhattan Project: The Untold Story of the Making of the Atomic Bomb","review":"I agree with all the other comments, the only fault is how 'rushed' the book gets near the end.

The process needed 10,000 tons of copper when there was none to spare, so they &quot;borrowed&quot; more than 10,000 tons of silver from the US Treasury and melted it down to wire for the magnets in the separation processing.

None equal this book, and if I had to choose only one reference book, it would be Stephane Groueff's Manhattan Project: The Untold Story of the Making of the Atomic Bomb."},{"Title":"Manhattan Project: The Untold Story of the Making of the Atomic Bomb","review":"The Manhattan Project is a book that explains and tells us how the Atomic bomb was made. This is also a book that tells us how it was a race against other countries, especially Japan to get the bomb done first. People in the states were scared about others countries getting done first and landing the bombs on the United States. The problems that we had trying to get this little toy made. It shows and explains the process in which it was made and also the scientist that they picked to make the two bombs that landed on Japan.This book is definitely a book that I would recommend to read to help further your knowledge on the past. If you don't know how the bombs were made or why they were made this book is very enjoyable to read. It is a rather lengthy book, but if you like to read then you would love to read this. This book is very useful to learn more about the technologies that we had back around WWII and also to just realize where the big boom of technology started. Before this we did try to learn more about technology, but that was mostly to help everybody out. From the time when they made the atomic bomb is when they started building more technologies in the defense for our nation.This book is defiantly a readable book. Most people can read a book if I can finish one. I am not much of a fast or good reader, so if I can read a book then most likely everybody will be able to read the book. Most of the terminology in the book is fairly easy to understand and to read. This book may take a couple of weeks to read, but in the end it is a great book and I would recommend it highly. This book is a book that you can read anywhere. It is not like some books where you either have to be in a mood or have to read in a certain spot to get the feel of the book. This is book is a great reading book right before bed or just when you have some free time at work.You can almost put anything as being part of technology or have technology part of it. This book goes great in depth about the atomic bomb. Some say one of our greatest inventions ever made. This is the technology that helped us win a war and also to defend our nations. This is definitely one of the high points in both science and technology in our past and future that is for sure. The technology for atomic weapons just keeps getting more accurate and high-tech. Now days you can use a remote control to direct a weapon where as in the book and WWII they had to use planes to drop them over the target.On a scale from one to ten I would give this book a nine. It may be a little less than a nine if you are not interested in the wars and technology such as bombs. I loved this book and will probably read it again sometime in the future."},{"Title":"Anthropology: Contemporary Perspectives (8th Edition)","review":"Again, I bought this for my son's schooling.

Pronouncements to David regarding his sons in the Book of Samuel are matched to Luke's passages in which Gabriel foretells Jesus' greatness. Hannah's song from Samuel, which begins \\"My heart exalts in the Lord; my strength is exalted in the Lord...\\" is matched with Mary's response to Gabriel: \\"My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior...\\"Comparisons such as these are a staple in Sri's work, but he also offers collateral insights, such as the discussion on Joseph's response to Mary's pregnancy. Three major theories are described. First, Joseph may have been being kind to Mary by not publicly accusing her of adultery, for which the punishment was death by stoning. Second, Joseph may have been aware that Mary had conceived in the Holy Spirit and thus humbly offered to release her from the obligation to be his wife. Third, Joseph may have been confused, knowing that Mary was pregnant but also believing in her innocence.Sri, an assistant professor of theology at Benedictine College in Atchison, Ks., bases his commentary on contemporary biblical scholarship and insights from Catholic tradition.

The writing is not very good, and the plot is even worse. Why would Han and Leia just take off like that in the middle of an alliance mission meanwhile their friends are wondering where they are or if they're dead or alive? And Hollagram Fun World is just plain silly. This is definity a series for younger kids. I myself enjoyed it when I was younger, but now just about anything else would be better."},{"Title":"Queen of the Empire (Star Wars: Jedi Prince, Book 5)","review":"It's OK to have a STAR WARS BOOK where Han and Leia almost get killed together and so realize how much they are in love and want to get married.

And what a cool place they go to to get married, HOLOGRAM FUN WORLD, it's like sort of Los Vegas in outer space. And OK so Leia gets duped by a magician and is captured. Anybody could.

This book does a good job of filling in the gaps. It has a lot more student-oriented activities than I'm used to, but they were very helpful when I sensed the class was losing interest in my lecture. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"How to Write Book Reports 3E (How to Write Book Reports, 3rd ed)","review":"For all of us who have reviewing as a hobby - and especially for college students, to whom this work is targeted to a text that shows the correct way to present an opinion is a godsend. In today's world, most of us are eager to express our feelings, to communicate our own impressions on everything that surrounds us. Sadly, a lot of our credibility slips through the cracks because of our own inability to present a valid argument, independently of it being true or not (after all, who owns The Truth?). As stated in Chapter 1, under the title of &quot;The rewards of writing reviews&quot;, &quot;You will learn to analyze your tastes, your likes, and dislikes, and back up your statements of opinion with sound reasoning&quot; (Page 4).&quot;How to write book reports&quot; includes all the tools and suggestions needed for effective reviewing. I liked very much the idea of presenting the &quot;History of the Essay&quot;, as a reference on how it all began, since right up to the sixteenth century, as the author points out, everything that was considered culturally acceptable was always written in verse. It was since then, that qualified reviewers had been relied upon for almost everything mankind has been interested in trying. Sova devotes a whole chapter to the qualifications of the reviewer, be he an expert scholar or a starting student looking for good grades. Organization is the key not only of effective review-writing but also of everything that makes a good impression. The book divides the actual task of writing the report into three phases: preparing, organizing and writing it, providing in this way an actual blueprint for a flawless work. There are also suggestions on how to review the different literary genres, and an Appendix with further exercises to be done either orally or written, to provide fresh outlooks to the task. To give practical examples, a few sample reviews are provided; of a novel, a play, a short-story collection and a biography.I hesitated at first about buying this slim volume because I saw it too high school, instead of professionally, oriented. Once I looked at its contents, I felt almost sure I had made a good choice. After having started to read it, I knew I had indeed purchased a simple but valuable volume. The book takes the fear (and boredom as well), out of reviewing assignments. The techniques suggested can be applied not only to literature but to anything related to art and culture, e.g.: music, cinema, graphic arts, etc. Dawn Sova intends to make the task of writing reviews an enjoyable experience, as she puts it herself &quot;Reading, especially outside reading, should be fun&quot; (Page 3). Throughout the book and in only ninety pages, she achieves this with a bang.As a final suggestion, I would also recommend that you visit the publisher's website, called The Education Supersite, especially if you are just starting your own college period. It can be an invaluable resource as well if you are planning to go back to school, to find out about everything from financial aid to test preparation and universities that offer all types of online degrees."},{"Title":"How to Write Book Reports 3E (How to Write Book Reports, 3rd ed)","review":"There are few books on the market today with information about writing professional book reviews. How to Write Book Reports by Harry Teitelbaum is a reference device, written with the high school or college student in mind, but can be a handy tool for the discerning reviewer. The author actually explains the difference between a book report and a book review, and shares the rewards of writing reviews.Because it is written for student use, the general focus is on book reports in essay form that would be graded by a teacher or professor. Be prepared to take a nostalgic journey back to high school English class, complete with grammar lessons. However, the outlined essay form can be a useful plan for organizing thoughts on an ungraded book review. The same rules a student would follow while writing a report can assist in creating a polished review that lends credence to the reviewer's opinions.Teitelbaum advises the reader to take notes as they read. He provides several lists of questions to consider that generate thoughtful review material. These questions could be the most beneficial tool for the professional reviewer, as they are a springboard for critical analysis. For all writers, a list of proofreading symbols for editing is included at the back of the book. (Although, I wish the author would have taken a bit more time to proofread his own work. On page 30, he refers to author Stephen Crane as a female.)How to Write Book Reports would be a helpful addition to any English professor's teaching curriculum. It shows the student how writing book reports and reviews can be a fulfilling task beyond the grade the instructor assigns. For those who have already discovered the joys of reviewing, this book can be an important aid for honing writing skills."},{"Title":"How to Write Book Reports 3E (How to Write Book Reports, 3rd ed)","review":"You already know how to write book reports if you can say what you dislike about a book or why you like it. Book reporting blends opinions with details: you take personal reactions based on your experiences and knowledge from life and other books; then back them up with facts and incidents from the book and with logic and reasoning. Along the way, you need to think not only what the book was about but also why it was written: for example, literature can bring out emotions or teach us something. So in the end, you want to say if the book did what the author wanted it to and if it is worth reading: these are the last thoughts that you leave with the reader. Harry Teitelbaum writes so well that what he says can be applied to any kind of writing, and I like to think that book reporting is the next best thing to the actual writing. His book leads in to other books on short, to the point writing: Mervin Block's WRITING BROADCAST NEWS, Syd Field's SCREENPLAY, Louisa Peat O'Neil's TRAVEL WRITING, and Elizabeth Penfield's SHORT TAKES."},{"Title":"How to Write Book Reports 3E (How to Write Book Reports, 3rd ed)","review":"When I finished this book ,I was tempted to give it a 3* but after reading the other reviews;two 5* and two 3*,I decided to go with 5*.There are a lot of good points made in these reviews and well worth reading.I can't pass up the temptation of reviewing these reviews;s collectively they merit 5*,at least \\"in my opinion\\".First of all,it is the one and only book that I have seen, devoted exclusively to writing reviews;and covers in a formal way just about everything that should be covered,and why.It is much like a teaching aid or text,and therefore is directed towards a formal review.So,if you are the type who wants for formality,this book will provide it for you.Personally,even though I am an Engineer,and understand the reason for order,I prefer much more personal freedom in my reading and reviewing,and also in the reviews of others.We all went through the formality of schooling.We all had to read \\"assigned reading\\" and write book reports and reviews.I,for one,never obtained my love for reading,and particularly that of writing reviews from my schooling exposure.As a matter of fact,by the time I finished university,I didnt even want to read anymore.A few years later,I picked up \\"Cannery Row\\" by Steinbeck,(Steinbeck was never ever mentioned in my school or university)and I enjoyed it so much,I proceeded to search for his other novels and one by one read them all.And so started my love for reading.Over the years my reading continuedto increase,and even so much that I began to write reviews here on Amazon,and love every bit of it.I have come to the conclusion that the education system is sadly lacking in two areas.First, we are not taught to read properly and no mention is made of Speed Reading or Memory Training.These are both great skills to have.As I see it, education is designed around correcting the student rather than inspiring him.I once was on a boat heading out to the Gulf Stream off Cape Hatteras,N.C.,and got into a long discussion with a retired University President.I told him about how I saw things and that in all my years in school and university,that there were only two teachers who inspired me in the least.His reply was \\"If you had more than one ,consider yourself lucky\\".As a person ,I really liked my High School Literature teacher,but he never inspired me to read.On the other hand,one day I was telling my High School Math teacher how fascinated I was with Logarithms.He reached in his desk and pulled out a Slide Rule.He asked me if I had ever seen on.Of course I hadn't and he showed me what one could do with it.He sent me off with it and an instruction manual.That inspired me, and later I graduated in Electrical Engineering .In those days,before calculators and computers,a Slide Rule was an Engineer's stock in trade.So if it's it's the fundamentals of a review you are looking for;this book is excellent.However,if it's inspiration for writing reviews;this book just won't give it.However,to be fair,my 5* rating was because the author's intent with this book was to instruct as opposed to inspiring,and it certainly does that."},{"Title":"How to Write Book Reports 3E (How to Write Book Reports, 3rd ed)","review":"This book is an easy read and offers lots of advice that will make the job/task of writing a book review or book report easier. While most of us realize that giving our opinions on a book we've read is something we do verbally without preparation at the drop of a question -- writing a report/review takes preparation and time. In this book you get hints on what to take notes on, how to document so that when it comes time to write the report the information you need is easily found. There's also lists of questions for each genre type that can help to focus your approach.Simply, useful overview for beginning reviewers."},{"Title":"Strange fruit,: A novel","review":"I don't think I've ever read a book as complete in so many different ways as this one. It had a lot of intelligent insight about people and society, it made my cry, it made me laugh, it made me swoon at the love story, the language was beautiful, and half way through the story, the suspense got really exciting. I can't think what more I could ever ask for in a book. This book is about race relations in the early 20th century South, but it's also about so much more than that. It's about the need we all have to find our place in this world and to be accepted and loved. This book is for anyone who's ever felt like an outcast in society. It's also for anyone who's ever really loved anyone, whether it was a family member or a romantic love, and whether they received love back in return or not."},{"Title":"Strange fruit,: A novel","review":"Strange Fruit is an excellent portrayal of race relations inthe deep South of the 1920's. It is a deeply moving story of forbiddenlove, and the inability of both whites and blacks in the early South to shed the long standing racial bigotry and prejudice, so prevalent in that era."},{"Title":"Strange fruit,: A novel","review":"Lilian Smith took on the Jim Crow racial system of the American Deep South and the hypocrisy of white southern Christians head on in her seminal 1950 memoirKillers of the Dream, making the subject of her 1944 novel \\"Strange Fruit\\" in a sense no surprise to current day readers. In 1944, a different reaction met the book as it was widely criticized and even banned and confiscated - the book's blurb says for profanity (that I didn't even notice) and its incendiary depiction of a small Georgia town during a life and death crisis. Its power undiluted, \\"Strange Fruit\\" still became the best-selling novel in America in 1944.Again, religion plays a big role in Smith's book - this time a weeklong series of revival meetings during the early 1920s serves as the backdrop for the story. In front is a years-before-it-became-acceptable romance between Tracy, son of the town's white physician, and Nonnie, the youngest daughter in the town's leading black family. Born of a chilvarous act during the girl's childhood, and surviving absences from the town by both lovers - she to go to college and he to serve in World War I, the love affair goes along very quietly behind the scenes until Nonnie reveals to Tracy that she is pregnant with his child and happy to be so.As with most dramatic star-crossed romances, this one spirals toward a tragedy that the people in both White Town and Colored Town of Maxwell, Georgia struggle to deal with. Along with depicting the tender interracial love affair, Smith deftly handles a myriad of relationships - parent/child, husband/wife, sister/brother, doctor/patient, business/labor, master/servant, and preacher/parishioner both within and across the racial divide, when such interaction is allowed. Again the hyprocrisy of religion in the form the revival and events in the town is palpable, and even reaches the consciousness of the preacher, who, after the central tragedy, guesses that adult attendance will be down, and therefore schedules an extended youth worship. On a side note, the dialect of the \\"kuntry\\" blacks becomes a bit thick at time, but can be understood with careful reading.White Southerners rationalized the system based on their prejudices about black people, fears about the consequences of a equalized social system, and the strange notion that blacks were somehow better off under white domination than in lives where they could enjoy all the fruits of life. Blacks were faced with a Hobson's choice - relative physical comfort gained by submission vs. likely punishment or worse for resistance.Reading \\"Strange Fruit\\" makes even more clear the necessity of leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the mass civil rights movement. Without it, individuals who chose to live a color-blind life, those who reacted to such \\"transgressions\\", and even innocent black bystanders, who ostensibly bought into the system and played by its rules, lived very perilous lives.Five stars and a very strong recommendation to all readers, except young children who will be stymied by the dialect, for an especially powerful novel, given that it was written by a white woman in the 1940s, when Jim Crow's rule was still strong in the American Deep South."},{"Title":"Strange fruit,: A novel","review":"Strange Fruit is an amazing, eye-opening, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, and often -- indeed, at nearly every page -- startlingly shocking book.

I've never been so drawn in and affected by a piece of literature. If anyone out there is having any doubts about getting this book, DON'T. I can't even explain it...one of THE best things I've ever read, simply unforgetable.I really admire how this author is able to write from so many different perspectives as well, which shows how talented she is. This writer was able to capture the history of the south and racism in such an honest and fearless way. It is a love story, a fiction, but a non-fiction as well because everything that happens in this story is based on actual situations that happened in the old south between whites and blacks. I just love how this writer attacked it head on with such depth and honesty.

An event that was as real as the morning paper in the 1920s and 1930s when the White Citizens' Council was the dominant political party in the South. Told from the perspective of white civil rights activist, Lillian Smith, Strange Fruit is as applicable today as it was when first published in 1944. One need only look to the daily media trappings of the Kobe Bryant v. Colorado case to see the makings of a public lynching in the global village not so unlike that of Maxwell, Georgia in the 1920s."},{"Title":"Strange fruit,: A novel","review":"Unfortunately, I picked this book up by accident in the library. I can accept that Smith is a product of her time, but the content of this book is based on romantic myths about black culture. Of course Nonnie is happy she is having this white man's child, in the white male hierearchal system that we live in it is romanticized that all black women, and black people in general, want to claim what is white. This story is about Nonnie and how horribly mixed up she is. Why on earth would she return to Maxwell to chase after someone else's child when she has a college degree? She does have other options.

Included in this book are chapter after chapter of important primary documents from the late 19th century and World War I to the Historians Debate concerning Nazism in the late 20th century.Stackelberg includes a very readable introduction to each chapter that puts the documents in that chapter in their historical perspective. Most documents are ordered chronologically, however a few are thematically ordered because they're best viewed in that context.This isn't a book of just dry Nazi government documents either, it includes works from others that were influential in the development of the Nazi ideology, such as Wagner.In contrast to other books, such as the series by Nokes and Pridham, this book also includes an index, which prevents scholars from having to search through the entire book to find a document on a particular subject.This book should be read by anyone that has a serious interest in Nazi Germany."},{"Title":"The Nazi Germany Sourcebook: An Anthology of Texts","review":"Stackelberg and Winkle do a magnificent job of accumulating important primary sources into one, easily accessible sourcebook. Whether you are writing a dissertation on a topic of Nazi Germany, or are just looking for extra reading material, this book is not only useful, but also intriguing. Over 150 primary sources are included within the text, each including an introductory paragraph or two, which means you are getting your moneys worth.I initially bought this book for my Nazi Germany class, but found myself reading through it for fun. I had never been into the historical topic of Germany during the WWI and WWII period until I opened this book, but now its one of my favorite subjects. Many people think they know, at least in a moderate sense, about the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party, but questions about what influenced Hitler's radical anti-Semitism and how he was able to seize and use the emotions of one of the most intelligent nations in the world are answered. I recommend this book to anyone even vaguely interested in Nazi Germany or how one of the world's most devastating genocidal wars came about."},{"Title":"For My Grandchildren","review":"very interesting, all that a princess must think about all that one goes through in this world that very few knew of very interesting"},{"Title":"Integrated Cardiopulmonary Pharmacology","review":"This is a very good book for RT students. I like its organization and presentation. It is by far the best book available for basic pharmacology in terms of coverage and readability. I agree with another reviewer in that the students are actually reading the chapters on their own. The review questions in the book are nice but missing the answer key (at least for the instructors). The online review questions are mostly recall. I hope in the next edition, more application and clinical questions would be developed for the book and online review. Instead of references within the text, it uses a bibliography format at the end of the book. However, this is more than adequate for an introductory course. Finally, I know it can be \\"painful\\" to switch textbooks but this new book is definitely worthy of your time and effort. If you supplement the book with other resources available (printed or web-based), it can be as complete as any other pharmacology books currently available."},{"Title":"Integrated Cardiopulmonary Pharmacology","review":"I think Colbert and Mason have done a great job with a text that is typically student \\"unfriendly\\".

It's sad because it tells the story of the uncompromising conflict of ideologies between the English settlers and their Native American contemporaries. I watched the Disney movie first, which, though a bit cheesy, is lovable in its own way. The book was completely different. No happy ending, no romance, no love. Especially the chapter where True Son meets his relatives just seethes with hatred. I felt like Richter had tried to portray a fair picture of the wrong on both sides--although history may be forever ambiguous on that point--, but as such, the book makes for some pretty depressing material. The one redeeming factor, however, is its incredible portrayal of the Ohio wilderness. Richter's love for and appreciation of his homeland shine forth in lyrical truth that is not quickly forgotten. The book ends rather abruptly; reading its companion volume, A Country of Strangers, helps tie up the loose ends."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"I thought it was kind of boring, but I did learn some stuff the indiands felt from their side.

In addition, after True Son left his indian home to be with his biological parents, he had many conflicts at his house and nothing was resolved.

The story is about True Son, a white boy captured by the Lenni lenape indians and then reclaimed by his white family 11 years later.There are numerous reasons why this book isn't a good choice to force middle school students to read. (I say force because I don't know anyone, even avid readers such as myself, who would choose to read this.) The book is violent (and yet without action), it is boring, most of the characters are unlikable (and you can't like them for their unlikableness like you can with some \\"villians\\"), and let me say that if I were Native American, I would be offended reading this book. For two reasons; first, the Native Americans in this book call themselves Indians -- where as it wasn't the NA's who coined that term but Columbus, -- and second, although this is a historical fact that shouldn't be ignored, I don't think we need to read fiction about people who think the NA's were savages and killed them like flies.If school is intended to encourage us to read and learn, I have no idea why they would choose a book like this. It makes books seem boring and unrelated to teenagers. I think they should choose books that are interesting -- give us a break from textbook historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"I was supposed to read this book and write an alternate ending for school!

Its about a white boy who was kidnapped by Indians when he was a baby and then raised by those Indians.

At certain times in the book, the author seemed to stumble in portraying a certain scene or developing a character. Or, the author would ramble on about a small over exaggerated infracture, frailty, or flaw that the white man possessed. But, when in a scene of action, the author had you at a point where you couldn&#8217;t begin to ponder putting the book down. His gripping scenes of Indian vs. Anglo was astounding.In my opinion, this book is an excellent read for middle school students. It compels them in a series of historical events wound in to fit the guidelines of a fictional story. This book is challenging, but not an impossible read. Also, the vocabulary is something that all eighth graders can learn and relate to. The characters are easy to identify with, and students would enjoy reading further into the novel.If I had to recommend a historical fiction book to a fellow colleague, I would put this book as my number one choice. It includes action, violence, drama and even the masterful art of suspense. If I had to rate this book on a scale of 1-10, 1 being the worst 10 being the best, I would give it an 8. This is so because of the authors ramblings at points and his condescending tone when he speaks of Anglo-Americans. But aside from that, I loved the book."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"This story shows that the Indian culture and the white man culture may have been very different, but people are still people. True Son had to leave his Indian family to return to his white family. I realized through his dilemma that the same people we use as scapegoats, could be our own family. Although the real history of settlers and Indians was more violent, we learn in this book that its hard to co-exist without tolerance for others that are different. This book makes the reader think about their own actions and feelings toward others."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"The Light in the Forest is a book about a fifteen year old white boy that was raised by Indians, but he's currently returning to his biological family. This book was okay, to an extent. At first, the book seems so boring, but the further you read, the more interesting it gets. This story gives you an insight on how it was back in those days, when the Indians and whites were fighting over land. And it also makes you wonder: is family the people that brought you into this world, or the people that raise you, love you, and care for you when your sick? This book was fairly well. I suggest this book only for people who can handle the emotions and in-depthness that is involved with this book. I also suggest this book because it will help you realize who you are, and where you come from, and it also tells you that life is full of ups and downs, and the only way to survive is if you surround yourself with people that care about you, and you also have to face your problems; don't run away, be strong. Cowards run away from problems."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"The book is short but it goes through a whirlwind of emotions.True Son is taken from white settlers as a young child and then raised by a his Native American parents. He is then taken back to his white family and he is not willing to go back to those ways. His despair is tangible but then, with what follows (don't want to give spoilers) he's torn between the two worlds.Its a great read but it seems a little short and abrupt at times."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"Identity issues 1950s style, this YA story takes up the life of True Son, a white boy captured by Indians as a toddler and raised by them as one of their own for some eleven years. True Son is forcibly reunited with his white family, but has completely identified with his Indian family and tribe. The story largely revolves around his rather difficult reunion with his birth family, his resistance to their way, and his desire to return to the Indian tribe and world. I found some pleasure in the tension of whether birth or upbringing determines who a person is throughout the book and ending, but in spite of Richter's fine writing, found the book tedious at times and addressing the central issues in ways that felt dated. It's worth a fast read, but not an ovation."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"I just read this with my children. My opinion of this book is positive in that it didn't have a predictable ending and the author didn't present a one sided conversation. It is a well rounded book with points of view from indian to settlers. About midway it did start to sound a bit like it might be going the way of propaganda but straighten up immediately. I recommend for all readers. There is some graphic details about killings so parents would need to monitor for age appropriation."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"When I started reading \\"The Light in the Forest\\" I thought it was going to be one of those typical Davy Crockett \`boy who goes to live in the forest' books. What I was not expecting was the amount of culture and loyalty pounded into the pages. The way the Indians simply enjoyed living and coexisting with everything around them was astounding. The way that this boy saw the earth, the moon, and the animals as his kin amazed me, because in this day and age we think of animals as, well, just animals.The book wasn't terribly suspenseful, but it did keep me wanting to read to see if True Son would ever escape the clutches of his white family and get back to his Indian tribe. The way that Richter wrote the book actually turned me against True Son's white family and made me just about cheer when Half Arrow reappeared to help him escape.It also threw the end into sharp irony with the whole of the book, because now True Son is forced to leave again, not by white soldiers but by his former Indian tribe. The end to The Light in the Forest differs from other classics I've read by, instead of giving the main character a sweet and happy ending, it hurls him into an unsure and most likely unpleasant future. However, the ending doesn't diminish the book at all; rather, it adds to its ability to stand out. I fully recommend The Light in the Forest for any reader interested in Native Americans."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"Good story of a young boy, True Son, who is struggles with self-discovery.

True Son has learned to hate the whites so he is very pained to go live with his white family. The author, Conrad Richter, does a great job of showing both sides of the White/Indian conflict. You want to be on True Son's side and root for the Indians, but then something happens to the whites that makes you want to root for them. The book teaches you how much hatred went on between these two different groups of people who never understood each others' ways. You might like this book if you can handle some disturbing and gory details such as scalping. Also, you might like this book if you enjoy descriptive writing."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"The Light in the Forest is an outstanding book. It really gets you interested in it because the author portrays the characters so real that you can't stop reading it. What I liked the most about this book is that is explains peculiar topics with details, and it gives you a good understanding of how the Indians and whites were back then. One of the things I disapproved of was the ending of the book because it left me in deep thought about what would happen next. I also disagreed with the stereotypes and slurs throughout the book concerning Native Americans and whites. Although there were some parts that could have been done better, The Light in the Forest increased my understanding of history. Compared to other books I've read, The Light in the Forest ranks higher. One of the books I would compare it to is Shabanu by Susan Fisher Staples, because it also has a frustrating ending. The Light in the Forest is better because it has more history in it."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"\\"The Light in the Forest\\", written by writer Conrad Richter is a very famous Young Adult Fiction book written in 1953. The setting is in the wilderness of the early American frontier, during the time where the white people and Indians were not necessarily enemies, yet were wary and scared of each other. The main character in this book is True Son, his real name John Butler.John Butler was only four years old when he was captured by the Lenni Lenape Indians. Instead of being killed, he was kept alive and adopted into the tribe by the warrior chief Cuyloga. John Butler is renamed True Son, and grows up to think, feel, and fight like an Indian. He does not remember anything of his life before he lived with the Indians, nor does he care because he hates the white people. Now he is fifteen years old and the Indians make a treaty with the white people, agreeing to return all white captives to their own people. True Son is very angry and does not want to return to his people. He thinks like all Indians that white people are evil and that the Indian way is the right way. He tries at first to hide but is soon caught and because he tries every opportunity to escape, they tie him up and bring him forcefully to Peshtank, or renamed Paxton by the white people. There he goes back to live with his real father, mother, aunt, and younger brother. But True Son despises all of his family and relatives, especially his narrow-minded uncle, Uncle Wilse, who believes that all of the 'savages' should be killed. Only True Son's younger brother, Gordie, is somewhat his friend. True Son feels like he is a captive living with his family, he does not agree with their ways and scorns them. But just as he was about to become settled down a little bit, Half Arrow, True Son's Indian cousin, comes to visit him with very bad tidings.Like I said, this book is not really one of my favorite books to read, though really interesting. Also, when I read this book I fell so depressed thinking about how narrow-minded the people were back in early American history, both Indians and the white people. Yet that is why I think the book is very interesting because it describes well how life was back when the Indians and the white people were enemies. I do not think younger kids will enjoy this book much though I think that maybe older children should at least read \\"The Light in the Forest\\" one time."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"\\"The Light In The Forest\\" is a wonderful story about a white kid who was living with a tribe of Indians. He had to go back and live with the white people which he had always learned were mean. With the help of his cousin, he escapes the white people. He goes back to his tribe, but they are disgusted with him and won't take him back. I think this was a great book and I would recomend it to anyone that likes a good story with a lot of adventure."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"This is a good book. True Son, originally John Butler, faces many difficult challenges as he is forced out of his beloved Native American lifestyle into the strange world of the whites.The third-person point-of-view is just perfect, and the awesome conclusion is leaves you something important to think about.Light in the Forest opens up your eyes, and makes you more aware of the ancient struggle back then between the conflicting Indians and settlers."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"Another chapter for the Indian adventure genre....That's what I thought when I was assigned to read and analyze this book. But to my astonishment, as I dove deeper into the unfolding plot, I discovered that this book differed from what I had first predicted. Conrad Richter not only gives insight into the views of the white settlers, as is most commonly found, but he gives and expounds on powerful views and points of the natives....who only wish to keep their land and have been forced to attempt to protect it by violent means from the never-ending oncoming of the white man. The native Indian is commonly portrayed as a savage....with no moral values....as a blood-thirsty murderer who cares not for the ideals of the of the modern world. This perception is corrected by Conrad Richter. They are morally superior to the whites and are only misunderstood.The story begins as True Son, a white child captured long ago but now accepted as a Lenni Lenape, is told that an agreement had been reached by the warring natives and the white army. One condition of the treaty was that all captured settlers are to be returned to army. True Son, although white, has been raised to live like an Indian, to look like an Indian, so naturally, he feels Indian: he is Indian. The thought of leaving his home is unbearable to him and so the first of many conflicts is introduced. We follow on as True Son stays with his maternal family and as he escapes and returns back home. Back to the vast forests, to the wilderness, to the Lenni Lenape. In the end, True Son is expelled by his Indian father for feeling compassion for the whites and is left alone. He has no one. In the end, I enjoyed this book because of its simple form yet powerful impact through the views and ideals given by Richter."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"You shouldn't judge a book by its cover.

Tearjerker at the end.Great book for expanding a child's understanding of culture and upbringing."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"I'm 47 years old, and I re-read this book last summer and I still love it. I particularly like how Richter portrayed the viewpoints of all characters realistically - and, of course, the final conflict of True Son, who has lived in both Native and European settler worlds and has emotional ties to both, is gut-wrenching. Also, having grown up around south-central Pennsylvania, and now living south of Pittsburgh, I appreciate the landscape through which the characters move.This is most definitely not a book that will be appreciated by shallow readers, nor those who are emotionally and intellectually naive because of youth. The negative reviews that I've read on this page reflect that fact clearly. However, I've found myself going back to those books that I was forced to read in middle and high school - A Separate Peace, The Ox-Bow Incident, and the utterly magnificent Watership Down - and appreciating them for their depth and complexity."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"A wonderful timeless story. Set in the period when Pennsylvania was still at the frontier bordering \\"Indian\\" country, this short novel is about a 15 year old white boy that was captured at age 4 and raised by Indians (Native Americans if you prefer) as an Indian. Happily I might add. The twist arises when soldiers show up at the Indian village to take back white captives.A short novel that was a pleasure to read, I note two salient aspects:The story of the boy True Son (white name, Johnny). His fears, conflicts, victories, etc.And -- the extremely educational aspect of the novel regarding the Indian perspective to the encroachment and behavior of the whites. Author Conrad Richter obviously invested much research and contemplation into the matter. To put it in a phrase, \\"the reader is exposed to and will probably sympathize with the Indian point of view\\". Conversely, it is clear that the Indians did not completely grasp the White Man's whole perspective.Not what I call a feel good ending, but a logical one in context. Well worth the quick read for a student of the Native American ways, early American history, or simply a student of people and their interactions."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"For once, a school related book that did not bore me out of my misery.I thought it was interesting. Not fast-paced or action-packed, but it moved well enough to keep the pages turning, even if the book topic isn't particularly my thing.I liked how it brought up the cultural issues between the Native Americans and the \\"White\\" Americans in the older days, and showing the cruelties of both sides, as well as some of the good points.However, I disliked most of the characters in the book. It was hard to feel for any of them, and we were with most of the characters so little that it wasn't possible to get attached to them over time. Also, the main character, True Son, wasn't likeable with his sour attitude the whole time.The ending, in my opinion, was also rather abrupt. You don't really get to find out what happens - just the destruction of a certain future he could have taken.All in all, an okay book.

So few books have beenwritten about the relationship of Native Americans and Europeans who took their land. This book humanizes Indians.I find a great gap in American literature concerning American Indians. James Fenimore Cooper writes about the same era as Conrad Richter, but where was the American Indian between l765 and l900? He was being murdered. We don't want to recognize that in our history books or our literature. Not until Laughing Boy by Oliver La Farge published in the l930's, did we discover another view of Native Americnas.Conrad Richtner is a brilliant storyteller whose foreshadowing technique is perfect."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"I was expecting a summary, an analysis along with lists of characters and descriptions of them. Instead there were simple graphic organizers that were not as good as those which I could make myself. I teach students with learning disabilities and they need high level content with low vocabulary material. This did not do it for them, and I would not use it for any students in lower grades either. Perhaps it is good to learn from regarding how to make a graphic organizer, but any teacher who does not always know how to make one will not find this one very helpful. It was not worth the money that I paid for it."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"I didn't think it was a good book at all. It was really boring, and didn't make since at all.

Yea, it may have so well written sentenses. It is mind-numbingly boring and pointless. Well, maybe not pointess but deffinently boring. The reason it is not pointless is because it does have soom what of a plot; which is, a boy who is tangled between two caltures. The worst part of the book to use is that he is shuned out of those two caltures at the end which makes the book disapointing to the reader and the author. The author probely would not care because he is dead. If you like indian storys you might like this, even though it has been done a million times before, if not don't even bother with it.This book is not what you should spend you summer on, but if you have to than make the best of it."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"The Light in the Forest is about a white boy in the 1800's who is captured by Native Americans as a small child. The book is all about his return to and escape from his white family. It has a very shallow plot and the author seemed to take a very long time explaining a small action or custom. In the beginning, the chapters jump from the viewpoint of the main character, True Son, to that of a soldier who observes his actions. The changing of viewpoints makes the book very hard to follow. I do not think a teen or pre-teen would enjoy this book, though I would recommend it to a younger and more naive group of children who didn't care much for interesting plots or an exciting writing style."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"What?

The sentences seem to drag on forever and it is very confusing. There are no colorful verbs that make you picture the setting and makes you feel like you are there. Instead of the great enjoyment you usually get out of reading a book this boring book makes you feel like you are reading it as a punishment.

Usually i don't want to put a book down, and stay up till 1 or 2 in the morning reading, but on this book, i never wanted to pick it up, and had to stay up till 1 or 2 reading it, because it took forever to read cuz it was so boring!

I think the author was drowsy when he wrote this book. My opinion is that there were too many Indian names and obscure words, the author used sluggish style. The sentences were too drawn out and monotonous. I do not like Conrad Richard's style. Others, however, may like this stuffy, stale book. On a scale of one to ten, I've concluded that this book deserves a two and a half. It's plot, however, did have potential. Another author could have possibly made this book worth reading."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"Some books stand the test of time, so do not. \\"The Light in the Forest\\" is 57 years old and still holds true, both historically and as a story.Based in Pennsylvania during the years preceding the French and Indian War, the story revolves around True Son, a young man who had been kidnapped from his family by Lenni Lenape Indians at age four. True Son is adopted by an honorable, respected man named Cuyolga to replace a son who died from disease. Over time, True Son forgets his white parents and becomes a full Lenni Lenape.However, a treaty is signed that requires that the white \\"captives\\" be returned to their white families. True Son is returned and the bulk of the book concerns itself with True Son's reactions to the white society he was forced to leave more than a decade earlier. Eventually, True Son escapes back to his adopted family and settles back into his comfortable way of life.Up until the last few pages, the reader is left with the impression that the conflict between the settlers and the Indians was primarily a war of brutality on the part of the settlers, but True Son discovers, to his horror, that warriors from his own family group massacred a family and even scalped the children - an accusation that he angrily denied when settlers threw it in his face while he was forced to live with them.Richter leaves the reader with an unconventional ending, but one that feels right, nonetheless.Makes a great companion to longer, more detailed (but less conflicted) books by James Alexander Thom such asFollow the RiverandThe Red Heart."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"A book full of deep emotional journeys and social introspections, The Light in the Forest is a coming of age story that also possesses the complications inherent in cross-culural contact. It serves both the functions of providing children with great literature and providing children with strong emotional and social lessons so that they can more fully understand the world in which they live. Children find it hard to resist given its sense of mystery, adventure, and unpredictabilty. It gives a human shape to a time which fostered many of the early issues that would eventually become important to an infant country trying to find its way through the wilderness."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"i really like this book. i think it was a good book. this boy was adopted by indians but his actual parents were white. he didn't believe his father when he said that it was him because of his father being white. i really haven't understoood why they adopted him but now i understand it more. i think it is one of the best books i have read. this is my review on the light in the forest."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"We start out following True Son as he is returned to his family after being a captive of the Indians. We see him go from being secure in his Indian upbringing and the ways he has been taught to watching him become aware of the true world around him. We are caught with him as he struggles to decide right from wrong.This story gives some shocks to the system. The sudden and seemingly needless violence did bother me, but it was important for it to happen. We see the Indians and the Whites saying and acting in almost the same fashion in regards to each other, yet all the while talking down about the other's ways.The only thing that kept me from enjoying this book was that I couldn't seem to get ahold of True Son and feel what he felt. I was being told a story, not experiencing it.Some people have mentioned that this book is sometimes assigned in school. I can see the reason for it, but I'm not sure that it is something younger people could grasp without being upset."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"The Light in the Forest is an interesting book.

For example, when True Son and his dad were down at the river, the author focused too much on their conversation. He should have consentrated more on the feelings True Son was experiencing. Another example is when True Son's father was bringing him back to his biological parents. The book had a entire chapter describing the journey to the camp. Focusing more on being at the camp would have been more interesting. As one can see, focusing too much on the small details makes it difficult for middle schoolers to follow."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"The Light in the Forest by Conrad Richter was not a fullfilling book because there was no closure to the book. For example, True Son was coming back to his biological family then the book ended, and it left the reader hanging. I wondered what was going to happen to True Son. Would his family reject him? Would they take him back and forgive him for running away and scalping his uncle? How would True Son's Indian family react to the situation?

Although it is short, the author was sure to include lots of interesting facts to hold your attention. The author cleaverly added Indain names from the Delaware (Lenni Lanape) language to make the reading leavel higher. Allthough not all of the words are explained, most of the words you can infer their meanings. It is an interesting book about the cultural clashes beetween the setlers of the US and the Indains that already inhabit the land. The book has minimal political veiws expressed with only ocational (only mentioned, not explained) violence.

After that, his indian customs and knowledge he had gained by his indian father (Cuyloga) were long gone..... until, one night, he escaped with his cousin... to a long journey back home.This story is good, specially for young adult such as myself because it reflects the hard decitions a kid that age had to do.

Everything changed after new circumstances required True Son to repatriated to his English settlers relatives. He had to go back with his real family.

The way that TRUE SON was adopted by some white people and he was like the total opposite of them. He is an Indian who originally lived with his Indian family.

It gave me a whole different view on how we live today. As another reader said, a dictionary is helpful, but if you understand this book then it is a worthwhile read.

I would definitely recommend this book!!"},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"If you like novels that are easy to read but exciting this is a good choice if you are looking for a book. I thought that this book was a pretty good for the most part. It was not the best I have ever read but it is pretty far up on the list. I has a fairly simple plot but there a few twists in it which make the novel exciting. I think that the book does a nice job describing how life was in that time period and how the main character feels through out the book. Some of the bad things that I saw was that the book moved a little slow and there was action but not quite enough.

He had taught to think like an Indian, and now, he was being forced to go to his enemies to live. It was about being capable of comprehending and empathizing with people of various civilizations. This book is moving and inspirational."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"When I first read this book, I HATED it. The main character seemed boring, the story seemed far fetched, and the ending left much to be desired. But after I read the story, I was haunted by it. This is not a story for people who like their ends tied up, and love happy endings. This is a story that moves in the direction of life; the issues are complex, and the end leaves questions unanswered the way they are in the real world.Throughout this novel, the very complex issue of race relationships between the Native Americans and the Whites are explored. The real beauty of this book is that it is fair to both groups. It does not take the side of one and disparage the other. The author shows that both groups have both positive and negative traits, and that both groups suffer because they continue to carry on the racial prejudice of their ancestors. They are born under circumstances they did not ask for, and must live with the consequences of them. This is what moves the action in the story, and this is what causes the climax of the story...essentially, when True Son tries to not act within the context of the struggle between races.The tone of this book is not preachy at all. My favorite part is when the minister comes to speak to True Son. In this conversation, a very deep topic is discussed...both characters bring up the fact that both races wronged each other. This is one of the great points of this story--to go somewhere and say something that is true, but wouldn't have normally been said because of political correctness.I did take issue with the author referring to the Native Americans as \\"Indians.\\" Even the Native Americans in this book call themselves Indian, and I think the author would have known better. And the slowest and hardest part of the book was when True Son was on the run. The author creates great images, but the language is hard to read.This is a haunting work of beauty. Many won't like it because it tackles a difficult subject, and it doesn't diminish the complexity, or hide it behind a \\"feel good\\" message. But for those who don't mind looking at the uncomfortable parts of life and history, this is a solid read."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"This story conveys into the reader a feeling that once youfinished the first chapter you want to know the resolution. Fromthe beginnig you get hooked on this book as if you were addicted to wanting to continue. John Butler, the main charcter in this book, was adopted and raised from a very short age by an indian tribe. He was raised from childhood to adolescence by this tribe. Prior to this time, he grew up believing he was part of an indian family, but it never came to his mind that his true family were white. The life of John Butler, who was known as True Son by the indian tribe, changed dramatically when he was returned to his true family, the white men. He seemed somewhat rebellious due to the fact that he was taught to be an indian so it was tough for him to actually blend in. To one point he wanted to kill the whites. True Son refused to be what he was meant to be instead of what he was raised to be. This is somewhat ironic, not wanting to be with your true family after living almost the first fifteen years without them. As the story unfolded, the bigger the intensity got. Living the life of something your not is hard. Trying to change the past is even harder. This really is a great story."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"Four-year-old Johnny Butler was kidnapped by raiding Indians and raised as True Son--fully adopted to replace a dead Indian boy. For 11 years he has learned Indian ways from his new father, Cayuga. Considering himself a future warrior, he is stunned and rebelious when his father (and others) must surrender their white captives (including wives) to make a land deal with the White Man. Hurt, humiliated and terrified, True Son mentally spits on all Western civilization. He despises white ways--their attitude toward Nature, their cruelty to Indians, and their cramped, oppressive lifestyle. He privately plans to escape back into his true culture and real people at the first opportunity.But he reckons without knowledge of his biological family: an invalid mother who never recovered from his abduction; a kind but stern father who values his ledgers; an adoring little brother who had not yet been born. Worst of all is his hot-tempered uncle, who leads Peshtank &quot;boys&quot; on vicious, punitive raids against his people. Who is the real traitor to Peace between the races? How can this youth enjoy life without the loyal companionship of his best friend and &quot;cousin.&quot; Half Arrow?Is it possible to take the Indian out of a boy whose blood and brain belong to the Native people? Both worlds claim him, yet in the final irony, both worlds may reject him. What does the future hold for a white youth who considers himself one with the enemies of the English in 1765? This is intense reading centered on a real moral dilemma, for which the youth is not responsible. Will he ever be free to choose his own path through life, to be accepted in either world? Will he have to betray white settlers, in order to prove his Indian heart? Presented with justice from both points of view, this short novel is an excellent example of Historical Fiction for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"I wish I'd read this years earlier! The author's lush descriptionsof the woods and streams were so evocative. The fast-paced plotand witty dialogue were a cut above most contemporaryYA books. What I like most is the hero's passion and authenticity --the author didn't try to be trendy like many oftoday's novels. Even though I'm an Asian female in my 30s I trulyidentified with the 15-year-old hero who struggles to reconcilehis white ancestry and Indian upbringing. This 1950s gemis hands down superior to today's YA stories.The only thing I'd change would be the ending."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"Like many, I first read this ages ago in school. Its not really meant to be a kids book, but is used to bridge readers into more sophisticated fare. Who knows what they are reading now in school. Depending on the teacher, the themes of this book might be lost on younger readers, especially those brought up on Dick & Jane. The book was before its time, when talking about the plight of the natives was still unheard of. Even these generations know little about ancient America and the millions who lived here for thousands of years. Light in the Forest is one tale of many based on the clash of those two civlizations where one prevailed and the old one died. For more on the history behind this novel, try1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus,The Founders of AmericaandIndians in Pennsylvania."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"Conrad Richter spins a powerful tale in a short time. His writing style reminds me of Richard Connell (\\"The Most Dangerous Game\\") in that he can deliver so much with so few words.This is as much about the collision of vastly different cultures as it is about a boy caught between them. John Butler, the son of a prominent Pennsylvania frontier family was kidnapped as a child by Delaware Indians during a massacre; Indians who were seeing their homeland usurped by white settlers and were making a last stand against them.The Indians brought up the boy as an Indian, giving him the name True Son; his own acceptance of the new way of life began to grow and deepen within him, so that when he was brought back to his own family eleven years later, he had formed distinct opinions of his own against the whites; in his own mind, he was not White, but Indian. He loved and appreciated all things Indian; the forests, the rivers, the animals and birds of the woods; the religion of the Great Spirit. Richter's descriptive passages delve deep into the psyche of a youth torn by opposing forces between two worlds, while one single world is the one he has accepted as his. As his birth family struggles to reclaim him, it drives all of them against each other, in a fierce battle of wills that none of them will truly triumph over when all is said and done.Another excellent novel with a similar, more modern theme regarding a childhood friendship between two boys,one white,one red,until adulthood intervenes,is \\"Crazy Weather\\" by Charles McNichols.Another Conrad Richter tale I highly recommend is \\"Sea of Grass\\" which is also about the frontier, (New Mexico) but with an entirely different context. \\"Sea of Grass\\" and \\"The Light in the Forest\\" are both slim volumes, but with a lot in between the pages."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"Some books stand the test of time, so do not. \\"The Light in the Forest\\" is 57 years old and still holds true, both historically and as a story.Based in Pennsylvania during the years preceding the French and Indian War, the story revolves around True Son, a young man who had been kidnapped from his family by Lenni Lenape Indians at age four.

Eventually, True Son escapes back to his adopted family and settles back into his comfortable way of life.Up until the last few pages, the reader is left with the impression that the conflict between the settlers and the Indians was primarily a war of brutality on the part of the settlers, but True Son discovers, to his horror, that warriors from his own family group massacred a family and even scalped the children - an accusation that he angrily denied when settlers threw it in his face while he was forced to live with them.Richter leaves the reader with an unconventional ending, but one that feels right, nonetheless.Makes a great companion to longer, more detailed (but less conflicted) books by James Alexander Thom such asFollow the RiverandThe Red Heart."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"I remembered this book from when I was a young boy and I thought it would be a good book for my grandson to read.

As the book reaches its last few pages, you realize what a waist of time and effort you have spent on such a poorly written and non-eventful book.

Some people feel constrained to make themselves like this book simply because of the subject matter, as a number of the reviews have taken great pains to point out, but I find it hard to believe that anyone thinks this book is actually good.I do not require that the characters be likeable for me to think a book is worthwhile, but if they are not, they should at least be interesting. Yet every character in this book is thoroughly unpleasant and dull, both, with not a single characteristic to catch one's sympathy or even attention.The plot drags on interminably, there is a great deal of bigotry on all sides, and there is quite a lot of violence without the least bit of interesting action. The writing is, at best, insipid and, at worst, laughable. This book tries very, very hard to be important, to carry a Message, to be morally complex.

Disappointingly, Richter choses not to take a stand, instead pointing out faults and strengths of both European Americans and Native Americans. The ending of the book, contradicts the title as True Son betrays his Indian relatives. Still, Richter wants the reader to know there is still hope to bridge the racial divide; there is still &quot;light in the forest.&quot"},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"At first glance, it would seem that this is a book wholly sympathetic to the American Indian, and I use that term because that is how it is used in this book. Through the eyes of True Son Whites are perceived as narrow-minded, land-stealing bigots who haven't got a clue as to how to treat the earth, treat each other or even how to live their lives. As the story unfolds, it doesn't particularly show the Indians in too good a light either however. While the author does not describe the actual scalping of a child, the aftermath of the act is enough to give the reader the shivers. I don't want to spoil the ending by revealing it here for anyone who has not read the book, but suffice it to say that it sucked. I think both the whites and the Indians could have done with some basic human kindness, never mind how to treat a confused adolescent boy. True Son, or John Butler as he was christened, is a victim here and while the story is a good read, it's not among my favorites. In fact, it raises my blood pressure."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"This short novel begins with a 1764 setting in the forests of central Ohio (near present-day Coshocton, Ohio) at the junction of the Muskingum, the Tuscarawas, and the Waldhoning Rivers. The book presents a somewhat romanticized picture of the American Indian at that time. The central character is John Cameron Butler, known as True Son in the Delaware tribe with which he has lived since he was four years old. He is now fifteen and his life is being uprooted once again. The Indians have signed a treaty in which they have to return all white captives to their original families, even those who don't wish to go. All John knows is his life as an Indian and now he has to return to the family (in Paxton, Pennsylvania, on the Susquehanna River) he hasn't seen for eleven years. But, he doesn't fit in there and he finds himself caught between two cultures. Although very well written, it appears that Richter is suggesting that Indian/colonists interactions were doomed from the very beginning. One culture had to win and one had to lose. He presents the case where neither culture appeared willing to tolerate nor to understand the other. And, in more general terms, in my opinion Richter seems to hint that all such cultural conflicts are fated to fail. This is a rather sad commentary on man. I certainly hope it is not true and that there are good chances for Serb/Albanian, Irish/English, Indian/Pakistani, etc., interactions. This book is often used in reading assignments for students ranging from ages eleven through fourteen. I find it also a depressing thought that such a dark vision of man's capacity for tolerance and understanding is being presented to young, impressionable minds. I would have hoped that teachers in the 1990s would have found literary sources with a less negative outlook. It would appear that some of the negative reviews provided by earlier, and much younger, readers have some validity."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"I found an interesting essay about this book and bought it.

He can understand and sympathize with either side. Hisbusiness is to be fair to them both. If the novel has anotherpurpose, it is to point out that in the pride of our Americanliberties, we're apt to forget that already we've lost a good many tocivilization. The American Indians once enjoyed far more than we.Already two hundred years ago, when restrictions were comparativelywith us, our ideals and restrained manner of existence repelled theIndian. I thought that perhaps if we understood how these FirstAmericans felt toward us even then and toward our white way of life,we might better understand the adverse, if perverted, view of us bysome African, European, and Asian peoples today. -Author'sIntroductionAs the above paragraph makes clear, this extremelypopular youth novel reflects the corrosive self doubt that has eatenaway at Western Civilization for most of this century. Richter tellsthe story of a fifteen year old boy, named True Son. He has beenraised by Lenni Lenape Indians after being taken from his whiteparents in a raid; his real name is John Butler. As the story opens,the boy's Indian father informs him that the terms of a recent treaty(the year is 1764) require the return of all white captives. The boydesperately hopes to avoid going back and after being returned hecontinually seeks to escape. When he eventually returns to theIndians, he goes on a raiding party, but in a fit of conscience, warnsaway some whites who are about to be ambushed. His Indian fathersaves him from execution, but convinces him that he is now so taintedby his white blood that he must return to civilization.This is an exciting story marred by the kind of starry eyed leftwing twaddle that characterizes far too much of children's literature.The saving grace is Richter's seeming acceptance of the fact that thisclash of cultures and the West's victory were inevitable.

Nice cover though, seems high quality And its a great story. Too bad it was printed that way."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"Poor Conrad Richter. His literary fate is like that of Steinbeck's shorter works - read by 8th graders. When I mention Richter to my friends they think more of the Newberry than the Pulitzer Prize. Historical novelists are rarely thought of as having written &quot;literature&quot;, yet that is what Richter wrote. Like Steinbeck, his style was simple and clear and strong. Like Steinbeck he understood the pain of being human. After reading one of his brief novels - they are often only about 200 pages - I wonder why other writers need so many more words. Richter did not think of himself as an historical novelist. He wrote instead to give a sense of how people experienced time past. Things happen in his novels, but the events are secondary to the perceptions, attitudes and (dare I say?) psychology. &quot;The Light in the Forest&quot; is a wonderful example of his work. Though it is about a teenage boy, it is not the &quot;coming of age&quot; or &quot;rite or passage&quot; story that it is often described as. It is about a person who lives in a world that has gone beyond his control - his life has been wrested from him by national and racial politics. His choices turn him into an American isolato. Very contemporary. The out-of-print and equally good companion novel &quot;A Country of Strangers&quot; pursues the same themes. Only in &quot;Country&quot; the protaganist is a white who has lived with the Indians and been returned to the whites. Like &quot;Light&quot; one of its virtues is to see through other's eyes. I wish I had the space to quote Stone Girl's dissection of Christianity. Maybe someday Richter will get his volume in the Libray of American and all his works will come back in print, including my favorite, &quot;The Free Man&quot;."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"I was not forced to read this book, like so many of the reviewers here. I was in my grade school library when I spotted the cover- two young, lean, armed Indians with mohawk haircuts walking through an impressionistic forest with a beam of light descending upon them. One Indian was entirely red, the other all white. I read the back cover. It was about a white captive among the Indians. I loved that subject as age ten and the book was my choice from the library that day. I must admit that it was tough going the first time I read it. It was sometimes hard to understand about whom he was referring to when True Son thought about his father and the book did lack action. I also admit that the ending was a let down. I wanted a cut and dried ending with no loose ends and LITF leaves the reader with a huge loose end. At ten years old, this book left me disappointed and confused.Yet I voluntarily read it again not less than two years later and I fell in love with it the second time. I have since then read it at least once every year and sometimes more. I am 29 now. I cannot adequately describe why this novel still moves me. I can say it is beautifully written and has a truly moving story about a boy caught between two very different worlds. Also Richter's description of the beauty of nature and the way people can see the same facets of nature and of mankind in two completly different ways is incredible.

At first True Son refuses to comply at all with the Whites and tries to escape. After a while, and after spending much time with the Whites though, it seems that True Son is beginning to accept and become used to their culture, and is starting to lose his Indian ways. It looks as if all of the Indian in him has been run over and destroyed, when one night, he finds his old Indian friend / cousin and escapes with him from the Whites to a long journey back home to his old Indian town. It seems now that all the Indian he left behind has been renewed to him and most of what the whites forced into his head is gone when, with little warning, True Son must make a life-altering decision that will decide his fate, and that will decide what culture he is to live with.I really enjoyed this book; it showed the conflict between whites and Indians in 18th century America very well. It was filled with action and adventure, and although short, it still developed the characters and the plot so that you had a broad understanding of what kind of decisions this young man had to make, how it must have been like being bounced from culture to culture (especially in that day), and how hard things must have been in general. This understanding of the character is what keeps you reading and keeps you itching to find out where fate will put John Butler/ True Son. I would recommend this book because of these reasons, and because of the way the author attacked the overlying conflict between Whites and Indians: he spoke of it from both the White's and the Indian's sides. Because of this the reader can understand the conflict from both sides, and can not easily pick a side to support, which made things interesting. Lastly, in my opinion, this book is quite unpredictable, and you can't tell how it will complete itself until the very end, which made the book more fun to read. If you enjoy history, and adventure you will probably enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"Wow, what a great book. I really don't know what everybody else is talking about, but I thought that this book was great. So great, that in fact, I am now reading it for the 3rd time. I read it once for pleasure, and once in school. I really like history, and maybe that is why I like it so much. I feel that it definetly transports me back to that time, and that region. I live in Philly, and the book takes place not all that far from there. I think that it would be fun to be able to be somebody like True Son. While slightly depressing at times, like when you realize that this was something that ACTUALLY happened to real people, and the tragedy of it all. That somebody has a family that they don't even care about, and that they never really knew them, and their family loves for them. Well, I won't tell you the ending, but it is pretty tragic. All in all, a great book, one of my all time favorites! Well, I am going to go read it now."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"This book was one of the best books I read all summer. It had a good plot, interesting characters and realistic history. In this story, a white boy is taken into an Indian family and is raised as an Indian boy. When he is made to live with his real parents, \`True Son' wants to keep his Indian habits. Raised as an Indian, True Son has a disdain for all whites; although he seems to take a strange liking to his younger brother. His younger brother seems to like the Indian ways, he wants to learn from his brother. He misses his Indian home and would stop at almost nothing to return back to it.True Son's cousin Half Arrow is his best friend. Even though Half Arrow is a real Indian, he treats True Son as a real cousin. Half Arrow loves his cousin. He even went into the white territory, where there was a chance that he could be caught and scalped, to free True Son of his white prison.In True Sons white family everyone treated him fairly well, except for his Uncle. His Uncle was a anti-Indian fanatic. He hated everything that the Indians had taught True Son. True Sons' Uncle told True Son that Indians scalped women and children. True Son did not believe him. After the Indian warriors brought back a child's scalp he finally believed in some thing his uncle had said. Maybe he would have listened to more of what his Uncle said if his Uncle had not killed an Indian brother, and if his uncle had met an unfortunate end at the blade of an axe.In this time Indians occupied most of the US. The Indians were not happy with the whites, because they were slowly taking more and more land from the Indians. There was a small war between the Indians and the whites, including scalping and many surprise attacks and strange tricks of illusion. In the end True Son is not a real true son to the Indians. By betraying his Indian family he is forced to go on all alone.I enjoyed this book a lot. I stayed up as late as possible reading this book even over television. I believe people who like absorbing books would really enjoy this book. You really believe that you are living in the era of this book. The book describes the landscape, the living conditions, the clothes so well that you feel that you are there. In this book I believe that through the beginning and middle were very well thought out, but the end seemed less carefully planned. The beginning was very detailed about True Son's life, friends, and family. The detail was excellent. In the end, it seemed more like a \`blur' with action and no setting. It went from birds eye view, to a more emotional setting that can occur in any place and in any time period. . If you like serious and interesting books this is a book for you."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"This book comes out of the true roots of America's past, a book that stirs something deep in every person's heart, a yearning for freedom, an achingly sweet sadness that doesn't cause tears to gush but makes you feel a little ache inside you for what you have lost- or rather what True Son, the main character, has lost. Everyone has something of True Son in them- his plight: of having the blood of a white... but the heart and mind of an Indian. We all have something of the Indian in us- the love for nature, the love for animals, peace, solitude, and simple ways- which is why this book appeals so much to all of us. Through simple words we come to understand the anguish of True Son, a white boy raised as an Indian, being pulled in two separate directions. It is like any person today, having to make the choice between close friends and blood family. As we read, we feel the injustices done to the Indian, under the spell of True Son's simple dialect and way of speaking. Even the third-person narrative is as if True Son is talking to us. As he says &quot;The Indian and deer would wither and die in such confinement, but the white man flourished in the stale sickly air of his house like fleas in his wall and borers in the cabin logs,&quot; we forget that we live in such confinement, and wonder with True Son at the white man's stupidity. You'll either love this book, as I did, or hate it, for there are still many people prejudiced against the Indians and their philosophy of life so far from material things. So if you luxuriate in &quot;that instrument of torture called a bolster&quot; and revel in the joys of material things, then perhaps this book is not for you. The ending on first read-through seems to leave a little to be desired. It's a little bit sad, but after a second consideration you will think that it is the best ending Conrad Richter could have given it. This beautifully written book will truly touch something in your heart and leave you with a wider view of the world, a better understanding and compassion of being torn between two totally different worlds- and which way your mind and heart take you, and which way your blood, heritage, and traditions take you. I definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"A Light In The Forest centers around a fifteen-year-old boy named True Son, who lived with the Lenni Lenape for eleven years, ever since the Indians had captured him during an attack on a farm. He was adopted by Cuyloga and Quaquenga, a family of the Lenni Lenape, and became one of them.One day, his village learns that all white prisoners must be returned to their birth families, and his father takes him to the camp of soldiers that will take True Son to Pennsylvania. True Son's experiences in an English town and his desire to return to his village are the storyline of the book. This book is appropriate for eight graders, though the author, Conrad Richter, portrays some scenes almost too vividly. Children who have been in a divorce situation can relate to True Son and his feelings of abandonment. The book does an excellent job of informing readers of how the English and the Indians viewed each other, and gives the reader the unique viewpoint of True Son. For entertainment, the book falls a little short, occasionally losing your attention by attempting to summarize events without going into any detail. Overall, the book is not a bad read, and would be especially enjoyable if you like historic novels from this period."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"The Light in the Forest is about a young and strong-hearted boy, True Son, who will fight for his life as an Indian. He is torn between his love for his Indian family and his blood ties with the white men. When he is forced to live with the white people and leave his beloved Indian family it seems as though his whole world is crashing down around him, while he grasps at the small pieces and tries to hold all that is dear to him together. Living with the white people is like tearing his heart out, and his white family watches as it begins to slow for there is no more joy in the world to keep it beating. As the days pass his small body wilts like a flower in the winter that does not have the sun to keep is petals full of life. He could not bear to live as a captive of his own life, his wild spirit suffocating. This book uses great detail in expressing the character's feeling and I felt as though I were there, feeling True Son's pain, understanding how each breath he took was like sucking poison into his lungs. As I finished the story the ending troubled me at first. Then I read it again and realized it was a fitting ending. I now understand why the author ended the book this way. The author is simply laying down the truth. Conrad Richter didn't write what the reader wanted to hear; he wrote the truth about the course of life no matter how harsh and bitter it sounded. Life does not always end up how you want it to; you have to play the hand you're dealt. I recommend this book because it really gives you a different outlook on life."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"Author Conrad Richter presents a paradox rich with American tradition, values, and beauty. The characters are archetypes of forgotten cultures and the events are ethereal visions of the past. Still Richter weaves this tale with vivid details that captivate readers through generations.True Son, the kidnapped child of a pionneer family, is raised by Cuyloga and his Lenni Lenape tribe of Indians. Richter places True Son in a difficult situation when he is returned to his white family as part of a peace treaty. But 12 years of resentment, natural freedom, and purity in purpose and life have turned True Son against the society he was born to.Slowly he learns the ways of his white family and is slightly bent by their ways. But his heart and mind never leave his family of the forest. Then one day, opportunity affords him the way home. His return to his native bretheren is bittersweet as he realizes his values.Richter's writing is colorful and detailed. He uses an omnipotent voice and laces it with Native American vocabulary. The reader sees the world through the eyes of True Son. Colors, movements, lands, skies, animals, and trees have a renewed value and slowly the reader learns to appreciate these things, long abused by white society.I enjoyed reading these descriptions and hearing them from an Indian voice. Still the bittersweet ending is hard to swallow, like a chalky stone that has been dried on a barren road. The history, conflict and traditions revealed here are everlasting. Readers will contemplate the role life plays and the strange twist of fate we each must face."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"Okay, first of all, people like MeeMoo who think historical fiction is boring, shouldn't read or report on it. I don't report on video games, which I think are stupid, so why is MeeMoo on my turf? Secondly, teachers should not force kids to read & report on literature written for adults - it's not fair to the kids, who are not developmentally or intellectually ready for this kind of novel, and it's not fair to the novel. So teachers, get your acts together!This is NOT juvenile literature.Conrad Richter's prose is subtle, lovely, sensual, and deeply moving. The storytelling draws the reader into the experiences of the characters. And this experience, the returning of white captives to their birth homes, even though many of them considered themselves Indian and didn't want to go \\"home\\", is a particularly poignant event in American history. In The Light in the Forest, Richter explores the heart and mind of a young man faced with an emotionally wrenching task - when the people and culture he has known and loved and called home since he was a tiny child are forced to literally abandon him, he must attempt to become a member of an alien and hostile group of people - his own family.This book was way ahead of its time - and is better than much current historical fiction. Conrad Richter meticulously researched his subject, made generous use of Native American philosophy & language, and allows the characters' different points of view to flow freely through the story.If you enjoy good writing, if you enjoy historical fiction, if you are especially interested in American history, I highly recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"The book was interesting because it was a conflict between two cultures.

When he went to live with them, he thought that many of the things his father did weren't manly.He didn't like the clothes because they belonged to a cousin he wasn't very fond of.

The kid was only 15 yrs old, and hes real name is John Butler, but hes Indian name was True Son. He was forced to go back with his real parents(white people) which he didn't like because there culture was different. He thought that every white people wans't manly because how they eat, sleep, and eat.

The difference between his Indian father and his white father is that his Indian father lives out in the wilderness and hunts for his food, and his white father lives in a house with beds and rooms and buys his food at the store. True Son (or Johnny, as his white family calls him) doesn't really want to go to his white father because he's used to sleeping outside on the hard ground and hunting. Because of all this, I really felt sorry for him because of all the changes that came into his life as a kid.

True Son is adopted by an honorable, respected man named Cuyolga to replace a son who died from disease. Over time, True Son forgets his white parents and becomes a full Lenni Lenape.However, a treaty is signed that requires that the white \\"captives\\" be returned to their white families. True Son is returned and the bulk of the book concerns itself with True Son's reactions to the white society he was forced to leave more than a decade earlier. Eventually, True Son escapes back to his adopted family and settles back into his comfortable way of life.Up until the last few pages, the reader is left with the impression that the conflict between the settlers and the Indians was primarily a war of brutality on the part of the settlers, but True Son discovers, to his horror, that warriors from his own family group massacred a family and even scalped the children - an accusation that he angrily denied when settlers threw it in his face while he was forced to live with them.Richter leaves the reader with an unconventional ending, but one that feels right, nonetheless.Makes a great companion to longer, more detailed (but less conflicted) books by James Alexander Thom such asFollow the RiverandThe Red Heart."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"I use this novel in my 9th grade classes.

He did not like living like a white man so he worked his way through the forest to go back to his Indian tribe. If you want to know how it ends read the book.The book was a pretty easy book to read except for the indian names which are hard to pronounce. I did not like all the description of the land. I just wanted to see what was goin to happen. Read it to find out for yourself."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"I remember being required to read &quot;The Light in the Forest&quot; as a seventh grader and complaining incessantly about how much I hated the book. Looking back, I suppose it was more adolescent laziness and my going through a non-reading &quot;phase&quot; that made me loathe the book. Recently, I reread it - read the whole thing through on a hot Saturday afternoon while I kept my left arm elevated to reduce swelling from a series of hornet stings. It's a lot, lot better than I remembered. Perhaps I was not mature enough at 13 to appreciate the horror of True Son being wrested from the only life and only family he knew and sent to a land of &quot;strangers&quot;, some of whom hated (and killed) Native Americans. Too young to appreciate the risks he took in his escape with Broken Arrow. Now I appreciate the book. I also re-appreciated the description of the Ohio/Pennsylvania forests (the one thing I liked about the book as a teen)- that is where I grew up, and now I am far from there. Hearing the old names - Tuscarawas, Muskingum, et al. - comforted me and made me picture the forests I hiked in as a girl.I know lots of junior high school students are made to read this book. I suspect that few of them will ever think to come back to it at a later date. But I'm finding that rereading stuff I read as a relative &quot;youngster&quot; is making me realize how callow and unfeeling I was then. Novels are much more meaningful to me now.&quot;The Light in the Forest&quot; is not the *best* book I have ever read, by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a good book, a solid book.

So many sad things were happening and you would think that in the end everything would even out but nooooooo. They just ended the book with the saddest ending that I have ever seen! My heart is still crying right now! This book was sad!"},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"I just completed reading this to my pre-teen kids, who enjoyed the story and who became particularly engaged as the complexity of the moral drama intensified in the final two chapters. There are many reviews on this page that summarize the plot, and I won't repeat everything except as is needed to make a few points in review.It's a good book, although I got a little whiff of \\"PC\\" early in the book that was an initial turn off. The plot is built around the story of a white teenager who is being returned to his \\"English\\" family 12 years after he was kidnapped from them by Indians (that's the book's term, by the way, for Native Americans). The boy, Johnny or True Son by name (the latter, a misnomer of the highest order), faces the unbearable dilemma of being taken from the Indian people who he knows as family and friends and being returned to a culture that is alien to him. In his head, we are treated to the evils of white culture (fences and rules and cold dark houses and strange restricting religions) and the virtues of the Indian life (the forest and brother wind and bravery and running around naked). True Son (or Johnny's) white family is not presented favorably, with a weak little father, a pathetically invalid mother, and a handful of jerks for extended family - in other words, pretty much like many white families I know today! In contrast, True Son yearns to be reunited with his brave brown Indian family, who he sees without fault or flaw.It is in the mid-part of the book that the reader should see that everyone has screwed up here (and, with the expection of one solitary character, this is reinforced well by the end of the novel). The Indians have committed the dastardly act of kidnapping the child of another family (on the justification that True Son's Indian father is looking for a replacement for a son that died) and then releasing him as part of a treaty (knowing of course that this was entirely appropriate given the decade-old crime). Johnny's white family cannot be blamed for wanting him back or for taking the opportunity to get him back, despite his own resistance. Hey, this was before the golden age of counseling, and perhaps some talk therapy or even drugs would have helped the situation, but this is the frontier we're talking about.Eventually, True Son gets a shot at returning home, and he takes it. In doing so, stupid and violent bloodshed is unleashed on both sides. And this is where it becomes crystal clear that there are no heroes in this book. Whites hate Indians, Indians hate whites (and have no qualms about scalping little girls, or almost anything else that moves), and everyone possesses weapons. One constant theme throughout the book is Love. True Son's Indian family loves him (as he loves them), and it is his Indian father who sacrificially saves his life in the end. Johnny's white family loves him too. Ultimately, the great climactic scene of the novel turns on Johnny/True Son's love of his little white brother, Gordie (the only character in this book who won't tick you off at some point).Quite a book. Slight blip on the PC meter, but in balance, an objective portrait of a time and place that we may never fully understand. I'm sorry to see so many young people panning the book on this site, but what the heck can you expect from kids these days? Trying shutting your mouth and opening your mind."},{"Title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"This book tells alot about how it could of been back in the old days.

True son, the main character, was raised by Indians when he was a child, but was taken back by the white men and couldn't believe that he had white blood.

I love books and although I am giving it 5 stars I think that the ending could have been a little better. I think that the Indian words Richter added in made the book more interesting. What moved me even more than True Sons thoughts was how he dealt with situations and how he remembered his adopted father's words. I think that the White settlers who claimed to be his parents shouldn't have been so selfish and narrow minded, they should have taken notice and faced to the fact that their &quot;son&quot; was no longer one of them due to their carelessness.

The author outlines the responses of the Confederacy and Union to this strategic dilemma with a narration of Sherman's North Georgia campaign that ultimately resolved the problem.Lincoln appointed Grant commander of the Federal Armies and Jefferson Davis appointed Joseph E. Johnston, a general he did not trust; commander of the Army of Tennessee and the text states \\"All the Rebels would pay a very high price for Jefferson Davis long-standing evasion of the command personnel problems in the West.\\" The author makes the fascinating observation that \\" By 1864 two irrefutable facts about the conflict should have been clear....neither side was likely to win the war in Virginia. The Confederates were too skilled to loose, at least as long as Lee lived, but not strong enough to win.The Northerners...were too strong to lose the war in Virginia but not skilled enough to win it there.\\"McMurry notes that Grant having nearly achieved military victory in the West, Grant made two decisions that made a Northern victory costly while enhancing Confederate independence chances. The strategy in Virginia to defeat Lee and prevent moving Rebel troops elsewhere; and two, appointing Sherman in Georgia instead of Thomas. Both decisions resulted in \\"Ten of thousands of Americans --North and South-- paid for this misjudgment with their lives....\\" and \\"The outcome of the war remained doubtful much longer...\\" The author observes that Thomas finished the war as a general \\"who never suffered defeat on a battlefield where he was in command\\" concluding \\"On the basis of his record, Sherman did not merit such a promotion....\\"Both Sherman and Johnston had command personnel problems. Johnston inherited a command muddle which one historian described as a \\"pit of vipers\\". The narrative and analysis of Sherman's campaign from North Georgia to Atlanta is informative. Sherman dependence on the Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad limited his strategic options to only advancing toward Atlanta because that was where the railroad ran.The writer makes the intriguing statement that Union General McPherson's seizure of Snake Creep Gap on May 7th probably \\"determined the outcome of the campaign.\\" adding the fascinating opinion \\"....if Grant had allowed Thomas to succeed to the command of the Military Division of Mississippi by seniority, the 1864 campaign in Georgia would have ended two or three weeks after its opening with \\"....a crushing Federal victory that, for all practical purposes would have ended the war in the West....ripping open the entire center of the Confederacy\\" and \\"save many lives during the last eleven months of the war.\\"As the campaign proceeded, Johnston would fortify a strong position and hope Sherman would attack. Sherman was not going to launch a massive assault against strong fortifications and moved against the Confederate left and flanked them out of every prepared position including Dalton, Resaca, Allatoona, Kennesaw Mountain, and Smyra. On July 8 Sherman crossed the Chattahoochee and the battle for Atlanta was imminent.Davis replaced Joe Johnson with Hood on July 18, 1864 and the text notes \\"Rarely has a general assumed command of an army under more inauspicious circumstances than those facing John Bell Hood.... His army was backed up to a city it had to hold\\" which limited his strategic options and maneuvering room. Hood reversed Johnston's conservative policy striking Sherman at Peachtree Creek, Atlanta and Ezra Church but failed to cripple or destroy the opposing force.Sherman ,after trying artillery for several days, realized the only way to force Atlanta's evacuation was to cut off all rail traffic into and out of the city. Interestingly, the text also notes \\"Hood too, sought some means of ....forcing his opponent to give up his position at Atlanta.\\" Hood initiated an unsuccessful cavalry raid on railroads supporting the Federals. Sherman finding cavalry ineffective against railroads used infantry to cut the Macon &amp; Western Railroad isolating Atlanta and Hood forcing the Rebels to abandon Atlanta. The Rebels after opening government warehouses to anyone (military or civilian) to take food, clothing etc.the Rebels burned what they couldn't take with them including five locomotives and 28 freight cars containing ammunition which exploded leveling adjacent buildings in a scene well depicted in the movie Gone With The Wind. Hood's infantry cleared Atlanta by 01:00 AM, September 2. Shortly after daylight Mayor James Calhoun rode north of Atlanta and surrendered the city.The author concludes with an excellent analysis of the generalships of Sherman, Johnston and Hood noting that Sherman as a field general was \\"probably not much above average\\". However, by 1864 Sherman had developed a grasp of the geopolitical-psychological strategy, matched by few, realizing that a war can be won \\"by destroying the enemy's society and its logistical-economic-social infrastructure and he put that doctrine into practice on a grand scale....\\" McMurry states Davis contributed to the Rebel command failures in Georgia through his failure to involve himself in western matters.McMurry concludes \\"Grant's much-vaunted plan did not work\\" and \\"It was a Confederate policy....that kept Lee from sending troops to reinforce the Rebels in Georgia, not the pressure of Grant's assaults on the Confederates in Virginia.\\" Failure of Grant's plan resulted in tens of thousands of casualties.A strong point throughout this work are the brief parallel accounts given of military and political activities in other areas providing a balanced account of the situations facing both Northern and Southern governments and their commanders. The books ends with two appendices analyzing Grant's strategy and Johnston's railroad strategy plus two excellent appendices titled \\"Numbers and Losses\\" and \\"The Atlanta Campaign and the Election of 1864\\"."},{"Title":"Atlanta 1864: Last Chance for the Confederacy (Great Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"Lots of military historians have gone over this ground, but McMurry takes an iconoclastic stance that yields fascinating results.His broad argument is that Grant made an error in putting Sherman in charge of the &quot;west&quot; rather than Thomas. Grant made a second, and related, error in personally directing Meade, while leaving Sherman to himself. These goofs caused many thousands of lives on both sides. The war could have been brought to an end much sooner had the full weight of the federals been put behind a drive to and then beyond Atlanta, under Thomas' leadership and perhaps with Grant's supervision, with Meade left in control of the Army of the Potomac.On the confederate side, I see this book as rehabilitating Hood, and as driving a stake through whatever remains of Joe Johnston's once-high but always undeserved reputation."},{"Title":"Atlanta 1864: Last Chance for the Confederacy (Great Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"Another book that tackles the subject of who lost Atlanta. Joe Johnson certainly set the stage by retreating and not seriously contesting Sherman's movements toward one of the South's largest cities. Johnson thought Sherman would charge his entrenched positions, and Sherman had no desire to take thousands of casualties. So the move toward Atlanta was one of feints and flanking movements which resulted in Sherman moving closer to Atlanta and Johnson giving up valuable real estate.This is a nicer book than Atlanta will Fall, because it is less harsh on Joe Johnson. It is charitable to both Johnson and Hood, although it does point the finger at both for losing Atlanta. Hood is depicted as a cavilier soldier who aggressiveness would result in thousands of Army of Tennessee soldiers deaths.This is a short read, and although a little revisionist, it backs its arguments up with solid facts, as noted in the Appendixes. A good, solid read about Sherman's drive to Atlanta."},{"Title":"Atlanta 1864: Last Chance for the Confederacy (Great Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"This book languished on my \\"to read\\" stack, always getting pushed down as \\"better books\\" arrived. On trips through the area, I would resolve to read this next but never did. After hearing the author speak on Johnston, resolve became action. I must confess this is the \\"better book\\" and should have been read sooner.This is what a campaign overview should be. Intelligently written, directly to the point with enough detail to sustain the story without slowing the narration. Mr. McMurry has an excellent in-depth understanding of the subject. This allows him to combine information and insight that informs and entertains at the same time. He easily places the campaign within the context of the war and the people within their inter-personal histories. The personalities and how they relate or fail to relate is the heart of the CSA's problem and the seeds of the questions we still ask. The Confederate Army of Tennessee is a study in management failure; McMurry gives these problems a national perspective by linking them to Davis' personality. This provides an answer to the South's inability to find new generals that was crippling her by 1864.The maps are campaign level and linked to the chapter. They were detailed enough to meet the needs of movement but do not provide a campaign level picture. There are no battle maps, this is a campaign overview and battle maps, while nice, are not required. I found the author to be to hard on Grant in saying that his 1864 strategy failed. Few would consider it a resounding success but total failure is overly harsh. The North is winning because they fond at least two good fighting generals. The South is losing because they cannot find more than one.If you require a well written, intelligent and fun to read overview of the Atlanta Campaign, this is it."},{"Title":"Atlanta 1864: Last Chance for the Confederacy (Great Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"The author's stated goal in writing this book is to bring fresh perspective to well-covered material, and he certainly accomplishes that. This fairly short book provides a concise history of the campaign from Dalton to Atlanta, but at heart it is really more of an essay, arguing several points and re-examining things that have been too easily accepted.McMurry reconsiders the military performances of Johnston, Hood, Sherman, and Grant, with no one faring particularly well in his review. He also re-examines Grant's overall strategy for 1864, the political and personal complications of Confederate President Jefferson Davis' working relationships with the armies in the fields, the ruinous personal politics of the Army of Tennessee, the effect of the Atlanta campaign on the 1864 presidential campaign, and the question of whether Nathan Bedford Forrest and his Critter Company could really have destroyed the Union rail lines by riding east from Mississippi. His examinations of these matters and many highly hypothetical issues are unusually lucid, well-conceived, and logical, and he argues his points so well it's hard to disagree.The details of the campaign itself are, as always, difficult to follow with total understanding; the geography is challenging even to a local native. The book really excels in providing a broader historical context for the events it describes."},{"Title":"Atlanta 1864: Last Chance for the Confederacy (Great Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"Richard M. McMurry is best known to me as the principle modern biographer of John Bell Hood. His book on that general was judicious and intelligent, if short, but Hood wasn't a particularly prominent character in the Civil War, at least for the first half of the war, so it seemed reasonable. Atlanta 1864 is as far as I know his second book, and while it's good, it's also very short and cursory.The book covers the campaign in the spring and summer of 1864, when Sherman challenged first Johnston and then Hood for the city of Atlanta, which turned out to be decisive in the outcome of the war. The campaign has been controversial ever since, not the least because the two principle Confederate commanders engaged in a vicious debate for some years after the campaign, and only ceased when Hood died suddenly. Frankly, this aspect of the campaign would have been interesting to go over again, but the author only briefly deals with it, instead concentrating on the campaign itself, and the events that occurred in 1864.Sherman has a very good reputation as a general, and much of that rests on the Atlanta campaign that is the book's focus. Johnston too has a good rep, and Hood, by contrast, has a very poor one as an army commander. Much of the author's attention is taken up going over the performance of these three men during the campaign, looking at the decisions they made in a strategic sense, whether they could have chosen to do something else more advantageous, and how their decisions fared. All three generals come in for some criticism, though Sherman gets by with the least. Johnston is criticized for a variety of things, and praised for little, while poor Hood appears to have been out of his depth, in the mind of the author.The campaign itself is detailed only briefly, with battles occupying a paragraph or two, and strategic maneuvers a page or so. The decision to fire Johnston and replace him with Hood, made by Davis in the midst of the campaign, gets a whole chapter. The campaign is put into context with a couple of chapters that detail what was happening in other parts of the country, politically and militarily. Everything is laid out so that it's easy to understand, and the discussion is reasonable.I don't agree with all of the conclusions of the book (for instance, I think Grant's Overland Campaign of 1864 was a success, not a failure) but the discussion is interesting, and nothing's particularly out of place or unreasonable. I would recommend this book to any Civil War buff. It's a very good book."},{"Title":"Atlanta 1864: Last Chance for the Confederacy (Great Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"I confess I often find military history very hard to follow with all those ridges, flanks, obstacles and maps that never seem to correspond to what you are reading. This book is clarity itself and explains the campaigns from a number of points of view, giving clear assessments, which one can agree or disagree with, but will surely respect as having been made thoughtfully. An admirable little book."},{"Title":"Atlanta 1864: Last Chance for the Confederacy (Great Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"McMurry provides a well written concise review of the 1864 campaign for Atlanta. I read Castel's Decision in the West immediately prior to reading McMurry's book. McMurry pays homage to Castel, and rightly so. Castel's book is a 600 page blow by blow account, McMurry's book is more of a summary. Both books are very good. Both are critical of Sherman as a battlefield general, laudatory of Thomas, and a lot more understanding towards Hood, at least as to the Atlanta campaign. I come away with the opinion that Grant and Sherman played favorites to such an extent that they detracted fromt the war effort and probably cost a lot of lives. It is also patently obvious that if Joe Johnston was the best Jefferson Davis could do in 1864 to command the Army of Tennessee, the Confederacy was dreadfully short of generals who could command armies. I followed these two books with The Day Dixie Died, which focuses on the Battle of Atlanta. I highly recommend all three books for anyone who wants to gain an understanding of the campaign that probably won reelection for Lincoln and the war for the North."},{"Title":"Atlanta 1864: Last Chance for the Confederacy (Great Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"Mr McMurry has made his career on this campaign. He did his thesis on the topic and a whole raft of magazine articles and such. He knows it well. I know because he is all over the bibliography which is the first thing an ACW enthusiast checks when he sees a new book. Ought an author to reference his own work?He assumes we know it, too. That must be why there are no tables of organization. The maps are from a book by a friend of his and they are awful. You would think in this age he would use some new computer-style maps, with circles and arrows, or maybe a landsat shot of the ground. This is what we get from a publisher in Nowhere, Nebraska I guess.The author makes many unsupported assertions. Check the chapter notes and you find he refers you back to an article he wrote many years ago, or an obscure unpublished master's thesis. I'm fine with criticisms of Grant or Sherman but I need reasoning and evidence in support. For instance he says more than once what a terrible strategy Grant employed in 1864 but his only change would be to put George Thomas in charge instead of Sherman. We are referred to his earlier works for his reasoning I guess.In the end he flings a lot of mud around and has little good to say of anyone. Personally, I have served (reluctantly) in the army in wartime. I would certainly have preferred to serve under Johnston instead of Hood. His army was stronger when he was relieved than when he took it over. He knew that the army was more important than any place. He cared for it, refused to waste it, kept it intact.Anyway I give only three stars for the maps, tables, inadequate supporting notes."},{"Title":"Atlanta 1864: Last Chance for the Confederacy (Great Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"Very little info on the actual battles that were fought.

He was delighted and says that this is a great book full of information."},{"Title":"Atlanta 1864: Last Chance for the Confederacy (Great Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"this is a digest since all the facts of the Atlanta campaign couldn't be covered in 200 pages. From the start when the author suggested that the liberation of Andersonville Prison in southern Georgia would have given the Yankees another couple of thousand soldiers i had to question it since Andersonville was a \\"humanitarain disaster\\". Indeed if Sherman had freed up this camp he would have had such a handful he wouldn't have been able to fight Johnson's army at all. That is why he choose to ignore it,he knew what was there but he never mentioned it and only sent a light cavalry raid to attempt it.Twelve thousand internees living virtually in their own sewage would not have been a positive addition to his army.Joe Johnson was a counter-puncher and we'll never know what he would have done,cause even at Richmond when he struck the Yanks a few miles from Richmond,he was wounded and Lee took over.The private confederate soldier may have griped at Johnson but at as they say,\\"a griping soldier is a happy soldier\\",not like the silent fear the troops had when Hood took over. I've read the memoirs of CSA soldier Sam Watkins and according to him Joe Johnson was loved like a father cause despite the marching and entrenching he spared his soldiers lives.Hood was represented by some accounts as addicted to painkillers and became more aggressive the more body parts he lost.A fine brigade commander but as the \\"Peter Principle\\" states,promoted beyond his capacity.His promotion shows how desperate the Confederacy was in fact.Nevermind the northern 1864 elections,the south was even more in need of a victory.On the other hand the author does point out that Hood tried to attack the Yanks when they were moving before they could get entrenched,so his attacks at Atlanta were not completely insane,unless you were in the attacking formation.The fog of war always bad was even worse,during the Civil War remember there are no walkie-talkies so a commander must count on a certain amount of chaos in troop movements. Johnson on the other hand kept things pretty simple and compact and the Confederate Army was an intact force when Hood took it over.When Hood was relieved after his failure to defeat Sherman it was little more than a \\"third column\\". I did like the way the author stressed the different railroad connections and their importance in the campaign,strategy over tactics. unfortuneately for the confederate army the north was alot better equipped to implement theirs."},{"Title":"Atlanta 1864: Last Chance for the Confederacy (Great Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"I will not go into as much detail as some previous reviews as they have already said much of what I would say and probably better, but this is remarkable read on the Atlanta campaign. You will not a find detailed blow by blow battle description here but a larger view of the difficulties and advantages and that each general possessed. Mr. McMurry also provides what I believe to be a mostly fair critique of all generals involved stressing both strengths and short comings. I would recommend this book for any interested in the Atlanta campaign, especially for those looking for an introduction before taking on a more detailed account or for someone who may lose focus with some of the larger more detailed histories."},{"Title":"Atlanta 1864: Last Chance for the Confederacy (Great Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"Richard M. McMurry's \\"Atlanta 1864: Last Chance for the Confederacy\\" is one of the most interesting, best written and more easily understood books I have read. Written with a flowing and engaging style, the reader is led to clearly understand what happened during this crucial campaign, as well as why it happened, and how. Additionally, after reading this excellent presentation, I have a better picture of the entire war and how Atlanta fit into the puzzle. I find myself in full agreement with one reviewer who described \\"Atlanta 1864...\\" as \\"the best compact history of the Atlanta campaign ever written\\". Since I am not as well read as many others, I would have to simply say it is the best I have read.McMurry's helpful effort includes relating events in northern Georgia to the political situation across the nation, clearly showing Grant's overall plan for this part of the war, and how it was designed to bring an end to the fighting. The inclusion of clearly drawn maps, forsaking the older practice of some authors using tired and unreadable photographs of maps that are almost illegible is also helpful. Granted, as some have pointed out, there are not many maps in the book, but those that are there are easily understood. Inclusion of a number of relevant photographs enhanced the books enjoyability. In a work of this size, it is simply not practical to stuff a book with a host of maps. It is more convenient for the reader, but not necessary. As a 21st century reader, it is very easy to open my iPad (or laptop) and access the internet for a plethora of helpful maps. Further, as one who reads not just for entertainment, but to learn, running references has opened a whole new world of information to my mind that I would not see if I confined my information to the pages of a single volume. Therefore, I don't want everything handed to me. Besides, no author or publisher can anticipate what every reader is curious about.Another of McMurry's helpful presentations is the suggestion of motivations, emotions, comparisons of leadership style, and alternate possibilities for the playing out of events. It is interesting to me that the author is not generally kind to General Johnston for his preference for fighting a defensive battle, which is almost always easier on the defender and harder on the attacker. McMurry seems not to take into consideration that Johnston might have been fighting the smartest way he knew, even though it was not the way the Confederate president wanted and many others expected. John Bell Hood, Johnston's replacement fought an offensive campaign against Sherman and still failed, perhaps proving that Johnston wasn't quite so wrong after all. Quite possibly, it was a battle not winnable by either offense or defensive methods. On the other hand, the author properly makes much of the fact that Johnston hurt himself by not communicating more openly with his superiors. In all, this reader was extremely pleased with \\"Atlanta 1864...\\" and wishes more historians wrote as helpfully and clearly as Richard M. McMurry.Five Stars for clarity and overall helpfulness in seeing the whole picture."},{"Title":"Atlanta 1864: Last Chance for the Confederacy (Great Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"This book is extremely well written and a great read. It also provides a good overview of the entire campaing. Perhaps the best part however, is the analysis of all the principal players and grand strategies. My one complaint which, seems to be problematic in most military books, is the lack of adequate maps. There are only about 4 in the entire book and they are pretty horrible. None of them show troop positions and movements which, I find to be crucial to fully grasping the situation. I actually had to make my own maps and pencil in troops based on his descriptions just ot get a visual. Needless, to say this was very painstaking and annoying. Overall however, it's a good book."},{"Title":"The battle of Pickett's Mill: Foredoomed to oblivion","review":"An excellent read with accurate details of troop position and troop movements.

Although the Amazon Description does say that the book 'adapts and updates three short volumes' it also says that the history is 'comprehensive'. I was more than surprised, then, to reach 1954 on page 27 of the 240 text pages. The book also fizzles out somewhere during the civil war, in about 1992. After that I get the impression of a hastily written conclusion. Therefore the book should be read as a history of Algeria from 1954 to about 1992. And for its coverage of this history I give the two stars.There is reasonable analysis of the '54 to '92 period given that the book is quite small. The statistics on demographics, industry and agriculture are well presented. The coverage of the many French, European and Algerian groups jostling for power before and during the independence war is good. The motivations of the various political and terror groups during the same period is well covered, as is the consequent turmoil in France. The book speeds up quite a bit to cover the period between the independence and civil wars and the period of the civil war itself, and is less satisfying in consequence.However, I never got over feeling cheated by the title, and the editing of the book left a lot to be desired. When a book written by a French academic on Algeria begins with 'If Americans have any image at all of Algeria...' it is somewhat jarring, even granting that this forward is written by an American. The 'adaptation of three short volumes' is more than obvious when you read the introductory chapter to the war of independence (from p27) because it restates, as if for the first time, much of what has concluded the previous background chapter. Similarly, near the end of the book the grammatical tense suddenly changes from past to present mid chapter (p226). Throughout the book there are many presumptions of knowledge (such as the '&quot;fly-whisk attack&quot; on the French consul' on page 3, which is not explained), characters participate in the action before they are introduced, there are jolts of deja-vu for the reader (p47 has 'Public opinion balked at the extension of military service to twenty-eight months' and p48 has 'the length of military service was extended to nearly thirty months'), there is English useage which does not quite read as English due to transliteration problems or idiomatic useages, and there are strange statements such as 'The next day his funeral occasioned truly brutal ratonnades (Arab-bashings), which caused several Muslim casualties'. Finally, the exclamation marks sometimes appended to statistics which the author finds surprising (see p65) remind me of canned laughter on television soaps.The book was useful, but its presumption prior knowledge of its topics makes it unsuitable as an introduction to Algerian history. The book is a cobbling together of different pieces and it needs more editing to help readability. Finally, again, the title is at best misleading, at worst simply dishonest."},{"Title":"Algeria, 1830-2000: A Short History","review":"The cliche \\"never judge a book by its cover\\" is what I should have had in mind as soon as I noticed that by the time I finished reading the introduction, Chapter 1 immediately was set in 1954, when Algeria began its fight for independence as a French colony. Yes, you read that correctly: years 1830-1953 are covered in 27 pages. Apparently, Algeria didn't really exist before 1830, when France began conquering it, tossing the ruling Turks out on their turbans. And what happened after wasn't that important, either. That's not to say that (French) historian Benjamin Stora doesn't outline the causes behind the drive towards independence, he just seems more interested in giving us an idea on how Alegeria as it is today, a country broiled in the violence of a religio-political civil war, has come to be.In this area the book is a fantastic study, but as intimated, ignoring the core of the Algerian people, customs and politics post conquor leaves much to be desired and is symptomatic of how modern historians are towards the formerly conquered."},{"Title":"Algeria, 1830-2000: A Short History","review":"Algeria 1830-2000: A Short History directly addresses the history and root causes of the deadly, long-term civil war that has killed at least 80,000 people out of this nation of 28 million.

Benjamin Stora (Professor of History at the University of Paris, Saint Denis) has written a new introductory chapter on Algeria's colonial period (1830-1954) and revised the final section with up-to-date information, making Algeria 1830-2000 a clear, detailed, rigorously factual, and up-to-date account of this troubled nation from 1830 down to the present day."},{"Title":"Island Boy: An Autobiography","review":"This true life fascinating story, about a great man, is an inspiration to others, especially the young. It shows what one can accomplish with tremendous determination, perseverance, a creative mind, timing and an adventurous spirit.Having known and worked with the author for many years, I can say first hand that this story would be enjoyable for the young, the old, the adventurous and politically minded. It is both educating and quite entertaining.Read it!"},{"Title":"Island Boy: An Autobiography","review":"It's a good thing that Polynesian culture encourages boastfulness among its elders and leaders, because otherwise this wonderful story would never have been told. In delightful detail, Tom Davis describes his many victories in life: over the challenges of living in two cultures at once, over poverty during the depression, over shoddy office practices in a Rarotonga hospital, over hurricanes at sea, flawed FDA processes in the USA, boxing and rugby rivals, cancer, and political opponents. His energy and enthusiasm for life shine through on every page. But for those who would follow his example, something else shines through: a sense of what a person can accomplish who is better with systems than people. That's right, he's a bit of an introvert, at least compared to his political rivals. A huge factor in his success is making processes work better for people rather than just trying to please everyone directly with his behavior. The lessons here are timeless."},{"Title":"American Travellers Abroad: A Bibliography of Accounts Published before 1900","review":"Is it possible to produce an important bibliography that at the same time possesses major deficiencies? American Travellers Abroad suggests that the answer is yes. The second edition of a work initially published by Southern Illinois University, the book currently includes some 1894 entries (up from approximately 1800 in the original; p. v). Items are identified by an alphabetical numeration, thus John Lloyd Stephens' Incidents of travel in Yucatan is S149 (at p. 284). One might presume that this is being done to facilitate the insertion of new books, but Smith accomplishes this by adding a letter after the appropriate numeration, such as C53a (see p. 54). Frankly, there is little excuse for not renumbering if one accepts that the second edition should represent the most up-to-date information available in the easiest to use format.More troubling is Smith's acceptance of later editions in his list without apparently seeking out the original works. Aaron Ward's Around the pyramids (W14, at p. 323) is a fourth edition, while Bayard Taylor's A journey to Central Africa (T10, at p. 298) is a tenth edition. It is difficult to believe that the author couldn't improve on these citations in a revised version of his work. Occasionally, the problem is not even apparent; Stephen Olin's Travels in Egypt (O16, at p. 221) is elsewhere identified as a third edition (see Martin R. Kalfatovik, Nile Notes of a Howadji (1992), at p. 135 [0363]). Stephens' Incidents of travel in Egypt (1837) (S147, at p. 284) was in fact first published two years earlier in London (see Kalfatovik, at p. 128 [0342a]). The original secondary title for William Wilkes Warren's Life on the Nile (W37, at p. 327) differs from that given by Smith (see Kalfatovik, at p. 212 [0589a]). And then there are the omissions ....A perusal of one book, Kalfatovik's Nile Notes of a Howadji (dealing with travellers' accounts of Egypt, and published by Smith's own publisher seven years prior to his revision) yields some fifty-eight titles of seemingly relevant works not listed by Smith (see Kalfatovik, at pp. 157-58 [0426a; 0426b], 159 [0429], 173 [0463], 174 [0467], 192 [0565], 197 [0538], 204 [0561], 209 [0581], 216 [0604], 226 [0632], 228 [0640a; 0640b], 236-37 [0672], 237 [0673], 240 [0682], 245 [0699], 246 [0702], 246 [0703], 249 [0712], 249 [0713], 254 [0729], 272 [0787], 275-76 [0802], 277 [0806], 280 [0819], 281 [0821], 281 [0824], 282 [0826], 284-85 [0834], 285 [0837], 285-86 [0838], 287 [0845], 288 [0849], 288-89 [0851], 289 [0852], 292 [0864], 294 [0872], 294 [0873], 294-95 [0874], 298 [0883], 299 [0886], 301 [0897], 303 [0902], 304-05 [0908], 305 [0909], 307 [0916], 307-08 [0917], 309 [0923], 311 [0929], 311 [0931], 311 [0932], 312 [0933], 312 [0934], 316 [0947a], 317 [0951], and 322 [0968]), almost half again the number of the new entries in the updated edition. Smith's work does not include items such as Sarah Barclay Johnson's Hadji in Syria (1858), nor is it clear that he has considered 19th century published accounts of whaling, which often include stops in South American or Pacific ports.All this aside, I have found Smith's work to be an excellent source for books dealing with 18th and 19th century American travel. An Index of Places (at pp. 357-76) will be of great assistance to those wishing to concentrate their researches (there is also an Index of Occupations at pp. 377-82). All bibliographies are, in some sense, works in progress, and one may hope that a 3rd edition of American Travellers Abroad will continue to improve upon former incarnations in this useful area of research.Samuel Pyeatt Menefee"}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],N={key:0},E={key:1};function M(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),o("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",H,[(t(!0),o(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),o("span",E,"Loading...")):(t(),o("span",N,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const P=u(C,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-c094cd5e"]]),q=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/63.md","filePath":"drive/63.md"}'),R={name:"drive/63.md"},F=Object.assign(R,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(P)]))}});export{q as __pageData,F as default};
